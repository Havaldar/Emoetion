>> ARTICLE
I think you've got a good idea going here.  My only edits I would changes/elaborations would be that I wouldn't liken the Bebop to an instrument.  The Bebop is the group's van, or the set they play on.
>> ARTICLE
The set is the songs you play, not the thing you play on. That's just a stage.

TV shows have sets like what you're thinking of. 
>> ARTICLE
the bebop being the drumset is actually my favorite part here. not only is it the most metaphorical, it makes the most sense. during most improvised jazz solos (unless it's the drums themselves doing the soloing), the drum stays steady. and after the solo, the music syncs back up with the drums. 

they fly their ships home after a mission where they made everything up as they went along (the premier attribute of jazz music) and relax back into the routine they're used to.

plus i used to play drums, so...

it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
During most solos your keyboard player is still comping and your bass is still covering roots. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree.  Plus, the drums always take up the most room and have the most features (being snare, cymbals, hi-hat, etc...) and the main parts being used could partain to the basics used regularly. Bass drum could be the landing bay,  the TV giving out bountys could be snare drum, kitchen cymbals, and the bridge (correct this if I'm using it wrong.  Where the pilot does his thing) snare drum. Hell! The drum solo could be the episode where they are chasing that blob thing around it, exploring parts not normally seen.  
Edit: spelling. 
>> ARTICLE
toys in the attic...like alien, but better

Thanks for sighting the episode for me!

Plus bebop is kinda like an onomatopoeia for hitting drums

Where can I stream it legally, yo?

I don't think there's a legit place to stream it, but watching a stream on a third party site is perfectly legal, it's just downloading it isn't

I don't think the creator ever thought of this, but it's still interest.

Holy crap. I just finished Bebop today and this blew my mind more than the ending. My head hurts.

The conspiracy is real.

That's very cool! Nice one!

Spike would definitely be the anime Miles Davis. Dude would look too hip leaned back with his horn.

Can you draw connections with the cast of ''Kids on the Slope'', that would be fun haha.

That actually makes a lot of sense. Because Cowboy Bebop had such an amazing soundtrack I started paying attention to the music in the animes I watch. You should post this to /r/cowboybebop if you haven't already. I'm sure the people there would appreciate this as well.

Even more depth to an already deep series.

You taught me a lot about music today.

I remember when my friend explained what the actual term of "Beebop"  and how the pace of the show fits the jazz term so well. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty legit metaphor...
>> ARTICLE
[The show itself seems to agree with you](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5449/what-is-the-text-in-the-intro-of-cowboy-bebop)

Sorry if I'm necroing this thread. I'm currently in the middle of a rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
I like it
>> ARTICLE
I approve of this interpretation.
>> ARTICLE
I think I've played in enough combos (and marathoned this show enough) to say this is a stretch and a half. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting analysis. I can't say I've ever thought of the characters in that way. To me these characters work soo well together, playing off each others personalities, balancing their various differences in character. I often think how the show could possibly be improved with one more or less member of the crew; they're used soo well that I don't think the number of characters could change with out damaging what we have. To your point, it's similar to the 'classic' ~~jazz~~ group, one might say.

About the title of the show, not sure how many realize this.

From the wikipedia article:

>[Bebop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop) - "a style of jazz characterized by a fast tempo, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on the combination of harmonic structure and melody. It was developed in the early and mid-1940s. It first surfaced in musicians' argot some time during the first two years of American involvement in the Second World War. This style of jazz ultimately became synonymous with modern jazz, as either category reached a certain final maturity in the 1960s."

Cowboy is an obvious substitute for the word [Western](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre), as in the genre. These two words combine nicely to give us a creative name for the show, while also being an aptly chosen description of what the audience can expect when the watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Bro, I love this!
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure you could argue that they're different instruments in this metaphor, I think this is a case of fitting an apt idea to the characters.

Like, having the bebop as the drums is a part I can't quite agree with. You could say that Jet is the drummer, always working in the background and an integral role whose absense would cause the whole group to fall apart. But when he has his moments they're powerful and just as interesting as the Sax/Trumpet/etc.

Similarly Faye being the singer is a tad weak. Aside from her being a woman and hot, the whole "opinionated, outspoken" doesn't really work. I mean, almost every leading Jazz player was probably an opinionated, outspoken asshole. =P

Spike is definitely Sax though!!

Also, if we're talking a bop group, Jet would more than likely be the upright bass, not bass guitar. =P
>> ARTICLE
that's actually what I meant, upright bass. I'll edit it
>> ARTICLE
You good.

I would say they are based on greek tragedy. Each character is tragic greek hero except Ed who represents a god who roams among the mortals. Such as Zeus 
>> ARTICLE
Dat after-the-fact spoiler.

And Bebop is a genre of jazz music in the first place, dunno if that helps.
>> ARTICLE
This should be cannon .
>> ARTICLE
im flattered, but i was just thinking out loud here :)
>> ARTICLE
Interesting theory seeing how Bebop is actually a form of jazz and was the first form of "modern jazz." It's a very fast paced form of jazz with a unpredictable pattern and lots of improv. I haven't actually watched cowboy bebop but I bet that jazz score it has is bebop jazz.
>> ARTICLE
Oh it absolutely has bebop jazz in it. You should really watch it...or just listen to the soundtrack. It's mostly jazz but there's also some blues and other styles of music thrown in. Yoko Kanno is a genius.
>> ARTICLE
I'll check it out soon 
>> ARTICLE
I actually came up with this while listening to the first OST, believe it or not, lol...
>> ARTICLE
I'll have whatever you are smoking.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of like no one on /r/anime has heard of kids on the slope which was made by the same guy who made bebop/champloo
>> ARTICLE
I've seen it.
>> ARTICLE
That's so dumb.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is a standalone classic, and doesn't need anything to be read into it. 
>> ARTICLE
you don't need to read anything into it, just like you don't need to read anything into the wire. But when you think about what makes it a classic, the themes, metaphors, symbolism, and characterization/foreshadowing are the main areas that classics excel in and that other shows lack. Not wanting to read into it is fine, but this is part of what makes the show great. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that Cowboy Bebop is anything like the Wire in terms of metaphors/symbolism/themes/etc... that said, nothing wrong with fan theories, and this is a pretty good one.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think of it as a theory, I think of this personal presentation as a thesis. This is drawing something from the anime in a way that makes sense, different from other fan theories. 

And I know the wire and CB don't have similar themes, but they HAVE themes (etc.) and not only that, but the devices the shows use are also extraordinary, which is similar. 
>> ARTICLE
Amazing just finished watching the whole series and just such an awesome theory / true belief <3

This guy gets it.

This is awesome -- having been in band, this parallel is incredibly awesome! I never thought about it this way, but it totally makes me enjoy the series even more.

Bravo!

Cowboy Bebop is also a mediocre show. I'm of the opinion that Outlaw Star is several orders of magnitude better.
>> ARTICLE
I love outlaw star to death but cowboy bebop is a classic on every level.

Get out of here.

And you're saying this here why exactly?

don't need to stream it - that entire show is burned in to my brain

that is awesome though

***FOR YOUR INFORMATION***

A couple things to keep in mind...

1: Watch it dubbed. The mastermind behind the masterpiece even says he thinks it is better. The show is very **VERY** heavily influenced by Americana, so it just works better in English.

2: This show is considered the best anime for non-anime watchers. I dont know what it is, but it seems to have an impact. I have ran into a couple of more... experienced anime watchers (otaku) who consider the show sub-par.

3: Much of the hype surrounding the show is from the late 90s American/UK youth. I was 8 or so when it aired on Toonami. This shit was crack to me. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen. So it holds nostalgia value to many people that can overhype it.

4: Dont fall victim to the [Seinfeld is unfunny effect](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny). This show was a huge influence on everything that has come since. There are many shows that have since come out that have probably done what CB did, better. But this show was shocking when it first aired. I had never seen anything that oozed that much cool. 

5:Enjoy.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I'm a 90s kid who listens to ska, watches anime, video games, and sleeps. I'm really stoked to watch this after I finish my bride is a mermaid, tatami galaxy, and fma brotherhood (should finish those in two days since I'm almost done with fma)
>> ARTICLE
>2: This show is considered the best anime for non-anime watchers. I dont know what it is, but it seems to have an impact. I have ran into a couple of more... experienced anime watchers (otaku) who consider the show sub-par.

That's because it doesn't follow anime tropes and conventions very much, it's rather heavily informed by movies. Especially 80's and 90's action cinema, and more specifically the Hong-Kong *heroic bloodshed* genre that John Woo is famous for.

That was not the first time Watanabe did that; Macross Plus was very obviously influenced *a lot* by Top Gun.
>> ARTICLE
> The mastermind behind the masterpiece even says he thinks it is better.

Where's he said this? I'm incredibly curious. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I think this is the first time I have heard a dub being suggested over sub. Does the sub miss out on a lot of Americana? (Will watch this masterpiece soon.)
>> ARTICLE
The dub of Cowboy Bebop is just done really well, its just one of the few times when they got a really top notch cast to do a dub

another show where the dub was undeniably better is [Ghost Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ4VWoeOzs)
>> ARTICLE
This cannot be the actual dub. This shit is funny af. These are some good Voice Actors too.

This is the actual dub in fact, put out by ADV

Also, Baccano has a dub that is head and shoulders above the original.

Second this, the accents are huge in Baccano!

FMA Brotherhood has an amazing english dub.

I also stand behind [Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORCes7h8Nhs) as having a superior dub over the sub.

They've at least made a recent announcement for Lucky Star.  Code Geass hasn't been mentioned since they saved it at the same time as Bebop.

Can someone help me to love cowboy bebop PLEASE!!! 

I've watched it and there were bits like ballad of fallen angels and anything with ed that I really enjoyed. However the rest of the series I just found ok, and I don't know why, I don't see why everyone loves it and that pains me.

Please can you tell me why you love it and why I should. As an anime fan it's one of my biggest annoyances (that I don't love it) as it is such a landmark series for anime and anime fans in the west.

Thanks in advance for any responses.


>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, I'm the same as you. But don't fret! Which anime you like and dislike is subjective. Its one of the things that makes you unique! Don't feel like you have to like something because its toted as a masterpiece,  just accept that you, like I, are an exception to the rule. Watch anime YOU like and enjoy, you don't need people on reddit (a site which encourages circlejerk opinions) tell you what you should or shouldn't like.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, was not expecting such a honest and sincere reply. Thanks. Yea I know it's just the fact that it has everything I love, it's anime, it's sci-fi, it's based in the future and in space, and there is also some martial arts in there. Theoretically I should love this show, but for some reason I don't. I think it's the episodic nature of it and how everything comes back to the status quo at the end of the episode (for the most part), I find series like that boring, only thing like that I've ever liked was Mushishi and only because I loved the animation and the stories.....loved the dub as well.

I found that show a little to slow for my liking. The main character was really annoying and childish in my opinion.

Did you finish it. To say he (and pretty much everyone else) has an incredible character arc is to put it mildly.

Also MORE ACCURATE THAN GRAVITY/2001/INTERSTELLAR.

I did not finish it. I watched maybe 5 episodes and it just didn't really hold my attention. I really like how they did space though so I may go back for a watch

I love Planetes.

At the start, I wasn't sure if I would like it a whole lot. By the end, I loved it completely. Really, truly great show

When Cowboy Bebop was on toonami, that to me, was when dubs were amazing. Samarai Champloo, Blue gender, DBZ. And CB has one of the best set of voice actors, and its done VERY well.
>> ARTICLE
Dubs have always been hit or miss , on average dubs are better now then they were 20 years ago though because dubbing anime is not a new thing in the industry anymore . You just need to know what dubs to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Are there any other dubs of anime that are generally considered, besides Cowboy Bebop, to be as good if not better than their sub counterparts?
>> ARTICLE
I thought that RahXephon was really well done once the actors settled into their roles. Yuyu Hakusho was well done back in the day, as was Rorouni Kenshin. The new AoT dub is bearable. 
>> ARTICLE
Hellsing ultimate 
Black lagoon 
FMA 
Baccano 
wolfs rain 
samurai champloo 
The Big O 
space dandy 
trigun 
ghost in the shell stand alone complex 
yu yu hakusho 
FLCL 

These dubs have always gotten alot of praise on the internet . I'd say all of these are in the same league as cowboy bebop . I'd say there pretty comparable to there japanese counter parts . It's all down to preference though .


>> ARTICLE
Baccano! and Black Lagoon both come to mind as a few dubs that generally seem to be regarded as more fitting than the subs
>> ARTICLE
Dubs have gotten amazing again. Just try to forget things like Utena or Higurashi. Ugh... Dark times.
>> ARTICLE
God that higurahsi dub, there is nothing I'd like more than a redub and a full series bd release.
>> ARTICLE
When it comes to dubs it's always been about knowing what to watch . Bad dubs come and go but good dubs are always remembered .
>> ARTICLE
Unless you're Ghost Stories or Samurai Pizza Cats. That's a level where the dubbing is so intentionally bad that's remembered forever.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost stories was made as a parody dub though , for what they were trying to do they did a good job . It sounds more lively then alot of dubs because the actors got to adlib alot of there own lines . In the case of samurai pizza cats they had no translations so they came up with there own story , sure it's bad considering the age of that dub .
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I wasn't shaming the dubs. I'm saying they were bad in terms of translation, but they weren't bad dubs.
>> ARTICLE
gotcha , I do agree ghost stories is a bad adaption if were talking about staying faithful to the source material .  That said the source material for ghost stories must have been total shit if aniplex told them to do what ever they wanted .

You did the same thing I did a year and a half ago. I watched a ton Ghibli films and films from various other directors and then ran out of movies and decided to watch some series instead. Bebop was the first, followed by Angel Beats and Sword Art.... it was a simpler time. 

Also dont forget to watch the [Cowboy Bebop Movie: Knockin on Heaven's Door](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop:_Tengoku_no_Tobira). 
>> ARTICLE
You saw the first three Anime I saw. o: last year in January I saw Cowboy Bebop, Angel Beats and SAO. No ragrets since then. I've actually made lots of new friends due to my interest in Anime and it's nice.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Cowboy Bebop recently and need to watch this film as I've sort of hit a brick wall in what to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yona of the Dawn is an excellent series.

Log Horizon.

Death Parade is amazing aswell.
>> ARTICLE
Honest question, I've watched both seasons of Log Horizon and I still can't find the appeal, I'm basically watching just to see how it ends.    
What is it that people enjoy about it?
>> ARTICLE
I was about to stop watching it... but then Shiro BOUGHT THE DAMN GUILD HALL! 

Not much else as exciting has happened since. But I enjoy how much attention has gone into making realistic rules and behaviors emerge from the fantasy world.

For example I recently watched an episode where the round table members discussed  intellectual property and wealth re-distribution! This kind of content in a children's cartoon is what leads to the stereotype of Japanese kids being smarter than average.
>> ARTICLE
Just the way the economics etc all started and how the world progressess. You can't enjoy everything.



>> ARTICLE
first season was the bomb, i think it starts with satelite char designs, the economic issues that arise in Elder Tale, and some very likeable characters into a pretty good continuous plot. 2nd season fell apart for me, dropped it at 12 episodes.

Gungrave

Watch some space dandy it's setting is similar but its really wacky. Also you'd probably enjoy redline, trigun, hellsing, and mushishi

I can only back up the mushishi suggestion. And I back it strongly.

Space Dandy same director as Champloo and Bebop

Samurai Champloo gives off a relatively similar vibe, if you haven't seen it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichiro Watanabe would be why.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear you enjoyed it! You should also check out Samurai Champloo if you want more episodic coolness; it has the same director (Watanabe), Steve Blum returns as the voice actor of the main character, and the animation is far better than Bebop's.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
It came out over a decade later. It's clearly better; that's not a knock on Bebop, just a fact
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I didn't say that at all; just in this particular instance. Champloo's animation is gorgeous even for its time
>> ARTICLE
Actually it came out just 6 years after Bebop
>> ARTICLE
No, it was definitely 10 years. Just looked it up. Thought it was more
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop came out in 1998.  Samurai Champloo came out in 2004. 2004 - 1998 = 6
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, Bebop was '98? I could have sworn it was '95 for some reason...
>> ARTICLE
I second Samurai Champloo.

Also I would suggest Ping Pong The Animation

>> ARTICLE
>and the animation is far better than Bebop's.

In a lot of places yes, though Cowboy Bebop's tight lines during action scenes are hard to compare to. Though that swishy, fast paced line style of Champloo is great as well.
>> ARTICLE
Go watch Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1st gig. You will love it if you liked what Cowboy Bebop had to offer in terms of storytelling and characters. I even find the side stories more interesting than the main storyline. GitS is much about the ongoing digitization of the world and how it affects peoples lifes, their bodies and minds, social connection and behaviour. E.g. memories can be stored on an external storag or personalities can be transfered if they have a cyber body. There is everything from cyborg eyes to online chat through your brain, computer viruses that can kill people, walking tanks, AI that develops and begins to become self aware. GitS asks very interesting questions. I guarantee you will find something in it you like.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I love me some GitS. Favorite anime for a long time. Kinda dialogue driven, but doesn't bother me.  Dub is decent too. Second gig starts a bit slow but gets fucking awesome. Highly recommend.
>> ARTICLE
Trigun is a pitch perfect next follow-up to Bebop. Than if I were you you'd need Blue Submariner No.6 in your life. Both of those shows have really great music, but unlike Bebop they take more time to put into words some of the depth and meaning expressed visually and phonically in Bebop. You would not go wrong with Blue Sub Six and Trigun. 

Also, one of the really enriching & meaningful parts of Trigun for me and my life was always the dubbed previews for the next episodes. The voice acting really captures the viewer's reactions to the episode you'd have just watched and places your emotions into a physiological context that grows with as you look back on each episode.

Stay frosty on your journey, Space Cowboy. And, remember to keep moving forward hero.

Another AMAZING anime in my opinion.

Agreed. Just finished Baccano! two days ago. Damn great anime.
>> ARTICLE
So deep...
>> ARTICLE
Tell that to Vash.
>> ARTICLE
If that's your first show prepare for everything else you watch to disappoint you because bebop is a fucking masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
It's the first anime I watched to completion and I have to agree, I think it set my standards too high for everything else.
>> ARTICLE
I felt that way too until I found RahXephon. Pretty much hit the nail on the head. That series = All of my love
>> ARTICLE
There's plenty more brilliant shows, you just have to know what you're looking for.

Yeah hyperbole obviously but compared to bebop the vast majority of anime is pretty bad.

Now, for more Kanno's music:  listen the Wolfs Rain OST.

Trigun next!

Do yourself a favor. Go find "Toys in the Attic". Watch it again now that You have finished. Look at the moral each character gives. consider that in relation to the end of the series.

I feel you man, unlike others I'd advice you to watch FMA:Brotherhood.(inb4 pitchforking me for preferring the 2 version over the original)  
It's 3 times longer, beautifull animation, and extremely well done story that will make you high as a kite and then drag you to the depth of emotional hell.

Based on his taste he should watch FMA2003 before watching FMA:B.

The single greatest piece of animation I've ever seen. I've been searching for something that comes close but I've yet to find it.

I was in the same boat as you at one point. The answer is Neon Genesis Evangelion (and End of Evangelion).

Popped my anime cherry with Neon Genesis, followed by sloppy seconds of Bebop

What an anime to pop your cherry, I'd be scared to watch anything else if that was my first one. 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing has filled the void since.

Once you watch Eva, nothing can. The amount of series I've started to watch and not able to finish is crazy ever since Eva.

*Ghost in the Shell* (first movie)

My anime cherry was popped by Yu Yu hakusho followed by cow boy bebop.. My god I miss seeing those. ~.~
>> ARTICLE
Yu Yu Hakusho and DBZ are probably the best anime cherry pops to the shonen genre.
>> ARTICLE
Yu Yu was probably one of my first real Animes, that or dbz i don't remember what I watched first. 
>> ARTICLE
My non-standard suggestions for what to watch next are:

Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet
http://www.crunchyroll.com/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet

Mushishi

Aldnoah.Zero

Blue Gender

Akira

These all stay away from the quirky stereotypes that only long time anime fans can make sense of.

First season of Naruto not subbed.

Kill La Kill

And obviously watch the Bebop movie!


>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the family.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit. I love seeing someone really get into anime. You are going to be here (in anime) likely forever though, so keep that in mind.

Pretty awesome that you are "starting" with Cowboy Bebop, though.

I'd say you can easily transition to Samurai Champloo. Same director and music influence (just with hiphop instead, and Nujabes is a legend) and is generally considered the spiritual successor to Bebop.

Both are fantastic, IMO.

Trigun is also an easy transition, as is Outlaw Star.

However, one of the great things about anime is the diversity in things you can watch. That is why I will also recommend Planetes if you want more space stuff.

Other shows you really should watch are: 

* Monster

* Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (just watch the 2003 one first, and certainly watch both)

* Steins;Gate

* Death Note (fairly easy to get into/accessible. Good for people looking to get into more anime)

* Neon Genesis Evangelion (Chances are you will get around to watching this no matter what, but you might as well get into sooner than later)

* Legend of the Galactic Heroes (literally one of the best things. Period.)

* Yuasa stuff. Everyone looking to really get into what many would consider "elite" anime will probably get into Yuasa's works. I highly recommend Ping Pong, Tatami Galaxy, and Kaiba. I haven't watched Kemonozume, but I have it on my list. And Mind Game isn't exactly for everyone, but if you are a fan of his style, then you'll probably like it. He tends to do very different kinds of art styles from most of anime.


Other films I'd recommend:

* Time of Eve (also cut up into "episodes")

* Summer Wars

* Akira

* Ghost in the Shell


And I could literally recommend enough anime to keep you busy for months, but this should all be a huge start, and by then you'll already know what you like and want to see.

I'd also recommend quickly Baccano!

It is great and a ton of fun. If you like that, you should also check out Durarara, which is also fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I remember finishing Beebop and not being able to move for several minutes after the end credits had finished rolling. Such a fantastic ending, one of the few shows that earns a 10/10 from me.
>> ARTICLE
I'd definitely watch [Space Dandy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20057/Space%E2%98%86Dandy), now. It's very Bebop inspired in all the right ways, but still has a unique fun feel to it.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought bebop was average, but even as an average show it was miles better than Space Dandy.

Space Dandy is funny once in a blue moon, not worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
That's really only superficially like Cowboy Bebop. Katanagatari is much closer with its episodic nature and character focus.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari is actually a rather good recommendation that parallel's CBBB's structure and flow.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like someone who enjoyed Bebop wouldn't like Space Dandy as much. It feels a lot more immature and doesn't really have the same level of character interaction.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Space Dandy as each episode came out and I only grew more sleepy with every episode. I didn't really think about the comparisons with Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I loved Bebop, but Dandy just rubbed me the wrong way from the start. I wanted to like it, but the characters turned me so off of the series that the rest couldn't make up for that. :(
>> ARTICLE
It's certainly not as mature as a whole, but it certainly has its moments (especially after the first season, after you've really warmed up to the crew).
>> ARTICLE
That show peaked in the first couple episodes in my opinion. At its best, it was hilarious, aesthetically appealing, and refreshingly unique. At its worst, it tried way too hard to get emotional and serious with characters that are straight up goofy and unrealistic. Those episodes just came off as way too cheesy for me. The first episode, the zombie one, the race, the chamilione etc were all hilarious; I wish the show would have stuck to episodes like that.
>> ARTICLE
That probably explains it, I've only watched till episode 5. Or whatever the one with the green alien girl was.
>> ARTICLE
As the other guy said, it improves as it goes along.  I dropped it originally around the same time, but picked it back up and loved the end of the first season and the 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
I went into Dandy expecting Bebop and disappointment slapped me in the face. I hear its actually pretty good so I'll give it another chance.
>> ARTICLE
There are some episodes that give a real Bebop vibe, like episode five of season one but especially episode eight of season two.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it up until the zombie episode which I think was around 3 or 4? I'm gonna watch it pretty soon over the summer.
>> ARTICLE
When you do, if you weren't already, watch the English dub. Fantastic by itself and really helps make the show more relatable to a western audience.
>> ARTICLE
I hear they did a great job with the dub when it comes to Western references (Might've been in the original script since Watanabe is a fan of Western entertainment) thanks for catching me up on it! 
>> ARTICLE
;-)
>> ARTICLE
You basically quit just as it started getting really good.  Dandy is gold by the end of S1.  S2 is like an orgy of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yep Unlike most anime the second season of space dandy is better then the first season . 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Bebop and love Dandy just as much. I don't like them for the same reasons though, they are very different animes in many ways.
>> ARTICLE
Now watch Death Note. It's your next step 
>> ARTICLE
Death note is so far to the opposite side of the spectrum from bebop though. Completely plot driven.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is hella plot driven but in a much different and episodic way 
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy bebop is much more about character development and even atmosphere. There are only 5 real episodes of overarching plot in the whole show.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah that's what I mean by different. The character development and their pasts serve as the plot and it all comes together nicely.
>> ARTICLE
But that's not plot driven. The plot is there and it's nice, but 90% of the episodes are not driven by the plot. 
A show like death note, every episode drives the plot forward. A show like cowboy bebop is not reliant on the plot, it is more concerned with other elements of the show like character development, mood/atmosphere, setting, and theme.
>> ARTICLE
Watch half of death note :)
>> ARTICLE
What the hell do you do to get yourself interested in it again after 25?  I've hit that brick wall and can't even bring myself to pick the next episode up.

>> ARTICLE
Why would you stop halfway through the L arc?
>> ARTICLE
finish the arc is what I meant.  
>> ARTICLE
You cheeky sassy waffle!
>> ARTICLE
You say that like he's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Not all, senpai, he is a cheeky sneaky bastarde, and OP will fins out why, after he watches it :)
>> ARTICLE
eh? why not Trigun?
>> ARTICLE
Because it's terrible.
>> ARTICLE
While I agree he should focus more on watching all kinds of different things instead of keeping with the space cowboy/sci-fi genre, Trigun's concidered to be pretty good in general. So it's actually a valid suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's description of Trigun is much much better than the show in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
May Vash The Stampede do terrible things to you in your sleep.
>> ARTICLE
He would never do anything terrible.  He's too boring of a character.
>> ARTICLE
While he's at it, Outlaw Star
>> ARTICLE
yeah this one too^
>> ARTICLE
Just watch the opening sequence of Elfin Lied!
>> ARTICLE
You should watch Outlaw Star. It's like a lesser known, not as good version of Bebop, but still great.
>> ARTICLE
good first experiences are always nice to hear :D i started getting back into anime after like a 8+ year hiatus, so i'm kinda in the same boat. cowboy bebop's on my list (along with 70 others...) and cant wait till i get around to it!

Not most people's first, but one of the best IMO.

So happy you liked it. It's a real gem.

I wrote the summary of Cowboy Bebop for /r/trueanime's Introduction to Anime guide, and I think I touched on what made the series great.

> While most of the western world first experienced anime through Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Sailor Moon or Miyazaki movies, there's only one anime that completely enraptured the western audience. It shattered the foreign mystique of anime and showed us how approachable a work could be. Perhaps it was the jazz-infused western-style soundtrack that has never been topped. Perhaps we owe some credit to one of the greatest English dubs ever recorded. Or perhaps we look upon this series so fondly because the ragtag band of lovable bounty hunters aboard the starship Bebop  Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed  and their struggles with money, love, purpose and motivation felt so incredibly human. Not just Japanese, but quintessentially human. It is required viewing for any anime fan, required viewing for any sci-fi fan, and probably something your father would enjoy and, most likely, has already seen.

As you are flooded by recomendations, allow me to invite you to /r/anime, and to provide you with a few of my favorite character-based shows.

Yeah, Bebop is a beautiful piece of art. I love the atmosphere, it feels so soothing yet lively. Too bad Watanabe hasn't been able to get close to this yet (although Champloo came pretty close).

Is this your opinion as someone who drinks his own cum?  Cause I give your review a 10!

Am I the only one who didn't really enjoy Coeboy Bepop? I got bored and couldn't finish it because it felt so repetitive.

I enjoyed it quite a bit but I did find it somewhat disappointing after all the hype. The first 8 or so episodes in particular were underwhelming (after that it got pretty good).

I watched it well into my anime career so eh, I guess I didn't have the same first time experience many others have with it.

Cowboy bebop has been one of the most praised dubs the last 15 years , better late then never though .

Stand Alone Complex 1st and 2nd GIG are great recommendations too as they have already mentioned.

I just finished watching it like five minutes ago, and it was incredible. Glad you enjoyed it as well!

Congratulations!

Cowboy Bebop is a classic and somewhat unique.  There are many good anime of many completely different flavors.  You seem slightly new to anime: you've probably already read it, but anime is a medium, not a genre, so don't go into new shows expecting anything based on CBBB.  They're all different.

That aside, [you'd probably enjoy this AMV to cap your watch of CBBB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2feaEnbVio).

Both Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop have amazing pilot episodes. I think Bebop's pilot is my favorite episode in the entire series. 

Everything that's good about the show is just captured in this episode. I love the mature vibe that the show gives, along with the topic. For real, drugs and ambition is rampant in this episode. The mature atmosphere that'll remain throughout the entire series is perfectly established in this pilot. It's also cool to see how suave Spike is, like when he's talking to Katerina. He's just naturally... cool.. and with Steven Blum's awesome voice, who could resist? 

Spike as a character is introduced so well in the first episode, as well. One of my favorite parts in the entire series that stuck with me is Bull's prophecy for Spike. Bull predicts Spike's death, but he just brushes it off and doesn't pay any mind to it. It's incredible how lax Spike is. One of my favorite lines in the series is Bull's prophecy, but even more so when Spike repeats it. He's pretty much just making a joke out of it, and he says it so cooly. *The red-eyed coyote will appear in the Zona Norte at the far end of town.*

I recently saw the German dub of The Garden of Words. Surprisingly, it managed the convey most of the original's nuances. But after all, I'm still a sub purist.

But most Germans don't know that or don't want to know that. We get everything dubbed, so many people are spoiled and don't want to read while watching.

I kind of want to rewatch it with the Spanish or German dub to spite both sub and dub purists.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I wrote a short analytic essay about this episode and some of the themes about a year ago during a different rewatch. This one is about the use of music, specifically. I think it's a great time to re-post it. 

**Session 1: Asteroid Blues**

*Setting up a Conflicted Work*

In a series known for its juxtaposition of conflicting styles and bounty of anachronisms (visual, cultural, verbal, and musical), much like the later Samurai Champloo, the first we hear of Cowboy BebopMemory, I believe--can only be described as akin to a music boxsoft, gentle, something wed want to go to sleep to. But combined with the visuals of the church shootout (at this point a mystery to us), it immediately presents a conflict within the work. Other shows take whole episodes to introduce some sort of conflict, but within the first 45 seconds we are immersed in contradictions at their basest forms: sight and sound. This, I believe, contributed immensely to the series popularityits ability to wrap the viewer into something interesting right away. Because thats what we find interestingconflict.

The conflicting styles continue as the opening pops onto the screenTank! is loud and thumpy to contrast brilliantly with the music-box from before. This time, however, instead of the bleak, drained church shootout scene we just watched (reminiscent, I thought, of the visual style in Schindlers List) its colorful and just kind of pops out at you. After that we get another songthis time with a harmonica as its foundation. I never really noticed it until now, but for the first three minutes of the episode, we are never without music. Then it breaks with Jets voice. By now, weve had three totally different styles of music paired with three totally different visual styles: Memory with the bleak shootout; Tank! with the poppy opening; and Spokey Dokey with a very Westernesque view of Mars. And were only three minutes in.
This, I think, is what Im going to focus on for this episodethe very distinct mish-mash of styles that appear in what many know to be their first fore into anime.

As the episode progresses, we see more and more of these varied styles. One such situation that I found especially unusual (and that I only noticed this time around) was around six minutes inwhen Spike is taking off to scout out for Asimov, hes very casual about it. We know virtually nothing about himor Jet, for that matterother than that hes a dangerous type, theyre low on food, and that the two of them have clearly gone after baddies for long enough so that its just another job.
Following this, we get our first look at Tijuana topside, with the song Felt Tip Pen. Again, not what youd expect from a show thatat this pointis set up very much to be a sci-fi. Its very clearly a Western kind of style. The older folk we see in the bar are exactly the kind of people youd expect to see in a saloon in the old West. Then, right around the seven-minute mark, we see Asimov and whats-her-face for the first time. Right there, we get another contradictionthis time in age, demeanor, what have you. The old men are just sitting around playing cards, complaining about the past and the lack of thanks they receive for their work. Theyre disgruntled, crabby, just plain old. Then in walks the relatively young Asimov and what we think to be his pregnant partner. He, too, sounds disgruntled, but he presents himself far differently than the older men.

As soon as the exchange of bloody-eye is initiated, the music stops. Its no longer the Old West. Now its a drug deal, complete with dim lighting and a sudden shift in tone. Then theres a shootout to break the silence, and we are finally introduced to Bebops distinct method of presenting action scenes. But, of course, we all know about that.

Throughout the rest of the episode, we are presented with more scenes of a similar fashioncalmer moments with suitable music juxtaposed with very intense, music-less scenesthat is, until the final exchange between Spike and Asimov. Personally, the fight scene set to Rush is my favorite in the entire series: its smooth, loud, but most of all its where the music and the action for which Bebop is so celebrated finally come together.
Then theres that transition into the ship chase set to very different music than Rush and we see the somewhat tragic end to Asimov and his lover: Adios. Then we get back to Spokey Dokey to round it all out, and were back where the episode really startedwith bell peppers and beef.

Though not as much as the later Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop is very much about contradicting visual and musical styles. Its a show about action, adventure, crime, suspense, but even more, its about the sometimes subtle fusion of sound and sight. Its fascinating, I think, to see just how much the juxtaposition of conflicting styles really sets up the show to be something different. From its outset, Bebop is perhaps one of the greatest experiments in anachronism and style in the last few decades.
>> ARTICLE
You don't know how much reading that made my day.   I would love to see more, man.  I love trying to analyze the artistic aspects of anime like this, especially bebop, eva and monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, thanks. I had intended on doing one for every episode but life got the better of me. For now I only have the first two episodes written up and my schedule is pretty busy right now so it would be hard to do an entry this long for each episode but I definitely liked writing it. I might do more, albeit a bit shorter. 
>> ARTICLE
I love the previews Watanabe shows have. They're like their own mini-sketches. "About three quarters of a mile..."
>> ARTICLE
Ill throw in my two cents about the episode. I thought it was a fantastic start to the series and shows what Bebop is all about. The relationship with Spike and Jet, the fight scenes, swordfish flying, chase scenes were all enhanced by the great animation and wonderful sound track. The ending was also very solemn [possible spoilers](/s "as is the case in a lot of the episodes") 
>> ARTICLE
I've been perfecting Spike's whistle as he leaves the bathroom every since I saw this episode ages ago.  Almost got it right.

>> ARTICLE
Most people say this show's English dub is one of the best. How come?
>> ARTICLE
One of the main reasons is probably Steve Blum is an overall fantastic voice actor and pulls off Spikes character so well, even IMO pulls is more of Spike than the Japanese voice actor. Also the rest of the voice actors are also fantastic and seem to work together so well. My explanation may be bad so its better if you watch it in english then another anime's dub and you can definitely tell a difference
>> ARTICLE
That so? I always cringe at every english dub I watch, because I think the voice actors were lousy, like their tipsy or something like that, which is saying something since people don't speak English that way XD
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Steins;Gate?
>> ARTICLE
I am like-minded, however Cowboy Bebop is definitely one of the exceptions.
>> ARTICLE
The reason other anime feel clunky in English is because they don't rework the mouth movements for the English dub. Bebop was simultaneously released In English and Japanese so they designed the mouth movements for the English one too. 
>> ARTICLE
I've had this show on hold for no reason, for a long time now. In a week or so, when the rewatch catches up, I'll be glad to join you guys!

It's not really. So many episodes have time where important characters die and then show up next episode.

I just picked this up on Blu Ray not too long ago. I'm already a few episodes in and it's just as great as when I first saw it on adult swim. It's hard to believe the show is 17 years old.
>> ARTICLE
People always say to me Bebop is the shit, probably gonna join this.
>> ARTICLE
Darn, I JUST finished watching this show for the first time about a week ago. I feel like I'm going to end up watching it again with you people.
>> ARTICLE
Forgot how amazing the OP and ED are. It might just be my rose tinted glasses, but I noticed during the transitions they have for ships revving their boosters, the animation jumps up in quality. It's the little things I guess. It reminds me a lot of Gundam Wing.

Also, eating plain bell peppers sounds horrible. I'm sure they could get something instead of bell peppers, even if they're broke x.x
>> ARTICLE
Time to track down a copy of the blu-rays or something to relive the glory of Bebop (are there blu-rays? there should be right?)     

This show gets me more and more hyped to Star Citizen...    
...it will never live up to the hype but it is shaping up to be one hell of a game at the direction things are heading.

Yes! there are blue-rays i bought them so I would recommend them, although the aspect ratio is a little weird [Here's a link!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NP06DJE/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p21_d6_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0R9FBE1P7SP1APW5FBV7&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475182&pf_rd_i=desktop)

YESSSS HD BEBOP!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's recently been released in HD.
>> ARTICLE
I'm late, but I was at work. 

I can't believe I watched this with the sound as low as I could get it on a small TV while my parents were in the other room. This show had some fantastic sound direction for its era, to say nothing of the soundtrack. 
>> ARTICLE
Im so pumped. But forgot to watch it yesterday since my timezone is GMT +8.
>> ARTICLE
It's been too long since I've seen this show. Definitely still one of my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Its a lot of fun to watch this episode and realise that three of the characters in the opening still haven't been introduced, but it still works so well! 
>> ARTICLE
Bang...
>> ARTICLE
Beat me to it.
>> ARTICLE
Why is it that this was the best way to end the show? 

Was it the finality of it?

The uncertainty of whether or not it could continue?

Dat sexy voice?
>> ARTICLE
Damn...just damn.......So epic, very emotional.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I don't see a lot of anime anymore. Samurai Champloo was my last one, but BeBop had a sense of depth that was unique. There was a lot of humor but a good wedge of pain too. Very dark at points. I wish there was more to explain things, but that leaves something to the imagination too.
>> ARTICLE
I have found that the best shows will put you through the whole range of emotions to pull you in. They don't just concentrate on one thing like being completely funny or being completely sad.

Cowboy Bebop does this pretty successfully.
>> ARTICLE
Well in a way it's much more mature than most anime. These characters aren't struggling with acceptance or approval, they've all lived their lives and have a rich history with their own motives. It's wonderful to see adults facing problems rather than teenagers fight for recognition or chase after love.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent viewpoint!
>> ARTICLE
Not going to lie. I cried a little. Love this anime. Yoko Kanno is the best!
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Cowbow bepop for years now on Adult Swim/Toonami and I never get tired of it.
just thinking about Spike's [death](http://25.media.tumblr.com/f7293152f8f9e2923e4c385f3f501683/tumblr_mf7bmb8WwU1rbs2tjo1_500.gif) gives me the feels! :(

>> ARTICLE
Believe it or not, I'm just now getting into anime, and this is my first series along with AoT, and I did not want to know that dude died. Can't blame you though, it's such an old classic show it's a given to talk about it now with no regard to spoilers. ;P
>> ARTICLE
I'm really sorry about my my blunder. I hope I didn't discourage from watching it.
and AoT is amazing too! 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you should go ahead and add a spoiler tag to your post--even though this seems way after the fact.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing would discourage me from finishing this series, It's quite possibly the best show I've ever watched for "last watch of the day", couple hits off the magic dragon, hop in bed, and go to sleep with to a beautifully orchestrated space jazz vibe. Too bad the series is so short, I could watch these every night.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to hear that!
and yes, the anime is way too short. At least there is a the [Movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop:_The_Movie) as well. and like I said, I've been watching it non-stop since 2002. I dont think I'll ever get tired of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's a lame thing to say, but cowboy bebop is the best anime ever. Nothing has really excelled in the same regards that it had. Not to say that there hasn't been good anime since
>> ARTICLE
This was my favourite anime until Steins;Gate, but still, never have I felt so immersed in any other anime. The drawing style was amazing, contrasting the space age technology and old western style of art. downright fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I ... never finished Steins;Gate >_>
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the best television shows I've seen, animated or otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Final cluster of episodes does pack quite a punch.
>> ARTICLE
This sure does showcase Shinichiro's directing talent. Some of these are exceptionally framed. 

Anyone who likes Shinichiro should check out [Baby Blue](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3508),  one of the shorts in the Genius Party anthology. It's very short, but is among the best animated shorts I have ever seen. Unfortunately the only avaiable copy is an Australian print, and I dont know the quality of the other pieces, so probably best off as a download.
>> ARTICLE
[Not the best quality.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ0CGWrOLmU)
>> ARTICLE
wow, that's my favorite anime short now!
>> ARTICLE
so cool. I want to rewatch this also but im waiting for the blurays. soon.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember correctly the blurays were released and the dimensions were... 

"1080p" - 1408x1080 resolution
"720p" - 968x722 resolution 

Now, I know they're up scaled but by damn, it is impressive the quality and watching it all over again with that clarity... It was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
1.) ###p doesn't refer to the screen resolution/aspect ratio but the number of horizontal lines that makes up the image.  So here we've got a TV show whose native aspect ratio was 4x3, not the 16x9 of modern widescreen HDTV stuff, and the resolutions you post are simply 1080p and 720p in 4x3 aspect ratio.

2.) These are actually remastered, not upscaled.  There's a big big difference in the processes involved and how the final product ends up looking.
>> ARTICLE
Thankyou for that, I was curious and it was still amazing though, the clarity. 
>> ARTICLE
as the pictures started showing the last few episodes I totally started smelling onions...
>> ARTICLE
So thanks for the list, I downloaded several.  But tell me, how do you not have the historic "Bang" image? I was expecting that one
>> ARTICLE
You mean [this one?](http://imgur.com/EsfORkb) It was in originally but I decided to remove it for the same reason I removed [this one](http://imgur.com/886Tdg2). Didn't want to overstate things. Also, incomplete collections are more interesting. There's a bit of a drop between Spike's legs and the shot of the sky.
>> ARTICLE
God every time I see stills from Watanabe's stuff it blows me away *again.* So visually impressive.
>> ARTICLE
nostalgic postcards 
see you space cowboy ...
>> ARTICLE
Of all those postcards my fave was the fridge floating off into the void.

The first thought that popped into my head when I scrolled down to it was Ed.....

"MMmmm....I can't eat anymore."
>> ARTICLE
Wow.  This just reminded me, it's been too  long since I watched this series
>> ARTICLE
*Looking through them*- I'm going to download thiiis one, and this one....and this and this and...where's the download all button? *click*
>> ARTICLE
This has reminded me to put this on my list of anime to watch/re-watch this summer. Thank you so much!
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop was visually very appealing.

What I loved most about this anime, aside from the visuals, is the way it blends Science Fiction, with Jazz music. It was unique and it worked amazingly well.

I hope you don't mind OP, but I'm downloading this album to use as desktop wallpapers.
>> ARTICLE
See you, Space Cowboy . . . 

Cowboy Bebop was actually the first anime I ever watched that wasn't named Pokemon/Big O/Dragonball Z and I instantly fell in love. A classic story with beautiful artwork and an absolutely stellar soundtrack, there is nothing about this show which isn't top notch.
>> ARTICLE
The artwork of bebop is still quite impressive, even more so when i have to remind myself, this was all hand drawn.
>> ARTICLE
Go bring up Space Lion, press play, click through these pics.

>> ARTICLE
I kinda prefer [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcTVu3N12no&list=PLC522F1A753034678&index=2). 

*rainy days...
windy days...
we'll go on walks every day
so come back quickly*
>> ARTICLE
Nice shots! I took the liberty of rearranging some of these into a 1900x1200 [wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/3UE34Is.jpg) format so I can stare at them all day :)
>> ARTICLE
I looked through this gallery by scrolling through really fast.  The effect was like watching your life flash before your eyes (had that happen before, BTW) and it sent shivers down my spine.  This show has such a great and iconic look to it.  They really don't make 'em like they used to.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful images.
>> ARTICLE
Watch this while listen to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3j4leyLjs&list=PL1D8981A6C7DCFA7E
>> ARTICLE
As soon as I saw the caps from ballad of the fallen angel, I started hearing "green bird" and got goosebumps.

No anime does that. Ever.
>> ARTICLE
See you later space cowboy
>> ARTICLE
Artist who did this is Gabriel at Tattoo Lab in Dublin, California.

Edit: Sorry I didn't put that in the title or first comment. I'm dumb.

Double Edit: I tweeted it out to Steve Blum, the voice actor for Spike, and he favorited the tweet. I can die happy now. (Sorry I can't link, I'm on moblie. But if you look on his twitter favorites, it's in there.)

Link for the 2nd edit pls, if it's not a problem.

Trying to link my twitter now.

Seeing as I live in Lafayette I might have to check this guy out.
>> ARTICLE
I live in Sacramento but if I'm going to be putting something on my body forever, I want this guy doing it. Wow.
>> ARTICLE
Also Sacramento.  I wonder if he could do something Dark Souls related for me...
>> ARTICLE
Only 30 minutes away, nice!
>> ARTICLE
Be prepared to be on a waiting list. I got booked back in April.
>> ARTICLE
3months for quality work like that sounds like a steal 
>> ARTICLE
And you get to wait a bit and see if you still want it. Pretty ideal situation if you ask me. 
>> ARTICLE
Can I ask how much did it cost? Thats a pretty cool Tattoo!
>> ARTICLE
$500 
>> ARTICLE
500 dollars well spent. That's a work of art
>> ARTICLE
How many hours did it take, 3-5?
>> ARTICLE
4 hours.
>> ARTICLE
That's great. Glad you found an awesome artist who's also a fan. High quality work!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, a tattoo like that for only $500? Dude, that is a hell of a hookup! 

That is one of the most epic tattoos I have seen.
>> ARTICLE
Couple shops around here will do a Sunday session(basically as much as you can stand or until it's done) for $500. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn dude that is a good deal no doubt about it.
>> ARTICLE
Really? that seems really expensive to me. I thought it would've been like $200, then again I don't know a heck of a lot about tattoos...
>> ARTICLE
Do you think a 200$ tattoo would look as good as his?
>> ARTICLE
Now? I guess not. But I honestly thought something that size without color would be closer to $200, with color and shading I could've seen it being $500
>> ARTICLE
He's a perfectionist, so he took his time to get every single detail of the stencil.
>> ARTICLE
Hell, I would pay 500$ for a tattoo that would look that good.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, I don't know much about tattoos.
I had an arbitrary pricing stuck in my head as to what it might cost.

Now I know
>> ARTICLE
I've never gotten tattoos because I want to cover my entire back at once(well more than one session obviously). I poked around with some artists and friends who have great tattoos and my conclusion is that the final thing would cost way above US$1000. So yeah.... that'll take a while until I have money.

Good artists definitely have their price
>> ARTICLE
I got a star with 3 layers (confusing I know) and a number(date) under it and it costed me $125 for 30 minutes of work. They are pricey for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, definitely re-thinking getting tattoos then
>> ARTICLE
IMO the only reason to get a tattoo is if its something worth marking your body forever over. Anything that special should be worth the money. If you need to second guess the price don't get the tattoo.

Some people get tattoos just for fun though, so people feel differently.
>> ARTICLE
Well here's the thing. If you really love something (design) then get it.  Don't let the price deter you!
>> ARTICLE
On top of that, make sure you maintain it! I have Valmets' tattoo from Jormungand, but didn't/couldn't maintain it properly that first month and the wings faded. Luckily they fixed it for me a while later.
>> ARTICLE
Dude such a good tattoo! I would've gotten Revi from Black Lagoon myself. I love the barrettes!
>> ARTICLE
Wow I've never seen such a perfect anime tattoo before. And from one of the best anime's in existence. As a bay area native, I will consider your artist and parlor if I ever decide to get a tattoo.
>> ARTICLE
I've never ever ever ever wanted a tattoo before, but I would get that on me in a heartbeat. So bad ass
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit man. That is some great detail! Who ever did it for you is dam good at it!
>> ARTICLE
My artist is a huge Cowboy Bebop fan and when he saw what I wanted to do he was stoked. He wanted it to be perfect, and he nailed it.
>> ARTICLE
Totally nailed it. Amazing quality there.
>> ARTICLE
Then why won't you credit this artist!?

Tattoo looks really good btw.
>> ARTICLE
I must get him to do samurai Champloo for me then
>> ARTICLE
If you ever get it post pics, would look pretty sweet
>> ARTICLE
Haven't even watched the show but the tattoo looks awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Its too late. You cant watch it now. Everyone will know you as the person who only watched it because of peer pressure. No one will believe you actually enjoyed it when you are done(you will though)!
>> ARTICLE
.... Bang
>> ARTICLE
its ok
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop has arguably the greatest soundtrack of any anime.  The voice acting is top notch, and the story combines elements of noir, scifi, and comedy without devolving in to ecchi romcom.  Definitely one of the greatest single season anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
>Cowboy Bebop has arguably the greatest soundtrack of ~~any anime~~ all time.

FTFY

Sacrilege! Go watch NAOO!!

That's just blasphemous. You know what you must do.

I hope you are not planning on getting that colored. Looks good the way it is!
 
>> ARTICLE
It's up to my artist man. I gave him full control over the tattoo. If I do get it colored, I'm getting the colors that were used in the intro to each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
okay that would actually be really cool. If that does happen please provide an update.
>> ARTICLE
> It's up to my artist

You should do it the way you want, you have to live with it, he doesn't. He definitely does great work and that's a sick tat bit if you prefer black over color, than that's up to you. Either way, it will turn out awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Respecting the artist's vision is incredibly important when it comes to tattoos. 
>> ARTICLE
**Holy fuck!** That sounds awesome!

If you do it, you *have* to post more pics.
>> ARTICLE
That would be so dope holy shit

Awesome tat man
>> ARTICLE
whoa. Faye looks amazing there. Your artist knows his stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I think you just gave me an amazing idea for my next piece. I won't copy this obv, but idk why I've never thought to get a bebop piece holy shit. I've been a die hard fan ever since 10 year old me first saw it on adult swim way back when it was actually good. Fav episode is up between Jupiter Jazz and Heavy Metal Queen (The feels on the bus go round and round). Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho, Inuyasha, Big O, Outlaw Star, Gundam, man Toonami and Adult Swim used to be the SHIT. 
>> ARTICLE
Same, but I was like 14, so I was *definitely" too cool to watch anime ... First episode of Bebop comes on and of course the dub is so good that I don't realize what I'm watching.

The Real Folk Blues starts up at the end and all of these Japanese names and my mind was goddamn blown. Hell of a way to accidentally get into anime.
>> ARTICLE
Damn! That's one great tattoo sir !
>> ARTICLE
Wow.  Your tattoo artist is really good 
>> ARTICLE
High quality tat dude, like thats perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Lol I did a 4hr session and we took 5 minute breaks each 30 minutes, and I would walk to his mirror and just be amazed at the little work he did. Even the stencil he drew up is phenomenal. After it's completely done, he wants to get it photographed and get it up in his shop.
>> ARTICLE
Great anime + great tattoo artist = master piece. 
>> ARTICLE
That's really fucking cool :o
>> ARTICLE
Freaking amazing, wouldn't do it myself but it's awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I don't like a lot of anime tattoos but that's superb!
>> ARTICLE
Not a tattoo guy BUT the quality on that is fantastic
>> ARTICLE
Are those both the same arm? 
>> ARTICLE
Indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. You can see that he just turned his arm a bit.  

Tattoo looks totally hot! 
>> ARTICLE
I just noticed Spike's hair next to Faye, whoops
>> ARTICLE
Great Tattoo!
>> ARTICLE
FUCKING AWESOME, see you tattooed cowboy
>> ARTICLE
Amazing!! How long did you sit for? Are you planning on more? Sorry for all the questions.
>> ARTICLE
Lol I sat for 4 hours and I'm deciding with the artist if I should add the rest of the crew in one sleeve, or add a bunch of 90s anime (Gundam, Sailormoon, Bubblegum Crisis, Detective Conan)
>> ARTICLE
Those tatoos will turn into regrets in a few decades.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe, maybe not. I live life day by day. I try not to worry about the future.
>> ARTICLE
Well, for your own sake, I hope you know well what you are doing.

Tattoos are for a lifetime, after all.
>> ARTICLE
Don't be such a hater!!! If you don't want a tattoo, don't get one.
>> ARTICLE
It is not about me, nor about my preferences.

Your assumptions are incorrect.
>> ARTICLE
Then why say anything?

Always give a little thought about your future. Doesn't need to be a ton, but a little never hurt. 

>> ARTICLE
That would be sooo coool

Wow amazing work and idea. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be repeating someone but... That's fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
One word: Amazing
>> ARTICLE
This is perfection! I don't have any tattoos myself but if I did this is the quality I would want! That being said your second photo kind of looks like a top dressed to bottom nude picture of a girl with your thumb crease being her crotch. I'm seeing things though... right?
>> ARTICLE
That's dope. I think it could look really nice if you just make it black and gray. Have you decided if you're adding color?
>> ARTICLE
If I add color it's gonna be the colors that were used in the intro.
>> ARTICLE
I've been thinking about a Spike "smoking gun" silhouette tattoo lately. It's not tops on my to-do list, but I definitely have it in mind. Anyways, your artist is clearly talented and I love your new work! Congrats! 
>> ARTICLE
Normally I can't stand anime tattoos because they reveal your power level. But this is a really fucking good tattoo.

Mirin'.
>> ARTICLE
not Ein? I'm disappointed. 

nice work, considering the lack of corgis.

wow, so good. not a fan of tatoos but this looks awesome

>> ARTICLE
This is insanely sick, You are a badass in my book :)

That's pretty rad! Amazing design, loads of details! Love it!!!

Did you listen to this while getting the tattoo?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b00LLgGyTA&list=FLdqIkUOod5jlhC_C6TV9fmA&index=1&ab_channel=crysknife007

Hellyeah this is my cowboy bebop tattoo http://imgur.com/I7xvxjD

i usually find faults in tattoos, but that is fucking awesome.  solid fine lines, great facial expressions, perfect hair (forever)

i feel good knowing someone on the world had the balls to get a cowboy bebop tattoo after i couldnt get one :(
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely fantastic!
>> ARTICLE
That looks so good, and I love that you chose to only do black ink 
>> ARTICLE
Very impressive. 
>> ARTICLE
Love the show. Outstanding tattoo! 
>> ARTICLE
Dope. I love Cowboy Bebop and haven't had the balls to get a tattoo of it. You are the man.
>> ARTICLE
That tattoo looks awesome. I generally don't like anime tattoos that people get, but this looks really well done!
>> ARTICLE
Damn high for Cowboy Bebop breh, I love that anime.
>> ARTICLE
Very clean work. Be careful with your aftercare, you don't want any unevenness in the black when it heals.
>> ARTICLE
How long did your forearm take? Mine was 8 hours, but it was also color.
>> ARTICLE
Mine took 4 hours without color. It's not shown in the pitcure but there's a gap of untouched skin that my artist and I are coming up with ideas on what to place there. So I still have a ways to go before it's completely finished.
>> ARTICLE
You know, normally I don't like tattoos and especially video game/ anime ones but this is pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
This tattoo is amazing! I absolutely love it. 
Cowboy bebop is my all time favorite anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Top of Forearm tattoos arent so bad, under forearm is more uncomfortable to get, source i have both done
>> ARTICLE
That is amazing, I love it!
>> ARTICLE
WOW, for once an amazing anime tattoo. I plan on getting a flamel symbol on my back, but I don't know how it would look like. Will have to do some tests, but I don't have any friends that can draw well... sigh...
>> ARTICLE
Awesome tat! I was also thinking of getting something done that's anime related, I had an idea for a mecha themed half sleeve.
>> ARTICLE
Not a big fan of huge tattoos, but this is awesome. The amount of detail and cleanliness of the tat is great!

Very cool, the art style looks perfect.

Great ink there, Space Cowboy. Very well done.

oh this is gorgeous!

Cool tats but why? Some background story please.. 
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop was a show I watched as a kid and I was amazed by it. The story, the characters, the scenery, the soundtrack, I loved everything about. Growing up I was bullied hard, and when I got home I would turn on Toonami, Bebop would be on, and all my problems at school would go away. It still has that same effect on me today. I suffer with really bad anxiety and depression, and on bad days, I pop in the blu ray and I would feel at peace. So I basically wanted to commemorate a show that helps me in my day to day life.

Anime tats are a poor life choice

How are they different from golf tattoos or hockey tattoos?  Something that is a large part of someone's identity is worthy of a tattoo.

People get golf tattoos? Like of famous players? That is pretty insane.

Mostly of like the clubs and stuff. You wouldn't believe the number of memorial crosses I've seen as tattoos that are a golf club crossed with a fishing rod.

I would recommend being careful about making judgments without knowing more about why OP got these tattoos in the first place. This could be something that he has considered for a very long time and has significant meaning for his life. I think saying that anime tattoos are a poor life choice is akin to saying that anime in general isn't an area of your life you should let be public. Either way, you are in the wrong sub-reddit if you want a sympathetic ear for that kind of notion.

At least this is not a tattoo that you'll easily regret.

Good luck with that.

**'Bang'**

Seeing as the show doesn't either, I'm not gonna waste any time here. We're at the close: there's no turning back, no escape.  

Speaking of escape, my remark from yesterday didn't escape Julia and Spike either. It's like the past years have never existed and Spike's tale leaves off again precisely where it got interrupted. This is of course the entire point. The past years have been a haze for Spike: he was alive, but his real life ended at the graveyard and now he's finally ready to pick it back up. 

Another thing that should not be lost on us here is that Julia says the exact same thing Jet said yesterday. Run. Turn back. Leave it all behind. But Spike can't do that. He's spent all those years running, trying to leave his past behind, but it didn't work. It will hunt him down again and until then he will be living life in a haze, a dream, just like he did the past years, whether Julia is there, or not. The reality of that gets nailed home with Annie dying. He knows he has to weather the storm, or perish along with it.

Meanwhile at the Bebop, everything is shot up and broken. Well, at least more than usual anyway, which is saying something. The first line out of Jet's mouth is about as ironic as it gets. 'You're a very lucky woman.' Faye replies just about the same way I did. Lucky is the last term I'd apply to Faye. 

Usually this would be the cue for some playful bickering, but naturally they aren't up for it right now. Interestingly enough both react to Spike's departure the same way. They try to distance themselves from Spike and denying their involvement: Faye through feigned indifference, Jet through through feigned anger. The moment they really look each other in the eyes, they see the other's lies for what they are and by reflection their own. They're both worried sick.

And that's not without reason. Notice how different the firefight at the store is from every other fight we've had in the show. There's no OST, no dialogue, not even background noise, only gunfire. The only time we've had the same style, is the gunfight in Ballad of the Fallen Angels, except here the lighting is more gloomy, the colors are more hazy. There is this creeping bad feeling as the scene progresses and as we go outside, those who pay close attention know for sure. The crows always know. Take note anime writers, this is how you do foreshadowing. Atmospheric cues and background hints, not flags the size of a football field (like a... *certain*, recently finished show). 

The gut feeling almost never lies. The white doves were a bit much for my taste. They symbolize a lot of things over different cultures, but the gist of it is love, peace, prosperity, longevity. But it's overkill, by now we know this isn't going to work itself out. Julia whispers her last words to Spike, words we can't hear (yet). The scene ends on a close-up of his left eye: I'll get back to that later.

Jet is not prepared to give up on Spike, but Laughing Bull, who has already provided us with so many foreshadowing lines, tells him precisely what he and we do not want to hear; Vicious tells us precisely what will happen. The pieces are all in place, there is no stopping now. All that's left, is the big finish. 

Spike returns to the Bebop. His scene with Jet feels like a Last Supper of sorts. A lovely detail is that this supper is our famous episode 1 'Bell peppers & Beef', only this time with actual beef. Spike tells his own story about the tiger-striped cat who dies a million times and only dies after he finds his love, who dies before him. He hates his story as well, but the parallel with Jet's tale is there. They can hate their stories all they want, but they end how they end. There's nothing they can do about it, but you can tell it means a lot to Jet that Spike is of a similar mind. Jet asks the question he already knows the answer to: it isn't about Julia, it's about facing his demons, once and for all. You can see the sorrow in Jet's eyes afterwards.

But that's nothing compared to Faye's reaction in the following scene. This is the most important scene of the episode without question and perhaps the most important scene of Bebop in general. Faye is completely right to call out Spike on his line back in session 15. Spike's answer is a very, ***very*** important one.

**'Since then I've been seeing the past in one eye and the present in the other. So I hought I could only see patches of reality, never the whole picture.'**

This is a summary for Spike's years since leaving everything behind. Since then, he has always looked back at his past, causing him to never really be in the present. Conversely, his running in the present means that he could never face his past head on. Caught between the two, he lived as in a dream he could not wake up from. His life goal was in his past, but his life was in the present. As a result, he was not truly living, but merely alive. This is about as direct as Bebop gets in stating its central theme of living vs. alive (*dude, again?! I'd say dead horse, but by now you're beating a skeleton.*) 

Of course this also begs the question: which eye is which? We know the answer already: Spike straight up told us back in Jupiter Jazz that his left eye sees the past. There are a myriad of visual cues impacted by this. Back in Ballad of the Fallen Angels, it's his left eye that's zoomed in on during his flashbacks. Meanwhile, it's his right eye that is zoomed in on while he shoots the guy detaining Faye. In Jupiter Jazz, it's his right eye we see when he wakes up from unconsciousness. And in this episode, it's his left eye that is the focus when Julia dies. 

As to the question which is the mechanical one, that answer is never stated. Personally, I think his right one is the mechanical one, for a number of reasons. For one, a mechanical eye can't recall memories; also, it stands to reason the mechanical one is more accurate and he shoots his precision bullet in episode five while zoomed in on his right one. But the most important reason for my belief is a thematic one. His right eye sees the present, so his right eye being a mechanical one would align nicely with his feeling of living in a dream, since both are not living at all. Meanwhile, his left eye being the real one seeing the past would mean his real life is in the past. 

But this scene is as much Faye's as it is Spike's. The facade cracked back in Hard Luck Woman and here it all pours out. Props to Wendee Lee here as all of the insecurity, despair and hurt come rushing out of Faye like never before. But once again, it's Spike who delivers the killer line, one of the most famous of the show in fact:

**'I'm not going there to die. I'm going to find out if I'm really alive.'** 

And here the tale comes full circle. Spike finally stops running and confronts his past. He has to. His past years were a dream, a haze he stumbled along through. But now, he turns to face his past, to align both eyes and really live. This is Spike's turning point, his moment of truth. Only by doing this will he ever attain a chance of life, even if this paradoxically spells the end of it. As for Faye, her ending is the worst of all. Her past recovered when it was already gone, she had nowhere to go but here and now this has crumbled too. She may have found her identity and her goal in life, but that also means that is all the worse when her hopes are crumbled to dust and all that is left is helplessness. 

And so this is the end of Cowboy Bebop: the rest is a farewell sequence. As the utterly magnificent (and one of my favorite pieces) [See You Space Cowboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4lNGz-2TaQ) plays, we prepare our goodbye. The song itself is a different rendition of the Real Folk Blues, but with the violin and screaming electric guitar replaced by a piano and a bass, and everything else both lowered in pitch as well as volume. We've heard the tune so many times already, which makes its hit so much harder: we recognize it, but this time it's lower and as such it lowers our mood. This is not the end of a session. It is the end of everything. Faye is utterly broken. So is Jet. And Spike is readying for the showdown of his life. Again his left eye is in focus as his past flashes past him and rushes up to the present. 

The song slowly builds to a climax as the end gets nearer. Notice Spike's left eye that sees the past is bled over and closing: his past has closed down on him, but so is his life. He kills Vicious, but ends up gravely wounded himself. As we close in on his right eye that sees the present, we know his past is over. It was all a dream and the dream is over. Only his right eye is open as Spike speaks his famous last word and the abolutely stellar [Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8) brings it home with Spike's star fading in the heavens. 

---

In the end, under all the supreme style and suave, Bebop was a show with a lot to say about life and it conveyed its message in an eloquent manner that is rare among anime. I've probably already bored you to tears with my view on Bebop's main message... at the very least I've done my best. 

So rather than hammering that home once more, let me end it by saying that I really enjoyed doing these write-ups (first time doing this) and even though the following got thinned out due to unfortunate circumstances, we did have a lot of nice dicussion going. I for one really appreciated your comments that provided me with things I'd missed on a regular basis. 

It was great and perhaps until a next rewatch. See you later, space cowboys!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the write ups!  Your analysis of the series is honestly one of the best I've read.  
>> ARTICLE
Bravo. I couldn't make any sense about all the talk of dreams in this session. By seeing the link with Spikes eyes, your interpretation really drives everything about Spike home and sums it up perfectly.

While your suspicion was correct, the flashback to begin Sympathy for the Devil, session 6, confirms that the fake eye is indeed Spike's right eye.

I really like your analysis's, hell, I missed most of the rewatch until Mushroom Samba so thank god for the list I can reread some of my more favorite episodes.  You're just a joy to read, thanks for your effort.

Thanks a lot, I started off a little unsure, as this was my first time doing such a thorough analysis, but as the rewatch progressed, there was more meat to process and I got more confident in my analysis. 

So basically you got all the good parts :D

Thank you Watashi! I really liked your analysis of Spike in a dream, even in the second rewatch I was still confused about what he meant but this explains everything

I should be thanking you for organizing the rewatch and keeping it going for the few of us who did decide to hang on. Without you doing this I would never have had the opportunity. 

So no problem and thanks again!

Let's talk about Annie. 

We don't even see her for five minutes in the entire show, we have no idea how she is connected to Spike or the syndicate, but she has a large impact in our final session. Specifically it's her death that kicks the action into another gear. I honestly believe Spike had been trying to avoid confronting the syndicate to this point; he was going to run away with Julia. Spike doesn't go to Annie to further the fight with the syndicate but to get her someplace safe. Spike is too late though, and Annie meant enough to Spike to finally say enough is enough. Yes the syndicate was monitoring the store so a battle was inevitable once Spike went to check in on Annie, but this battle is different from any other in Bebop.

This is the only battle in Bebop that I can recall a shotgun being used. A shotgun is an indiscriminate weapon. Now Spike has used indiscriminate weapons against the syndicate before and will again, specifically grenades and timed explosives, but a shotgun causes a very different, visceral reaction than a grenade. Grenades are very useful for clearing a large number of congregated enemies. Shotguns can be used similarly, but Spike doesn't use the shotgun this way. There is never a moment in this scene where a shotgun would be more effective than Spike's standard pistol, and while we never see it it's a fair assumption Spike has his pistol with him. An argument can easily be made that there's no way Spike could've known he didn't need the shotgun and he was using the most effective weapon for the tight quarters of the convenient store and this is all true, but that's not how you write a scene. The writers purposefully put a shotgun, a weapon known for causing serious, long lasting injuries in though who survive, in Spike's hand when a pistol could've been just as effective. Spike has changed, he's finally lost someone close to him to the syndicate, and he's mad.

* Check out [the box](http://i.imgur.com/a1AdWn4.png) near the top right behind Laughing Bull. It says Sunrise. The studio that made Bebop? Sunrise.

* I really bothers me that Faye's bullets that are fired into the Bebop have no effect. There are no bullet holes, no bullets bouncing anywhere; they just disappear.

* The last fight sequence is just fantastic, please don't get me wrong, and it does have a few similarities to the fight in Ballad of Fallen Angels, but it doesn't use light nearly as well. I honestly was disappointed.

* I didn't mention Spike and Jet's little stories, even though they are the highlights of The Real Folk Blues, because I'm sure they'll be mentioned and thoroughly dissected by others.

* I'm sorry I can't find a better source, but [this pdf](https://mrsspooky.net/bebop/The%20Daily%20Texan%20-%20%27Cowboy%20Bebop%27%20director%20Watanabe%20talks%20anime.pdf) contains a 2006 article from the newspaper of the University of Texas. The article is an interview with Watanabe, the lead member of the Bebop team at Sunrise, where he leaves the door wide open for Spike surviving. I firmly dislike this interpretation, I believe that Spike is dead beyond a shadow of a doubt, but it's worth noting.

* ~~It appears Spike loses his real left eye during the fight. Even if he doesn't lose it, he still can't look out of it. Spike can only see out of his right eye, the fake eye that only sees the past.~~ I totally misinterpreted this. He doesn't lose his real left eye, he just can't see out of it. My original assumption that the fake eye only saw the past is wrong. His fake eye is the one that sees the present, and it's the only eye he can see out of during this final fight.

* You're gonna carry that weight is a reference to [Carry That Weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjOl0fG72ZE) by the Beatles. A trio of songs, including Carry That Weight, sort of connect to end the album Abbey Road and represent the last music that the Beatles as a whole ever recorded.

Final Bounty Count, including the movie, 8/22

Edits: Lots, but the big one is I misinterpreted Spike's eyes. Read /u/watashi-akashi for a really good, and more importantly accurate, interpretation of Spike's eyes.
>> ARTICLE
That's a point I forgot to note in mine.  It's a small, meaningless gripe, but I always felt the shows ending card should've been "See you, space cowboy..." as it was, in my eyes, the signature card of the show, and something that I feel would have left a better close.

On your point about Watanabe leaving his death open to interpretation, I do remember reading somewhere that he said he was open to the idea of a continuation of the show which may be why he wants it left open.
>> ARTICLE
I'm responding again because apparently I can't read and missed the entire first paragraph of your response.

[](#kyon-facepalm)

Anywho, I've never really thought about what that last ending card means in the context of the show. Thinking about it for the first time now I like it. You can't use "See you, Space Cowboy." It's a great saying, defines the show, but Spike's dead. Such an ending card would be cruel or cause false hope for Spike surviving. I don't care what Watanabe says, my Spike is dead. You can't see a dead man again.

"You're gonna carry that weight" is a reference to the weight Spike was forced to bear throughout our entire journey, a burden he never shows and so we never see. Losing Julia destroyed Spike. The show wanted to confirm beyond a doubt that Spike indeed had a burden crushing on his back, and this was a perfect way to do it without forcing Spike to show us, which would be out of his character.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny how you describe it, because, in a way, I see it in reverse.  Saying "You're gonna carry that weight" is implying that he has more to do and that it isn't over.  "See you, Space Cowboy," though used before in the show, and thus possibly leaving some people with a lack of feeling of completion while leaving others (like me) with a greater feeling. "See you, Space Cowboy" is a farewell and when a farewell more resonant then when one is leaving life?  

It's more how you view the show.  With the possibility of a sequel in mind and, the the community, a supposed open ending, this standard card *would* leave false hope, whereas if you view the show without any chance of a continuation or any idea of an open ending, you might see it as a closing card. Of course, this isn't absolute either as there are so many factors that go into how someone views a work of art. For me, I never got how the ending was "open" spike was sliced with a fucking katana and collapsed in front of five syndicate elite, or at least high level.  Even if he survived the katana wound, he's not getting out of there alive (barring a Faye and Jet rescue mission, though now that that possibility has just occurred to me, it would be a nice way to work that in) so I didn't, and still don't, entertain the idea of a continuation, as even if there is one, unless it holds up to the original, I'll separate the two in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I like that interpretation of "You're gonna carry that weight", mainly because it didn't even cross my mind. With your view in mind I clearly see why you would prefer "See you, Space Cowboy" and I would too. Honestly after reading your post I kind of wish it was "See you, Space Cowboy."

Still, I'm happy with "You're gonna carry that weight."
>> ARTICLE
Yep. It's kind of why I called it a minor gripe. "You're gonna carry that weight" works well enough, even more so if you understand the reference.  I'm glad we could talk on this. It was a fun evaluation.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly kind of hoped it ended with "See You, Space Cowboy" as well.  But I think it was to hammer in the lessons of Bebop one last time.
>> ARTICLE
It was a nice standalone artistic choice, an okay one as part of a show.
>> ARTICLE
From everything I have read he was indeed open to the show continuing, but even if the show were to continue it could've been done without Spike. Would it be as popular? No. Would there have been an outcry? Certainly, but in my opinion it would've worked for a 13 episode season. My biggest gripe against Bebop is the lack of time with Faye, especially since we practically don't have any time with her after she gets her memories back. In a second season we could actually see some conclusion, satisfying or not, to Faye's plot arc.

Alas, fantasy is fiction.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people really like Faye. I liked her too, but I was fine with what she got.  Honestly, if we got a Bebop without Spike, I'd like to see more Jet and a lot more Edward.  Ed did not get enough, hell he was introduced really late in the show.  Granted, Ed's story closed off (as did everyone's in a way it had to).  Overall, Bebop without Spike isn't Bebop, and I feel like if there was a continuation, it just wouldn't be great or feel right without him there.  I guess it really comes down to the face that he's open to it, we all want it, but there's not good way it can happen.  Something of value would be lost in a continuation.
>> ARTICLE
The star being gone really gets me.
>> ARTICLE
That shotgun is a really nice catch. Spike has never used anything but his pistol in terms of firearms and his use of a shotgun is a very heavy reminder that the gloves have come off, that he's gonna fight tooth and nail. 

Annie's death is a turning point for sure, specifically it's the first half of the turning point, the second being Julia's death. I underestimated that and now that I rewatch it, you're completely right about her impact. I completely missed that, I'm glad you pointed that out. 
>> ARTICLE
The shotgun was a really good catch, after Annie's death Spike was ready for war and the shotgun really shows that well. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I never thought about the shotgun either, excellent catch!

The End of Cowboy Bebop The Real Folk Blues Part 2

I could say alot about this episode but ill leave that to the others that analyze it alot better than me, so I'll just give my two cents about the best part of this episode and in my opinion the best scene in the entire series, Spike/s return to the ship after Julia's death and his final talks with Jet and Faye.

* Jet is the first one he sees and talks to, also his first partner before the rest of the crew came. Spike asks if he'll make him something to eat, which low and behold is Jet's famous Bell Peppers and Beef the first meal Spike eats in the series and of course he calls it terrible just like he did the first episode. It started with Bell Peppers and Beef and it ended with Bell Peppers and Beef. 

Spike's story about the tiger stripped cat really sums up his character, again someone will probably analyze it a lot better than me. But Spike being the tiger stripped cat and Julia the white cat. 

"Good story"-Jet 

"I hated that story, you know i've never liked cats"
The laugh that Jet and Spike leave on is a great way of ending their characters relationship.



* Now for Faye's encounter which I will argue all day is the best scene in the show. 

Spike walks out after speaking to Jet and is met with faye pointing a gun to his face. Now if you ever doubted Wendee Lee's Faye or Steve Blum's Spike, I hope this scene blows that debate out of the water because they both kill it in this scene. Faye has been running away from the Bebop and trying to find her real home until she finally finds he past is gone and she has nothing to return to, and that her home and family is the place she always leaves behind, The Bebop. But it is too late for Faye, now it is Spike that is leaving. I'm still not completely sure of Faye's relationship with Spike is romantic or not so if someone could clear me up on that? Anyway her desperate cries "Where are you going" "Why do you have to go"  and her firing as he walks away were pretty sad but Spike says he's felt like he's been living in a dream and now he must go awake from it. Also Spikes false eye is revealed and how he's been looking in the past with his false one and future with the real one.

Now as soon as Swordfish lifted off and Real Folk Blues started playing I knew Spike was not coming back, the fight with Vicious and the Syndicate felt like a resolution to me the climax had already happened Spike was already dead when he walked in the Bebop the last time, he had made his choice. 


While Spike flies to his death, Vicious does the same, he sits in his chair with his Katana waiting, he is the past Spike is finally facing. 

During Spikes assault on the HQ of the Syndicate he gets injured above the eye and its bleeding down causing his false eye to close leaving, so he is finally looking to the future for once. When he aims at Vicious his vision is blurred in his real eye so his future is about to end. 

>> ARTICLE
~~It is his left eye is that is forced to close. I thought that was his real eye?~~ The right eye is the fake eye, that's made very clear in the opening of session 6, but that doesn't mean it's the eye that sees the past. It's clearly his real eye that sees the past, so your synopsis is correct.

Edit: I want to add more.

Spike has no romantic feelings in Bebop (I'm ignoring the most loathable thing to come out of the movie) whatsoever outside of Julia. 

Does Faye have feelings for Spike? There is nothing to indicate this before that last scene, but it certainly muddies the situation. I think her feelings for Spike are strong but platonic. Spike is going off to die and any friend would get emotional at this proposition. Jet does the same but he emotes differently. However a good argument can be made that the last scene with the two of them shows that indeed there is sometime more.
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks for pointing  that out I was never sure which eye was the fake all I knew is it was one of them. But I always thought the fake one was the one he looked in the past with because he assuming looses it leaving the Syndicate or on other Syndicate business, so everyday he is reminded one of his eyes isn't real which reminds him of his past and the syndicate
>> ARTICLE
I thought so too actually, but /u/watashi-akashi convinced me otherwise in his post.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I felt that the story about the striped cat, whether or not an actual story or something the writer's came up with, is a bit sloppy.  It's too obviously parallel to Spike to mean anything.  THe laugh they have afterwards is really touching though.  

I'm fairly certain that Faye and Spike have no real romance going on.  Throughout the show, they've always had a relationship akin to having a relationship with anyone else on the Bebop.  Faye's angry he's leaving not because he's the man of her dreams, but because he's family.

Really interesting. Thanks for this.

One of my favorite tropes in Cowboy Bebop is the white birds that are associated with death. Spike, Julia, and Chessmaster Hex all have their final scenes with a white feather or white birds in flight prominently in frame.

[From the wikipedia on Torii:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii)
> 
> In Japan birds have also long had a connection with the dead, this may mean it was born in connection with some prehistorical funerary rite. Ancient Japanese texts like the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki for example mention how Yamato Takeru after his death became a white bird and in that form chose a place for his own burial.

It's interesting that though each one of these characters died, they found a way to live free and on their own terms.  They died, but they all chose where they died and how they lived.

I have some strange feeling with OST [Blue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8)

I first watched a number of Bebop episodes from original airing on TV Tokyo back in 1998 (including Yoseatsume Blues), and loved the show. Just hearing Tank from my TV I thought it was not an ordinary anime and would be super phenomenal like NGE.

As I couldn't afford DVDs I just bought all OSTs and listened repeatedly before watching full episodes later. Almost 20 years past but I still have them in my iPhone.

Blue is placed very first track on the third OST and it is perfect opening song of the CD. (did I say it's my absolute best favorite song of all Bebop tracks) Thus the song is not tied to the closing of the show for me, but a new start of the amazing songs magically packed in a disc.

When I actually watched the episode 26 first time, that scene with Blue felt very strange but also well matched to the image I had had from the song. It was indeed an ending of the show but also looked like a start of something new. So I felt Spike's death was not much sad, and rather thought it might be happy for him.
>> ARTICLE
The grand finale. Honestly, the first part was rather boring in comparison and this part really pays off,if only for the final hit. Spike and the crew have their farewells, and we get a great action sequence.  After all of this is the only thing I really wanna talk about this episode: The ending.  I had seen the ending before in my early anime days and thought it was decent, but it takes on a whole new meaning when you actually watch the show.  The art style is amazing and really sells the ending. That and the song "Blue."  That choir at the beginning is utterly beautiful, and the song itself is pretty damn great.  This is the only episode I find worth it to sit through the credits as it plays out as a part of the scene and ends off with Spike's star going out in the night sky, signifying a beautiful end to the series.
>> ARTICLE
Blue is a great ending song and a great ending to the show. A lot of people say why did Spike have to die? I think it was a lot like [Breaking Bad Spoilers](/s "Breaking Bad and Walt having to die") there was no other way, it couldn't have ended any other way. Vicious was the only one who could kill Spike and set him free and vice versa with Vicious. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I can't think of better written way to end it.  We'd all love an ending with them on the Bebop and that would work fine, but only fine, and that's not what the show wanted.  We could've settled for "There'll be more fun times we don't get to see" but it would've been empty.  Even if it's sad to watch Spike leave, it feels complete, and that's what matters.
>> ARTICLE
*You're Gonna Carry That Weight*

Everyone's done such a good job of analyzing this episode already, I'm not even going to waste time with that.  

The series in its entirety is a life lesson that hits really close to home for me, and probably most who watch the show.  Life is a constant struggle, a fight, a search for meaning.  We all just want to understand our place.  Or as Faye says, where we belong.  There's no one way to answer this question, nor is there a specific way to go about searching for the answer.  But there are a few things that we must accept, understand, and come to terms with to find that road to the ultimate goal.  This series does an excellent job of teaching us how to go about finding this.

* Accept the past.  It wasn't until Ed met her father and face her past that she was able to go on her own journey.  It wasn't until Jet faced his past that he realized what he really wanted: a family.  It wasn't until Faye faced her past that she realized where she truly belonged.  It wasn't until Spike faced his past that, well, it was too late.  Your past it was shapes you and molds you, it's what teaches you, and it is what allows you to keep searching.  Holding on to that past, or leaving parts of it unsettled, will end up coming back to haunt you.  Or in some cases, kill you.  

* Accept the future.  "Whatever happens, happens."  Understand that your idea of a perfect life may not happen.  You can't control the future (just like you can't control the past).  You never know what may happen, what people may do, or what events may occur.  Things can change in a heartbeat.  Accepting this, the fact that life can turn in any which direction at any given time, is the only way to continue your search for meaning.  This is perfectly represented in Faye.  She came to terms with her past (imo) the moment she laid down in her old bed.  At that point, it was figuring out what was next.  She had to accept the fact that there was no future in the places and people of her past.  They are long gone.  She had to accept the fact that her future at this point still wasn't clear.  But she knew that she at least, for the time being, had a place she belonged with the Bebop crew.  And knowing this, and having this sense of belonging, will allow her to continue her search.  Rather than worry about what will happen to her next.  

* Live in the present.  Your search for meaning doesn't take place in the past, and it certainly doesn't take place in the future.  Your search occurs in the here and now.  The only way to be alive, is to live in the present.  Living for the past, or for the future, is no different than living in a dream.  A reality which currently holds no truth.   

The series also does an excellent job of showing the simplicity of life.  Things happen, then they're over.  There's nothing we can do about it, it's life.  There's no reason to dwell or become obsessed with past or future events.  Accepting them is key.  We live and we die.  Hopefully some time along the way we find our own purpose, but we can't help what has, or what will, happen.  Just like the series.  We don't need 5 seasons of plot development to understand the main characters, the syndicate, etc.  There was no need to drag out the story.  We get the exact amount of plot we need, and nothing more.  We get it as it happened.  And just as quickly as it came about, it's over.  If the series were any longer, it would ruin the whole feel.  It's the perfect length to go about teaching this lesson.  And Watanabe masterfully placed the events of the story as to make the largest impact possible.

All in all each character played a vital role in the series.  They all had their own problems, and they all had a past which caught up to them.  Hell, even Ed taught me a thing or two.  But it was Faye and Spike who had the biggest impact on me.

For Spike, it was to not get caught up in the past, it'll come back at you ten fold.  For Faye, it was not to worry so much about the future.  Her search to *find* her past, was only a means to find her place of belonging.  Her future.  Doing so will allow you to live in the present, and continue your search.  And I truly believe Faye, Jet, Ed, and Ein upon the end of the series, have all been able to accomplish this.

Thanks to /u/Chetcommandosrockon for making this happen.  Not that I need an excuse to rematch the series again, but being able to discuss and analyze it honestly was tons of fun.  This is what I've been looking forward to each day.  Maybe we can keep going through Watanabe's work and hit Champloo sometime soon?

Another thanks to the users who were active throughout, I wish I could have gotten in on this from the beginning, but it started while I had exams.  /u/DurdenVsDarkoVsDevon and /u/watashi-akashi really made this into a great rewatch.  Without the both of you it would have really been a bore.  I honestly didn't think I could learn so much more about my favorite series, so thank you!

That's a wrap, I'm going to miss talking with y'all.  Hopefully we can all get in on another rematch soon.  Thanks for making the last month or so great!

*See You Space Cowboy*

Very, very nice interpretation that is very much alike to my own. Everything you said about acceptance of both past and future is absolutely spot on and a HUGE recurring theme throughout the show. 

I'm also really glad you joined in on sharing your thoughts in depth, as I said, everyone has a unique point of view that allows them to observe things others don't.  

I'm not yet sure as to what kind of pot I'll be doing tomorrow, but I hope to see your general thoughts on the show! And who knows, maybe we'll meet in a rewatch again soon!
>> ARTICLE
~~Uh~~, I really appreciative the shout out, ~~um~~, it honestly means a lot and I'm really glad that I could add something to everybody's rewatch, ~~but uhhh /u/DurenVsDarkVsDevon isn't my username...~~

whoops typo, fixed it!
>> ARTICLE
Every part of me Wishes the show had ended when he was walking away from Faye. We all knew what he was about to do. And Faye firing that gun at the wall as he walked away would have made for the best possible ending I could imagine. The stuff that followed, it was all okay. The scene with Faye was and will always be my ending. 
>> ARTICLE
In my comment I said I felt like him taking off in Swordfish was basically the end, that was the climax, the fight was almost a resolution, we knew Spike was going to die, we knew he would kill Vicious, not to put down the ending fight, I loved it
>> ARTICLE
I might agree except having the real folk blues song play while it was happening was just perfect, sends chills down my spine!

and of course

dat bang
>> ARTICLE
I think we all knew the show was over at that point.  We all felt the end.  But I still like it the way it was made.  It's like we know Spike is going to die, and we can't do anything else but watch as the soundtrack hits us in all of the feels.

I was wondering why my Etsy had such a spike (AHA GET IT.) in views today. I like how mine was referenced! Very pretty! Handmade gifts are the best kind.

Thanks Nortiker, your piece is phenomenal by all means and the input makes this piece that much cooler.

Holy crap that's awesome!    Gotta do one with the Swordfish as Spike's cig trail

Samurai champloo and bebop are the greatest

I will check this out for sure man. Thanks for shooting me a msg back

iT'S.... different. It's by the creators of Bebop, but a bit more silly sometimes (there are only 2 eps out so far). but YW.

Same creator.

Pretty sure that's why they like them both equally.

The beats in both of them were mad fresh too!

I don't think the word "Dope" does this canvas any justice. This is great and very well done.

Well otherwise it would be just to genius, it has Jupiter in the sky(maybe this is from the perspective of Ganymede?), and the the minimalist ship that is used in the opening sequence. What first appears to be a silhouette of spike is actually a starry sky.

It introduces the main character and the setting. I couldn't expect a normal person to come up with something so brilliant
>> ARTICLE
$28 shipping, just my luck.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I knew that look familiar, felt weird seeing my self as top post with op reply. You know what I never bought one, I think I'll do that right now. Ohh you got more stuff up there too! SNAP
>> ARTICLE
lol does it matter that she used another piece of work as a reference? It's not like she blatantly copied off of it either.
>> ARTICLE
I like this one better tbh, but it does seem inspired by the link.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry. Downvoted due to the use of the word "dope"
>> ARTICLE
Wut?
>> ARTICLE
I'd definitely say this is the reference she mentioned she used. Regardless, she spent upwards of 7 straight hours on this painting, layering some colors 7 times just to get it to look nice, because my poster and wall scroll collection contained zero Bebop pieces. 

That definitely makes this a special, one of a kind piece to me. 

We appreciate your ruse.

There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?

Don't worry man. If you didn't know the exact source. Whatever. You got it as a gift, thought it was awesome and decided to share. I straight up came here to say I'd pay for one of those. And since skyler put up a source, I might be able to (haven't been able to click yet).

Don't worry about him/her, he/she's kind of being and ass now. Sure, posting a source would have been great. But, if you didn't have it, no one shoudl bite your head off for it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks Bacon. Its always cool to see kind level-headed people actually existing on the interwebz. 
 Your feedback definitely means a lot to my girlfriend. She practically begged me not to post it in fear that redditors would eat it up and spit it out for not being the original. She gave it to me purely as a surprise yesterday and I never went digging to find the reference. But at least the original creator liked it!


P.s. Your username is flippin' awesome
>> ARTICLE
Man, they're showing off a *gift*. They aren't passing it off as OC, and they aren't the person who was inspired by the other piece to begin with. Cut them some slack.

The "I guess this is reddit" part, to me, is some person guilting a dude for receiving a heartfelt gift and not knowing how heavily it was influenced by another piece.
>> ARTICLE
It comes off as *exceptionally* tone deaf.

>OP: "Hey, check out this awesome painting my gf made for me!"

>otherguy: "That's totally ripped off from this other painter and it's rude you didn't even give credit to them, but I guess this is reddit."



I mean...seriously?

C'mon bro, this is reddit. Sterotypically sociallyawkardneckbeardetcetc.

Since it's just a present, I think it gets a pass. No one is selling it or anything.

I didn't really get the idea OP was aware his gift was so heavily inspired by that other work. Just that his girlfriend used another work for inspiration. You can't really expect him to give credit if he doesn't know where credit is due.
>> ARTICLE
I operate under the assumption that 90% of the people who claim the object of their post was made by their "girlfriend, dad, sister, etc." was made by the poster who labeled it that way because it sounds lame to say "Look what I did!"
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yea, lets kill OP. 
>> ARTICLE
I really really really like this!  It's a super neat idea and looks really well done.

But (and there's always a caveat!) the art student/critic in me can't keep quiet.  I can't help but think that this piece would have been vastly improved by making the star-field more focused - by orientating the stars into a formation that evokes the image of the Milky Way the way it's seen in the night sky.  It would have provided an additional line of symmetry, a line that could have been used to draw the attention of the viewer to a focal point (like say, towards the Swordfish II).  As it stands, there's too much dead-space in the silhouette, and the random nature of the stars draws your eye to them and to the dead-space rather than out towards what should be the more interesting parts of the piece - the outline of the silhouette or the Swordfish II.

Preemptive disclaimer: Not trying to knock the piece, but I know that serious students of art usually appreciate constructive feedback on their work.  I still love this painting though!

Looks great!

The question is.  When is she doing to start a shop and sell them?

Incredible job. I would say this is one of my favorite Spike pieces I've seen. I particularly like the representation of Spike's inner brightness... given all that he's been through, the empty shell that he became when he "died" and yet the brightness he maintained, as though he were made of stars themselves.

*"The souls that God has given us, our spirits. Our spirits which found a way to swim through the immense network and live in the infinity of space. Is not the human body a mere shell, a form of existance all too small and weak for consciousness with such vast reach and potential?"*

Bebop will always be my favorite till the end. Fantastic art.

As a fellow matrix I can confirm this statement.

She and I both agree that it is our favorite show of any kind. A true masterpiece in every sense.

One of my friends recently chaffeured the DIRECTOR of bebop around Edinburgh and Glasgow. 

Blows my fucking mind when I think about it.

Wow... I didn't even know that it wasn't a screenshot from the show.... It looks so amazing, and with Bebop being my favorite show, I am glad to see a piece of art like this, that just captures the feeling and essence of the show a piece of art. Truly Amazing! :D

I thought it was screenshot from the actual show. no lie

My favourite part is Cowboy Bebop at his computer.

For a second I forgot the reference and was all like "wat?".

I don't have a profile for either of those websites, but tell her that she is very talented, the Bebop scene above is especially beautiful. Well done to her.

Both of those provide RSS feeds, so just subscribe with your reader of choice.

I have never used RSS feeds, or know anything about readers sorry.

f...f-fan art?  Looks almost official!

See you space cowboy...
>> ARTICLE
I miss this show. It was the one that made me like anime, and then it was too short to fully satisfy. As if they were teasing you with it, but instead ended it. However, I then had Blue Exorcist and Attack On Titan to watch, but now those are over and I have no anime to watch...
>> ARTICLE
[Samurai Champloo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo) is a great "Post-Bebop-Depression" show. It's directed by the same guy and is very similar in style. You should check it out if you haven't seen it already. It's definitely one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Oh cool! Thanks for the suggestion. I'll check it out in the morning or when I get home.
>> ARTICLE
Try Kids on the Slope as well. It's from the same director and it has that Jazz music center like Bebop did.

Michiko & Hatchin is another very solid one and it was produced by the same director (Shinichiro Watanabe) and it feels like Cowboy Bebop set in contemporary Brazil.
>> ARTICLE
I had a hard time finishing Kids on the slope. Too much drama, too many clichs, not enough jazz.

In the end it was ok, just not what i was hoping for
>> ARTICLE
Well, the series really rushed things because the director put too much budget into animating the music scenes and the lack of 12 more episodes to flesh the plot out better hurt the storytelling. It's still a pretty enjoyable show, but yeah, more episodes and less of the rushed drama elements would have made it a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching this for the first time, only a few episodes to go. It's become one of my favorite anime
>> ARTICLE
My favorites are #11 and #18.
>> ARTICLE
Nice!!! I was literally watching Cowboy Beebop when I stumbled on this in /r/all. Spine tingle, one of my favorite series!

Also, Ep. 16 "Black Dog Serenade" if anyone was curious.

Thanks for sharing!

>> ARTICLE
I would comment about watching the dubbed version but the English voice actors are great in this show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, one of the best dubs, if not THE best dub of any anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Director Watanabe himself considers the dubbed version the superior version. Bebop is the only anime so far that I prefer in english, they just act so well.
>> ARTICLE
Don't let the elitists get you down.  Watching English dubbed anime isn't all that bad.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if it's conditioning or something, but the first time I heard japanese DBZ Goku I almost died laughing...like, THAT is the voice of the universe's mightiest warrior.

Honestly though, japanese voice actors tend to try harder, which leads to a better end product. Sometimes.

The thing is Masako Nozawa, the seiyuu for Goku, does a fantastic job for Goku when he's a child.

I'm not a huge anime fan but this is one of the best shows ever.

Your sister did an awesome job. She should be an artist!
>> ARTICLE
Character art is pretty nice, but she needs to work on her background. It's neither aesthetically pleasing nor does it match the style the characters are drawn in.
>> ARTICLE
I find the background aesthetically pleasing...
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing PixelPenguins is bothered by the placement of the rocks and the low clouds, which might make the horizon look slightly awkward for some people.
>> ARTICLE
I'd be more bothered by the random boxes next to this backdrop of a sunset at a beach. It's as if they were put there solely for the excuse of characters lying on top of them.

Excellent work overall, but the background does need work.
>> ARTICLE
It's the hull of the bebop?? 
>> ARTICLE
As I said below, I don't remember the hull of the Bebop having flat grey walls and floors. Just saying.
>> ARTICLE
they're chilling [Right Here](http://i.imgur.com/LNSaqKr.jpg), same spot Faye was sunbathing in that episode as well
>> ARTICLE
> I'd be more bothered by the random boxes next to this backdrop of a sunset at a beach.

That's clearly meant to be the Bebop...
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to be a dick about it, but the only way that's recognizable as the Bebop is that the characters from the show are in it. The floor and walls are entirely featureless.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the inside of the Bebop...
>> ARTICLE
wow, this is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Fucking nice man that shit is legit.

Super awesome. My favorite anime. Always enjoy images like this.

It almost looks like it came directly from the show...

Everything is pretty amazing.  The only thing I could complain about would be Faye's face, but that may be because I am a huge Faye fan and imagine her to be far prettier in my head than she actually is.

This... really moved me. I'm not even a huge fan of Bebop, but I think this piece just struck me at the right time. Breath-taking.

Rewatching it right now.
I thought it would be one of the animes which wouldnt be as awesome when i watched it when i started watching animes. 
But it is really awesome. Also like this older drawing style.
And its one of the animes which you can watch in german dub and the voices are perfect.

Wow this looks absolutely fantastic, can't believe that this is fan art. Seems more like official art from the creators. Tell your sister that she's very talented.

Why didn't she draw a doujin? We need more Cowboy Bebop doujins.

Alright, that's not cool, though. Seriously, tell your sister that the internet says she did a great job!

Is it crazy for me to think that Cowboy Bebop is overrated as hell?

Yes.
>> ARTICLE
No, not at all.

AMAZING! Why...oh why can't we have MORE of this series?
>> ARTICLE
Firefly/Serenity comes close.
>> ARTICLE
Very close!
>> ARTICLE
If you know it you could try [BC,GE](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/) for a continuation. The plot is of course a bit different, but the *feeling* of the show is the same.

Some of the best and most fascinating works in the world are perfectly light hearted

Well fascinating doesn't have to be good, good doesn't have to be fascinating. CB is neither of those to me because boring is the first word I'd describe it. When the style is boring and the delivery of substance becomes trite, there is nothing to keep me motivated throughout.

> Some of the best and most fascinating works in the world are perfectly light hearted

Like Princess Tutu, even when gets very dramatic when it needs to.
>> ARTICLE
>Like Princess Tutu, even when gets very dramatic when it needs to.

No idea what that is, I was thinking of Douglas Adam's work, or Terry Pratchett's, or Huck Finn, some Shakespearean comedies, and a bunch of other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head. 

>When the style is boring and the delivery of substance becomes trite

And why do you feel that way? You haven't really shown why that necessarily reflects the work, cause I'm not seeing it. And "The delivery of substance becomes trite..." The delivery of substance became overused...? Are you just throwing in words that sound smart? That barely even makes sense. Are you saying the medium itself was overused? Should it have stopped being an animated show? 
>> ARTICLE
It's slightly annoying that you would criticize it for not having substance when you openly admit to dropping it.  Bebop has plenty of random, fun episodes... But taking 7 months and then dropping the series and criticizing it is a disservice to the story of spike, which is a fantastic character arc.  Heck, my wife doesn't care for the series, but she doesn't make empty criticisms of it. 
>> ARTICLE
So I can't criticize *episodic content* because I haven't finished the last 4 episodes, just because you took an implication that I have a hard time finishing the series, but never said I dropped it.

You certainly implied it. Cowboy bebop is not episodic though. About half of it contains standalone content... But there are threads that run the whole show and reach their conclusions. 
>> ARTICLE
Anything becomes less enjoyable if it was overhyped for you.  

If I recall correctly, only 14 episodes in total contained "plot relevant" information, so I understand why its episodic nature did not appeal to you.

i found like the second half of the episodes better the first time I watched it, but going back and rewatching the earlier episodes made see how good it is even more. Still love the first episode that Eins is introduced.

i wonder if there's a way to choose only the plot relevant episodes like episodes in chronological order like the Main quest in Skyrim. 

That said, I really like the side quest & the freezer epsiode in Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop was hyped as one of the absolute best anime of all time. Didn't take away from it at all for me(i'd rank it same). If you aren't into atmospheric/episodic stories then you just won't view the show as highly.
>> ARTICLE
>Anything becomes less enjoyable if it was overhyped for you.

That's how I felt watching Trigun. I'm going to try rewatching it one day with a different mindset. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, just my two cents; I watched Trigun mid 2000, untainted by internet hype nonsense...and it wasn't that good. Vash is annoying as all get out.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Bebop before I ever discovered this sub or any anime community other than a few friends for that matter. I agree that overhyping is terrible and surefire way to ruin a series to newcomers, but I don't think that the "overhype" is what the OP was refering to or why it's not *AMAZING*, it's more due to the fact that it feels so aimless and fails to hook you.

To be fair to Bebop's format I'll make a comparison with a similar format. The show *Firefly* follows the same episodic format as Bebop (granted the episodes are 45 minutes long) but it also consistently hooks you into the characters and drives you to watch more.
>> ARTICLE
Also 2 to 3 months would do it too. 

He wouldn't like Samurai Champloo either then I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
> moths


>> ARTICLE
I have the same opinion of Bebop as the OP and I loved Champloo. It actually DOES have some plot to drive it, even if it's pretty vague, and I feel that Champloo just flowed a better and the characters actually grew.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually the opposite of you. I loved Bebop even though it was episodic, but dropped Champloo after like 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Champloo felt less episodic, but it felt like there was less of an overall plot, in my opinion.  I'd also say that we learn more about the Champloo characters through actions in real time, while Bebop teaches us character backstory through talking and through flashbacks.

  How do you feel about that?
>> ARTICLE
There was a goal the whole way through Champloo, so even though it was episodic, you knew they were on their journey. Truly, Champloo was more about the journey than the destination, and it worked really well for that. Bebop was a return to status quo for all but maybe 5 or 6 episodes, and they really did seem to just be aimlessly wandering in space trying to sustain themselves on bounty money. Each episode was great, but there is nothing actually compelling you to watch more than 1 episode most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
Basically, you don't like episodic series.

And quite frankly, bingewatching episodic series just feels bad, since it wears most people down.

Other great shows like Mushishi and Space Dandy have this exact same problem if you try to watch them all at once instead of weekly like they originally were aired.

Honestly, the best way you can approach an episodic series is to approach them as a collection of short films sharing the same setting and the same primary cast.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting how some genres/plot forms go better with different viewing habits. I think mushishi is amazing, but could never watch more than 1 at a time.
>> ARTICLE
But shows like Samurai Champloo or Nichijou work just fine as binge watches. I also say that as someone that doesn't really enjoy episodic series as much.
>> ARTICLE
I dont like Bebop or Champloo much, but I definitely liked Champloo better. It actually had a plot.....kinda.
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't find the episodic formula in Space Dandy to be a problem since the show never appeared to have a plot in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, now that I think about a weekly format, it certainly makes more sense why people would praise certain episodic shows.
Although I wouldn't say that I don't like episodic series at all: I certainly enjoyed watching Gintama as well as some other comedies, as most of them are episodic too. The beginning of the first season of SAO was more or less episodic too, but quite enjoyable. It also made a good set up for the rest of the season imo.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, love, I'm not going to downvote. I understand all of your points but I think that one of Cowboy Bebop's most appealing features is that it's an episodic series and each episode has its own style, characters, conflict and climax. So you have like 26 mini noir-steampunk movies to enjoy. I don't think the creators of CB intended the show to be addicted, they just wanted to make it good, each one of the pieces. You can really appreciate all the effort put in every episode. 

PS: Thanks for pointing out that there's nothing clich about CB, it's another of its strongest points IMO.

PS 2: Don't you love Vicious and THAT love triangle, even though they only appear in 5 episodes? 
>> ARTICLE
> noir-steampunk

I know little to nothing about either of these genres(?) but I don't think CB is either of those.

Back to the topic at hand, although I did enjoy CB I did not enjoy this

> Don't you love Vicious and THAT love triangle, even though they only appear in 5 episodes?

In my opinion it was one of the weaker points of CB, because it felt so static as a plot point. The entire time I watched CB I was trying to figure out what was going on between this whole interaction and in the end the payoff felt disjointed and blurred. Take this in comparison to something like TriGun, where the reveal and payoff for the mysterious plotpoint was well explained and rewarding.
>> ARTICLE
> I know little to nothing about either of these genres(?) but I don't think CB is either of those.

I don't think the show has much in the way of steampunk elements, but it certainly has many nods to and influences from noir movies and shows. Hell, the final shot of the show is nothing but noir.
>> ARTICLE
> Hell, the final shot of the show is nothing but noir.

I know that much but I honestly have no idea what exactly noir pertains to. I only know that it has something to do with 1920'sish P.I. type of vibes, and something about black and white.
>> ARTICLE
> a genre of crime film or fiction characterized by cynicism, fatalism, and moral ambiguity.

There's the definition when you google noir. Obviously Cowboy Bebop isn't a straight up noir homage, but it's a show about bounty hunters (private eyes in their own way) dealing with criminals in a cynical world. I feel comfortable calling Bebop noir.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know why I didn't Google it... Anyway, thanks for the information! I'd definitely say it has some hints if anything of noir.

I agree. The main reason why the episodic nature didn't bother me when I was younger watching it on Toonami was because I rarely watched back to back episodes. I didn't have the option to DVR shows when I was younger so it was a bit harder for me to watch it. When I was older and watched the episodes back to back, I really didn't enjoy it as much as I did when I was a kid, for pretty much the same reason. I really dislike episodic shows. Unless the show is as critically acclaimed as Cowboy Bebop is, I would never watch them. I really like my overarching plots. While Cowboy Bebop did have one, there were very few episodes that actually involved it. Although the ones that did involve it are my favorite episodes from the series.
>> ARTICLE
Overarching plots tend to be generally the cause of a series ups and downs. And yes, I'm thinking about Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
The same can be said for episodic shows, although the downs don't last as long, neither do the ups. Episodic shows are usually hit or miss, where one episode is an up, and the next could be a down. Overarching plots, at the very least, have longer lasting ups, as well as downs. 

And I don't like Death Note as an example of an overarching plot causing the ups and downs of a show, because after 26 episodes, the plot changes a bit. And when it changes is when the show had it's downs. [Death Note](/s "One can argue that Light's goal to become god was the overarching plot, but I believe the main plot for the first 26 episodes was to overcome L. Once Light was able to overcome L, the overarching plot changed to overcoming Near/Mello, which is where the down starts. In other words, Death Note has two overarching plots: Overcoming Light and the second is overcoming Near/Mello")

God I edited this like 5 times, it's more coherent and looks nicer now.

Did you watch Subbed or Dubbed? In my experience Cowboy Bebop is better dubbed.

Subbed. I didn't know about outstanding quality dub for this anime, but I don't think I can bring myself to watch it again in any form anytime soon. >_<
>> ARTICLE
Shit, just watch the first episode dubbed. 
>> ARTICLE
If you ever do watch it again , watch it dubbed. The dub is ridiculously well done, and you'll miss a lot of the humor without it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's the only show to have the original director say that the dub was better than the sub
>> ARTICLE
I love Cowboy Bebop but I can totally understand that the episodic nature of the anime can turn people off (my brother for example).
>> ARTICLE
You seem to have set expectations based on the hype surrounding the show.  Don't do that.  I know it is hard to go into a show (especially an old one that is highly regarded) without them, but you will inevitably be disappointed if you let popular consensus dictate your expectations.

Curiously, this happened to me with Steins;Gate.  I nearly dropped it after the first episode because my friends hyped it up quite a bit, and it was nothing like what I expected.  Steins;Gate was one of the shows that made me realize that I had to ignore the hype.


And here is my opinion:
I would say that Bebop is a better show, partly because it has so many more amazing moments due to the episodic nature.  Just thinking back off the top of my head I remember: the end of the space shuttle episode; the crazy creepy fat guy fight; Spike teaching Jeet kune do; the mushrooms; finding the beta player; Jet's backstory.  I deliberately left out the plot episodes but those also delivered.  The show is simply rich with character and cool moments.  All of those moments were possible because of the episodic nature of the show.  Then, when the plot did surface, it was brief and just enough to whet my appetite for more.  Whereas Steins;Gate has a stronger more "addicting" plot, but fewer amazing climactic moments.  In fact, the only moment that comes to mind in Steins;Gate is the excellent way they revisited the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
You probably expected too much because of how hyped it is. Thats why it's better to just go into an anime blindly without seeking others' opinions. For what bebop is, it's great. If you don't like it, thats fine, it's just your opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's important to put the praise of Bebop in context: when it came out, in the late 90s, there wasn't anything like it. It's still pretty unique, but it was even more mind-blowing back then. Evangelion was dark and revolutionary, but it was still a mecha anime about teens. Bebop had a uniquely Western-style cool, and it was actually about adults, not 14 year olds, and the quality of its "artsy" moments was kinda unprecedented, I think. Its dub was also 10,000% better than anything else that had been produced at the time. 90s dubs were total garbage.  

Many shows of similar quality have come out since, but Bebop was light-years ahead of its peers in terms of maturity and storytelling, so people think of it as more than just a good show. The closest thing I can think of, in terms of quality, is "Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal," which was an OVA, not a series, and it came out a year later. 

Anyway, I'm not saying people have to like it. Just explaining why I think it's on a pedestal.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, that's how I felt about it too.  The episodic plots were ok, and the characters were good, and the music was good, but overall it ended up being meh.
>> ARTICLE
Completely agree. I liked the characters but hated the episodic feel. Not sure if there was a LN or manga and how that was how it was written but I hate it when it is just a bunch of random stuff and then random plot episodes.

Of course there are exceptions.
>> ARTICLE
Totally feel where you're coming from, I honestly was crazy unimpressed with Bebop immediately after finishing it. It's a show that gets better the more you think on it, even the biggest fanboys will tell you that it offers very little in the way of big emotional moments or crazy plot twists, but what makes people love it so much is how it's intentionally not doing those things for the sake of being a mold breaker. It's certainly brilliant, but very subtly so, and that ends always seems to end up splitting opinions on it in two. 
>> ARTICLE
Understandable... Great show but I loved the sequential eps  12-13 and the last two a bit more.   Like you, there was a void which i filled by trying to find an anime that reflected Spike and Vicious's story / relationship.   Because of Bebop ...i found my favorite anime ever. GunGrave.   Try it. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the Dubbed episodes as well, and you pretty much took the words right out my mouth. Beautifully drawn, wonderful music, and overall just a fun watch, but I guess I went in expecting to be blown away by something (plot twist, etc..) but for me it just never came. In any case, I enjoyed the series, and I would love to add it to my blu-ray collection.   
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this sentiment. I actually started watching anime because i believed the stories to be more interesting and because i was tired of the episodic format of American shows. If I wanted to see episodic shows American shows are mostly nothing but that so i try not to find them while watching anime. I look for excellent story and an enjoyable experience and episodic shows don't usually have that.
>> ARTICLE
I totally get where you're coming from. I wasn't all that into it either until around episode 17, that's when I "got it." I realized what this anime is all about and how all the episodes connected from a theme standpoint and it was beautiful. Yes, Bebop is very hyped up and it's not exactly my favorite anime of all time (I'd probably go with Gurren Lagann), but I enjoyed it a lot and I'm glad I watched it.

Now, if you didn't, then that's fine. You're entitled to your own opinion and I respect that. For example: ^^^^I ^^^^enjoyed ^^^^Naruto
>> ARTICLE
Everyone don't like the same things. Even though a lot of people like something that doesn't mean you are going to like it too. And the opposite. There are going to be a lot of praised animes you're going to hate, and there are going to be also a few despised animes you are going to love. Just try them and enjoy whatever you like.

It's like wine. Even if you don't like dry wine, you can still recognize and appreciate an excellent dry wine.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I feel the same way. When I watched the first few episodes I really felt like understood why it is so critically acclaimed and loved the sound, style and characters. But now I'm stuck in 17 can't even finish the show. On top of that staying in this fandom for such a long time I already know what happens in the last episode and the iconic line, so I'm even less motivated.
>> ARTICLE
If you're already at 17 you might as well finish it, there were a few episodes near the end that I really enjoyed even though I was in your boat. In fact, I had almost the entire ending scene spoiled for me when I was watching Gigguk's "Top 20 coolest anime characters" video series on youtube and Spike came in #1. That's the only reason I watched Bebop, because Spike indeed can be a cool mofo. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, i enjoyed CB, but definitely not an anime id put on a pedestal. its funny, and engaging, but not the kind of anime that left lasting impressions on.

THANK YOU! So many people hype up this anime but it wasn't *SPECTACULAR* or *THE ANIME ABOVE ALL OTHER ANIME* like so many people in this sub prop it up to be. It was still very enjoyable but it didn't hook me in or keep me invested like countless others have.
>> ARTICLE
It's same for me. I've somehow managed to get through it in short time but I had to take breaks. One episode that was probably the worst for me was episode 22 aka "Cowboy Funk". Man how much I hated that Cowboy Andy and whole thing was made worse because I was hoping for some "plot relevant" episodes at that point. 

>> ARTICLE
It was meh imo. 6/10 at best. I'm extremely biased against episodic series, though, and I don't think they can ever hold a candle to serials. The one example I've found to this is Star Trek, because it manages to do so many different things from episode to episode and really takes advantage of its episodic format.

Bebop was an episodic show that tried to shoehorn in an overarching plot at the end. The result? A cheap, dishonest, and hollow conclusion to a story thematically unrelated to it.

Which I think is kinda strange.  Bebop was my personal gateway show into anime, but I wouldn't say that it appeals to the anime viewer the same way that most other shows do, and it feels quite different than most of the things you'll watch today.

It feels weird to see somebody say that bebop is "not good" because its like saying that My Neighbor Totoro is not good.  It seems like those people are trying really hard to find faults in things that aren't even that hyped up compared to many other things.

Bebop is pretty hyped up, but more in the way of if someone mentions it, everyone automatically says it's really good. Not so much in the everyone's talking about it all the time way.

I feel like no one brings up Bebop unless they're asked about it, and if its brought up they say that its good.  I very rarely ever see anyone saying that Bebop is one of the greatest anime ever, and its rarely brought up out of nowhere, but i do see it being depicted as a "good anime".

Its crazy how much entertainment has changed over the years, especially with binge-watching TV series.  At first I looked at your criticism and scoffed because I consider Bebop to be an all-time great show, bar none, but I thought about how I experienced it.  

I experienced it on Toonami years ago, where you couldn't necessarily see each episode consistently one after the other.  No DVRs, and recording on a VHS tape was a pain in the ass.  The episodic nature of the show was a huge boon and meant I didn't miss much if I had to skip an episode or two.  Hell the first episode I saw was episode 5, and I thought  the ending to that one was a theme throughout the whole damn show.  Watching it all at once, or in rapid order, without an arc or storyline throughout can be tough.  I've experienced it recently when re-watching Firefly.  That's an episodic show too and when you binge it all at once the episodes jumble together and can get mixed up.  

However, your opinion is bad and you should feel bad (obvious sarcasm!).  I'll go to the grave thinking Bebop is GOAT, but that's probably just a circumstance of how I experienced it.

It's a good anime, but it's overrated due to a lot of factors, such as: 

People who rate it highly are, usually, not well versed in anime (i.e people who watched only a couple of shows, mostly battle shounens, and then beepop, therefore thinking it's the best thing ever, something similar to the recent Attack on Titan fever spree), nostalgia from childhood, grand names behind it and the fact that is a very west appealing anime, good dubbing, etc.

I've watched a lot anime since Cowboy Bebop and I find others shows to be miles away from the quality it achieves. Call it more mature, call it more Western-like, call it whatever. It's great and deserves a high rate, regardless you watch one anime series or two thousands.

I have no problem with it being episodic, but if it's going to have a central arc, it should at least be developed more.

Watanabe has a problem of introducing new plot points, arcs or characters and not doing much with them.

See, my problem is that one out of every three episodes is powered by pure contrivance. Prime example, the first episode with Faye.

Faye has to receive the chip that is actually a data drive from a guy who kinda-sorta-looks like Spike. Spike HAPPENS to visit her table so she mistakes him. Okay, fine. Then Spike bumps into another guy who HAPPENS to be the guy Faye was actually looking for, and they drop each other's chips and that's how Spike ends up with the MacGuffin.

Wouldn't it have been easier for the plan to that Faye was supposed to give the other guy the chip instead of vice versa? Then your episode is based on one coincidence instead of two. That is complete amateur hour poor writing.

Many, many episodes (especially the early ones) have this problem of everything being needlessly contrived.

For it's time it was GREAT. It's just good now

Very subtle, I fuckin love it! I'm not a huge fan of the over the top anime tats, but this is legit.

Reminds me of the guy who got the Berserk branded tattoo. People who know what it is will think it's awesome, otherwise it's just kinda cool looking!
>> ARTICLE
> People who know what it is will think it's awesome, otherwise it's just kinda cool looking!

tbh i wouldent recognise it unless the guy said "i really like cowboy bebop" or something, it just looks like a cool symbol and the extra line is somewhat confusing

it looks amazing tho
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is a very classy tattoo, nicer than mine. :-(
>> ARTICLE
What's yours?

I have sasuke's cursed seal on my shoulder.
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a link to that Beserk branded tattoo?
>> ARTICLE
Actually there's tons of them, I wouldn't be surprised if it's the most common Berserk tattoo just because it can be small, easy to identify if you know the series, and if not it still looks pretty cool.

I easily recognized it with it being on the anime subreddit with the words "cowboy bebop" in the title, but I don't think I would if it were just something I saw on somebody's arm that I didn't know liked anime.

so the exact same thing just going the other way? :3

I was looking at doing something similar, but with the contrail underlining "SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY..." and overlining "YOU'RE GONNA CARRY THAT WEIGHT."

Also would go in a straight line down my forearm instead of around it.

Love yours man! saving the pic for when I decide to take it into the parlor.

Looks very gothic. Nicely done.

I'll be the one to say it, cool tatoo, but it's not symmetrical and it bothers me, sorry it just does. Have your tattoo artist touch it up and fix it, most will be ok with doing that, like really sorry like I feel like a dick pointing this out but I have too, sorry. Otherwise cool tat.

Edit: woo first real feel of hate from reddit for this one. Guess the truth isn't always appreciated, Like really cool tat, like the idea, your tattoo artist can't draw a simple symmetrical design, I get hate for it, I get it no one likes it when someone points out a problem, but it bugs me. I've had training in the arts and I notice these things, that's what I've been trained to do, see problems and fix them, I guess my above statement should be taken as critique, like there are things working with this, and things that are wrong, get it fixed and then it will actually look good then.

Looks more like a symbol to summon a demon and cutting your wrists.

Well that's a perfect excuse to finally watch it. I watched Bebop months ago and it easily became my favorite. Yet for some reason or another I never got around to the movie.

I agree that his voice is really great but damned if I wouldn't love more protagonists that aren't "badass sounding gruff male" in the genre he's in.
>> ARTICLE
Mine too, he's so fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Guy has an awesome voice.
>> ARTICLE
Same but dam it seems like he hasn't been in anything recently. That or I'm just not looking good enough.
>> ARTICLE
He will be in the new Star Wars show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure he's in Wildstar.  One of the robot NPCs I was getting quests from sounded a hell of a lot like Steve Blum.
>> ARTICLE
The dudes like Nolan North. Hes in everything.

Hes in the new Ninja Gaiden game too

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znj-5pbddFg
>> ARTICLE
He said in a panel a few years ago that Anime work isn't coming up like it used too, especially where he is living.
>> ARTICLE
Random and small, but I recognized his voice right away as the translation voice-over for Eiji Aonuma in The Legend of Zelda Wii U trailer.
>> ARTICLE
You're right that he hasn't done any anime lately, but a lot of western animation and video games. I've been hearing him a lot lately in the (newly updated) free to play game Marvel Heroes 2015, where he's the voice of playable characters Taskmaster, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.
>> ARTICLE
I liked him as Amon in Korra. Yeah it isnt an anime, but its an awesome show. :D
>> ARTICLE
More like his rate is probably too high to be involved in too much cheap dub stuff these days. So he's in a lot more things now where he's the primary voice, not the guy doing lines in English someone else already did. 
>> ARTICLE
He's done a LOT of video games. Chances are a few roles you didn't even know it was him.

He was an NPC in the elder scrolls online, and was a few cops in the recent batman games. I also think he was someone in the newer borderlands. Those are just recent examples.
>> ARTICLE
He's also every other NPC in SWTOR.
>> ARTICLE
Well not EVERY other but yeah.  Swtor is a smorgasporg of voice actors playing a million different roles. It's fun to spot em.

Legend of Korra. Amon. <3
>> ARTICLE
Easily the season in which the show peaked, in my opinion.  I hope 3 is as good as this, I felt like 2 was kind of cliche and maybe a little boring.  Still good but just not what I was expecting.  I know a lot of people loved it though. 
>> ARTICLE
It's an unpopular opinion but I really enjoy Korra more than Last Airbender. Probably because I was younger when I saw Airbender so I was less patient, still damned good though. 
>> ARTICLE
Go back and watch Last Airbender then.
>> ARTICLE
I did, my opinion still hasn't changed.
>> ARTICLE
>Probably because I was younger when I saw Airbender so I was less patient, still damned good though. 

This is probably why I wasn't so into it at the time.  But going back now, I can appreciate it so much more.  I'm not sure which I like better.  I feel like Korra has a slightly more focused narrative (not to say that Last Airbender's wasn't), a greatly increased animation quality, and I felt, at least for season 1, more mature and better quality writing.

But Last Airbender's sense of adventure and diverse cast grab my attention.  I also think it's a great length.  Not too short where it feels like the story's over before it begun but not too long where it's daunting or feels dragged out.  The lengthier run meant for a more complicated plot that held lots of side stories and I found it more very interesting.  Both great shows for sure.
>> ARTICLE
From what people have seen of the leaks, it's better.
>> ARTICLE
Amen
>> ARTICLE
Toonami. Every week. Like a boss!
>> ARTICLE
Also, countless video games. Plus, he may be in something and you just wouldn't catch it.

He's got his "Spike/Tom/Roger Smith voice," which is super iconic and can be spotted from a mile away, even as a background (Batman: Arkham City for example,) but then he does stuff like Oghren, Wolverine, or Grunt, and you just don't catch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Grunt was incredibly obvious.  I'll admit I didn't realize it was him doing Oghren, but once I'd read that it was him, I was like "oh, wow, they're right..."
>> ARTICLE
And Guilmon from Digimon Tamers!
>> ARTICLE
I just still can't get over that he does Orochimaru from Naruto and Leeron from TTGL. They're just so out of his usual vocal range I didn't believe it at first.
>> ARTICLE
The last video game I played with Steve as a character was Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon. It was a pleasant surprise to see his name in the credits! 
>> ARTICLE
He also does Rocket Raccoon in Marvel Heroes.

I had no idea it was him with the cockney so thick.
>> ARTICLE
I knew he did Wolverine & Taskmaster in Marvel Heroes, but I didn't know he was Rocket, too.  Nice!

Speaking of Steve Blum as Taskmaster, [this is still one of my absolute favorite video game cutscenes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-6DaCTBMUM)

good cosplay/best moment ever
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! It was pretty surreal
>> ARTICLE
10 out of 10 on Spike's hair. It is spot on.
>> ARTICLE
It's not even close in terms of volume though. Look at it side by side and you'll see what I mean. It's recognizable enough but the spike cosplayers never get that shit right because they always use their own hair.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah definitely, but I did what I could with my already pretty long hair
>> ARTICLE
Before the picture he actually congratulated me on pulling off the hair!
>> ARTICLE
Rightly so, you got it as good as possible, taking real life physics into account!

I did the same thing, only I was dressed as [Simon from Gurren Lagann!](http://i.imgur.com/mvnjZ.jpg?1)

he did a great job in bulletstorm
>> ARTICLE
I'M STILL SUPER BUMMED THAT DIDN'T SELL MORE! 
>> ARTICLE
There was a post in r/gaming or games a week ago about why it didn't sell.  Long story short: it didn't have a multiplayer experience like COD or BF and people thought 60 dollars for just a single player once or twice play through wasn't worth it.

I wish it would have done better because I'm all for getting more great single player FPS experiences.
>> ARTICLE
Steve Blum might actually be in everything ever made. 

That's the theory I'm going with, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
He's like Tom Kenny, dude's been in everything.
>> ARTICLE
on top of that, he's been in shows WITH tom kenny - tom is doc ock in ultimate spiderman, hes wolverine, and im pretty sure steve has been on adventure time at least once
>> ARTICLE
They were both in igpx
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he can bend his voice in amazing ways. He also dubs Amon from Legend of Korra. Never expected that. He could even be dubbing our inner voice.

I tried. Didn't sound manly enough  :<

Wikipedia isn't the most accurate source for voice actor's roles. Behind The Voice Actors has a lot more roles. 

Tara Strong has been in 580 roles.

Some voice acting gigs I can think of that others might not know.

* Darkseid in Justice League: War
* Amon in The Legend of Korra (Avatar)
* Pretty much every Transformers cartoon for the last 15 years
* Wolverine and others in the Marvel cartoon for the last 10 years
* Tons of stuff in the Batman games
* Orochimaru and Zabuza from the english dub of Naruto
* a ton of characters from Ben 10
* Jamie from Megas XLR - My personal favorite

We all know his anime dubs, but he keeps pretty busy.

Wait... He was Jamie?!


I have to rewatch megas now..

It's a show that that needs to be revived. Two seasons was not enough!

Mind blown...

That is some serious talent (especially comedically). I am actually pretty good at voice recognition and he fooled me.

Yeah, I lost my shit when I found out too. Then I felt stupid for not realizing it. Then I could never unhear.

At this convention, he was making voice mail messages for lots of people

Steve Blum is in everything, he's not an "anime dubber". He's a voice actor.

This is true.  I swear he is the guy who does the 7-11 radio commercials

I would be too. There's 3 voice actors out there that would have me shaking in my boots if I ever met them in person.

While I was still in line, a woman sitting with Mr. Steve Blum at the signing table (his wife or girlfriend?) asked a staff member to ask me for a picture with her.

Don't know who he is, but judging from everyone's responses I'm guessing he does Yamadera Kouichi justice.

Steve Blum is like Mark Hamil, they can both play heroic and villainous characters.  Mark did Luke Skywalker and the Joker, Steve Blum did Spike and Amon.

Steve Blum is the nicest guy. 

He recorded a voicemail for me after I donated to his charity run. He has a PDF that you can download for free on his website where he basically tells people how to get a job as a voice actor. And, he personally emailed me back answering questions I had for him. 

Love that guy.

Steve Blum along with Mark Hamill, are in my opinion, easily the two best English VA's. 

Pretty awesome pic man!

Who the hell is dumb enough to watch dubbed anime? that shit sucks. ALWAYS watch subbed, you can NEVER replace original voiceactors.

Cowboy Bebop is widely considered one of the exceptions(If not **the** major exception) to the convention that Japanese voice actors at least sound better to the English speaking public, and Steve Blum voiced the main character in it. Either your head is so far up your weaboo ass that America can never do anything as good as the glorious Japan, or you're trolling. Either way, Steve Blum is a legend.

Works in your favour then for cosplaying Ed. :D

Nice job!

Lucky. So much easier to cosplay when you are short.  Im kinda limited to tall lanky guys since im 6'5" and 190lbs.  Cosplayed as Vash the Stampede for 5 years.

Why not try some other Red Coated badasses? Like Alucard or Dante.

Or Alexander Anderson - who was very tall and lanky.

I could pull off Alucard right now with my natural hair too, so maybe that will be next.  Also, I just started watching SAO, so i might do someone from that. Im too tall for Kirito, but im sure there will be other options i havent seen yet.

You could do Alucard or Father Anderson.

True!

>> ARTICLE
I'd love to see a legitimately tall D or Alucard.
>> ARTICLE
It's on my to do list once my hair is a few inches longer. Same goes for Seshoumaru..
>> ARTICLE
Piccolo would work too. Maybe not great for lanky, but good for tall.
>> ARTICLE
Also, my hair is just to my shoulders. Ben growing it out.

If I grew my beard for a week or two, is be able to pull off Hoheim Elric spot on.
>> ARTICLE
You should cosplay the hulk at least once. just because a lanky hulk would be the tits. 
>> ARTICLE
But Vash is 11 feet tall, has tattoos all over his body, and destroys every town he steps in with one glance!

-I don't even get to put who said the line because of how badly I'm sure I butchered it.
>> ARTICLE
And a womanizer of the worst kind
>> ARTICLE
Ah damn, that would be a fun cosplay costume project. That guy nails Spike's facial expression, even if he doesn't have the... afro-dour. Pompa-fro?
>> ARTICLE
Wow, those are some attractive people. Nice work on the cosplays, and congrats on the faces, all of you.
>> ARTICLE
> congrats on the face

I don't know why but thinking of saying this to people I know is hilarious
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the opposite, "I am sorry about the face."
>> ARTICLE
Very cute!  Ed is one of my favorite anime characters of all time.  She doesn't get enough love in cosplay.
>> ARTICLE
up-vote for adorable Ed. 
>> ARTICLE
3, 2, 1. Let's Jam. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good, but you forgot the red circles around your cheeks
>> ARTICLE
Mmm... Pudding...
>> ARTICLE
Nailed the slightly insane look.
>> ARTICLE
Actually funnier when you take the picture as a whole.

Ed: Heeeee!

Faye: You're in trouble now!

Spike: Bang!  You're gonna carry that weight!

::To catch a predator, Cowboy Bebop Edition::

>> ARTICLE
Hot damn! (Except Ed is, like, 9, so now I feel weirdly unsure if that's appropriate...)
>> ARTICLE
Ed's 13. But yeah. That's a no-go. =P
>> ARTICLE
Well, 13 is less weird.  Still very weird, but less so.
>> ARTICLE
How you phrased it there made it jump back up on the weirdness scale though.
>> ARTICLE
Subversive humor.

"Ed's not a little boy, ed's a little girl."

You're Edorable.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, that was clever.
>> ARTICLE
Woot!

Nice work! Saw the other thread; so cool that you just ran into them.
>> ARTICLE
Ed is one fucking crazy kid.
>> ARTICLE
Cute Ein!
>> ARTICLE
"Bang!"
>> ARTICLE
I don't know anything about cowboy bebop, but that guy make those two females less attractive. 
>> ARTICLE
Because he's hot? Because he's super unhot? I don't really know how to interpret that.
>> ARTICLE
He's not a smoker, is he? 
>> ARTICLE
Don't see smoke trails on either, but both seem to be different lengths. Do they sell fake cigarettes, the ash wouldn't stay like that unless it was either real or a decent fake. 

Source: Crappy smoking habit :/
>> ARTICLE
They could be made pretty easily I bet. Eh, no sense starting one for a cosplay (also a smoker). Either way they're well done. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually I just remembered. When I was younger there used to be those fake cigarettes that the tip/ash would actually glowed when you inhaled but did nothing else. Yeah no, going back wish I didn't start the smoking habit, but I'm pretty good until I start drinking, then I chain smoke like crazy. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, they are smokers, yes. This picture happened as they were outside, having a smoke.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, still a legitimate question. Although I'm not a comicon'er(new word, sush) I've seen some stranger props to complete outfits/costumes. 
>> ARTICLE
He is super handsome.

Faye doesn't have enough tissues.

Cute!

You look so great! :)

Nice work all of you! I love the goggles :D

You guys did an awesome job with those costumes! And may I say, you make an adorable Ed.

Well you do not certainly have enough **Fro** to pull of the hair but its still good.

I did have a little more than this picture shows. But my hair had fallen down a bit by this point in the day.

And since you did such a wonderful job, here is an idea for the [next cosplay](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3UWGANOGnqw/TfEtlJnhNqI/AAAAAAAAABg/IBKyhw84o1g/s1600/kaolla03_01.jpg).  Ive always pictured Kaolla Su being Edward's great great great great grandmother or something.

I saw both this exact Spike and Faye at Comic con New york this year; where was this taken? I did not see ED with them when they went outside to smoke.

You're adorable as Ed.

I've had an obsession with Faye Valentine since 8th grade. I'm totally smitten for your friend right now.. *drool*

Did you really dye your hair?

Actually, it was already this color! Which is why I decided to dress as Ed for Comic Con.

I'm a grown ass man, I had my first mustache at the age of 12, full stalin stache at 14. And yet when I saw this picture I audibly said "awww shes adorable"
  I hope your fucking happy with yourself.

I can tell at first glance you're a woman.

I see you are cosplaying as Cowboy Bebop.

Ein is a plushy?

Faaye has small tits?

Brown haired Spike?

Ed clearly a girl?

Are you even tryi . . . /endrant

Ed is cute <3

Not real life corgi. 3/10

But honestly, great job! I'd love to cosplay Spike one day if I ever get in shape

all of you are hot. except the one with the orange hair. she is hot but has an ugly face.

Faye needs more boobs. She has the foxy look down though. Great job on spike and Ed.
>> ARTICLE
Your friends should have just used fake cigarettes instead of damaging their health for the sake of the character.
>> ARTICLE
I assure you, it was not for the sake of character.
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, fair enough then. I thought it was just for the photo but if not then that's good; adds a little extra authenticity.
>> ARTICLE
Cigarettes are dangerous?!?! 

Seriously, let adults make their own decisions. Criticizing random strangers on the internet makes other random strangers on the internet think you're an asshole. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not what I was saying at all. I don't care if people want to smoke, I was speaking on the basis that the cigarettes were purely for the photo. It is now evident that this is not the case, and I encourage everyone to smoke up.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure I remember hearing that Code Geass was basically the same thing.

They got a bunch of money from Pizza Hut who told them to run wild.

This could, however, simply be a joke referencing the large number of Pizza Hut cameos, though. Surprisingly believable.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like my kinda show
>> ARTICLE
Pizza the Hut
>> ARTICLE
To be specific, it was the Japanese Pizza Hut Division and not North America.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, that explains that chicks pizza addiction ... And her doll. It all makes sense... Woah.
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe they pulled a giant pizza episode not once, but twice, and it still managed to be a great show. 
>> ARTICLE
And strangely enough I felt compelled to eat pizza both times.

I had no desire to watch code geass until now.

Pizzas are awesome [](/s "and I love Pizza Hut")

There needs to be more Pizza episodes in anime.
>> ARTICLE
They could go hand in hand with the beach episodes. Bleach even did a beach episode. It was fantastically horrid, but succeeded in the fan service department brilliantly with Orihime and Rangiku.
>> ARTICLE
When I first saw the pizza box, I couldn't stop laughing. I had to rewind and double check I hadn't just imagined it. Then it was EVERYWHERE.

It got me to order some dominos one night (no pizza huts in my area) >.>
>> ARTICLE
> no pizza huts in my area

I didn't know there were such places
>> ARTICLE
You're not missing out, don't worry bud
>> ARTICLE
Vs. Domino's?  No.

but ingesting the ass that dominos calls "pizza" is no better im lucky we mostly have local places
>> ARTICLE
I don't know man, their new pretzel crust is pretty solid.

>> ARTICLE
I can't believe I don't remember the existence of either episode.
>> ARTICLE
They were both those types of episodes you just forget about because it was fan service filler nonsense and had close to nothing to do with the story until the last few minutes of the episode. [For The Giant Pizza Episodes](/s "The first giant pizza episode was when Euphie announces the creation of the Special Zone for 11s. Completely overshadowed the rest of the episode and set events in motion. The second one was around the 5th or 6th episode when Suzaku tries to confirm that Lelouch doesn't remember Nunally. Same story, that one moment completely overshadowed the rest of the episode.")
>> ARTICLE
I remember one of those episodes.

There was a second one?!

I really need to rewatch Code Geass...
>> ARTICLE
Both school festivals. In the second festival, they attempt to recreate it since it got messed up in the first one? I'm not 100% sure since its been a while since I watched it, but they definitely do it a second time. 
>> ARTICLE
First one is when Euphemia is at the school and makes her big announcement. Second time is in the second season and the blonde haired Knight who wants to be Suzaku's best friend tries to makes the pizza. I may be wrong since I haven't watched it in three years.
>> ARTICLE
> the blonde haired Knight who wants to be Suzaku's best friend tries 

Wait, is "best friend" a euphemism now?
>> ARTICLE
Second one is when that tableslider goes bananas?

>> ARTICLE
They were overshadowed by the Cinnabon episodes and the episodes where Lelouch tries to kill a fly.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget chasing that cat to get his mask back.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they dress-up like cats in that episode too?
>> ARTICLE
I think that was a much later episode. God, I need to rewatch Code Geass, and it's only been a few months since the last time.
>> ARTICLE
Me too, both series. It's been like 2 years.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch: "I, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you, fly, to just die!"

C.C.: "Lelouch, your Geass can only work on humans."

Fwiw, being at the Sunday concert at [Otakon 2013](http://i.imgur.com/A1xr78A.jpg?1) was pretty awesome. For her age, she's quite full of energy live. Though she nearly lost it during "The Real Folk Blues" because the room was singing along...and apparently very few people bothered to learn more than the first verse.

In case anyone asks, the Kraken Club (FFXI) is a personal joke that I had to pick between Yoko and hitting Shingo Adachi with it for nearly losing his job to that game...

My friends and I lucked out getting to that concert.  It was really great.  So, worth waiting forever for.

^^^Seeing ^^^myself ^^^out...
>> ARTICLE
I'm convinced that whenever Shinichiro Watanabe wants to make a new show, he strolls over to Yoko Kanno and asks "Ay Yoko, whatcha feel like composing?"

Yoko Kanno then throws a dart at a dartboard labeled with a multitude of different musical styles, to which Watanabe responds with a plot.

Bebop jazz? Spaceships and bounty hunters it is.
Icelandic folk/pop? Terrorist teenagers coming right up.
Blues jazz? Post-WW2 jazz playing and sexual tension!
>> ARTICLE
> Blues jazz? Post-WW2 jazz playing and sexual tension!

Which one is this?
>> ARTICLE
AKA "kids on the slope"
>> ARTICLE
[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon), though the sexual tension is more implied. 
>> ARTICLE
And in truth, it's less about sexual tension and more about bromance... unless, of course, that's what /u/Alroxes was referring to.
>> ARTICLE
It's always implied, that's what makes it sexual tension and not sex

Probably Sakamichi no Apollon

Sakamichi no Apollon is Kids on the Slope, some people prefer the Japanese name I guess
>> ARTICLE
Aaaah, ok, thanks for the clarification. Sorry, didn't know the Japanese name.
>> ARTICLE
sakamichi no apollon is kids on the slope so yea...
>> ARTICLE
She's the composer of the whole anime, IIRC.

She also did Ghost in the Shell (SAC) and Macross. She is a legend.

She formed the band The Seatbelts just for Cowboy Bebop (they perform Tank and a handful of other tracks for the show that aren't done by just her)

She is an idol of mine, and very influential.
>> ARTICLE
The seatbelts also did FLCL, the second greatest anime soundtrack, second only to Bebop.
Kanno is a god.

*edit* I'm a pleb. It was the Pillows.

Those were The Pillows.

As a fan of both bands, Their names are still kinda hilarious when seen together like this.

Edit for stupidity: [Great interview for Red Bull of all people](http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/yoko-kanno-interview)
>> ARTICLE
She also worked on several Macross scores, namely Macross Plus.

Macross Plus has a special importance placed on music as well.
>> ARTICLE
She also did the whole composition for Jin Roh Wolf Brigade if I remember correctly.

If you haven't watched Jin Roh fucking watch it right now. There are plenty of websites (less than legal) that stream it. It's a fantastic movie with just god tier animation and sound.

Kanno sings as well. She usually goes by the name Gabriela Robin when she does though. Fantastic voice.

Torukia is sung by her, for instance.

<3 Yoko.

Other famous anime series/movies she has worked on are Porco Rosso, Jin-Roh, Space Dandy and Wolf's Rain.

She also composes for various video games (such as Nobunaga's Ambition for all you *Oda Nobuna no Yabou* fans out there)  and a TON of pop artists.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Samurai Champloo!
>> ARTICLE
That was Nujabes.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously? My bad
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's fine. If Nujabes was alive I'm sure Watanabe would alternate between Kanno and him. Both make some great music. 
>> ARTICLE
They really do. Watanabe has a great ear for getting amazing music for his work.

I remembered reading somewhere that Kanno had worked on Champloo or remembered reading that. My apologies.
>> ARTICLE
Holy eff, no wonder Space Dandy sounded so on point and...familiar
>> ARTICLE
She did stuff for Proco Rosso? That's really cool, I thought Joe Hisaishi was the sole composer for most of the Ghibli films. I love Porco Rosso, I think it's my "unappreciated gem" of Miyazaki's work. Not that any of his work is *really* unappreciated, but it's definitely not the first movie that comes to most peoples' mind when you say Miyazaki.
>> ARTICLE
It's true! You say porco rosso and folks are like "What? Huh?"  drives me nuts. It was so well done and I love it. Kudos to another fan. =) 

Edit: fixed a word. 
>> ARTICLE
Kanno just did a sing or two for porco not the whole thing. I should have made that clear.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I totally knew what you meant. That's why I said "did stuff." Joe Hisaishi is the official composer for Porco, but hearing YK did work for it is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
And it's all great.

She's probably the only case where if I see her name attached, I get excited without knowing anything else about the show.

Of course, it helps that she only seems to take on quality work.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Macros Frontier because of her. Her music was pretty much the best part of it...
>> ARTICLE
I still haven't seen Frontier, but I will soon. I just have some other stuff on my list to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, don't we all...
>> ARTICLE
Haha, no kidding. The more I watch, the less progress I make hahaha.

The list grows faster than my watching rate.

Some day I might be on my last show...and I might be really sad...or really relieved.
>> ARTICLE
I share your sentiment. If it has her name on it, I will give it a shot, no questions asked because she is *that* good.
>> ARTICLE
Such a fantastic tack record. I wish she was a household name
>> ARTICLE
I feel like she pretty much is in anime terms
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's probably true. Considering the anime she's worked on are consistently considered classics or must watch, I think many anime fans wind up knowing who she is pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Yoko Kanno. Meeting her and getting to speak to her for 30 seconds at Otakon 2013 was one of the greatest moments of my life. Not to mention getting her autograph and seeing her perform live. This woman is nothing short of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Envious, but I got to meet Vic Mignogna from FMA and took pictures with him and got him to sign my FMA pocket watch and spent a ton of time with him. It was amazingly awesome.

I was at a con once and apparently he stayed in the same hotel as me. My friends I was with saw him every morning but I never noticed him. Met him later at the convention and he was a super nice guy.

I went to his panel which was great, and I spent some time talking with him. He is a really great guy. I have a younger brother so we both sorta resonate with Ed and Al, we both love FMA alot. I told him that it was the first ever anime to make me cry, he said it was the same for him. I look forward to seeing him again at Phoenix Comicon this year.

Pretty much the same thing with Space Dandy. Just a bunch of writers and directors doing fun shit for 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't there a manga before the show, though?

I'm pretty sure the show is not very dictated by it though.
>> ARTICLE
The manga was createted as a way to promote the show before it aired.  Sever original anime have done this like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Nausica.
>> ARTICLE
Nausicaa is actually based off of Miyazaki's manga. And Watanabe seems to have a preference for originals as he directed Bebop, Champloo, Dandy, and that latest terror one.
>> ARTICLE
The manga was started after the show finished I believe.
>> ARTICLE
I thought so too, but it came out several months before the show aired and ended a month or two into the show's run. 

Though, a show does take a while to make, so they could have done the manga during production of the show
>> ARTICLE
It actually came out 15 days before the show started. [Link](http://gyazo.com/c387d70e00583d6e970bc2aedebed4c0)
>> ARTICLE
So it seems to have been made quite a ways into production of the show.

Seeing how the manga says "ongoing" I got a lot of hope for future seasons!

Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Still can't believe its over :'(
>> ARTICLE
We can still hold out hope for a movie.

[Better context from the original TIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/31wk97/til_the_creator_of_cowboy_bebop_was_told_to_make/cq5vjui)
>> ARTICLE
The funny thing is, when I saw Shinichiro Watanabe say the very quote in the OP, he didn't provide that context. So I can't blame anyone for writing it this way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he was at an event in Scotland a couple of years ago and the way he told the story was that Bandai just wanted something with spaceships to ride on the Star Wars Episode I wave; He heavily implied (might have been lost in translation, I guess?) that they didn't give him any direction other than "put lots of spaceships in".

They were annoyed by the non-marketability of the show though, and pulled out - which is why there are a lot fewer spaceships after the episode when Bandai Visual took over.
>> ARTICLE
thank you
>> ARTICLE
No problem man, just sharing what I found interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> During the making of Bebop, Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later.

17 years and counting.
>> ARTICLE
it isn't wrong unless you consider the somewhat obtuse way of counting

**90's + 00's + 10's =**

three decades wrong.
>> ARTICLE
So you're gonna sit here and tell me that if we give the writers and directors of a show full intellectual control except for a small necessity like space ships it'll result in an artistically fantastic and classic series? I frankly don't believe you. 
>> ARTICLE
Only if they are as good as Shinichiro Watanabe...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but think of the producers and their stupid fucking ideas that have to be in the show so they can leave their mark!
>> ARTICLE
Well, history kind of repeated recently with Mappa and Rage of Bahamut.
>> ARTICLE
Also Avatar: The Last Airbender. The creators were basically told to make something that rides the wave of the Harry Potter style coming of age chosen one storylines.
>> ARTICLE
Isnt Rage of Bahamut based off of a game or am I thinking of something else?

>> ARTICLE
Exactly and I think the connection they were going for was it just had to feature characters from the CCG and they could do whatever they wanted. Ended up a big surprise and quite enjoyable series.

There was what you can consider slime porn, right? Or am I remembering that episode differently? Actually, don't correct me if I am.

Well, you didn't really see what the slime did to his victims since the scene would always get cut when the action was about to happen. Potentially there was so much tentacle stuff going on that the victims weren't able to stand afterwards.

It's probably worth noting that the person being referred to is Shinichiro Watanabe, not Yoko Kanno.

The odd thing, I don't remember seeing any Cowboy Bebop ship models for sale. When I lived in Japan, I actually looked for them. I'm sure they existed but I could never find them. Billions upon billions of Gundam mechs, even super obscure ones, Dozens of EVAs and variants, Yamato, and Galaxy Express of course... but no Cowboy Bebop ship models.

Yoko Kanno <3 !! 

I remember getting her autograph at Otakon 2013. You had to stand in a line on Friday just to receive a pass to stand in line on Saturday in order to get her autograph. This doesn't include the OTHER line I had to stand in to get a pass to stand in a different line later in order to watch her live piano performance.  Conclusion? It was all fucking worth it.

I've known more women fans of anime than male fans in my life and very few of them had anything but great things to say about Bebop.

There are certainly ascribed gender biases, like girls with dolls and boys with guns or cars or whatever, so I wouldn't be surprised if a sufficient sample size of the hobby showed preference. But most of the tastes you run into will be localized. For example, as far as I can tell, the active posters on /r/anime are overwhelmingly men, which runs pretty contrary to my personal experience of women anime fans outnumbering men.

Then again, redditors are also overwhelmingly young. Tastes go by generation as well. Women anime fans I've known in their 30's and 40's don't have much interest in shit that's explicitly marketed towards girls and women. It seems that younger female fans got hit with shojo, josei, and yaoi quite a bit harder because it took the Western import and marketing machine a bit of time to catch up with dolls and makeup and crap.

That's certainly anecdotal, but it also fits my point: even beyond individual preferences, you're going to find a lot of variation based on age, non-anime tastes, and how and when those people got into anime and manga. That's especially true of niche hobbies, even with the ubiquity of the internet.
>> ARTICLE
Guys in real life tend to hide their powerlevels.
>> ARTICLE
Unless its over 9000
>> ARTICLE
Good point. Maybe I just haven't been around as much. 
>> ARTICLE
Or you just know women with particular tastes.

Hell, being around here (even though, if anything, I've noticed a drop in participation of people who are openly female), I've also noticed a drop in interest/promotion of Cowboy Bebop. If you look at the best/favorite/essential anime threads, sometimes it's taking a day or two for someone to even mention Bebop, and then it's not getting a lot of upvotes. And I'm noticing way more people who are talking about having never seen it or having just watched it.

Preferences of the active members are leaning more and more towards three things: 1. moe, 2. the most recent sci fi or fantasy non-Shonen Jump-style title, 3. shows with references/pandering. Steins;Gate happens to squarely hit about two and a half of those, so it's no surprise that it's one of the strongest flavors of late. The one before that was Lucky Star, which hit 1 & 3 as hard as possible. Others in that range with recent strong followings around here: Haruhi, Bakemonogatari (and Nisemonogatari), Nichijou.

Don't misunderstand, I like some of those shows, too; so I'm not denigrating prevalent tastes. But prevalence exists in every circle and is far from universal. If you happened to go to a technical or engineering school and joined their anime club, you'd almost certainly witness something different from the anime clubs at liberal arts schools. You could be around forever and your personal experience is going to be subject to your circles. That's not to say you cannot get a wider read, but you should ask yourself if you're getting that wider read to confirm a bias you already have or if you're just absorbing what's out there without assumptions.
>> ARTICLE
I just have to say, your replies are consistently interesting and very well written and I find myself often upvoting you.  You, I like you.
>> ARTICLE
Ha. Thanks. I appreciate it.

To be honest, I think of my urge to engage in online discussion as a really bad habit. I hold it in sometimes, and other times, I can't restrain myself. So, when I can't hold back, I *don't hold back*. Sometimes that means I go overboard, but then I can keep myself from commenting for longer after that.

Kind of backwards, but, then, so are a lot of other things about online social interaction.
>> ARTICLE
Don't feel bad. I'm sure you have just as much to say in person. Your insight is very interesting keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to add another vote of appreciation and ask if you use MAL, I like seeing the favorites of the posters here.
>> ARTICLE
I don't. Never really found a need for it. Maybe some day. My favorites are pretty basic. Bebop, Tatami Galaxy, Planetes, Azumanga Daioh, Beck, Ghibli stuff, Bakemonogatari, FLCL, Haibane Renmei, Nana, DMC, Nodame Cantabile, Cromartie High School, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, Mushishi, Maria-sama ga Miteru, Hidamari Sketch...

A few of my tastes that deviate from popular opinion are probably that Howl's Moving Castle, while good and enjoyable, is one of the worst Ghibli films. Also, that Evangelion is really mediocre at best and the only good thing about it is the cool robots. I also can't get into Lucky Star. And the first handful of FMA Brotherhood episodes are a travesty of storytelling. Death Note is mediocre.

Also, I like some shows like K-On! and Strawberry Marshmallow but apparently not for the same reasons most people do. I don't get into the moe thing and I just like those shows because they're funny and chill. And on the other side of the coin, I watched Bleach without the filler and really enjoyed it up to the end of the Arrancar stuff. The last season/arc lost me right away, but I don't think that shonen stuff is automatically bad, just like I don't think that moe is automatically good. There seems to be way too much tribalism about that.

Of the stuff that I rarely see mentioned, some favorites are Cat Soup, Fantastic Children, Windy Tales, and Kamichu!

Thanks, that was much better than an MAL list!

I just started getting into anime, and im watching cowboy beebop alot, and i like it.  

While Im here, are there any good anime that does NOT evolve around a highschool, teenagers with issues, and card games?

Oh... also one that doesn't have some cute girl chasing after the main character who is basically a dick to her? 

<edit>

By the way, thanks for the suggestions, everybody in the thread.  I haven't been commenting, but i did write every title down, google them, and have been downloading champloo, ghost in the shell, big o, mushishi, and murder princess, mononoke the series one....etc..... 
  
One old one that i found that i absolutely adore is Slayers.  Im sure you all already know that anime.  
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK(Being a loser problems), the Tatami Galaxy(college problems), Ghost in the Shell:Stand Alone Complex(Sci Fi stuff), Samurai Champloo(Samurai stuff)

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex; Samurai Champloo (as has been said many times already); Darker than Black; Big O...

My girlfriend doesn't really watch a lot of anime.  Out of notable series she's seen with me, Clannad+AS, Spice and Wolf, Gundam Seed+Destiny, FLCL, Cowboy Bebop is actually her favorite.

Out of that list, It would probably be my least favorite, well maybe ahead of Seed.  People like different things, gender has little to do with it imo.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, but now that you mention it, I don't have too many female friends who I know like Cowboy Bebop. I know I don't know all of my lady friends' likes, but I can't recall anyone whose a big fan. I'm a huge fan of it, it's basically my favorite TV show of all time. It's the only thing I've ever stayed up til 5:30 to watch on Adult Swim, just because it was on.

Bebop fans even have our own subreddit, www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/

Bebop is not exactly shallow...
>> ARTICLE
My experiences with anime clubs and friends who like anime in general (girls and guys) has been that Cowboy Bebop rarely gets talked about, and usually when it's brought up, it's brought up in the context of Yoko Kanno-composed BGM.

Personally, I think it's a good intro to anime (it was my first one), but it's not very memorable. The plot is rather episodic and the whole thing is kinda short. The characters are cool, but not easy to relate to. So in the end, it's one of those anime where if I were asked about it, I'd be like "yea that was a good anime" because well, I can't find anything wrong with it, but I'd never considering putting it in any of my top lists because it just didn't engage me much emotionally.
>> ARTICLE
> The characters are cool, but not easy to relate to.

I'm still pondering if it's bad that I can relate to the main characters and the even the minor characters...I love Cowboy Bebop, and I think you are lucky then, to have a harder time to relate to Cowboy Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I almost cried at the end of that series had the same effect on me as TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
You almost cried? I still cry at the ending, even after watching it like 6 times.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree, it's probably top 3 for me. The whole noir sci-fi tone of it is perfect. Spike feels like this iconically cool dude, with this pretty epic send-off.

"Bang."

It's all in line with his final words to Faye, about how one of his eyes only sees the past. The only way he could reunite with Julia, and the only way he could escape the Syndicate was guns blazing. 

A TRUE TESTAMENT TO THE SPACE COWBOY WAY. That final scene in Red dead Redemption. Couldn't help but remember Spike. 

It lacks a larger over arcing plot, but it's character driven, with this unified style. It uses something that I don't see as much in anime in general: Subtlety.

I understand not diggin it the same way.
But it irks me to say it isn't memorable. 
>> ARTICLE
haha I'm a girl and don't give a shit about bebop. Meanwhile, my BF really likes it
>> ARTICLE
Speaking with a vagina, Cowbop Bebop is still one of my favorite animes. In terms of musical score I've yet to find something quite as diverse and so memorable and I would be here for days if I wanted to go into length about the story arch and character types and why the series could appeal to women as much as men. 

But hey, this is meant to be personal.  

For me if there was any female protagonist I wanted to be, it was Faye Valentine and I couldn't have had more of a girl-crush on Spike. (You couldn't imagine the heart break at the end of the series.) The universe brought with it references to so many other of my interests; my love for jazz, harmonicas and shout outs to great bands like Led Zep. and the Stones. gave me a girlish tickle. 

Oh and there was that whole sexy Julia chick. Diggin' it.

And so we've reached an episode that nicely captures just how amazing this show is. The scene with Spike falling from the window is one of my favourite scenes in any show. The music, the visuals, it's just absolutely beautiful.

We also get some nice plot development, in terms of backstory, as well as what seems to be a larger scale antagonist than the ones we've seen so far.
>> ARTICLE
Not rewatching (my DVD's over at my Pap's and I want to see if he'll like it) but I'm glad I clicked on this thread.  This episode is honestly what truly sold Cowboy Bebop for me. I watched the first episode about a year and a half before I ever finished the series and I really liked it, but when I watched the series, and got to this episode it finally felt like the show found its place.

The very second that falling scene happened, I was sold for good on this show. One of its more perfect scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I've bled all that kind of blood away .
>> ARTICLE
They why are you still alive
>> ARTICLE
I'm Excited! One of my favorite Episodes and the first big story episode! I'll bullet some of my favorite parts!

* A lot was revealed about Spike's past involving the Crime Syndicate 
* Introduction of Vicious!
* Small backstory about Jet and his arm
* Shoot out in the church
* Spike's falling from the stained glass window with fantastic music and flashbacks is probably the most powerful shot of this episode 
* [BIG SPOILER, only for watchers who've finished the series before ](/s "close up on Spike's false eye showing he is looking into the past while he was falling, nice little hint I've never caught before ")
* "You sing off key"

New watchers!: What were your thought's on the backstory in this episode, favorite parts? Theories?

Excellent catch on that spoiler, that never occurred to me before but it makes sense now you brought it to my attention. 
>> ARTICLE
Great catch in the spoiler. [Spoiler](/s "I would've expected them to put bits of the flashback throughout the episode. Logical places would have been with Annie and especially during the scene when Spike gathers his weapons. With the false eye in mind it makes a lot more sense to put all of the flashbacks in that one sequence.")
>> ARTICLE
Nice catch in that spoiler. [Spoiler](/s "When I first watched it, I figured it was a life flashing before his eyes thing, and he was remembering those scenes, but I never went back and made the connection with the false eye once that was revealed. ")
>> ARTICLE
This is a great Bebop episode

* The use of light is superb. The obvious case of course is when Vicious, covered in darkness, approaches Spike, whom, while not truly bathed in light, is well lit. If you look closely at the whole church sequence, in this small bit of the scene when Vicious approaches Spike the lighting is acting in a fairly illogical manner. That's actually purposeful and superb because it makes the dichotomy of Vicious and Spike that much more impactful. In a church such as this the doorway, while letting in unfiltered light unlike the stain glass windows, shouldn't be the major source of light as it is during the small bit of that scene. Before Spike enters the church we're shown a shot of the church clearly covered in windows, we've already seen Vicious silhouetted in the light of the far rose window, as Spike approaches we are shown beautiful well lit stain glass panels around the whole church, and at the very end of the sequence Spike and Vicious are drowned in the light of the rose window. This is a well lit place, but Vicious is a malicious man. Put him in darkness.

* The other notable use of light is the opera singer reaching up towards the ceiling lights, as if reaching to heaven, near the end of *Ave Maria*. The meaning of this is more muddied and my interpretation could certainly be incorrect, but to me it seems that it highlights the fact Faye fears for her life and would conceivably pray if she thought her time was at an end (the opera sequence is Faye centric). This fear is something we really don't see out of Spike, especially in this episode. Although I say all of this knowing that such an interpretation is a stretch at best.

* The most unappreciated first appearance in this episode is undoubtedly Jet's bonsai trees! They are very important in this and future episodes for symbolizing aspects of Jet's character.

* Bounty Count: 0/6

I feel as though every aspect of this anime was crafted like a very symbolic novel, or a well written poem. I find something new to appreciate about it every time I watch it.

Yes the Bonsai trees! I forgot about them very important part to Jet's character
>> ARTICLE
Faye's outfit in this episode, hot damn
>> ARTICLE
The music that plays as Spike falls is called [Green Bird](https://youtu.be/XJjnbhSTuqQ).
>> ARTICLE
Some other interesting parts:

x The shot of the cross while they're talking about blood.

x It's ironic that Vicious refers to themselves as fallen angels even though they fell from fighting as a living.

x The flashbacks of Vicious and Spike working together as friends really fleshes out their conflict, since there must have been a fight/betrayal between the two.

x Jett tries not to get involved, but he cares too much and winds up picking up Faye and Spike.  The group dynamic of the crew is really coming together now.  They each give each other personal space, but they'll help out, too.

Also, who is the third person in the picture? (I feel like I should already know that.)
>> ARTICLE
I do love Jett and Spike's relationship and it gets more fleshed out as the series progresses but in their talk before Spike goes out you can see Jett doesn't really know much of Spike's past and same with Spike not knowing Jett's (as seen with him asking about his arm). While we've seen Faye join the group we never actually saw how Spike and Jett met up which leave a lot of uncertainty of how they met and decided to go in business together


> Also, who is the third person in the picture? (I feel like I should already know that.)

In what picture?

I remember leafing through a book about Cowboy Bebop one time where I believe they explained who he was, I don't remember very well.

It wasn't explained in the anime but I believe the information is out there somewhere.

This is the episode of Bebop that really got me hooked. The first four episodes were alright, but nothing like I imagined after hearing all the praise for it, but *Ballad of Fallen Angels* really sold the show to me. It's just a beautiful episode.

That's because episode 5 encapsulated what is so good about Bebop, it's the best episode, but there are other very good ones to go.

>> ARTICLE
Vicious is such a badass
>> ARTICLE
I'm not watching along with you guys, but I do wanna say something.

A lot of people think the first 4 episodes are slow. Some even go as far as to say that you should just start at 5 and then go to 1, 2, 3 and 4.

However, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are deliberately slow. They build up the world a bit, sure but they have 1 other very important function. To illustrate Spike's and Jet's place in the bounty hunting world. 

They are good at it sure, but not because they are naturally born bounty hunters. They are just badass characters with usefull background experience.

The first 4 episodes in my opinion mostly serve a single purpose. Illustrate that Spike and Jet don't like the bounty hunting business. So if they don't like it, why are they bounty hunting?

This question is very important and should stay in the back of your mind until you realize the answer.
>> ARTICLE
that song that plays as spike is falling out of the window is awesome 
>> ARTICLE
Episode is fantastic, it is undoubtedly the best session of Bebop, very memorable, 'Rain' is a wonderful song I listen to frequently, as is the rest of the music in the episode.

It's very memorable, with quotes you won't forget, and Vicious is a great antagonist for the series.
>> ARTICLE
I really hate her! Also i hate those kind of characters! They go and mess up other peoples privacy, screw things up and drags the bystanders into their mess. It sickens me everytime i see those kind of characters. They ARE supposed to be smart. After failing so many times, and they yet to realize anything. Srly!

But regarding the flashback. Could some1 explain it to me? Did that Vicous guy kill his love interest or something? Did Vicous see her as a unneccasary influence for Spike? Like him becoming more soft hearted around her? Did he NTR her? Any1? Was the woman, that nursed him at the end, the same as the one that rejected(because she was threatened) him?
>> ARTICLE
I want to go back and watch cowboy Bebop now.

>> ARTICLE
I tried watching it, and couldn't watch more than 7 EPs. Which is a shame, because the art and everything is really good, but it feels like it doesn't go anywhere. It feels like it's the same basic thing over and over.

Complain about not having food/money, bad guy shows up, have a chance to catch them, fail, go back to complaining.

Does it change? D: I really do want to get into it, but it's almost like Haruhi's Endless Eight.

There is a real plot.
>> ARTICLE
It is a pretty by the numbers show until they introduce Julia and Vicious. That is when things really pick up.
>> ARTICLE
That's like ep 5.
>> ARTICLE
It's much more complex than it might seem. I watched a few episodes when I was 13/14 but got back into it last year or the year before and only finished it then. It deals subtly with a lot of philosophical themes, existentialism, great voice acting, design and concept everything about it is perfect imo. The plot becomes more complex and interesting not everything episode is the same there's a really strange one towards the end. Only 26 episodes it's worth watching it all!
>> ARTICLE
I've noticed some of the more subtle plots in each episode. But I also want to see him get the bad guy now and then. D:

I'll start it again tonight and only watch a few episodes at a time like /u/Megarhurtz suggested. I've got a habit of marathoning series', and maybe Cowboy Bebop was just too much to take in, in just one go.
>> ARTICLE
There are several times they're successful, don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't recommend marathoning episodes. Take a break and take it all in and then continue after some time.
>> ARTICLE
The best advice I have is don't try to marathon it. Just an episode or two a day. Most of the episodes are standalone and that can be a bit much if you try to do the whole thing in just a few sittings.

How was someone able to make this?
>> ARTICLE
They hook up the floppy drives to a computer and use a program called Arduino. The computer commands the floppy drives, which can move at different speeds for different notes. Solder a bunch of stuff together, write the composition into Arduino, and adjust the floppy drives to tune them.

My favorite is [Ghostbusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_vWkv50uk).
>> ARTICLE
That's so cool. I never knew about that before, thanks for the info. 
>> ARTICLE
So I'm assuming all you need to play a song is the notes and rhythms. That you can take any sheet (simple enough) and play it given by translating into an Arduino program. Then there's are programs that analyze songs and transcribe the sheet music. Well has anyone hooked up a system to make a floppy drive music player that can handle arbitrary songs?

>> ARTICLE
I have no idea. I think you need to create your own MIDI file, have Arduino do its magic, and maybe mess with some options.

I don't think a machine alone can handle that, as there are certain things that will technically be correct but won't sound good. You'll have to change the notes of the melody or something to keep the floppy drives from blending their noises together.

The Ghostbusters theme I linked is an example; the words "Ghostbusters" aren't said that high in the song and the spacing is awkward, but you wouldn't hear it if it were played lower.
>> ARTICLE
For clarification, Arduino is a microcontroller that sends instructions to the floppy disks in order to move them in certain ways.

[Here](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Musical-Floppy-Drives/?ALLSTEPS) is a link to a how-to guide.

And then you install certain software on the Arduino to have it play the midi file.

Stand Alone Complex is pretty good.

Kids on the Slope is made by the same people who did Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. It's a very different kind of anime, but my god is it beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are some anime like Cowboy Bebop (but keep in mind that this is subjective) :

* Darker than black
* Black Lagoon
* Trigun (less mature/serious, and the manga is waaaay better than the anime, which is graphically poor)
* Baccano!
* Cobra (old but gold)

>> ARTICLE
Darker than Black and Black Lagoon were spectacular. 
>> ARTICLE
Second the Black Lagoon rec. If you liked bebop, there's a good chance you'll like the characters in BL.
>> ARTICLE
~~season 2 Darker than Black~~ IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo was done by the same people who made Bebop, it's a really good series.
>> ARTICLE
Shows that have a more serious, mature styled sensibilities have always existed. Seemingly every season (or every other season) there are shows that are staggeringly well made and can make the viewers think or have an amazing style to it. It's just a shame that so many amazing anime are very little known, even within the anime fandom.
>> ARTICLE
But wait! Don't go yet! We need examples!!
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Samurai Champloo (I'm guessing most Cowboy Bebop fans at least heard about it) and it's pretty much a spiritual sequel to Bebop with the style and the entire 'silly characters going on an adventure and then things turning deadly serious' aspect of Bebop. 

There's more off beat choices like the newest Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure which has a fair mix of the comedic and serious action. Fate Zero is a very dark action and a great introduction to the Type Moon universe continuity.

Black Lagoon and Mitchiko & Hatchin are both great if you want some of the bounty hunter action found in Bebop. Both shows are very well animated too. 

This recommendation may be a bit out there, but the director of Cowboy Bebop recently made  Kids on the Slope which is a Jazz music schoolclub based anime. It has a lot of the top notch attention to detail and musical flare the director is known for. It's not a spiritual sequel to Bebop like Samurai Champloo was, but it's worth following the works of Shinchiro Watanabe regardless.

Other offbeat choice is Kemonozume, which is just comedy and action overload. It might be to your fancy if you really like the experimental nature of Cowboy Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Wow thank you for the tips! I recently finished evangelion and I decided to watch two at time this go around those being Cowboy bebop and steins;gate. 

I loved the whole musical mixing aspect of samurai champloo and have seen the series in its entirety, but it's due for a rewatching soon. 

I've been recommended black lagoon before which I always confuse with the other anime titles darker than black, but beyond title names I don't anything else about either series. Also I will probably be watching the others you mentioned, I usually watch episode one of a lot of shows and then decide if I'm adding it to my list and then I come back to it later ha.

Underrated in what way?  This anime is lauded as one of the greats from anime fans all over.

There are plenty of fans of the show who will sing praises of it, blurbing all over internet forums, invading youtube comments, and praising every little intricate detail of it 'till the cows come home.

Not like I'm not one of them, mind you. 
>> ARTICLE
Great work.  Cowboy bebop fans do some amazing art work.  Keep it up.  I don't have the picture but another person did a 4 panel with the characters.  Almost pulp fictiony.   
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I couldn't be assed to sit through even 6 minutes of the first episode. I know exactly what it is about this anime that turned me away, it was the cheap half-assed art, the style, even how the characters were drawn felt as if it was off. I don't know who the voice actors were, but they also killed it for me at the start, they didn't even fit the personality that the characters were given.

And the guy at the start who sprayed whatever into his eyes that gave him super-human abilities to dodge bullets, really pissed me off, he should've at least caught that bullet between his eyes and died, nobody is going to be that inaccurate at near point-blank firing handguns especially when he was simply moving around out in the open not even bothering to take cover.

I wouldn't recommend this anime to anybody, I believe it deserves to be burned and never seen again. I had the same problem with One Piece, I managed to ass myself to sit through 12 episodes of that anime, because I was told that if I sat there and watched more than one episode I was promised I would like it. I didn't.

I can tell straight off whether or not an anime is good (in my opinion I want to point that out, in *MY OPINION*. Are we clear on that? Good). 

If someone cares to say otherwise, please do so without starting an argument and we can discuss it in a civil manner, if not, then just feel free to down vote and leave some hate or just down vote without leaving a response, either way, I don't care unless it's something to be discussed in a mature way.

I said my 2 cents.
>> ARTICLE
> I can tell straight off whether or not an anime is good 

And what, in your opinion, constitutes good anime?
>> ARTICLE
I'll point out Trigun and Outlaw Star (just for comparison) in terms of pulling off a space pirate or space bounty hunter theme in an anime, two things that I want to point out that these two anime have that Cowboy Bebop doesn't have, is a sense of mortality and realism. I'm talking about bullets being fired that are so close to a characters face quite literally should be dead, at least in Outlaw Star or Trigun when somebody took a hit, it showed. 

In Cowboy Bebop's first action scene, it displayed somebody dodging handgun bullets at point-blank range just because he injected himself with a drug of some kind while trying to sell it off to somebody who happened to get killed instead.

What constitutes a good anime for me depends on what kind of anime it is. Such as Cowboy Bebop for example, if it involves guns and bullets flying, I expect somebody to take a hit, that's all I'm saying. Not dodging bullets so close to someones face like it's Dragonball Z where at least that anime has an excuse for a super-human theme.
>> ARTICLE
Spike gets hit a lot. People get shot a lot. People die a lot. [For example.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFSsZo7rfA) That is one of my favorite scenes in anime, particularly because of the music.

The whole dodging a bullet thing was a one off event to show the effects of the drug. They are in the future where they have hyper-space technology, who cares if the guy can dodge bullets because he shot up some space-PCP. I can't imagine me being able to get through many shows just because I saw something I thought was absurd, or didn't make much sense even in the context of the show.

There are many reasons people love the show, and none of them are because they loved that guy who took drugs, dodged bullets, and died in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Now this, this is the type of civil discussion I was talking about with an evaluated assessment of my opinion that stayed on topic.

Okay, I can agree that this one scene that I've been highly debating can be overlooked, I'm not that narrow-minded and stubborn to say at least that much otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned a few other things that turned me away. 

What about the voice acting? I can also deal with the bad art style for the theme, but the voice acting for the characters don't particularly tell me that they were all that into the role they were given for the characters they were covering to have much of a personality. 

The main protagonist in the beginning basically passed off to me as much as I was able to understand about the character just from the voice actor that didn't sell the role to be enough to buy it, to me, he seemed like a person who would be more inclined to take on a job rather than reluctantly accept the job until he's told that his last job (that we never even saw) get brought up in conversation as to the reasons for financial troubles in which he finally accepts the job.

His attitude in this situation did not tell me he was lazy and just wanted the luxury, this scene told me that his attitude is about mental, physical, and spiritual awareness (I'm assuming he was meditating of sorts in the beginning?) and that he'd be more likely to accept a job to chase after a bounty target than complain about it. His appetite about food as well tells me he's choosy, but again, the voice actor didn't sell the role enough for me to buy into it.

Please tell me that the voice acting at least picks up, cause if not, I'm afraid that on top of the bad first shoot-out scene and the bad voice acting will be enough to keep me away permanently.

I really want to like an anime, but if the anime is not worth it, then my time spent on it will mean nothing and I can't get back those 8 or so hours of my life watching the entire thing, so I don't see why I should spend my time on it if it isn't entertaining for me or to my interest.
>> ARTICLE
The art and voice-acting (assuming you are watching dubbed) are two of the reasons people love bebop so much.

I really can't fathom how you formulate your opinions.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, watching the entirety of a show (or reading the entirety of a book, etc.) is usually the best prerequisite to making a strong critical evaluation of the work as a whole. The reason you're getting plenty of opposition is that you based your entire opinion of the show as a shitfest that needs to be burned on the first few minutes of the first episode. 

Now I respect your opinion and decision not to watch the rest, but had you at least done more before calling out the entire series (a dangerously brave act considering the general acclaim surrounding it), then people would probably be more accepting of your opinion. With the little that you watched, a simple "The situations, voice acting, and animation didn't appeal to me so I didn't watch the rest" would've sufficed instead of a rather strong and forceful proclamation of disgust and contempt towards the entirety of Cowboy Bebop. 

In fact, you didn't even have to say anything at all, especially in a post that celebrates the anime more than it does debate its merits and flaws. I know it's your opinion, but posting a rant here just makes you seem aggressive and asking for confrontation. Unless you truly wanted someone to convince you that Bebop was worth watching (though with your defensiveness in other posts I'm doubting it), then you probably should've started this discussion somewhere more appropriate than a fanart post. 

I'm not trying to convince you one way or another about how good Bebop is (tbh I'm only halfway rn), but I'm just trying to be civil. Just my 2 cents.

Cheers.
>> ARTICLE
But the parts about magic bullets in Outlaw Star and the Angel gun arm in Trigun were realistic.

Kinda stinks the art is what turned you off of it, the story was actually really good. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah well, maybe if I get bored enough and not care about the bull about a bullet so close to a characters face that they should be dead I'll give it another shot.

But until then, Cowboy Bebop is another anime I'd rather not look at, and the irony of all of this is that I gave this anime a try earlier yesterday morning. Kinda a shame, but I'm not easy to please with just the common gun firing action scenes, I just expect a character to die with a scene like the one in the first 6 minutes, not just the no-name face-less common filler characters dying off for plot to get the anime rolling.

I understand the character is supposed to be a badass, but it just makes me cringe when I see what I already saw. I expect that kind of twist from anime like Dragonball, not an anime based on space pirates or space bounty hunters using real-life inspired weapons.
>> ARTICLE
Asimov is a one off character. He diea first episode.  Finish it then be a snarky prick.
>> ARTICLE
Your opinion is easy to scrutinize because your evaluation is weak and poorly founded. You gave up because you were bothered by an arbitrary plot device. That's hardly an objective or thoughtful analysis... It's just a reactionary judgement. You also discredit yourself when you label the art as cheap and half-assed... It is neither. The show had high production values. That's just a fact. You can say you thought it was ugly, but it's incorrect to call it cheap.
>> ARTICLE
> I know exactly what it is about this anime that turned me away, it was the cheap half-assed art, the style, even how the characters were drawn felt as if it was off.

Ok, thats your opinion I guess, though I'd like to point out that this anime was made in 1998 (before digital production was available, as in every single frame had to be drawn by hand.)

Secondly, I find it hilarious that you are judging its entirety by the first six minutes. I mean seriously? I don't think you are at all qualified to form an opinion on it.

Not gonna comment on the whole red-eye thing, since your thoughts are kind of all over the place.

Can't help but think that this is a troll post, but I bit anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, let's talk about "qualification", I'm 25 years old, I've been watching cartoons and anime for let's say at least 20 years of my life. Let me first nit pick away at what you're referring to "qualification", I'm not payed to criticize, so what does that say about me? You guessed it, it's just me and my alone, opinion. I believe I pointed that out rather clearly in my first comment, so your little nit picking at my comment just became null and void, especially since you selected only one thing in my comment to point out and "argue" about.

Second thing I'm going to tell you, is that with as many years that I've been watching anime, you can damn well be sure that I know what I believe I'm looking for within just the first few minutes or less of an anime without having the need to finish it.

Do you know exactly what I'm talking about the art turning me away? It sure as hell isn't how old the anime is just because it is drawn by hand, I'm a huge Street Fighter & Dragonball fan in the anime arena, these are the anime with the art styles that could pull it off.

Let's talk about how an anime can pull off the whole "space pirate/ space bounty-hunter" theme. I want to bring up two anime that pulled this off quite well, which are Trigun and Outlaw Star. Do you know what these two anime had that Cowboy Bebop doesn't have in it? A sense of mortality and realism. When I say a sense of mortality and realism, I'm talking about how even the fucking heroes and villains taking bullets when they should be, not some point-blank range handgun bullet dodging bullshit just because you happened to inject red blood eye spray crap in your eyes to give you super-human abilities or senses to dodge them.

When a bullet is THAT fucking close to hitting you between the eyes you really gotta start questioning what the hell you're watching.

So yes, within just the first few minutes of watching a new anime if I catch that kind of bullshit straight off I know immediately that it's pretty bad in terms of story development, even while knowing that he injected himself with some kind of drug to give him those abilities.

You want to call what I said a troll post, then your definition of that is pulling that off all on it's own when speaking about your own. I gave an honest opinion and a very valid reason for that opinion, what you did was start an unnecessary argument over said valid opinion rather than discussing it in a civil manner. I may be the one slinging f-bombs, but at least I can spot bullshit and call you on it when I know that what you posted by far screams nothing but troll. Congratulations, you got a rise out of me defending my position on my opinion, I don't care, I welcome half-assed obvious trolls such as yourself to steer a subject off topic.

Thanks for that.
>> ARTICLE
> that Cowboy Bebop doesn't have in it? A sense of mortality and realism.

Yeah... it's pretty obvious that you haven't watched the show.
>> ARTICLE
Jeez, you are rustled as fuck.

Come and talk to me when you have watched more than six minutes of it, and when you've calmed down. I refuse to believe that six minutes is enough to formulate an opinion, I don't care how long you claim to have watched anime for.

And you're the one that wanted to have a conversation, way to completely blow up for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah no I'm not going to waste my time watching more than 12 episodes like I did for One Piece just because the person recommending it happened to be my nephew.

Sorry, if anybody writing manga or making anime based off manga want me as a fan, they gotta cut the bullshit out of the equation unless it is blatantly obvious that the character came to the planet on a spaceship with a tail and super powers involved.

No, I expect somebody to die if a bullet is that close to the characters face out in the open without cover.
>> ARTICLE
Who the fuck are you that your time is soooo valuable?  I bet youve wasted more time coming up with sparky reddit comments than you have on one episode of Bebop.

Bebop is one od the greats for a reason.  The entire show oozes style.  It is a show that breaks the concept of anime as a genre and focuses on anime as a medium. 

You can have your opinion but don't be a dick. 
>> ARTICLE
No, his face was that close to a bullet at point-blank range, I expect him to be dead in that instant since he somehow *miraculously* dodged a hail marry of bullets walking toward everyone he killed out in the open with no cover when his plan to sell I'm assuming is an illegal drug became a bust.

One of the greats? I'm glad I didn't give it the time of day as a kid growing up, because back then would only confirm my suspicion now that it's story development leaves much to be desired.

I half expected in that instant where time slowed when the bullet was so close to the characters face that he would die right then on the spot, with the hero or *main protagonist* finding out that somebody stole his score leading him to go on some rampage to grab the money that he accepted a job for.

If you call that a bad evaluation of the first six minutes for an  expectation of mine then that's just your feelings towards my opinion, not your own opinion. I'm sorry I'm not as gullible and easily entertained as you are. May I suggest you doing what you do best from here on? Which is drooling and wearing a helmet.

Thanks, have a nice day. Oh, and I'll be a dick if I want to, it's a common reaction when I spot somebody spitting nothing but bullshit in an uncivil manner such as you did. I wasn't being a dick for the hell of it, no, I'm a dick when the situation calls for it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah youre just a regular dick. 
>> ARTICLE
You are getting awfully hung up on such a mundane point
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget that it's a mundane point with a reasonable valid opinion.

Give me any reason that this character shouldn't have been killed in the first minute of his appearance during the shoot-out scene other than being the filler to the plot of just the first episode? I would have at least expected that he was a grunt working for a boss to sell a drug product to be ambushed by a rival gang to have their plans ruined by that rival gang, with them killing the dope dealer and the main protagonist going on his way to finding them, and then leading that information back to the big boss for his money.

Please, I'm begging you to change my mind as to any reason why this character shouldn't be dead in the first minutes of his appearance. You're gonna have to do better than just explaining that it's because he's the mark or target of the main protagonists personal agenda of list of things to do.

I've had this idea to re-edit the unreleased episode, "Session XX Mish Mash Blues" with a Bluray rip.  
So far I've transcribed the old subs and taken screenshots of every scene in Mish Mash Blues.  
The only thing left would be to watch every episode of Cowboy Bebop to identify what episode and at what time each screenshot takes place

Here's some links.

IDK if I could post the episode here since it would be piracy but it aired once almost 20 years ago and hasn't been sold since.  That's what made me want to do this re-edit.  The rip we have now is really poor quality, recorded to VHS, has advertisements in it, it's a mess.  

So with all this being said, would anyone be willing to take a look at the scene collection to see if they can identify some scenes?  What would even be the best method for people to contribute.  I guess a Google Doc maybe?  IDK and that'd be an issue for me since I can't make a google account without giving them a phone number which I'm not going to do if this is tying into my Reddit account.

EDIT:  I think the best method would be for me to host a ZIP of the screencaps which are labeled 001.jpg, 002.jpg, ect... and have a Google Doc for people to contribute Found Scenes to.  Which is a small problem since I won't be able to make a Google Doc.  

Anyone willing to help with this.  With more people rewatching I think we could really knock this out pretty easily.

Here's my old analysis of this episode, from about a year back:

**Session 2: Stray Dog Strut**

*Wild Wild West*

To the untrained eyes and ears, when one thinks of anime, you think giant eyes, cartoonish expressions, and over-the-top action sequences. People tend to think of the Big Three (for the uninitiated, those are Naruto, One Piece and Bleach). They dont think of anime as having western influences or themes. As far as I know, Bebop was one of the first anime that very much so had a Western feel to it. You had contemporary shows like Trigun that rivaled Bebop as far as being Western was concerned, but it really was Bebop that came onto the scene and became the really definitive western anime. As a result, Bebop was established as the gateway anime for many American viewers.

Stray Dog Strut really sets Bebop up as Western in both tone and influence. By this, I mean this episode establishes Bebop as Western in the old West meaning, complete with our beloved Big Shot Bounty Hunters (more on that later). At the same time, it is Western in that its overall style (music, action, characters) are all very Americanized. But once again, more on that later.

It may seem like a pretty obvious observation, but the title itself: Cowboy and Bebop embody the series dual Western nature. The cowboy, of course, representing the Old West, whereas the bebop signifies the jazzy, American spin put on it.

Regarding the episode at hand, Stray Dog Strut contrasts itself with the previous episode both in tone and in the number of characters introduced. Although one thing I have always found a bit odd was the fact that the scene immediately following Abdul Hakims introductionthe shots of Mars from spacewere extremely reminiscent of some of the beginning scenes from the previous episode; but, of course, thats just a little observation.

There were two primary observations I made throughout the episode regarding the Western style. As previously mentioned, Bebop is a series of contrasting and conflicting styles. In this episode, the first conflict I noticed was the sheer number of (speaking) characters introduced. In Asteroid Blues, we have Jet, Spike, Asimov, his lover (still dont know her name), the bartender/drug dealer, and the trio of grizzled old dudes. Here, we see the villain of the weekAbdul Hakimthe men chasing him, Jet, Spike, Punch & Judy, the Professor (or whatever), the bug-drinking guy in the bar, the dude with the suitcase, the pet store lady, Ein, the bickering truck guys (one of whom reminds me of Ravi from Planetes), the kids Hakim threatens, and the street man with the tracker bird.

Most of these are one-scene characters, and aside from Ein, Spike, Jet and Punch & Judy, we dont see most of them again. The point Im trying to make with regards to the unusual number of speaking characters is that it contrasts with the typical cast of a Western. Going off my knowledge of Old Western films, theres the typical lone wanderer, perhaps his sidekick, a damsel in distress, maybe some Indians or train robbers, and a mishmash of town folk. Granted, my knowledge of Old Western films is fairly limited. Anyway, it takes the tradition of a Western having a relatively small cast and turns it on its head with the number of new characters.

The second was, again, a great contrast from the first episode, this time in tone. Whereas Asteroid Blues was at all times either dark or action-packed, Stray Dog Strut was much more light-hearted. That is to say, its not just more light-hearted in terms of dialogue or characters; the colors and visual style of every scene is so much brighter, so much more alive than in Asteroid Blues. But where the humor really comes into play is in the context of the series as a whole. There are dark episodes of Bebop (see: Ballad of Fallen Angels) and there are very light-hearted episodes of Bebop (see: this one) and there are just plain weird episodes of Bebop (see: Pierrot le Fou, Toys in the Attic).

Where it conflicts with the series Western roots is the fact that Bebop so well balances its humor with action, suspense and drama. Your average Western series (note: average) isnt so well balanced. Likewise, an Old Western film is typically void of humor or even happiness (see: Clint Eastwood). Its just unusual for a Western to have such a sense of humor without it being overpowering or out of place.

Without it sounding too much like a review, Stray Dog Strut is easily one of my favorites. I need to mention the standout songs from the episode: Want It All Back and Bad Dog No Biscuit. Its always a pleasure to watch this one, and even more so to observe the series Western roots so early in the series.

I just don't know what westerns you're watching. This show has roots in the genre, sure, but this is a terrible episode to showcase it. The entirety of the episode is inean urban enviroment and the action focuses on two characters who are adept at martial arts.
>> ARTICLE
Well put.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of old westerns come with humourous elements involved. Clint Eastwood was actually in some of them such as Two Mules for Sister Sara and Coogen's Bluff. Sergio Leone also managed to sneak in a comedy spaghetti western in My Name is Nobody. 

Terrence Hill was a master at combining these two elements of westerns and comedy into his act. Although Leone wasn't the only man in the game, you'd definitely see comedies from guys like Don Siegel and maybe even elements in Henry Hathaway's films. Primarily the western influence would stem from the classic directors; Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich, Henry King, King Vidor, John Ford, John Sturges, Nicholas Ray and Siegel himself. 

There is a rift between the italian and American directors however. Italians were always drawn to the history and myth making of the American outlaw. Directors like Enzo G. Castellari, Sergio Corbucci and Tomino Valeri, Sergio Leone's assistant director, would make many films exploring this trend. Whereas American directors predictably fetishized the law making aspects of the American West and the land in which these people lived. This might add some context to your original post about Westerns and the connection between them and Cowboy Bebop.

I listened to Tank! in the intro every time when I first watched the series. I listened to it 40+ times after that. It is my ringtone on my phone. I will still be listening to it each time. Every episode. Every day. Best opening, despite what a [deluded subreddit may think](http://challonge.com/animeoptourny)
>> ARTICLE
these damn kids.. coming in here and voting for the latest fad..   get off my lawn \**shakes fist vigorously* \*

seriously though Tank! and the whole OST of cowboy bebop is the best.
>> ARTICLE
I got my band director to try out Tank in Jazz band. It ended predictably badly, but the fact that its awesomeness is recognized outside of the anime circle should be a testament.

That entire soundtrack really. I once heard it playing in my university bookstore while shopping for books. Put me a little bit more at ease with how much I was being fleeced

That's a real disappointment that Tank! lost to Tokyo Ghoul. Tank! is a masterpiece

Damn it, I forgot to Rewatch this.

I think its really cool that in this episode, even from the start, with that space gate, you can see all the chinese influences on the world of cowboy bebop. The tea, the signs, the fortune telling bird, and later in the series the feng shui and tongs. Its a little bit of speculation that really fleshes out the world, and years before firefly went the same route.
>> ARTICLE
I just fucked up.. I just marathoned it ...again. Well time to watch it again up to episode 2, can't be getting ahead of the curve. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's time for me to finally watch Cowboy Bebop. hopefully it will live up to all the appraisal it gets. I'm optimistic though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm doing the dub this time around. Hoping for the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
The dub's how I see the actual characters. It's really well done.
>> ARTICLE
It's how I first watched the series. Late Sunday night on Adult Swim as a young kid in middle school. Cowboy Bebop would come on, then Trigun and Tenchi Muyo and then I'd typically fall asleep around 2 in the morning. It was still one of the best experiences of my life. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, although the style is a little too dated for me. US voice acting has made leaps and bounds of improvement over the 20 years since this came out, between all the anime and video games they've done work for. I mean compare it to Black Lagoon in the early 2000s, and Space Dandy today. Black Lagoon is actually my favorite dub
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, it's not quite as good as dubbing of today... but I think it's still quite good. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying it's bad, but you could tell the staff is more used to Saturday morning cartoons than something like Cowboy Bebop. Granted they still pull it off quite well so far, and everyone's gotta start somewhere

Yes, but due to surface tension plastic type material will stick to you and slide a bit but not let go.

[Dude](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpmph2c9d01qc93th.gif) - oil would be absorbed by the skin and then there would be nothing for the plastic fabric to hold onto. 

Double sided tape. Double sided tape is used ubiquitously in fashion adhesion. [Fucking *oil* he says](http://cdn.niketalk.com/1/1d/1de8e7e2_NicolasCageLaugh.gif). 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... good point on it being absorbed. I guess the tape would work fine, but why must you all mess whith my fantasies of oiled up woman in cosplay 0.o?
>> ARTICLE
Double-sided tape most likely. It's done for a lot of cosplay, fashion and even some celebrities do it to prevent slips.
>> ARTICLE
sounds painful. I'd rather just use a little oil or vaseline and let them stick to eachother. I guess with cloth it wouldnt work so well though.
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell are you guys just downvoting things at random? This comment very clearly adds to the conversation.

**EDIT:** Oh. Because he might be trolling since vaseline and oil are lubricants. I'm slow.
>> ARTICLE
Nah it's not, like, Office Depot masking tape, they make body tape and the like, no pain involved and it's usually nice and sturdy.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I just think that a bit of vaseline or baby oil would allow a more natural sliding motion of the fabric against the skin.
>> ARTICLE
It would also allow a more natural sliding off of the tits, which is sort of the last thing a girl wants to happen at a convention.

with enough oil used no more likely then the tape failing from moving back and forth.

*Sigh.*

In the beginning, there was the First Ancestral Race. They made the seeds of life, their moons, the Spear of Longinus, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The seeds of life are creatures that, when they end up on a planet, spread a certain species of life on it. The moons are what they travel across the universe in for protection. The Spear of Longinus is a spear that can pierce any AT field and comes with every seed of life just in case one should be destroyed. An AT field is a protective barrier that every living organism has, though Angels and Evangelion units have far more prominent ones. They made the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are essentially a prophecy for the fate of Earth and it's inhabitants. 

The Seeds of Life were sent randomly through the universe by the First Ancestral Race. First, a seed of life called Adam crashed into Earth, being carried in The White Moon. This is known as the First Impact. Adam spread Angels, the species correlated with Adam,  around the planet. A few billion years later, a moon known as the Black Moon crashed into earth carrying a seed of named Lilith, the seed of life correlating with Homo Sapiens, or Lilin. Lilith did not have a Spear of Longinus. When Lilith came to Earth, there was a problem. Only one seed of life can live on a planet.

Seeing as Lilith had no correlating Spear, the Spear of Longinus for Adam was activated, neutralized Adam, and ended all Angel life for the time being. Humans became the prominent species of Earth, and all was well.

Until The Katsuragi Expedition carried out the first attempt at the Contact Experiment. A Contact Experiment is an attempt by Lilin to make contact with a Seed of Life. Through physical contact, the genes of Lilin were mixed with that of Adam. This caused a massive explosion, which was covered up by being blamed on a smell meteor travelling near the speed of light that impacted with Earth. The fact that the lie involved a meteor collision earned the event the name "The Second Impact". At this point, Adam was part human, and a certain human known as Yui Ikari was part Adam, so to speak. The embryo of Adam was gained from the Second Impact.

This was the reason for the creation of Gehirn. Gehirn was intended to prevent a Third Impact by all means, and they went about so using the DNA of Adam gained from the second impact to created weapons in Adam's image. Shortly after creation, Gehirn reorganizes and is renamed Nerv. The weapons are known as Evangelions, or EVAs. Adam's DNA is first used to created Evangelion unit-01. Nerv HQ is built on top of the Black Moon, and protects Lilith in an insanely secret underground vault called Terminal Dogma.

SEELE is an illuminati-esque top secret organization. It is known for funding Gehirn AKA Nerv. While Nerv supposedly is supposed to prevent a Third Impact, SEELE intends to create one. The reason SEELE would fund Nerv is that they intend for the third impact to happen on their own terms via the Human Instrumentality Project. The Human Instrumentality Project was started by SEELE to rapidly progress the evolution of Lilin and make all of humanity one single god-like entity. Yui Ikari, wife and Nerv Coworker to Gendo Ikari, a few years after giving birth to a son named Shinji Ikari, dies by sacrificing herself to merge her soul with Evangelion Unit-01, the most accurate clone of Lilith ever made. Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, the mother of Asuka Langley Soryu AKA The Second Child, did the same thing with Evangelion Unit-02. These were the second and third occurances of a Contact Experiment respectively, and the last two to ever occur.

Evangelion units can be piloted exclusively by children born during the second impact whos mothers souls had been merged with the Evangelion. There are five children focused on with this ability in the show, four of which pilot an Eva. 

Rei Ayanami - First Child - Pilots Evangelion Unit-00. 

Clone of Yui Ikari created by Gendo Ikari, The Widowed Husband of Yui and father of Shinji. Vessel for Liliths soul.

Asuka Langley Soryu - Second Child - Pilots Evangelion Unit-02. 

German pilot, moved to Japan because of talent for Eva-Piloting being discovered by Misato Katsuragi and Ryoji Kaji.


Shinji Ikari - Third Child - Pilots Evangelion Unit-01. 

Son of Yui and Gendo Ikari.

Toji Suzuhara - Fourth Child - Pilots Evangelion Unit Unit-03

Classmate to other children; chosen for seemingly random reasons other than simply being qualified.

Kaworu Nagisa - Fifth Child - Controls Evangelion Unit-02 via Angelic abilities.

Last Angel and Son of Adam, and Vessel for Adams soul. Sent to Nerv by SEELE to make contact with Lilith and cause the third impact. Claimed to be replacement for Asuka Langley Soryu.

Evangelion units were made to protect against Angels. Fifteen years after the second impact, Angels began attacking Nerv HQ in attempt to contact Lilith and start the third impact. A total of fifteen of the eighteen angels to exist post-second impact attempted the attack. For reference, a list of said Angels:

Seeds of Life:

1.Adam

2.Lilith

Children of Adam:

3.Sachiel

4.Shamshel

5.Ramiel 

6.Gaghiel 

7.Israfel 

8.Sandalphon 

9.Matarael 

10.Sahaquiel 

11.Ireul 

12.Leliel 

13.Bariel 

14.Zeruel 

15.Arael 

16.Armisael (Note: Killed with Spear of Longinus)

17.Tabris (Kaworu Nagisa)

Children of Lilith:

18. All Lilin (Homo Sapiens)

A Super Solenoid, or S^2, engine is an organ contained within the core of an Angel. It grants an infinite amount of energy to its user. After extensive research in German laboratories, blueprints for a Super Solenoid Engine were created, allowing mass production of Evangelions. Nine out of a planned 12 palette Evangelions were produced by SEELE with a synthetic S^2 Engine. Evangelion Unit-01 consumed the Super Solenoid Engine of Zeruel, granting it not only limitless energy, but also complete accuracy as a clone, making it equal to Lillith and Adam, though not a seed of life.

Gendo Ikari infused the DNA of Adam obtained back in the Second Impact into his palm, which kick starts the Human Instrumentality project, the ultimate purpose of SEELE, in an attempt to revive his wife. He fuses it with Lillith. Most life turns to LCL, the highly oxygized fluid used for eva pilots to synchronize with Evangelion Units which is called The Primordial Soup of Life, after fusing with Lillith. The Mass Produced Evas begin attacking Nerv, and Asuka Langley Soryu begins to fight in Evangelion Unit-02. Shinji Ikari is too scared to fight, afraid of death. Eventually, he musters up the courage to fight alongside Asuka.

When he shows up, Evangelion Unit-02 is dead, and Shinji realizes Asuka is too. He goes into a furious rampage, which triggers Earths Spear of Longinus, which was stuck in lunar orbit from being used against Armisael. The spear and Evangelion Unit-01 together trigger a planet-wide Anti-AT field, neutralizing the AT field of every living organism. Lillith absorbs the soul of everything on the planet. This is the third impact. The last soul to be absorbed is Shinji Ikari, he becomes like God and is eternally in control of everything. The ending poses a serious question about whether its better to be individual or be the same entity as everyone else.

Saving...

After all these years, I finally know.

I didn't think the reason that Shinji didn't act in time to save Asuka was because he was afraid of death, but because he felt that he could do nothing good without hurting others.  At least I thought that is what I read in the Red Cross Book, but I could be mistaken.

This is closer to the truth. I wrote all that stuff *right* after I finished Evangelion just so I myself could make sure I understood, so there are a few mistakes. If I have to explain Eva to someone again, I'll take this into account.

I always find it sad how many people can't seem to empathize with Shinji or Asuka.  The hell they endure throughout the series would be enough to crack well adjusted adults let alone 14 year old kids who've grown up from very difficult childhoods.

I wrote this a while ago, don't know where I got the idea that Adam's DNA was used to make EVA 01, but EVA 01 is definitely a clone of Lilith. I just checked, and it seems that it's every other eva that was based on Adam.

Other than that, great costume, the woman's reaction to it in the background is priceless and I like cookies. The end. :D
>> ARTICLE
I din't NSFW it. The mods must have. I don't think it is NSFW at all. As you said, bikini and many other pics show more skin. 
>> ARTICLE
NSFW means Not Safe For Work.  As in, don't click on this picture if you're at work.  Because if the humorless boss or perpetually-offended co-worker sees it on your screen, you might get fired.  I'm pretty sure this qualifies.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know what NSFW means, it appears to me that most people have forgotten what would classify as NSFW and you have proven my point. They show more skin when they wear a bikini and THIS is classified as NSFW? Yeah, I don't think so. lol
>> ARTICLE
You must work in an unusually relaxed place.  In most American office jobs, especially in large companies, looking at images of partially-exposed mammaries could get you fired.  Thus, this image is Not Safe For Work.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously? Wow, Here in Canada every job I have worked for would never find this to be inappropriate, at most people would ask why you are looking at it, you would explain it's cosplay and people would get on with their lives. o.O
>> ARTICLE
 To me NSFW means nudity. This woman was walking around in a packed public convention center with men, women, and children and none of them had a problem. 
>> ARTICLE
To me, "idiot" means "someone who disagrees with me on any point, no matter how insignificant".  That doesn't make my definition correct.

NFSW is a warning to not open this image at work.  The costume may be harmless at a convention, but if you click on it in a typical American office, you risk getting fired.
>> ARTICLE
It isn't that bad. If some one would get fired for this image, they would probably get fired just for browsing reddit in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how much she is being paid.
>> ARTICLE
Why would you think she's being paid?

>> ARTICLE
It's Meg Turney. She doesn't get paid to cosplay.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt she is being paid anything, unless of course she won the costume contest. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely "Mom of the Year".
>> ARTICLE
I dunno about that, there's still summer and winter to decide that, but I'd say shes definitely MOTS.

I heard mom painted this under the direction of Masaaki Yuasa, so it was decided she would be Mom of the Year before she even started painting .

Wow. That is beautiful. Did you do that yourself?
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, no I didn't, the designs were made (I believe) by the designer at [Canime](http://canime.co.uk/), they make really good prints on canvas from a lot of animes, I also bought a [Mushishi](http://i.imgur.com/0kxwmfc.jpg) canvas from them too. I found out about them at the last comic con in London :)
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's too late to revise my Christmas list. Damn. 
>> ARTICLE
I just checked their website out, thank you for introducing me to them!
>> ARTICLE
what is it exactly, a poster? a flag like thing? Both look gorgeous, and both  
probably my favourite animes, would love to have these

>> ARTICLE
They're actually prints on canvas, you can buy the Cowboy Bebop canvases separately here: http://canime.co.uk/index.php/store-gallery/random-sizes or alternatively save some money and ask them to put them all on one like me. I can't find the mushishi one, I would ask them about that one...
>> ARTICLE
I have to wonder whether they're licensed goods, since they have such a variety of anime prints. The inclusion of the Totoro print leads me to believe that they're not licensed though, because Studio Ghibli is notorious for not licensing and instead doing their own stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not from UK, can I ask if you have any ideas how much it would be if I ordered from the US? Assuming it has to go through customs and whatever kind of taxes exist. If you're not from the US I won't expect too much.
>> ARTICLE
They won't ship to me... I put like $400 worth of stuff into my cart then realized it's only UK. Damn it all to hell. 
>> ARTICLE
wow that's a bummer
>> ARTICLE
Email them, they might be able to do international delivery for you.

>> ARTICLE
Gosh that Mushishi canvas is beautiful. Some of the artwork from just the anime itself is so stunning. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the anime is awesome, everything seems like a handmade painting in it.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I just checked out their website and they have some really cool stuff! I kinda want the bebop set lol
>> ARTICLE
The set ~~isn't~~ on the website; email them and they may be able to make another print for you. This print was requested by myself; they were selling each character separately on canvas at the expo so I emailed them and asked for them to merge them onto one.
EDIT: The set is on the site but as single canvases 
http://canime.co.uk/index.php/store-gallery/random-sizes
>> ARTICLE
Wow that's pretty nice of them to offer that lol
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they seemed like quite nice people when I saw them in person :)

Thankyou so much I lost their website name, I bought two canvas from the Birmingham one, and I was looking to rebuy someday.

Hey guys, just a helpful comment to save you looking through the comments.

This is a print on a canvas I got from [Canime](http://canime.co.uk/), they do anime prints on canvas for decent prices IMO. 
The single prints are found here on their site http://canime.co.uk/index.php/store-gallery/random-sizes.

I requested to have all characters on one canvas as shown by emailing them: info@canime.co.uk 

I did not do any of these designs; so if you want vectors or anything you're gunna have to email them directly. 
>> ARTICLE
Is this 4 individuals or a single piece? On their store I only see the 4 individual.
>> ARTICLE
They were selling them individually at their stand at the comic con, if you email them they should be able to make one like mine as a single piece.
>> ARTICLE
thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I bought 2 canvas from these guys as well at Birmingham MCM. 

I bought a [Cowboy Bebop Spike canvas](http://i.imgur.com/ui9MTlh.jpg) and an [Eren Titan canvas](http://i.imgur.com/m37ry79.jpg) 

They're really nice quality as well. I managed to snag the two for 35, negotiated a price with the guy at the stall.

I recently watched Beepboop and thought it was great. The animation and fight scenes were so fluid. I have absolutely no qualms with that show. The best episodic series I have ever seen.

Does anyone know of an anime with similar choreography or fight scenes that rival Beepboop? If so please recommend me.

Also, thanks for posting these gifs, they hit me right in the feels.
>> ARTICLE
I just assumed because spelled it as Beepboop. Attack on titan has really great animations, you may have seen it because it is pretty popular.
>> ARTICLE
Just messin' around with that, it is what my friend calls it. And yeah, I have, loved it :D!
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo, Hip Hop+Chambara (samurai films).
>> ARTICLE
I assume that you don't really watch that much anime so I will recommend Avatar the last airbender. It is an american show so it will probably be easier to watch compared to other animes shows. I know that the animators for the show use footage of a martial arts expert and choreographer to do a lot of the animations in the show.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching Avatar for the first time yesterday, and it was a downright cringefest in the last book when everyone kept talking about their feelings the whole time.
>> ARTICLE
I have seen avatar over ten times. I also watch a tonne of anime, but I generally do not watch many actions. I just wanted a few recommendations for anime with fight scenes like cowboy bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Since Cowboy Bebop can be very different from episode to episode it's hard to me to figure out exactly to recommend. Maybe try some of these:

[Canaan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5356/Canaan)

[Outlaw Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/400/Outlaw_Star)

[Btooom!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14345/Btooom!)

[Darker than Black](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2025/Darker_than_Black:_Kuro_no_Keiyakusha)

[Mobile Suit: Gundam Wing](http://myanimelist.net/anime/90/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing)

[Wolf's Rain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain)

[Samurai Champloo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo)
>> ARTICLE
damn ive been meaning to watch wolfs rain again, i havent seen it since adult swim aired it.
>> ARTICLE
I would strike both Gundam Wing and Wolf's Rain from that list and add a few others.

Mostly because Gundam Wing isn't that good a show and that Wolf's Rain is more philosophical and less an action show.

Some others to add though:

Trigun

Birdy The Mighty

Kill La Kill

Gundam: 08th MS Team.
>> ARTICLE
Wolf's Rain is on the list because it feels a lot like the blues, jazz, and classical themed Cowboy Bebop episodes. The music in both series was done by Yoko Kanno as well.
>> ARTICLE
This is the response I sought! THANK YOU!
>> ARTICLE
If exciting battles are what interest you, Gundam Wing is not what you want here. 0080, 0083, 08th MS Team, G Gundam, and Unicorn are where you'll want to look for those.
>> ARTICLE
Wolf's Rain had the same screenwriter as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.

>> ARTICLE
Outlaw and Gundam rock!
>> ARTICLE
No love for 

[Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) ?
>> ARTICLE
ehhh maybe trigun

it has the same art style, that retro anime style
>> ARTICLE
not exactly the same, but do check out Space Dandy which is currently airing. same universe as Bebop (using same currency) and most people agree it's set in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Having the same currency doesn't really mean it's the same universe. It could just be another easter egg, Space Dandy is full of them.
>> ARTICLE
But that fridge man... that fridge...

Honestly it's just kinda funny to think it's the future of Bebop, and the easter eggs add to the funniness.
>> ARTICLE
Champloo's already been said, so I'll recommend Baccano. It's fight scenes are very fluid and have great style in them. Just know that Baccano is confusing as fuck for the first few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano is awesome, same team that did Durarara, another anime I can't stop recommending. 
>> ARTICLE
Second this. Baccano may start out confusing but it pays off at the end when all the plot points connect together. Its like Pulp Fiction infused itself with Fullmetal Alchemist and Goodfellas. 
>> ARTICLE
Well Samurai Champloo is made by the same person, with a blend of Hip Hop music and samurai culture as opposed to Bebop's jazz and futuristic/spacey culture. The fight scenes are super fluid and entertaining, and the show basically follows the same idea with a main overarching story sprinkled throughout a bunch of episodes that are largely independent of each other. 
Personally I preferred Champloo to Bebop, but both are incredible shows. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't the same studio, but not director, make Ergo Proxy? Though that is really different from Bebop and Champloo
>> ARTICLE
Can vouch for Champloo. Wicked yet familiar art style, equal parts humorous and awesome with some allusions to actual historical events (some creative licence taken). Thoroughly enjoy and recommend.
>> ARTICLE
CB and SC are epic. I was really drawn in by them. I'd love to see a followup to SC. Loved the theme songs too!
>> ARTICLE
Mugen and Jin have got to be some of my favorite characters in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I really dug how Mugen and Jin were polar opposites, order and chaos, but in the end [vague spoiler:](/s "order and chaos finally found harmony"). 

I definitely recommend Samurai Champloo, especially if you really liked Cowboy Bebop. It pretty much reverses the anachronisms. You got hip hop in the Edo Era rather than jazz in the Space Age. There's humor, there's depth, there's *fantastic* action (better action than Bebop, I'd say), and, unlike Bebop, this a journey with intrinsic purpose rather than a journey that only happens upon purpose. 

I think the two shows really complement each other in a lot of ways. Cowboy Bebop was a story of characters avoiding purpose and attachment, Samurai Champloo was, in some ways, the opposite. Here we have three people who otherwise have no purpose come together and avoid aimless pointlessness.

We also see similar themes as we saw in Cowboy Bebop, primarily in coming to terms with the past and... I guess the struggles of subsistence. 

______

Bottom line is that Samurai Champloo is a good show. 
>> ARTICLE
And then, if you enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, watch Sakimichi no Apollon. These three animes are in constant talk and dialogue between each other.
>> ARTICLE
The fight scenes, especially the ones against [Big time Spoiler](/s "Kariya, Sara, The Brothers and the Negoro clan")
>> ARTICLE
I find the lack of Jet disturbing.

Sorry if posts regarding one of the most popular anime shows within an anime community upset you. I'm sure you can find it in you to move past this.

It's an awesome show, always been pretty popular on here. But also lately people have been reminded of it since Space Dandy is currently airing and has the same director.

Best character definitely.

I loved cowboy bepbop has to be one of my favourites.

I guess the sign of a good show, is that it always leaves you wanting more.  The series and the movie I thought were great.  Love the interaction of all the characters and the fight scenes are some of the best I have seen.  Just wish there was more I guess.

God you say anything bad about Cowboy Bebop and you get downvoted.

I didn't find Cowboy Bebop to be that entertaining.  
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It certainly could have done with some rotation, perhaps with Samurai Champloo & Trigun.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hate it or anything, but I disliked the fact that there didn't seem to be a final main goal to work towards. Granted, I haven't got past the halfway point yet, but with few exceptions every episode was "fly around in space, try to catch criminal for lucrative bounty, back to wandering aimlessly in space again". I much prefer Samurai Champloo's approach where even if it's just as episodic, there is a start and end point, and progress to a goal.
>> ARTICLE
There is a goal, but it's hidden (kinda-ish). Bebop is more subtle than Champloo when it comes to that.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of stalled watching it past episode 14, the only thing so far that seems to resemble a plot spanning more than one or two episodes were the short glimpses into Spike's darker past, [namely](/s "his connection to Vicious"). But that doesn't really point towards anything definitive either. I think people have fond memories of it because it was probably really great to watch weekly, the action and music are kick ass and Spike can be deeply cool, but there's not much incentive to marathon or even watch more than a couple episodes at a time when doing so doesn't create the semblance of a continuous story that can get you hooked. That's why I prefer Champloo, in addition to the central characters. Spike is usually cool, but Jet seems to be more of a parent or even spousal figure rather than a friend. Not to mention Faye seems to be mainly just a freeloader relying on her sex appeal and Ed is an annoying brat who really doesn't contribute much to the story. This is all subjective, but Mugen, Jin, and Fuu simply work together better because they complete each other. Mugen is the brawns and impulse bravery that kicks the most ass, Jin is his perfect foil and perpetual friend-enemy that is the cool headed voice of intelligence and reason, and Fuu is the only one with any ambitions and can keep them together without them killing each other.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda figured you didn't get to episode 17-18. At that point, it starts showing a bit more about Faye and Ed, but yeah, until episode 24 it doesn't tie in anything. Though when it does, it's amazing. I won't tell you watch it if you don't want to, it's your own choice to make. Just make sure that you won't regret not watching it one day.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you say it all comes together with a great ending, then it's probably really worth investing in the rest of the series. I put it off not because I really didnt like it but because I was watching 3 or 4 other series at the time and it got left behind for a couple months. But I am in a bit of a dry spot at the moment in terms of shows I can marathon, so it's a good time to revisit what's put on hold. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand how you feel. Never could get past episode 2 or 3 of Black Lagoon. Might watch it one day (not finishing it haunts my dreams :( ) but for now, I'm gonna go through Bebop once more, start to finish.
>> ARTICLE
Black Lagoon gets much better at about episode 6. It's still all about the action, but the circumstances surrounding the action are more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Well, to each his own. I personally couldn't get into One Piece.

That last gif is amazing.

That last gif...damn...

It's so beautiful ;_;.

Instant classic :)

This show will always have a place in my heart.  Very few movies/books/tv shows have been able to make me feel the amount I did when watching the final episode.  It will be a long time until something lives up to it in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
I just dont get the Fuss about the Show im glad this was posted so i can talk to Watchers/Likers of the Show I started 2 Days ago cos of its Reputation im on 15th epi now the Show just seems Mediocre .. Nothing so great I finished Psycho Pass yesterday started it at sametime as Bebop but PP was better gripping to make it a continuous watch
>> ARTICLE
Report back when you finish the series. 


>> ARTICLE
Well still the same i completed the series and stand by what i said earlier
>> ARTICLE
Ok sure. To each his own I guess. 

I'd say that given when bebop came out there just weren't a lot of high quality shows around and it gained a reputation. Now there are lots of comparable or better series. 

Either way I think it still holds up and is a great series. 
>> ARTICLE
Ya i had the same thought its about the 'Time' it was aired  watching it then and now is just different and cannot be compared ..
>> ARTICLE
Will surely Do 
>> ARTICLE
I remember getting into this series by the film. My dad got it for me like 8 years ago on DVD and I loved it. Then, I found out it was also a full series like a few years back and decided to binge it recently. I'm only at like episode 13 at the moment, mainly because I also got into Kill La Kill and To Love Ru a few days ago, so I'm set for a while.

wasn't too interested until I saw the flying corgi. shit's cute y'all.

Probably the best of all time. If not, then top 3 at the very least.

what does see you space cowboy refer to? a scene or line?

Both, kinda. It's a very important part, and a big spoiler.

Is it bad that after watching every episode several times I have started to hate that show? I just can't stand it anymore for some reason. I will admit at first i thought it was a great show but now I just hate it.

This sub, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213338/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and [its list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=5000,&sort=user_rating,desc&title_type=tv_series), and [this list](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php) would like to have a word.

It's your prerogative to dislike the show, but to call out those who enjoy it so blatantly and criticize it with not even the slightest backing of your opinion is immature and rude. This sub is generally quite polite, and I think most of us would like to keep it that way.

We've all known Spike's fighting style was inspired by Bruce Lee. I'd say this fight was inspired by all of the old martial arts films. In the 00s we got so obsessed with shaky cam and visceral intimate crops. As it turned on the "grit" the less the action made sense. Only now are we starting to see the longer shots with a steadier camera. Skyfall had a great sequence in China with the assassin and John Wick.... Well that whole movie was a perfect example of this.

I was referencing the art style in general. From the 1998 anime, unchanged in impact even now.

I'm not arguing with the art style being great, but it does look much better in the movie because the budget was a lot bigger and the general production values of anime went up quite a bit from the 80s to the 00s

definitely one of the best anime movies

amazing movie from an amazing franchise

My childhood favorite. Used to stay up to watch it on Toonami every night.

Yup, they're similar but CB,in my opinion, is far better. I used to watch the 2 shows one after the other (Toonami aired them at the same time in Spain in the early 2000s) and that's the feeling that I got. CB I think is more Seinen and adult-atmosphered while Outlaw Star is more shounen-like and keeps it simpler for the story and general flow. Both are good shows to watch if you like sci-fi.

Thanks! I appreciate it. I don't really update my DA with my stuff often, and I usually only spend about an hour or less on most projects.

First off check out this post about the Bebop crew as a metaphor for a Jazz band pretty cool

http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2d02ie/cowboy_bebop_is_a_metaphor_for_an_actual_jazz/

My top 5 Episodes are probably: 

1. Asteroid Blues

2. The Real Folk Blues Part 1&2 (Gotta group them together)

3. Waltz for Venus

4. Jupiter Jazz Part 1 

5. Ganymede Elegy

Sorry i'm boring, I chose the serious episodes but those are the ones I love. 

Least favorites are probably 

1. Boogie Woogie Feng Shui 

2. Brain Scratch

What one of the biggest strengths in Bebop is it's music and how it incorporates it. No matter what that /r/anime poll says, Tank! will always be the best opening song in any anime. Not just Tank but I love all of the OST and it just blends into the story soo well. Bebop usually takes on their music not just as background noise, but as a character, as a crucial part in the story. Each episode is named after a genre of music or song and Bebop's episodic layout makes each episode (for the most part) its own independent story or almost its own song on the album that is Cowboy Bebop. 

Bebop's story about each members past catching up to them is also really good but one of my gripes is not alot of development on the end of the rest of the crew besides Spike. 

Anyway I think Bebop has survived and thrived because it is part of the few landmark anime that have redefined the entirety of anime making it an art form. Bebop is also the type of anime that is real enough and not too crazy that not even anime fans can watch it and recognize how great it is.  
>> ARTICLE
It was my first anime, it's has a special place in my collection, and damn; it's still got it. 
>> ARTICLE
I was never sure how to feel about the ending. Feel happy that Spike finally got the closure he craved, or sad that he had to leave his friends behind? Anyone else feel similarly?
>> ARTICLE
Spike even though he was the one who died in the end, had the best ending, he faced his past after running from it for years. Faye I find had the worse ending which was really sad. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea but the feels wet definitely real with that show!
>> ARTICLE
God, Faye finally finds herself with a group of people that accepts her and creates a sort of family for herself, something she lost decades ago. Then suddenly it all blows up in her face with Spike's decision. The ending of Bebop has always frustrated me. In most other dramas the characters are just beginning their lives, and regardless of the ending you know it's just an experience to learn from, more or less. But there's just such a fatalistic finality that comes to mind when I think of everyone's future. Jet's getting old, these may be his last adventures, and he just lost his closest companion. Faye's so emotionally damaged I can only imagine what her relationships are going to be like from here on... If there's one anime I've yearned for closure with, it's this one.

Thanks /u/Chetcommandosrockon for doing this rewatch and everyone who did write-ups everyday! A lot of the symbolism and themes would have gone over my head if not for you guys.

Could anyone explain the history between Spike, Vicious and Julia for me please? I didn't really understand everything from the flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much Kira4!!! As for Vicious and Spike they were both members of the Sydnicate who were proteges of Mao Yenrai (the dude Vicious kills in Ballad of Fallen Angels) They also seemed to be good friends showing them fighting literally side by side. Julia was Vicious' girlfriend who was also part of the syndicate who fell in love and Spike and they both had an affair. Before this they all three seemed to be good friends in the syndicate until the affair 
>> ARTICLE
Makes a lot more sense now. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Both Jupiter Jazz, and Ballad of Fallen Angels... Those episodes to me were just beautifully made from action, artwork, music. I listen to of all the Cowboy Bebop's OST and it's still key pieces of songs that makes me think of parts of an episode. Though the music is standalone great... It's just a very well put together show. 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously I can't think of another anime where its entire OST is just so good, sure there some good ones but I feel like Bebop's is the only where every song off it is just good by itself 
>> ARTICLE
Yoko Kanno also does Ghost in the Shell and Wolf's Rain. Both have some pretty good sound tracks as well and are worth a look.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching Bebop for the first time (I know, I know, where have I been all this time?). I was a little late to do the rewatch threads and a little busy with the end of the school year. Actually, with me graduating from college on Sunday, this has served as a really great note to end my collegiate career on. A reminder to accept the past, accept the future, and live in the present.

>> ARTICLE
I am a big blues and jazz player on the piano, and i came across this anime and man... it speaks to me. seriously. the composition of these songs was no small feat i can promise you that
>> ARTICLE
Yeah in his talk show, he said that before Sakamichi no Apollon, no one had shown characters actually PLAY the instruments as it is very hard to animate. Normally, in anime, they would cover up and avoid actually animating the artist playing the instrument. For this, they tried 3D models first but that wasn't good enough. So what they did was, they called musicians to their studio and asked them to play instruments. This was filmed and then broken down frame by frame. THIS is how they animated the scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I know. Its amazing, that was actually how i got hooked on K-on! While it might not have been the best, and neither the music, the scenes where they showed them playing was spot on. literally. In sync with the music, and perfect note, technique, its crazy
>> ARTICLE
And Sakamichi no Apollo!  He's still got it!

He's a very interesting director. Between Champloo, Sakimichi, and Bebop, they're stylistically very different, yet it's almost effortless how smoothly he manages the transition.

Yaya nujabes was amazing. I wish we still had em. :/ 

The series I really loved though. I was sad about the ending too. Let a lot open and we didn't get to have another one. Boo! The characters were amazingly written and developed and that made me happy. I grew up watching Cowboy Bebop and this was just a little reminder of childhood haha!
>> ARTICLE
Actually, this was his second visit to Singapore and he claimed it to be very nostalgic. He mentioned that the first place he had been to outside Japan was Singapore. That was like 20 years ago. SG inspired some parts of Cowboy Bebop (hence you see the multi linguistic sign boards in Bebop). Plus, Faye Valentine's hometown (in episode 24) has the merlion; simply put Faye Valentine was from Singapore.

Add to that, he was a bit camera shy. I could see his hand trembling a bit when he held the mic. His Japanese was simple formal Japanese. (with an N4, I could understand about 80% of what he was saying)

He also mentioned that some of his productions stopped due to lack of funds. Made jokes saying, "if any of you have rich parents, please let me know hahaha". Even though it was a joke, I could see the irony behind that. I expected him to be one of those rich director types. But apparently, he's more down to earth and simple.

Last night I was thinking how the internet would feel donating to a fund for him to make those halted productions. What do you guys think?
>> ARTICLE
Did you ever find out if he had a kickstarter...or should we contact him and help start one for him? :P
>> ARTICLE
Don't think he would want to do it himself. He seems too shy for those things.

We can try mailing Danny Choo asking about this.
>> ARTICLE
Okay we should do this! PM me and we can get this ball rolling :P

>> ARTICLE
Awesome. Sounds like a great guy. We knew that a cool mother fucker he had to be though, he gave us Cowboy Bebop. Haha

I would love to have him do a kickstarter thing!
>> ARTICLE
Considering the amount of money people on the internet have invested in things like kickstarter projects, I'm pretty sure there'd been a ton of people that would do this. I don't know how you'd arrange it so that the money goes directly to him though.

That is gonna be another issue. Might meet Danny Choo tomorrow. I'll see what can be done.

It's a fairly realistic story about a rock band. It follows a character's introduction to the style of music and his rise as he learns to play guitar and sing.

Watch the dub, the Japanese version is filled with Engrish.
>> ARTICLE
It's about a jr. high kid and his transformation into being more than a body in the background, mainly focusing on his being introduced to rock n roll and eventually playing and singing in a local band that makes good.

If you're as big a voice actor nerd as I am, it's fantastic. Greg Ayres is the lead, and Brina Palencia makes her debut in a huge way, what a voice.

The Japanese original is great for its ability to skirt copyright issues (there is a Beatles song used in the original that Funimation could not spend the $$ on for the English version), but the dub is excellent. Monica Rial is hysterical as the parrot.

>> ARTICLE
you could've put the name in the title. it's called [Terror in Tokyo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)

it looks great, far removed from dandy.. diametrically opposed to it with bebop at the center.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, someone already posted this before, under its title.  But that apparently didn't turn heads quite like "new animu from Cowboy Bebop guy!"
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The kanji doesn't mean Tokyo though.
>> ARTICLE
no it means echo
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. In this case the most literal translation, I think, would be Echo's Terror. I wonder why they named it Terror in Tokyo when the former sounds a lot more catchy lol.
>> ARTICLE
But alliteration makes Terror in Tokyo sound catchy too.
>> ARTICLE
I would say "Terror of the Echo" Is the most correct way to say it but Echo's Terror is good too. The no particle in Japanese attaches an association of what comes before it to what comes after it, so for example Shakugan no Shana would be Shana of the Burning Eyes, Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa is Nausicaa of the Walley of the Wind, Ore no Imouto, as in Oreimo, is my little sister, Shingeki no Kyojin is Giants that Attack. The word that comes after is always the main Idea, and the word that come before modifies it. I suppose you probably know all of this though, I learned it from anime before I started learning Japanese, its a pretty simple concept. 

Source: intermediate level Japanese speaker
>> ARTICLE
I  ;)

I chose Echo's Terror because Terror is the subject, not Echo, and calling it Terror of the Echo because when translating 'wordword', placement of the terms before and after the preposition is a little ambiguous in English. Plus, it sounds (to me at least) less catchy.

Source: beginner level japanese speaker.
>> ARTICLE
Terror is the subject either way. IMO Terror of the Echo sounds better because using an apostrophe has qualities of personification that you don't get when preceding echo with the word "of" or "of the" Thats why most of times you see Japanese to English translations In XY form where X has no adjective equivalent in English, it's translated Y of the X, provided X is inanimate. For example "sakurasou no pet na kanojo" is translated as "pet girl of sakurasou,"
"kaze no stigma" is "stigma of the wind," and "Kara no Kyoukai" is "Borderline of emptiness."

If X is animate you will most likely see X's Y. for example "Kuroko no Basket" is "Kuroko's Basketball", "Kino no tabi" is "Kino's Journey" and "Howl no Ugoku Shiro" is "Howl's moving castle"

if X has an adjective form, or is an adjective as well as a noun, you will usually just see "X Y". for example "gin no saji" is "silver spoon" and "garasu no kamen" is "glass mask."

Obviously there are exceptions to these rules based on context but 99% of the time this will give you the most correct translation. I don't think "Terror of the Echo" is and exception. 

>> ARTICLE
god damnit am i the only one that always thinks kyoukai no kanata when they see kara no kyoukai, i was about to say thats beyond the boundary silly then i realized I'm an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
no, I'm the same way because I saw Kyoukai no Kanata first. Kyoukai no Kanata is one of those exceptions that just translates funky. beyond of the boundary and beyond of boundary don't make a whole lot of sense. 

Kara no Kyukai also throws me off because kara is a very commonly used particle that means "because" or "because of" so I always think is "Because of the boundary"
>> ARTICLE
So the title doesn't indicate a setting, per se?

For this new anime, there is no mention of a place in the Japanese title, that doesn't mean its not in Tokyo like the English title says though.

I was kind of disappointed with Eden of the East. It started out pretty interesting, then it's sort of like they rushed everything and the story didn't turn out as good :(

Watanabe shows usually have a particular style of music to reflect the show's themes and atmosphere.

Anyone have any guesses as to what the music in this show will be like?
>> ARTICLE
I think it will be something orchestral and maybe choir.
>> ARTICLE
I hope its something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPtb7bV7jl4).
>> ARTICLE
Hell no.
>> ARTICLE
Lol I was only half serious. I'd be much more interested if it was just dramatic opera/classical music.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect more modern, perhaps electronic music to match the urban setting. Although, the PV's music seemed quiet to emphasis a feeling of dread - so, I think there'll be selective use of music. I think silence works well to build tension in certain scenes, like contrasting with an explosion.

Yoko Kanno again!  ;)
>> ARTICLE
This makes me happy in pants

FUCK YES
>> ARTICLE
Awwwwww shit son this gon be good!
>> ARTICLE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA im so happy
>> ARTICLE
You have no fucking idea. A good soundtrack can be the difference between a meh anime being good or great for me. Yoko Kanno has consistently delivered that kind of music: soundtracks that embody the atmosphere and emotion of many of the works she is involved in.
>> ARTICLE
The only reason I watched bebop as a kid was because of the music.  It was the reason I got into anime in the first place.  Your words speak truer than most.
>> ARTICLE
If anyone hasn't seen it yet, check Kids on the Slope. Another great show directed by Watanabe with music from Yoko Kanno.
>> ARTICLE
One of my most favorite series, hands down. Beautiful anime all around. 
>> ARTICLE
pls no moar tears ;~;

So many bromance tears. Seriously though, A+ show, A+ tears.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes!  Kids on the Slope is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
How strong are the homoerotic undertones? I'm hesitant to go into a josei anime especially if it's like that. Not because I'm homophobic, but  because I know I won't be able to connect to the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I saw none. I watched it and viewed their friendship as, well, a friendship. Same way I'm friends with my best friend.   
  
Then again, I view Kuroko no Basuke the same way; everyone are good friends and teammates. They strive to win and support one another because that's what you do on a team, especially a team comprised of your best friends.  
But apparently many people view that as yaoi instead. So maybe I just can't "see" the homoerotic undertones as...well...as others. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it a when it aired so don't remember it too well, but iirc they get most of the they-cannot-be-serious homoeroticism out of their systems in the first episode.  

If you like the premise beyond that, I think it's a decent show, but I expected more out of the last few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
None that I remember, but bro-mancy. The main characters are handled well as teenage males, and not teenage males with anime characteristics.
>> ARTICLE
Very slowly, we are seeing more smart phones in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of people in Japan love their flip phones. It's just market differences, right?
>> ARTICLE
I see Japan as a sort the Galapagos islands of technology. Its insular nature and isolated culture created a different "breed" of technology, through a form a divergent evolution. Flip phones are a good example. Or Minidisc.
>> ARTICLE
And I think the Japanese really like the large ass smart phones like the galaxy note.
>> ARTICLE
Phablets are popular across Asia, not only Japan. Phablets may be most popular in Korea.
>> ARTICLE
I went to Japan recently. Due to how much cheaper it is to get a cell phone in Japan, people often own two: smartphone and a traditional flip phone. I tried to figure out the advantage of this, ie why they still liked and used their old style ones as well. I didn't get much more than apparently they like some of the features that they allow them on those unique Japanese networks (that required me to get a separate phone due to compatibility issues.) I am still not totally convinced but I will have to research more... Btw those old Japanese flip ones were/are pretty sweet for their time. Pretty much a smartphone before real smartphones came along. Japanese bought phones based on features rather than slimness and style like Americans preferred in their dumb phones back in the day. Dem Japanese flips were big, blocky and ugly, but mad tricked out. 
>> ARTICLE
Flip phones can be used with one hand (like in the subway when you have only one hand free) and they're much better _phones_ than smartphones are.
>> ARTICLE
Good point. They were designed specifically for use on Japanese networks.

Perhaps a show concentrating on domestic terrorism? It kind of looks like it...hmm.

Check out Ghost in the Shell if that interests you.

From [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror):
>A bomb exploded in the heart of Tokyo. The terrorists are two teenagers and call themselves "Sphinx." Now they launch a huge game that involves the entire Japanese population.
>> ARTICLE
?!??!?

yup, I'm in.


 sounds like Stand Alone Complex, but for present day.


>> ARTICLE
I read the game part and instantly thought of East of Edin
>> ARTICLE
Sounds "Death Note-ey" 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was my first thought too.
>> ARTICLE
So Samurai Flamenco has to save the day?
>> ARTICLE
Their evil plan is probably not silly enough.
>> ARTICLE
hey! you have to be super evil to buy all the apples in the market before everyone else 
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of excited for this until I noticed the "launch a huge game that involves the entire Japanese population." Maybe I'm expecting too much, but a series focusing on the sort of crazy or embittered people who'd commit terrorism for some political or religious goal would have been very original. Unfortunately, that premise reminds me too much of *The Dark Knight* Joker-esque actions - cool, but not relevant to our current global situation regarding terrorism. 
>> ARTICLE
It sounds like a pretty generic plot now, but all we have are two sentences and a 30s trailer. Watanabe and Yoko Kanno collaborating again is enough to put this at "casually optimistic" by itself.
>> ARTICLE
Terrorism for a political/religious goal might be a original thing in anime, but it's too common in other media for that to be more interesting than the game scenario they're going with. 

Then again, you might be right. I just realized I too quickly generalized terrorism to like middle eastern stuff which doesn't interest me all too much.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe, but death games are also ridiculously popular in anime, too. I don't see how a game premise would be preferable to one dealing with real-world terrorism. Although, either of those will still need competent staff to be good (given that Watanabe is on the staff, though, I'm not worried :P)

And yeah, I feel you on the second thing. That's why I'd love to see *domestic* terrorism being explored. Japan's had a recent history of that stuff - the 1995 subway Sarin gas attacks and the Aum Shinrikyo in particular - and so seeing how a Japanese director would make a show about terrorism would be interesting.  
>> ARTICLE
Mawaru Penguindrum had some references to the Sarin gas attack. Good show, domestic terrorism is (kind of?) a topic in there. Closest anime I've seen to that theme anyways. Won't say more in case that leads to spoilers.

And even if death games are an overused topic, I'm pretty open minded and feel it can be well done, like Mirai Nikki. As long as it's not a rip off and they somehow make it into an original mind screw, this could be fairly exciting.
>> ARTICLE
Penguindrum is kind of an exception.

Well he's not really making Space Dandy, every episode has their own directors and writers (which is why they're all so different) he has the final decision on every episode, but for the most part it's other people playing with the world he created.

I know its done A LOT in tv series.    
I think its a brilliant idea though, think of a concept and then let some good writers and directors in anime do something with that.

Fair points, I actually didn't realize it was a real building, which was stupid of me.  The buildings definitely aren't identical but the nature of the smoke, flames, and the way it's situated in the poster certainly evoke 9/11, whether intentional or not.

> (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy) 

one of these things is not like the others
>> ARTICLE
Uh
>> ARTICLE
Are you saying different stylistically?

Because Dandy is still made by Watanabe
>> ARTICLE
No, Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo have O's in them, but Space Dandy doesn't. duh
>> ARTICLE
Much like Cowboy Bebop but not Samurai Champloo or Space Dandy, this show's English title (Terror in Tokyo) contains O's but no A's. Cowboy Bebop 2 confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy use Woolongs for currency.

They also share a fridge.

In Space.
>> ARTICLE
So is it going to have an overarching plot or just be episodic like Cowboy Bebop and Champloo are?
>> ARTICLE
The PV looks absolutely excellent, seemingly on par with Shinkai standards of animation, barring a different style of course, everything looks so real and detailed.   

If the format is different than Watanabe's other works, (ie not episodic), which it looks like it will be; than I have really high hopes for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for the other writers, but Dai Sato, who has written for Bebop, Champloo, and Space Dandy, said he won't be working on this show at a Q&A this past weekend. So that sounds about right.
>> ARTICLE
Well, "Michiko to Hachin" and "Kids on the Slope" weren't episodic but were really good. 
>> ARTICLE
AFAIK, he was just in charge of music on Michiko to Hatchin, which was just as episodic as Bebop and Champloo.
>> ARTICLE
I felt it was more serial, especially towards the end. And you may be right about the music thing. Sorry! 
>> ARTICLE
Ah that's true! I always forget that Watanabe did Kids on the Slope. 

Though, it was adapted from a manga, but you could really feel his direction.

Wait, what was the name of this Anime in English and what's the release date, if any?

any news on if the dub will be released concurrently as with Space Dandy?

It's called Terror in Tokyo and will be airing in the summer (starting in July)

Holy crap. Cant wait

I wonder (and really hope) if Toonami will pick this up right away like they did with Space Dandy. Watanabe has a huge fanbase here in the U.S.

It's Watanabe, I'm sure it will.

Hope so, i've loved every one of Watanbe's works thus far, even Space Dandy which seems generally unliked around here.

I love space dandy. I think the hate is because people expected it to be as great and deep as his other works, which it's not. But that doesn't make it bad. :[

I agree, its been a fun ride thus far. Dandy is just so....dandy. In space..

Combing the galaxy like his pompadour, on the hunt for aliens. <3

I still gotta get to space dandy. It seems like fun stuff.

It's definitely fun stuff, just dont expect it to be as deep as Bebop, it's purely comedy. Still fun and a couple episodes hit the feels

Watanabe + Yoko. What more could you possibly want?

so wait.  all the power goes out, but the cell phone towers are still functional..?
>> ARTICLE
The plot wasn't really upfront with this trailer. It also seemed to appear very unexciting and insipid I would say. Though of course I still look forward to how it truly is.
>> ARTICLE
I have not seen Space Dandy, but I have seen Bebop and Champloo.  Is Dandy worth it?
>> ARTICLE
yes it's funny, perhaps too. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't expect dandy to be like either of these. Dandy is just something to watch for fun, it's nice to watch once a week, like a sitcom. I'd watch it on toonami. After next Saturday, their  rerunning season 1 so that would be the perfect time

looks like death note with a cell phone

Wait, so the second season of Space Dandy and this are gonna run at the same time!? O_O

Looks like a death note durarara hybrid

The guy is a genius. But it's going to be hard for me to love anything more than CowboyBebop.

This looks nothing like that I was expecting it to look like. Very different to his past works in my opinion.

Still haven't watched Space Dandy but will sure as hell be checking this out the moment it becomes possible to.

I really love that I spent a few years wondering just where on earth Watanabe has been and then he just roars back with Kids on the Slope, Dandy and now this. IM SO GOD DAMN HYPE.

I'm surprised everyone's so bent out of shape. If he does something more a la american psycho with this it could be good. Kids on the slope was pretty good, ending was poop.

looks dope as hell not that space dandy old bull

Oh no, please not.

Its going to be popular and regarded as good simply because of watanabe. It doesnt matter whether its shit or not.

Ohh snap

The animation looks like psyco-pass. I wonder if we can expect something similar.

>Anyway after the first episode, discussion on each episode after has dwindled only to a few

This is actually pretty normal for most rewatches, they get a ton of support when proposed and the first episode or so, and then the discussion posts dwindled to only a handful of people. Things like the Code Geass, Evangelion, and FMA:B are somewhat rare for keeping a large amount of people interested. Of course other factors do affect rewatches like hype, time they are posted, episodes himself, and amount of other rewatches, but on average most die down after the first few threads. I don't think option 2-3, ending or pausing it, is the best because most people that are keeping up with it will probably just finish the show and then not be interested in the discussions when they resume, instead of putting the show in hold and waiting on the discussion threads. Moving the time might help, but it may just be that not as many people have much to say with the current episodes. Going up as the same time as Code Geass shouldn't matter that much, people that are taking part in both probably would watch the episodes that day no matter when the thread went up. Changing the time would be the easiest thing to change and see if it has any effect though. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the last two options should be considered...I'm following the rewatch, and i'm just waiting for the right episodes to express my opinions . Just keep in mind there are a lot of lurkers here!
>> ARTICLE
like me :D
>> ARTICLE
Same
>> ARTICLE
I know it's a pretty poor way of tracking anything's popularity, but the threads are still getting a relatively high number of up votes despite the lack of comments. While I was also a little disappointment regarding the discussion of episode 3, episode 4 isn't an episode that warrants much discussion. I take notes while watching anime and I still can't come up with anything worth writing publicly about episode 4. I would recommend giving it a few more episodes, at least two, before making a conclusion. That being said it is college exam season (at least in the states) and there are a ridiculous number of re-watches out there. To address your comparison with the Code Geass RW directly, they are significantly farther along in their story than we are and I would expect that has more to do with it than the time slot. With all that being said if you do choose to end the RW I would understand.

In a completely unrelated note, if you continue the RW, please link to the previous episode when you create an episode's thread. It's a lot easier than going through your profile or bookmarking them all. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you considered that most schools in the US have finals at about this time? Perhaps it should be postponed a few days.
>> ARTICLE
I myself was originally planning on joining in the rewatch but between the amount of series I'm already watching this season (like 15 most of which ive already dropped or put on hold and am behind on all of them) and gaming I just didn't have the time.

Rewatches typically only keep an active discussion if they are incredibly popular on this sub, normally Cowboy Bebop would fall under that but due to the large amount of series people are interested in airing this season it's not. Even High School DxD Rewatch had 20+ comments on average an episode which really surprised me. I guess it's cause we're all perverts.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I'm the guy who started and is currently holding the Code Geass rewatch. Sorry that you had to deal with the lack of discussion in your threads, getting mix up with your threads and mine really dwindled the amount of people who are willing to discuss the show in its entirety. I'd say just move it to a different time because I'm following the LotGH rewatch, and even though I don't post on those threads, the time they post the threads are pretty much a very well made idea, being midnight for me.

It also depends on how you comment on other peoples post on the rewatch threads, when you have a bunch of people writing walls of text and you pretty much ignore them, the people who do post those will be discouraged and the amount of responses will dwindle as well.

Anyways, good luck on your rewatch, hope that it becomes more successful than it is right now in the future.

#***JIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***

I never saw it but now that I know I'd participate. 

EDIT:  All ideas to postpone til finals are over is smart. Probably why I haven't seen it. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been following the rewatch, just haven't been commenting on threads. Like /u/FoxFriend said, there are a lot of lurkers here!
>> ARTICLE
I've been stuck on episode 12 of bebop for a while now, so I was glad when I saw Rewatch was happening. I plan on joining in when the rewatch group gets to ep12, and while I don't tend to comment on discussion threads very often, I look at them every day for anime I'm following, so I hope you don't cancel it. I'm sure that other people like me read through the thread every day without conundrums as well. :)
>> ARTICLE
I think it'd be best to call it a day. The only two rewatches that kept a decent following are Code Geass and Evangelion (Brotherhood rarely broke twenty after the halfway point).
>> ARTICLE
Also Gintama which was solid for 250+ episodes
>> ARTICLE
One thing I've noticed in both the Gintama and Code Geass threads is that the first time viewers responded to each others' reactions, leading to a lot more activity overall. Not sure how often that happens for the other shows.
>> ARTICLE
Legend of the Galactic Heroes has a pretty strong following so far.
>> ARTICLE
we'll see how long that lasts. the show runs for 100+ episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have much to add other than agreeing that we keep going at least until the series really gets rolling and see if discussion picks up.  Mostly just because I'm having fun with this, so I hope it catches on.
>> ARTICLE
it's because of finals. postpone it for a week or two i think might help.
>> ARTICLE
Viewership dwindling is unfortunately common for all but the most popular anime (Code Geass). I'm hosting the Monster rewatch and it's got like 2 people that actually comment at this point, which is unfortunate but I don't really mind. It's a small community of people that watch and I enjoy reading what they say. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been able to watch the last couple of episodes because of school work, so for that I'm sorry.
>> ARTICLE
You might want to post this in the bebop sub too, it would probably attract more discussions 
>> ARTICLE
it is state?
>> ARTICLE
You could try combining episodes instead of a daily episode discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I think this would work better for a show with arcs and not like Bebop where almost each episode would be able to stand on its own. who knows though? I've never taken part in a rewatch here but if I had  seen it before there is no way I could start it and watch one episode per week like I do my currently airing ones. I would go insane!
>> ARTICLE
I cannot tell you how very jealous I am...

You better keep those safe somewhere. Those are priceless items.
>> ARTICLE
Would you still be jealous if you knew Yoko Kanno is a [plagiarist?](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=154599)

That information tainted my image of her personally.

EDIT: Why the downvotes? Not saying she's a bad musician in any way; she's just not the creative genius people take her for.

EDIT2: This post seems to have caused a lot of controversy. To those downvoting, realize I'm not trying to be a dick here--though my first comment comes off as a bit dickish. I'm shedding some light on someone we all admire to add nuance to our image of Kanno. I asked myself one question before I posted this: Is blissful ignorance better than facing a difficult reality? For the sake of growing up, I say no.

EDIT3: [**Compilation of the similar songs**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOy3AuB5PtI) so you all judge for yourself. I'm not a Kanno hater, and I feel calling her a plagiarist is overly harsh. She's composed too many solid, original scores to be bluntly called a plagiarist--to be **defined** as a plagiarist. That being said, I feel strongly that some of her songs are so similar that not calling it plagiarism is self-deception. The truth is: She plagiarizes but is a talented musician and composer nonetheless. 

**TL;DR** We should admire her, not lionize her.
>> ARTICLE
Say it ain't so!

I'm disappointed to read that she may well have been a plagiarist, and as a fan of her music, I'm very saddened.  The only way my hopes in music in anime will be shattered is if Yuki Kajiura turns out to have stolen music too...
>> ARTICLE
Like Picasso said, "Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal". Besides, if Led Zeppelin can get away with it, nobody else can say anything.
>> ARTICLE
Off the top of my head, "[Bad Dog No Biscuits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuAzPR0ACVw)" sounds pretty similar to Tom Waits' "[Midtown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwMtQ4sDpD4)".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as a jazz musician I can testify to this. Most of the jazz from bebop consists of contrafaction; new melodies but borrowed chord changes. 

Pretty damn cool melodies, though.
>> ARTICLE
Jealous of the discs? 

Yup, still jealous.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call her necessarily a direct *plagiarist*, they sound very similar yes, but she puts her own style on things. Hell, most of the music from Sakamichi no Apollon IS her doing just that
>> ARTICLE
True, but a lot of people seem to place Kanno's music on a pedestal. She adds her own spin on things, yes, but that doesn't mean she deserves to be lionized as much as she has.

She's not a Beethoven generating musical brilliance out of thin air; there are others that deserve a part of the overwhelming credit she's gotten.
>> ARTICLE
Beethoven wasn't a Beethoven generating musical brilliance out of thin air, either.  Not to say that Kanno is equivalent to Beethoven, but every composer in the history of music has cribbed to one degree or another.
>> ARTICLE
I'm completely fine with being inspired and making similar music. What bugs me, however, is that calling some of Yoko Kanno's music merely *similar* to other songs is an understatement. To put it gently, she borrows too heavily from some songs; to be more blunt, she flat out plagiarizes.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, I've gotten home and had the chance to listen to the linked tracks...  Yeah, that's definitely well beyond what even well-known "cribbing" composers take from other songs.  And if I criticize John Williams because the Star Wars soundtrack sounds a bit too much like Holst, I can't not criticize Kanno for this.
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean she's a plagiarist. And according to that thread you linked, she's given credit where it's due. Sometimes beats can sound similar, it's a side effect. That example with "Pushing the Sky," I could tell the beat was somewhat in rhythm but as a whole it's a distinct song. Whether you think it qualifies her as a prodigy or not is more subjective.
>> ARTICLE
Beats can sound similar, and I'm fine with that. Hell, tons of melodies sound alike, and I'm okay with that too. But with some Kanno's music, almost everything is the same-- melody, rhythm, vocals, the entire structure of *some* of her songs feel ripped.

Take this [brilliant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBfYXE098bA) Kanno piece for instance. Starts off with the catchy chorus; the high vocal melody creates a wonderful ambiance. Then, this sick percussion line pops in and makes you want to move. This song makes you think Kanno's a musical genius.

Now listen to [this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZuArYiXpkM)
Starting off is a similar chord progression-- a similar feel. Hardly offensive. Then at around 25 seconds, this sick percussion kicks in! Sounds similar... But hold on. Kanno's piece still has that signature high vocal melody. So far, this song's just sorta ambient instrumental music.

And that's when the vocals kick in.

When I first saw this comparison, I felt shammed: Every cool part of Kanno's song is in a song made years earlier by Hooverphonic. Her song is *not* distinct. It's a remix, or perhaps a cover of Hooverphonic's Battersea. What bothers me is that it's called Cyberbird, by Yoko Kanno.

>> ARTICLE
I have to say, those feel like two completely different songs with the lyrics. The violins may be somewhat reflective, but even then I don't see much more than an inspiration there.
>> ARTICLE
It's not violins that I'm pointing out, though. "Reflective" is fine. I'll say it again; both songs are almost entirely the same. Same vocals, same drums, same everything.

> I have to say, those feel like two completely different songs with the lyrics.

I might be confused here but it sounds like you're suggesting the other song doesn't have lyrics at all. If so, listen to the hooverphonic song again. They are extremely similar.

If you're referring to the actual lyrical difference, I'd say you're stretching a bit. Yes, one has russian(?) lyrics and the other has English. But the vocal melodies are basically the exact same.
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I agree. Cyberbird is actually in a made up language btw.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she even sources where the original is from though. It's different from cover songs, it seems like she tries to pass it off as her own. Just listen to the instrumentals (not the vocals) of this one:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLv9Q5hQ_Dk - iMogen Heap Song

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XESreJjGx-I - Lithium Flower from Ghost in the Shell

Even though I like Lithium Flower more, no denying where it came from. She has TONS of her other songs that copy like this, a lot from Imogen Heap specifically 
>> ARTICLE
well, she has good taste. Has she been in a legal battle ever? If not she puts enough spin on something to make it hers. Was everything released after the original song. Anyways, songs inspire.

I'm sure you could find songs from today that sound like songs from yesteryear.

>> ARTICLE
I think the show thinks so. The characters all do illustrate certain viewpoints about life and especially about their pasts. While their are flaws with all the character's viewpoints (illustrated in their behavior and fates), Vicious's flaws are especially prevalent - his beliefs ultimately lead him to being a destructive force, benefiting no one but himself (and even then, that's debatable).

Personally, I'd agree with the show - life is at the end about creating a narrative for yourself and who you are - an identity. Believing in nothing is a terrible foundation for an optimistic, self-affirming narrative, and to me, the benefits of such a narrative outweigh the benefits of any other narrative. Sure, sometimes you may look foolish, but you will always be out there, doing your thing, and when opportunity finally knocks, you'll be there to answer. The man who believes in nothing is far more likely to be sitting at home, entertaining himself, because what else matters besides those chemical spurts of pleasure?

There are beliefs out there that are substantial, spiritual (although I hate the term), and consistent with the scientific facts of life. Find them; at least one will work for you.

It does wonders to manage people's expectations, I shall concede on that. But it also leads to a certain... apprehension. 


Standoffishness, if you will, given that by asserting that Ayn Rand is right you encourage others to engage in the opinion that you are wrong regardless of circumstance.  In other words, any opinion you endorse will automatically be discredited since, by implying that supporting that opinion is tantamount to supporting the views espoused in *atlas shrugged*, *the fountainhead* etc. As a result anybody who disagrees with Ayn Rand will be more likely to go against your position.


Now is this an accident on your part? Or is this a potent weapon indeed, given that simply endorsing a position is sufficient to discredit said position in the eyes of many others? I guess it all comes down to how you intend to wield your account; as a naive attempt at public honesty or as a means by which to subvert your enemies or opinions you find disgusting and abhorrent enough to try and destroy them?

Not a lot of people commented on the last thread so Ill be trying to get some discussion going in the later ones, unfortunately this episode isn't really the best to start since it isn't that much of a "big" episode but ill still give my input. 

* This episode is very much an action and world building episode. The space gate, terrorists, politics all revealed expanded upon in this episode.

* We see faye once again and this time she works with the Bebop crew. 

* Some of the best animation and spaceship fighting occurs in the Space gate fight. One of the more fun and intense moments in the earlier episodes 

 The Episode tomorrow will hopefully spark some more discussion being one of the first big story episodes and one of my personal favorites, be sure to join in tomorrow!

I love that shot of the space station with the killer jazz in the background, so damn good.

If anyone is feeling unsure about this show, I implore you to at least watch episode 5, which is where it really starts becoming a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably my least favorite episode in all of Bebop. I feel like the entire purpose is to flesh out some of the universe around the (close to established) cast. Elements like explaining the space gates, some of the governments of planets and how the crew interacts with each other. 

That being said, Episode 5: Ballad of Fallen Angels is one of my favorite episodes in not only Bebop, but in all the anime I have seen to this date. 
>> ARTICLE
I would have to agree, although it certainly still is watchable (it's not bad). The thing about Bebop that guarantees I will enjoy every episode, regardless of anything else, is the sound track and the choreography. This episode is kind of lacking those two things though. Don't get me wrong I like the hyper space scene, but this entire episode lacks any ground based action (we don't get to enjoy Spike dodging anyone). The sound track is also surprisingly quiet. Except for the Space Warriors "ad", the very beginning of restaurant scene, and the fight sequence, this episode is musically silent (there's a drum beat in the scene after they capture Faye but it's honestly boring and equalized out). Compare that to Wild Horses (e19) in which the music basically won't shut up, particularly in the second half. Bebop could over come this by a compelling stand alone story line that world builds. Usually Bebop does this with gusto by writing single session characters that feel complete and fleshed out, doing so arguably better than any other television show I've ever watched. This episode's villains are, well, not so fleshed out, especially compared to other characters we've already seen in only four episodes like Asimov and Katerina in Asteroid Blues (e01).
>> ARTICLE
Just started watching this today, great series even though I tend to despise the older style of animation, this show seems so ahead of its times even to today. So many characters and worlds
>> ARTICLE
faye really makes herself at home at the end of the episode there...
>> ARTICLE
After they close the hyper gate and Faye still sees the missiles fly at her and freaks out for a second, Jet asks "Didn't you pay attention in school?" And goes on to tell her matter closed in hyper space can still be seen by the naked eye as it passes by on its natural route.  

Anyone think this is foreshadowing to Faye's past?  How whether or not she paid attention while in school she wouldn't have known regardless due to obvious reasons
>> ARTICLE
good catch! Never really thought of it like that but it could be true
>> ARTICLE
Well break out the tissues, no offense to the rest of the show but the best Bebop session has come and gone. I've never made it through this session without some tears and never will.

(I know /u/watashi-akashi has already covered the Urashima Tar legend and did a fantastic job doing so, but I already wrote this so...) As someone who is totally ignorant of Japanese culture, every time I have watched this session Jet's opening story as been difficult to understand. Jet is telling Ed the tale of [Urashima Tar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urashima_Tar%C5%8D), a man who saved a turtle and is rewarded with a visit to Ryg-j. He is also given a [tamatebako](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamatebako) as a parting gift. To the unknowledgeable viewer, this gigantic hint makes absolutely no sense. In addition the segway to the parcel delivery is also so well done that we don't notice that Ed is literally calling the parcel, brought on a drone with a turtle logo, a tamatebako. All of this tells us exactly what is going to happen in this session three and a half minutes in, including the intro! As told by Jet around 14:40, the tamatebako makes Urashima Tar into an old man. The beta tape is Faye's tamatebako, and by watching it she is going to become an old woman no matter what she may look like or remember. Urashima Tar opened his tamatebako, even though he was warned not to, because he couldn't adjust to a world that had advanced three hundred years without him and Faye is in the exact same boat. However don't forget that the tamatebako was a gift. This beta tape is a gift, no matter how sad it may be. Faye is getting a pep talk by her biggest fan, and I think that counts for something and changes Faye for the better moving forward. That all being said I'm not Japanese, so to the show's intended Japanese audience this story could be well known and come off heavy handed. I just simply don't know.

The song that opens the session is *Adieu* sung by a male vocalist. This is clearly an homage to our final session *The Real Folk Blues* which also begins with *Adieu* albeit a different version. Perhaps I'm taking it too far, but I believe this is the series signalling that Speak Like a Child is cut from a different crop and on the same echelon as our fantastic finale, but we'll get there later.

I also have to add here that [The Egg and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6N1_GJAyFw) may be my favourite walking around music of all time. It makes a mundane montage scene a lot of fun.

Does anyone know if the final scene where Faye is watching her past self on tape is original to Bebop? Or is it a reference to an earlier work? Not only is it my favourite moment in all of Bebop, but the exact same formula is used to create my favourite scene in Adventure Time as well.
>> ARTICLE
> (I know /u/watashi-akashi[1]  has already covered the Urashima Tar legend and did a fantastic job doing so, but I already wrote this so...) 

Hey man, just so you know, you did a way better job than I did with the folktale. I was mostly focused on the last sequence and the comparison between this session and My Funny Valentine and why this one worked and the latter didn't. The folktale was something I only looked at for a short while.

On the other hand, you absolutely nailed it. You managed to compare the fisherman to Faye, a link that eluded me but seems obvious now that you've pointed it out.

The whole parallel is very fascinating to me as I've yet to find the correct approach that really makes everything fall into place. The tape being the Tamatebako is pretty straightforward, but what would you say is the Bebop equivalent of the treasure hidden inside?

In the tale the Tamatebako contains his old age, or in a different light, his loss of youth. I'd say the tape contains Faye's past, or from a different perspective, her loss of identity. 

It's a fascinating comparison. The folktale is pretty famous in Japan from what I've read, but the moral of the story seems unclear or at the very least confusing. 

Btw, completely agree on the Egg and I: it also played when Ed was walking on the prairie in or previous session, making his strange antics pretty funny. 
>> ARTICLE
For all the parallels the show itself draws between the legend and Faye's story, it purposefully doesn't parallel in other areas as well. To our fisherman the treasure isn't a treasure at all. At least from the version on Wikipedia, he doesn't appear to get anything good from his old age. This is because he is warned not to open it, much like Pandora's box. Faye receives no such warning and this is why I think the beta is in fact a treasure and not a curse. Now to your actual question, what exactly is this treasure? Well I left that vague for a reason because I'm not entirely sure. [Spoiler](/s "We get so few Faye moments from now until she get's her memory back that it's hard to say, and I don't think any interpretation has enough evidence to say anything with certainty. However we get some clues. If memory serves this is the last episode in which we see her gambling, and we have enough episodes after this point for me to say with some confidence that it's a character shift and not just the show running out of time. She also mentions her debts in Brain Scratch. While nothing truly jumps out at you, I think Faye starts to give up on nihilism after this episode. Before this episode nothing was really worthwhile for Faye. Why get close to people if they're just going to betray you? Why not gamble away all of your memory with such a large debt hanging over your head? Why not run away when things suck? Sure she's doing it in baby steps, and she's still the Faye we've always knew, but Faye is trying to improve her life going forward because she wants to become something worth believing in. That's something that wasn't true before.")

[](/s "While this is a totally useless speculation since her memories return, I think Faye would've eventually left the Bebop without the video. I think she would have kept leaving like in Jupiter Jazz and one time Jet wouldn't be able to find her, or maybe Jet would learn to move on a quit looking. I'd like to believe that she and Jet stay on Bebop for a some time after Spike dies. Maybe they all move on and go their separate ways, who knows! But if Real Folk Blues, and Bebop in general, says anything it's that moving on is hard.")

Good point. I thought about it some more: maybe the point of the Tamatebako isn't so much that it is a treasure, but more that it must be treasured. That would make sense since the origami cube itself falls apart upon opening. 

So in the tale, he is told that the Tamatebako will protect him from harm, meaning he should treasure the thing, and that he should not open it. Considering the little box contains his old age (future), he's in fact told to treasure his life.

Now if we look at Faye and apply the same analogy, she should treasure her Tamatebako, which is the tape. The tape contains her younger self (past), meaning that what she should treasure is her identity. 

This also fits in nicely with the cheers she gets from her younger self: her younger self says 'Don't lose me!', which we can interpret as cheers for her future self, but also as encouragement not to lose herself. 

As for your [Spoilers](/s "Like I said in my post, this moment is a turning point for Faye. All of the things you said are nice little hints to the fact that she's finally dealing with her past, finally finding herself. I'd like to throw in some more: in Pierrot le Fou, she actively pursues Spike because she's worried, the first time she's doing any chasing of her own IIRC.  The biggest hint of all is in Hard Luck Woman: she repeatedly rewinds the tape to try and figure out the things in her past and this is before she regains her memory. From this episode on, she's actively persuing her past and her goal, the thing that gives meaning to her life, instead of just cruising aimlessly. Like I said before: alive vs. living and this is where Faye starts living instead of staying alive.")

[](/s "I don't know if Faye would have left the Bebop, but I do think she would have started searching for a place to belong. Whether the Bebop fits her criteria, who can tell, but especially after Real Folk Blues that seems unlikely. It's hard to say for sure, but I'd like to believe that Faye and Jet would have gone separate ways in search of what gives their life meaning: for Faye it's an identity and a place to belong, for Jet it's a family.")
>> ARTICLE
I never thought of the tamatebako like that, and I basically agree. I thought the tamatebako was simple but effective symbolism for situations in which whatever needs to be valued cannot be put back once it is released. Something like age, death, knowledge or other intangible things. Urashima Tar cannot return to his youthful state. Faye cannot forget what she has witnessed. Since it is inherently a treasure box whatever is inside the tamatebako should be valued, just a tamatebako is used instead of a normal box due to the etherial nature of what is inside.

[Spoilers](/s "You bring up much more convincing evidence than I remembered. You're point about Faye now living is certainly convincing and well written. I think that there probably is enough evidence is say it's true. Even ignoring the evidence this is definitely the feeling the show is giving with Faye. Faye's story doesn't ever take step backwards so it just makes sense that this is a step forward and not sideways.")

[](/s "As for the speculation, you're probably right on Faye's point. We see from the extraordinary long package forwarding list that Faye is more than willing to move around in order to find where she belongs. With Spike dead the Bebop will always have an uncomfortable hole for her. As for Jet, well, there's a reason he let so many hobos on his ship. That was his family. It wouldn't surprise me if he never settled down with a normal family and kept on bringing strange faces aboard the Bebop. Yet then again Spike's death is pretty traumatizing. Even Ed and Ein leaving had to hurt the Black dog. Perhaps it's all traumatizing enough that Jet moves onto that next part of his life. Now that I write it all out yeah, you're probably right, the Bebop's day is done.")

> Well break out the tissues, no offense to the rest of the show but the best Bebop session has come and gone. I've never made it through this session without some tears and never will.

Really? I'm just wondering why you think that, I find later episodes like Hard Luck Woman and Real Folk Blues to be more emotional
>> ARTICLE
(I didn't mean this to turn into a long rant, especially about something so trivial as which episode is better. All four of these are great episodes. I need to work on my brevity. That being said my opinion is probably rare so here's an explanation.)

I didn't mean to take anything away from those two episodes, especially Real Folk Blues. There's absolutely nothing wrong with finding those episodes more emotional. It's all personal preference. For whatever reason video messages from a past self always work on me, no matter the show. Honestly this episode could've been poorly done and it would still be my favourite. I mean to take nothing away from Spike or Jet's stories, but I like Faye's better because it surprised me so much. Ten or so episodes into my first watch she kinda didn't have much of a point and wasn't progressing enough as a character. Yes there are many hints that she is complex early on, but you can't be sure that the show is going to give you a satisfactory payoff. She could be there to fulfill the boob quota and they were simply giving her a few subtle complex character traits so you didn't get bored with her. Boy could I have not been more wrong. It's Faye's total turn around as a character that makes her moments that much better for me.

To go into those two episodes in detail [Real Folk Blues Spoilers](/s "Real Folk Blues doesn't churn up much emotion for me. While the ending is exactly what Bebop deserved and the ending it should've had (I would've been disappointed by anything else), it is fairly telegraphed as is Spike's story as a whole. It's a fairly classic love story presented masterfully. My biggest sticking point is that it's difficult for me to buy Julia as a character. She works very well in the past to define Spike as a person and give him motivation, but in my opinion she's mythical to work as a character effectively when introduced so late. She's both idolized and condemned more than any character deserves to be in Spike's memories because that's how lost love works. If you've read Atlas Shrugged, she reminds of me of that that one awful character who is also introduced late, although she isn't even close to being as egregious. (I know that's vague and obscure but I don't want to spoil Reddit's most hated book and I can't think of as good of an example in the limited number of anime I've watched.) I think the show does the best it can with her, the structure of the story has just put the show in something of a corner. I want to stress though that just because Julia doesn't work as a character for me and that I didn't feel sad when Spike dies doesn't mean I don't love the finale. I do love it. Real Folk Blues is a satisfactory conclusion for me. I didn't feel sad or overwhelmed by emotions, but just simply satisfied. It's the perfect end to our ride.")

[Hard Luck Woman Spoilers](/s "As for Hard Luck Woman, the episode's thematic structure hurts itself. Faye and Ed are purposefully put in parallel, but their stories return very different emotional reactions for me. To me Ed will always be Ed. I like her, but I have absolutely no emotional attachment to her. It felt right for Ed to leave at that juncture and so it wasn't a sad thing. Spike's reaction to Ed's message on the Bebop is pretty great though. As for Faye, regaining her memories was emotional. Should I like her story in this episode more than Speak Like a Child? Probably, but Ed is center stage and so my emotional reaction is disjointed. Speak Like a Child pours out all of it's emotional payoffs at the exactly same time through a method I am very biased towards. The ending of Hard Luck Woman also ends to the tune Call Me Call Me, which, while very suitable for the episode, isn't a sad song to me.")

**'In your time, I'm no longer here, but... I am here today. And I will always be cheering for you, right here. Cheering for you, my only self.'**

Today's session marks the end of what I call the Super Solo Stretch. And we end it on the highest note out of all of them and one of my favorites. 

The opening shot seems random, but really isn't. It's not just an introduction to the character's whereabouts, but also (as one should always expect with random Bebop shots) some great symbolism: in this case it's a quick representation of how you can have everything one moment, then lose it all the next. Why the shot is there in the first place, well, we'll see that a bit later in the session.

Anyway, the crew is on Mars for what I assume is a day off and Jet briefly delves into a famous folktale, one which includes the Tamatebako. Now, I think the entire reference went over most people's head here (including mine), since it's a Japanese folktale and us Westerners aren't really well-versed in those, are we?

So I was curious and did some research and what I found was pretty wonderful. The tale goes like this: a fisherman (Urashima Taro) rescued a turtle at sea which turned out to be the daughter (Otohime) of the Emperor of the Sea (Ryujin) and was rewarded with an invitation to his palace. The rest is told by Jet: he stays at the beautiful palace for three wonderful days and decides to leave, for he was longing for his home. Upon leaving he was given the Tamatebako, which is in fact an origami cube that can be opened from any side, but falls apart upon opening, making it very hard to reconstruct. The fisherman was told not to open the Tamatebako, but upon returning to his homeland, he found that 300 years had passed and his home was no longer his home. Depressed and overwhelmed by grief, he eventually opened the box and instantly turned into an old man: the princess of the Sea tells him with a sad voice that the box contained his old age and that he should have listened. 

Now, the parallel here is not to the folklore and its message, but specifically to the Tamatebako itself: it is a representation of the loss of something precious that cannot be recovered. 

Yeez, we're not even three minutes in and we're already top heavy on the symbolism. Apparently the episode thinks that to, so it sidelines the heavy stuff and switches to a humorous, lighter tone. A tape is delivered for Faye and Jet is forced to pay for it; what ensues is him trying to recoup the cost at first, but it devolves into a search to find out what the hell is on the tape. 

In contrast to our previous Faye session, the humorous tone here actually works, mostly because Spike and Jet's hijinks are quite simply hilarious. Some highlights are Spike being as impatient as a child with opening packages, their comments on the Betamax tape, Spike's umpteenth display of his, ahem... *strained* relationship to technology and of course the entire trek through the ruins of a department store, which is superbly capped off by it having all been for nothing. Luckily, a second package arrives, the actual Betamax player, with Jet again being forced to pay because of Spike's curiosity. All of it is pretty damn funny and lures our attention away from Faye, who returns from her gambling and immediately settles into some familiar quarreling with Jet, as the mood radiates 'life on the Bebop as usual' and the crew settles in to watch the tape.

What follows is a staggering punch in the gut and in my opinion the most poignant sequence in all of Bebop.

As soon as Jet utters his last line, the entire mood turns 180 degrees: it slowly shifts from comfortably familiar, to painfully delicate. Everything here is done perfectly. First off, the reaction shots of Spike and Jet: they start off happy and gung-ho, but by the time younger Faye is halfway her message, all of that is gone and replaced with the realization that they are watching something unblievably intimate and personal, and that they should never have seen it. 

Speaking of younger Faye, whoever voiced her in the dub gets all the gold stars. Her delivery combined with the imagery and the soft piano notes convey all of the things that Faye has lost so achingly well. Innocence. Shyness. Enthusiasm. Genuine happiness. With each line and passing moment I felt worse and worse for Faye. This only gets worse when we see the look on Faye's face soften, the pain and tears in her eyes grow as she utters that she can't remember. 

The final twist of the knife comes from the line I quoted and it is the worst blow of all. We all lose some of the aspects mentioned in our journey to adulthood, but Faye lost something so much worse. She lost her personality, her identity: she literally lost herself. And to see and hear her younger version say that she'll always be cheering on her only self, the one she lost, is about as heartbreaking as it gets.

The entire sequence never gets easy to watch and it was at this moment that Faye became my favorite character. At the start of Bebop, I couldn't stand her selfish, uncaring, aloof personality, but by the time this episode is finished the facade has crumbled to dust: what lies beneath is the most hurt member of our main cast. It is a testament to Bebop's quality that they managed to turn the tables on her character and they're not done yet, as this is the stab in the heart Faye needs to move on from the place she's been stuck in since being thrust into this harsh world.

... fuck, I rambled off again, didn't I? I'm sorry, this shit happens when I really like things, I can wax on and on about them. Luckily you won't have to expect another rambling wall of text tomorrow, as tomorrow's session is one of the weaker standalone efforts.

Some of my favorite moments from this episode 

* Spike opening both of Faye's packages right after Jet said he was going to return them 

* Spike not giving a fuck and kicking that guys Beta deck

* [Yes this is dog](http://i.imgur.com/LAPd1FC.png)

* [Movie time!](http://i.imgur.com/b5cl9ci.jpg)

* Now the most important part of this episode, the video was of Faye before the space gate accident and her younger self giving her words or encouragement. Probably one of the saddest parts of an episode seeing her react and saying , "I can't remember" before the episode ends
>> ARTICLE
This is such a good episode, and I always look forward to it every rewatch, because it not only has some of my favorite moments, but kicks off the home stretch in my eyes
>> ARTICLE
I agree every time I rewatch and get to this episode, I realize it's all going to end (again) soon
>> ARTICLE
It's a sad feeling, knowing it is ending, but it is great to see such a strong run of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I knew I loved this episode but after reading everyone else's posts on here, I love it even more. The symbolism in the beginning is great. Both scenes right in the beginning of the episode tell us perfectly what will happen as they both relate directly to faye. 

Also found it interesting that Faye was disappointed/upset they went to earth and left her after she ran away on her "disappearing act."  Her attachment to the crew is only growing stronger. 

The episode gives us a good bit of comic relief. I like to think of it as the calm before the storm. Because no one is ready for the weight bebop is going to drop on us at the end, but trust me, you're going to carry it.

Ah yes the episode [FMA Spoilers](/s "where we meet Selim Bradley, aka Pride. I kid, but the likeness is far too uncanny for me to believe it to be a coincidence. FMA rips off Wen, but did a damn good job of it. I have no complaints.")

* Soundtrack is on point. Outside of the final shootout in the clearing the entire soundtrack of this episode is pure harmonica. Wen's instrument of choice is, non-coincidentally, the harmonica.

* Spike is right handed. In prior episodes and at the beginning of the first shootout with Wen Spike is using his pistol in his dominate right hand. However Wen gets a clean shot of Spike's right arm during the fight. Therefore for the rest of the episode Spike is forced to use his pistol in his left hand. Despite this Spike still gets two head shots on Wen, one of which was very difficult. Spike's a badass no doubt.

* I love the exposition scene where Jet explains how Wen has gained what is basically immortality and how the stone can take it away from him. I usually have issues with shows that have a lot of sci-fi elements that are impossible in real life because often the show will desperately try to explain every element in excruciating detail as if whatever is going on is truly possible. Let's face it, this exposition isn't well done and comes off as a bunch of bullshit, but both Spike and Jet admit that! By Spike and Jet both admitting to not being able to understand the mechanics behind Wen's immortality, we as an audience can also accept that it's not something we're suppose to fully understand and is in fact a bunch of malarkey.

* ~~I have a minor issue with the dub in the beginning of this episode. Spike tells Jet at around 3:48 that Jet was "A baby hipster; very cool." The sub is "You were a pretty thoughtful kid." I understand how these expressions mean the same thing, but the dub is immersion breaking. Spike saying hipster threw me off.~~ Everybody read [/u/phd_trand's](https://www.reddit.com/user/phd_trand) comment below. I have been thoroughly schooled in etymology.

Ooh, I didn't notice the left-handed thing until you pointed it out.  Something did seem significant about the scene where he aims.

I also didn't notice this- puts the scene in a new light! 
>> ARTICLE
About the "baby hipster" line, I don't think it was immersion breaking at all. The original term, 'hip', was coined in the 40s as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing jazz scene. Although the adjective's exact origins are disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for opium, while others believe it comes from the West African word hipi, meaning "to open one's eyes".

Nevertheless, "hip" eventually acquired the common English suffix -ster (as in spinster and gangster), and "hipster" entered the language. The first dictionary to list the word is the short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", which was included with Harry Gibson's 1944 album, Boogie Woogie In Blue. The entry for "hipsters" defined them as "characters who like hot jazz".

I can understand why it could throw you off, but you have to remember that this anime came out before the term hipster changed in meaning to how it is used today. I prefer the "baby hipster" line personally because it adds to the jazz theme.
>> ARTICLE
After reading your comment it has become clear I was ignorant of the history of the term. I actually was taking the age of the anime into consideration; the phrase particularly bothered me because I didn't understand why Spike would be using a term that I thought only had developed this century. I was clearly wrong. I have updated my original comment accordingly.
>> ARTICLE
Great analysis. First-time viewer here, watching dubbed (since I've heard it's better). I actually prefer Spike's "baby hipster" line over the sub alternative.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely 100% personal preference like all sub/dub arguments. I guess I just pointed it out because it was the first line I've noticed that seemed out of character for subbed Spike to say. The one thing I will say is that so far I have gotten a different vibe (not a bad thing) from Steven Blum's dub than I did for Spike's Japanese voice actor (I've watched subbed but this is my first time watching it dubbed.). While I think Blum's acting is excellent, his Spike comes off to me as a little younger and more of a "cowboy" if you will. Blum's Spike has more energy in non-action sequences.
>> ARTICLE
One of the better non-story episodes IMO. Although this episode can't really be categorized as non-story as some important details about the space gate are revealed and how their was an accident that caused many to die. 

* Wen's harmonica soundtrack very great and a good showing of Bebop's western roots in its soundtrack

* Spikes chase with Wen and shoot off very well done animation 

* Wen finding peace with death and asking Spike if he understand and Spike responding "As If"

* "Bang" 
>> ARTICLE
So, I just discovered the rewatch, I actually finished the show this weekend right before this started, which is nice timing. Shame I didn't discover it sooner, there were some nice highlights in the past episodes I would have liked to discuss. Oh well, at least it's here now.

Anyway, today's episode works *WAY* better in retrospect, that is to say, in rewatch. There is no character development present, but there is a theme at the end. Problem is, that entire message at the end goes over our heads at first watch, but when viewed a second time, we come to understand the meaning behind all of it. 

Soundwise, there are no real standout moments like there were in the past few episodes, however, the highlight to me was the great shot of Wen ahead of the flames which links up perfectly with the title of our episode: he is the devil we should sympathize with, of course, but somehow the sympathy part never really came for me at first.  

Overall a somewhat middle-of-the-road non-character arc episode, that gets lifted upon rewatch. 

Tomorrow's episode gets my vote for worst episode of the series btw. Oh well, can't all be gems.

"We girls are different.  We have to be pampered because we're delicate and refined." *scarfs down dog food*

Wen's aging scene reminded me of Indiana Jones.  Only creepier.

A lot of theme stuff has already been talked about, but let's not forget the first scene.  Spike is on the operating table having his fake eye put in before he jolts out of the memory.  He's obviously got some heavy stuff in his past that made him who he is.  [Spoiler] (/s "The fake eye is also mentioned in the same episode as his last bang to refer to his past.")

From what I gather, Spike liked the story because that's how he wanted his life to turn out. But it's just that, a good story.

I don't think Spike believed he could achieve a happy ending at that point. Just as the story and the happy ending isn't real, his life aboard the bebop wasn't real either.

It was a good story, a happy dream. And now it's time to wake up.

It's a bit of a sin to talk about Bebop and not mention it's absolutely mindblowing OST.  Ilaria Graziano's Pearls is probably the highlight of the soundtrack (for me).  Such beautiful vocals accompanied by a somber piano.

Regarding the MC comparisons, I wouldn't say Gene by himself is much stronger than Spike.  Spike is much better written than Gene and as a result is more consistent as a character.  Gene and Jim together, on the other hand, are a very strong duo.  They play off of each other surprisingly well.

Looking forward to the other two WT! threads.

[](#thumbs-up)
>> ARTICLE
[Fuck...](#facepalm)
>> ARTICLE
Haha, bit of a blunder there, but the WT! is still great.  My personal opinion on the three soundtracks is that all three fit very well with their shows, but Bebop's soars above the other two in terms of memorability (is that even a word?).  

True to Outlaw Star's image, the soundtrack feels like space exploration.  It does have a few very western-esque songs, though.  Freedom is a pretty neat harmonica jam with a side of electric guitar.  

Trigun has *a lot* of electric guitar (and steel guitar!).  I'd say Trigun's is the most strangely composed.  electric guitars, synth sounds, bongos, etc.  All mixed together to make a rather unique OST.  All three soundtracks deserve their own independent listen to really appreciate them, but be warned that that's about a 6 hour undertaking.  

Also, wanted to make you aware that I did edit my previous comment and add a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the soundtrack in Bebop is just too good to forget and is probably the best overall...yet somehow I did forget it...

And I saw your edit, hopefully I can live up to expectations.

For the last two days we had more [WT!] threads than for the whole previous week! Good thing, more recommendations definitely won't hurt.

Your recommendation is good, however... Let's assume I haven't watched any of these three series. Than this comparison would make little sense to me, because I'm not familiar with them and don't really know what you're talking about. I think that with [WT!] threads we need to try and appeal to the widest audience possible, no matter what shows they've watched or not. I like your comparison section, honestly, but I think you should've emphasized anime's strengths and weaknesses in vacuum, without direct comparison in many points.

Anyway, solid thread, looking forward the other two!
>> ARTICLE
As far as I can tell, only 2 of the 6 comparisons make direct references.
>> ARTICLE
Always open to criticism and after re-reading it...it really does seem like I alienate new comers a lot... 

Reason I did do the comparison section, especially for Cowboy Bebop, is that majority of /r/anime has already heard of everything that makes Cowboy Bebop great, heck you can see the things I completely forgot about in the comments. I wanted to try something a bit different by showing how it stacks up against the two others, seeing what I think makes it better and what makes them worse. Unfortunately as you noted, I alienated new comers with the assumption everyone has heard of the three, so for Outlaw Star/Trigun, I may consider getting rid of it or trying to implement it a better way.

Thank you for telling me your concerns, hopefully I can improve on them next thread.
>> ARTICLE
You won't believe how many people haven't watched it because it's an 'old' anime and doesn't look like UBW, actually. So I would not say that everyone has watched it. Which alone makes me sad.

Fantastic WT! for Cowboy Bebop and I told you that you had nothing to worry about!

Actually, Outlaw Star is probably more similar, from it being a space western, them finding a girl in a container at the very beginning, she being a huge part of the whole plot, and ~~the title of the show being the name of the ship~~, but that'll be for tomorrow's discussion.

I dunno, bebop in general is a lot more moody than firefly. 

In firefly with the exception of Jayne they all work together pretty well and want to be on the ship with each other. In bebop they're all stuck with each other through little choice of their own and have to try and make ends meet. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe in tone, atmosphere and possibly pacing (Firefly is waaay too short to really come to a conclusion on this), but definitely not style or dialogue.  Bebop is too entrenched in Jazz and Film Noire to even reach the levels of Wild West that Firefly achieves.
>> ARTICLE
Firefly is significantly episodic.  Outlaw Star is significantly not and sticks with the main story arc throughout except for like 2 episodes that are more filler than anything.

In terms of style I view OS as a very shounen-esque main character-centric action adventure show.  The other characters influence the plot, but strictly as side characters.  CBBB has a lot more focus on different characters and their backstories and individual plots, with the different characters driving their own arcs to a significant degree.  In retrospect, Firefly is probably only halfway between the two and not particularly leaning towards CBBB in this sense, since Mal is heavily involved in all the arcs, even though the arcs are heavily driven by the other characters.

I think the main part where Firefly aligns with OS is the *premise* and setting in terms of the space powers etc.  Which is what I would consider the "jazz and film noire" vs. "wild west", although I agree that those aspects of the style are significantly different.  In retrospect, the term "style" itself is probably too vague and abstract to be useful.

In terms of dialogue, OS is mostly shounen stuff with some exaggerated and over-the-top lines and whatnot.  CBBB has more serious seinen-esque dialogue with deeper themes and character drama, similar to Firefly.  Maybe this bleeds over too much into tone, but /shrug.
>> ARTICLE
> Firefly is significantly episodic.

This is definitely true, and the only reason I said otherwise is that had Firefly gotten a thorough running we might have seen more of an overarching storyline come through in the same vein as the movie.

>I think the main part where Firefly aligns with OS is the premise

It's important to note where each story draws inspiration from.  Firefly draws *heavily* from the post Civil War Restoration era (which is also when most westerns take place as well), whereas Bebop is drawing from 1930's-1950's American gang culture (much like the film noire it's based off of).  The only similarity I can see between the two is space travel and Chinese, but all 4 (Bebop, Firefly, OS, Trigun) all have space travel to some degree.

>dialogue

This is pretty true, but you might be giving Firefly more credit it than it deserves.  They can get pretty immature in their dialogue for comedy relief.

But honestly, it isn't really worth dwelling on too much.  All of them share something in common in one way or another.  For instance, despite their differences, all of them still qualify as Space Westerns.
>> ARTICLE
Ah alright, but still, I'd say if it Firefly is similar to Cowboy Bebop or Outlaw Star, definitely not a bad thing.

Right, I got them mixed up...been a while since I saw it...
>> ARTICLE
Haha no worries, just thought I'd mention that
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you can't call yourself an anime fan until you've seen Cowboy Bebop
>> ARTICLE
I saw some of the episodes but couldn't really get into it. I was fond of its spiritual successor Samurai Champloo.
>> ARTICLE
I like Samurai Champloo a little bit more, but I think they're both great. Unless you really hated Cowboy Bebop, I would recommend finishing it. It's one of those iconic anime that everybody should watch in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
What an antiquated notion.

[](#kukuku)
>> ARTICLE
I only saw cowboy bebop because of Steve Blum old boy is a great VA
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop's dub is excellent.
>> ARTICLE
So dub over sub?
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen a little bit of the sub but from what I've heard you can't go wrong either way. Go dubbed if you prefer watching in English or try watching the first episode both ways and see what you like more.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks i'll give both a shot
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, Bebop is the exception to dubs sucking. The japanese VA work is great, but so is the dub. Try 'em both because you can't go wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say dub, IMO Cowboy Bebop is one of those very few anime where the dub is best
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Watanabe himself has said he prefers the dub if I recall correctly.
>> ARTICLE
There are three dubs that I find better than the original Japanese voices: Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z, Cowboy Bebop, and YuYu Hakusho.
>> ARTICLE
O wow all shows that aired on toonami. But that wouldn't have anything to do with your feelings.
>> ARTICLE
Toonami's had bad dubs too. Rurouni Kenshin, One Piece, Attack on Titan, Zatch Bell, most of the Gundam series... It's not really Toonami so much as it is the shows.
>> ARTICLE
I would also like to add Baccano! to your list. 
>> ARTICLE
I have not watched Baccano yet. Guess I'd better get around to that one.
>> ARTICLE
Bacanno is amazing and i remeber watching the first 2 or 3 eps subbed and the main reason i switched was because the story line was already somewhat hard to follow at the start and the dub would make it easier to follow
>> ARTICLE
If you ever do get around to watching beck watch it dubbed the subbed is bad so bad it hurts but mainly because they switch to engrish a lot and the songs all seem off but what im really saying is watch beck its awesome!
>> ARTICLE
They even did all the songs in English to which is pretty awesome. 

But yeah I heard the sub and the Engrish is strong, also anyone who supposed to be native English speaking has over the top accents. 
>> ARTICLE
I've gotta say the Code Geass dub is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly a lot of whether I'll find a sub good or not is the amount of Japanese culture that's in it. I'm sorry, but hearing Japanese names pronounced by a native English speaker hurts most of the time. 
>> ARTICLE
i agree.  the dub also fucked up karen's name and left it as kallen.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see a problem if they're pronouncing it right. Yeah it reflects their accent, but who cares? In Code Geass' case, a good deal of the characters are Britanian so they have english names. Whats the difference between a Japanese person pronouncing a English name versus the other way around? It could really go either way.
>> ARTICLE
kallen/karen. 

in code geas,  is spoken in english (and subtitled) as "kallen", whereas in bakemonogatari,  is subtitled as "karen".  it makes way more sense for the girl in code geas (who is half british) to be karen instead of kallen than it does for the japanese girl living in contemporary japan to be karen and not kallen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's probably a mistranslation just like Aeris and Aerith in FFVII, but I don't see how that affects the show. The Britanians do have some unconventional names such as Lelouch, Euphemia, Rolo, Cornelia, etc. If anything it makes it fit a little more.
>> ARTICLE
euphemia was actually a great name for her.  consider: euph(oric), meaning very happy.  also e(phem)eral, meaning short-lived.  anso no weirdness with l/r or v/b due to phonemic difficulties.  cornelius is actually a pwoerful name with a storied history.  lelouch is french for 'the decadent man".  you may be right about rolo though, no idea what's going on with that one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying they're bad names, in fact they're perfect for the characters like you said. It's just that they're unconventional names because they live in an empire that doesn't exist.
>> ARTICLE
I would include FLCL in that list.
>> ARTICLE
I second this. Another one where they got the voice actors spot on. 
>> ARTICLE
Dubbed. Steve Blum's voice acting for Spike is too good to miss.
>> ARTICLE
Although I prefer animes subbed, Cowboy bebop dubbed is an exception.Steve Blum did an amazing job voicing Spike Spiegel and helped fulfill Spike's personality with his "butter to my ears" voice.
>> ARTICLE
Dub. Even the creator of the anime said he preferred the dub.
>> ARTICLE
What does that matter though is my question. Yes I understand it's a testimony to the quality of the dub, but that shouldn't factor into whether you should watch it or not.

What if OP doesn't like the dub? Should he ignore his own preferences because the creator said that the dub was excellent?

I just...I just don't see why that actually matters in terms of whether *you* liked the dub or not. 

You shouldn't blindly choose one or the other because of someone else's opinion or preference. You listen to their *reasonings* and then you make a decision. What is more important than the creator's preference are his *reasons* for the preference. An argument in which there is only the conclusion without evidence is useless.

Another example that I could think of was when people were debating which Final Fantasy was the best. Final Fantasy 9 came up and one of the arguments was "Even Hironobu Sakaguchi (the creator of Final Fantasy) said that Final Fantasy 9 was his favorite". So? Why does it matter? That's not an argument, that's just stating someone's else's stance. 

EDIT:Formatting
>> ARTICLE
Except in literally every corner of the internet everyone has come to the conclusion that the dub is better. Don't need to make a big hoopla over a little comment. You almost never see an ANIME director say he prefers the dub.
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a source for that? I was under the impression that he liked the dub but not that he thought it was better. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a source either, but I can confirm I read an interview that corroborated his story.
>> ARTICLE
Can't find it exactly, it was somewhere in a space dandy forum/interview. 
>> ARTICLE
dub, Steve Blum as spike. that is all you need.
>> ARTICLE
Dub all the way. The english VAs' voices seem to fit the mood and the archetype of the characters better. It's in that zone where they seem like the voices the characters would actually have. Did I mention the VAs are actually pretty good? It's like they actually tried, unlike most of the other dubs. 
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is the only anime I'd recommend dub over sub.
>> ARTICLE
Dubbed, I've grown accustomed to the show in english. I would expect a lot of people here have. 
>> ARTICLE
Shows that western inspired are the only shows that are pretty clearly better dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
They are both excellent. It might be because it was one of the first anime series i ever watched but the Dub is by far one of the best I have ever encountered. The voices actors are absolutely perfect for every single character.

So in my personal opinion Dub over sub. And I don't say that much.
>> ARTICLE
Can't go wrong with the dub in this case. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly.

Just watch both and determine which one you like better man. Watch and episode with dubs and watch an episode with subs. I'm not saying like half of the series in dub and the other half in subs, I'm talking watch a single episode with each and see for yourself.

Ultimately all of our opinions don't mean shit because what matters most is what *you* think about it. A *lot* of people say that the dub is better than the original, but what if you're one of the people that think differently? There is no way of telling, so the best thing for you to do is to not listen to us and just watch both and see for yourself.
>> ARTICLE
I only ask because i wouldnt really mind either just want to know what is generally considered better i did end up watching it dubbed im 5 eps in and i am enjoying it so far.
>> ARTICLE
One of the 3 anime I watched dubbed and enjoyed it more than sub-Cowboy Bebop
-Baccano!!
-Yu yu hakusho
>> ARTICLE
I may be late to the party, but I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one that thought Baccano's dub was stellar. Ladd Russo was pretty amazing, and while fast talk works in sub as well, (I.e. tatami galaxy) English lad works so well.  Yu yu, I'm less in love with, but that's mostly due to kawabara. 

Back to the original point though, Steve Blum is always great, no matter which anime.
>> ARTICLE
bebop, baccano and black laggon have a really good dub as far as I know. I watched code geass dubbed and it was also good. watch it dubbed if you feel like it.
>> ARTICLE
Black Lagoon has a good dub? I've only ever seen it subbed, so I may have to find the dub. Thanks man.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to add Helsing (and Ultimate) and Fullmetal Alchemist (and Brotherhood) to that list. Yu Yu Hakusho was great (the Funimation dub). Soul Eater was  too, but I accept I am partial to it because of Stein and Death the Kid.
>> ARTICLE
I almost never say this, but Dub. Bebop's is excellent, Steve Blum as Spike is perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Dub was very well done. In my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Dub vs sub debate. If you like how the dub sounds, watch dub. If you like to watch it sub, watch sub. Debate end. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it subbed then dubbed. After watching the subtitled version, the dub voices didn't seem to have the same quality. FWIW. 
>> ARTICLE
Looks like it's time to buy the bluerays! Do I even care that I already own the remastered Bandai editions? Nope. 
>> ARTICLE
My feels exactly
>> ARTICLE
is there a point where anyone would care? give me 12 editions of Cowboy Bebop...bring it, I'll watch them all.
>> ARTICLE
Well you're almost in luck since Funimation is releasing four different editions of it. 
>> ARTICLE
AH, so basically what you are saying is, I am going to be a poor man soon.
>> ARTICLE
Probably only 2 editions poor.  The first two editions are BluRay and DVD.  The second two are an Amazon Exclusive BluRay DVD Combo-Pack Premium Edition and a Funimation Premium Edition which will have different premium items in them.
>> ARTICLE
Jeeeeeez, Turning into my videos games now with all their different editions and exclusives and store promos!
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty much what I thought during the announcement.  All I want is the BluRay, or at most the combo pack.  All this other stuff just adds to the cost without adding to the value for me. 
>> ARTICLE
If they had like... Two editions one fore like you said combo pack or something and then for the people who want to blow $100-$150 on something they just "need to have" add something nifty collector wise!
>> ARTICLE
Is there a difference between these and the remastered editions?
>> ARTICLE
Probably just a bit better quality...and the box art. 
>> ARTICLE
I will definitely be purchasing this. Funimation's Yu Yu Hakusho Blu-Rays were excellent and I'd expect the same from this. 
>> ARTICLE
Those blu-rays come with their DVD counterparts?
>> ARTICLE
Uhh, I might not actually physically own the blu-ray collections so I'm not the best person to answer that question.
>> ARTICLE
10-4
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, those YYH Blu rays were brilliant looking, and I was constantly admiring how clean the art was. But are these Bebop BRs going to have the same remastering done to them? I have the Bandai DVD remasters and they look pretty good already, I probably won't bite unless there's a pretty substantial increase in quality for this release.
>> ARTICLE
[Here is a comparison album](http://imgur.com/a/Lx0W0) showing the differences between the Bandai DVDs and the recent Blu-ray releases for Japan, UK, and Australia. Funimation will probably use it as well for the US release, so this could be a good representation of what we will see.

which is which? the right has a weird sheen to it. it must be dvd

It says above the first pic: Left: Dvd - Right: Blu-ray

I don't know if this makes sense but it seems like they boosted the reds a bit too much

It's one letter worse than breaking into a bank, so you know this guy's a real badass.

Hopefully that means netflix soon too.
>> ARTICLE
Last year there was a ton of cross promotion surround Bebop, Funimation and Daisuki. Unless the licensing agreement has changed I would expect Daisuki and Funimation.com to be the most likely streaming locations. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. Looking forward to that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man. Netflix is kind of shitty as far as anime goes. On both of my x360/1 there isn't even a "anime" section anymore. I want a better selection.

Edit: would love to see this and more added.
>> ARTICLE
What are you talking about? Of course there is an anime section. Search by "genre"...
>> ARTICLE
I know the anime genre exists it just isn't there on my 360 or one. At least me anyway. On my phone and pc it's there. Hell even my Wii.
>> ARTICLE
Google?
>> ARTICLE
Google what
>> ARTICLE
If every other platform has a genre section, so does your Xbox. Google it.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix HAS been adding more anime recently though, so who knows where it'll go in the future? Over the last few weeks even, they've added some of the most popular anime in recent history, which is a good start.
>> ARTICLE
Just curious but what has been added?

Edit: words.
>> ARTICLE
Deathnote was recently added. 
>> ARTICLE
Death Note, Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, and Psycho Pass are the ones I know for sure. Attack on Titan was added very early in the year as well. I also think a pretty large chunk of HxH was added somewhat recently. 
>> ARTICLE
Edit: basically I just want more ultra violent blood and guts head exploding stupid anime. That's all. Sorry if I'm being assholish or whatever. Not my intent.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann isn't on the US netflix.
>> ARTICLE
To highlight, here are examples I just pulled from the anime section of better know series:

Attack on Titan, Kill La Kill, Madoka Magica, Sword Art Online, Fate/Zero, Psycho Pass, Death Note,Full Metal Alchemist ( +Brotherhood ).

In addition you have Knight's of Sidonia (from last anime season), which is a "Netflix Original", so they have the exclusive streaming rights in some places. 

I won't say they have as broad a selection as Crunchyroll, Funimation.com or Hulu. But what they have picked up is very well known amongst the the community and well regarded.
>> ARTICLE
don't forget HUNTER X HUNTER!!!
>> ARTICLE
oooooh didn't know that was on there!
>> ARTICLE
Say what? It never shows up on my Netflix. You would think Netflix would have a better way to search shows by now but naaah.
>> ARTICLE
I think their search bar is actually pretty fantastic. Just type in what you're looking for and it will almost always show it, and show whether they have it on instant or not. Hunter X Hunter is also the very first title when I browse the anime category here in the US.
>> ARTICLE

Yep already out in Japan and Korea. Don't know about the Japanese discs but the Korean ones only have Japanese and Korean languages. Same goes for Giant Robo. Still upset about that one. 
>> ARTICLE
They've come out in Japan and the UK on BD.
>> ARTICLE
How's the resolution? I'm assuming just an upscale? 
>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen, it's fully remastered.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, not sure how i feel about that. A lot of the charm in rewatching Bebop is the old gritty look of the animation. It really adds to the show instead of taking away from it. I'm not sure how i'd like it to be overly crisp.
>> ARTICLE
Well, no one is taking away your DVDs. If you don't want better video quality why would you consider the BD release?
>> ARTICLE
Tracing over outlines and filling everything in with flat colors to make everything look like shiny and uniform isn't exactly what i'd call "better video quality". It takes something that was hand drawn with care and makes it look like it was someone's weekend Flash animation project.

A remaster when you're using the original animation cells, but at a higher resolution is great, but simply drawing over the top of everything tends to take away from it more than anything else. I'm not saying it looks like shit or anything, but it loses a lot of the heart and soul of the original. 


>> ARTICLE
They didn't trace over anything or do any new animation for this. They took the original film master and scanned it at a higher resolution, this allowed a lot of fine details that were present in the original to become a lot clearer. That "gritty" look that you like, came about due to the DVD encoding technology of the day, the BD release is as close to the makers artistic vision as you can get at this time.
>> ARTICLE
* After [a full year of waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSxTcaDBPbs) they finally announced a actual release date, thank god.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah seriously and this is more like like a time frame(December 2014) instead of an actual date.  I feel like they completely forgot about it.
>> ARTICLE
This wouldn't include a new dub would it? It should have the same dub? Different companies I believe so I'm not sure
>> ARTICLE
When I spoke w/ Justin Rojas at SGC he said that Bebop isn't a redub or anything. Just cleaning stuff up. 
>> ARTICLE
As with Black Lagoon and Hellsing Ultimate, they won't re-dub it. No reason for them to since it will be more expensive
>> ARTICLE
I hope not. CB had one of the best dubs of any anime I'd seen, so if Funi decides to re-dub it, I don't think they'd do a good job matching the notability of the original dub. I don't think they will dub it though. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I agree. I didn't think they would re-dub it because almost everyone loves the original dub for this show. Just wasn't sure, but I think they won't re-dub it as well.
>> ARTICLE
Even the director of bebop prefers the dub to the Japanese casting. It is probably the best English anime dub ever.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that thinks two different premium editions is lame. And why do companies keep making their blu ray's come with dvd? 
>> ARTICLE
It's more lame when they come in DVD boxes like what funimation use to do and NiS currently does.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah if excluding those stupid DVD editions from the blu ray editions meant a drop in price, I'm all for it. I buy blu rays to watch it blu ray. They maybe a convenience factor for others, but not for me. 
>> ARTICLE
For the second question, i imagine its so people who don't have blu-ray players can buy the fancy editions and still be able to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Fair point. 
>> ARTICLE
It just doesn't make sense though, because those fancy editions cost more than a BluRay player sometimes...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, i'm not sure why people still don't just drop the money for a BD player, they're getting to be pretty inexpensive these days. 

>> ARTICLE
You can get one for like $35 on amazon from samsung.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy having both so that I have the option to watch on my blu-ray at home or the dvd on my laptop elsewhere. Can't speak for the real reason, but I love having the option.
>> ARTICLE
Can even give the DVD's to a friend.

I can see this.

Love that Cowboy Bebop is coming out on blu ray, but I'm really nervous that Amazon and Funimation blu rays will have different premium items. Guess we'll just have to wait and see what each offers.

>> ARTICLE
TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY. TAKE IT.
>> ARTICLE
I have the uk blurays. They are awesome. A must buy,  even if you already own a previous copy.
>> ARTICLE
So is this the re edited version (I think it was called the Remix) or the original version? Cause I honestly didn't like the Remix vs the original there were to many little things that were just ... not as good. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait..... What do you mean by remix being different??

Thought they were the same thing.  I think I own the remix of the series but not sure. 
>> ARTICLE
ok the example I can think of off the top of my head is in Episode 1. [remix] (http://youtu.be/fUnqrx8pjAg?t=2m52s) Vs [original] (http://youtu.be/yER6K7jTeog?t=5m10s)

Now granted the audio isn't the greatest quality but listen to spike over the radio in the original it SOUNDS like he is talking over a radio vs the Remix they cleaned it up and made it crystal clear. I prefer the original it just added a layer of authenticity to it. There were more things that they redid (mostly audio/sound) in the remix that I just felt detracted from the feeling that you get from watching Bebop (like yeah that universe is believable/gritty/lived in ect ect).

Most people wouldn't notice or didn't care but I just preferred the original. Which is why I have yet to buy bebop cause all I can find is the Remix at cons. I'm sure if I did a search I could find an original copy online but with the Blu-ray coming out if its the original (or at least an option in the sound menu) I will snap buy this in a heartbeat.
>> ARTICLE
Brb.  Watching episode 1 right now.

Holy shit.  I forgot how amazing this series starts. That romantic, calm jazz with scenes of violence. Then boom you have the song tank just blast through the speakers during opening credits.

Also my version is definitely the remix.  Really sad about the sound changes.  They crisped the sounds up so much they lost the same character that the original had.  

I guess it's been so long since I have seen the original series, I didn't realize it when I bought my dvd's.

I mean shit.  The way the ship sounds traveling through space, the way Spike sounds on the radio, to the way the key enters into the swordfish. I think even the whistling has been tuned a little.  This makes me sad. I wanted the bluray just because, but I really do want it now if it has the original soundtrack.  Wonder why they changed so many small sound details.

Did someone lazily autotune it to make it sound pretty, or did they do that clean crisp sound intentionally??

Also that ending of that first episode.
>> ARTICLE
That's *very* noticeable.  I'm not sure I prefer one version over the other.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who just found out (I just watched mine and I have the remix), I actually like the original better.  Me personally, the sounds seem to have more character.
>> ARTICLE
Original. They are just releasing the series on bluray and DVD
>> ARTICLE
What fucking coincidence! I just finished this series an hour ago.
>> ARTICLE
My body is ready.  Hopefully this means we'll get a rerelease of Geass next year!  (And Akito the Exhiled as well)
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure which will be stronger. My love for Bebop, or my dislike for Funimation.

If original dubs are intact then it's almost a no-brainer, but god help us all if they use the standard Funi pool to re-dub it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not a BIG fan of Funi. Now, don't get me wrong, some dubs from them were good, but others.... not so much. I just hate that they re-use the SAME VAs for a lot of the series they dub. 
>> ARTICLE
Voice actors are reused everywhere, including Japan and other areas of American animation. I don't love or hate Funimation, but I don't see exactly what they have done deserve the hate they get.
>> ARTICLE
My biggest problems with them are not so much the VAs they use, but who they use for which character. They seem to mis-cast pretty often. A lot of their scripts have some really stupid translation choices, or just plain WRONG translations/typos.

Also, not a fan of them breaking series up into parts 1 and 2. That one though is more because they don't seem to be throwing any thing at the series to make it WORTH that. Many of their encodes are outright TERRIBLE, you rarely get any incentives for the split like nice quality art boxes, posters, cds the things that companies like Aniplex and Nisa include to justify it.

Also, and this one is just fucking nitpicky, and i admit it, but i hate their fonts for subs, only Sentai's VHS throwback lettering is worse.
>> ARTICLE
This is good...this pleases me.
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean we can also expect it to be available to stream on Funi's website?

They're already out on Blu-Ray in Australia, I saw them at JB. The 26 episodes comes on 2 different collections

So was the series was in HD? Is the blu ray actually better than the dvd? I know the series is old. Before anything in the U.S was in HD. But I would not be surprised if it was that good of quality in Japan back then.

I hope it isn't Aniplex-tier expensive. I swear Aniplex caters to billionaires with their pricing scheme.

WOOP WOOP! I'm so glad I help back on buying the DVD remix version. Gotta have those sweet, sweet extras.
>> ARTICLE
How will this differ from the Bandai Anime Legends DVD box? Is it technically in higher definition if I buy the Blu Rays?
>> ARTICLE
it would hopefully be a proper professionally done and checked up scale. Most newer DVD (bluray) players will up scale dvd's live for you however they would never look as good as a system that has taken the time to properly up scale the images. 

So yes it would have a higher native resolution than your DVD's but will never be as good as something originally released in 1080p. 

(everything I wrote above assumes the source material isn't for some reason originally done in a higher resolution) 
>> ARTICLE
Most BD releases of old, pre-digital anime are rescans of the original film made from photographing the cells, and thus are not actually upscales.

It's only when you get to old digital stuff before HD was a thing that you get upscales (like Funi's Full Metal Panic BDs).

Barring licensing issues (I know that was a problem with the Persona 4 anime release) I'd assume it would come with both language options.

I like to rewatch (or reread books). I always seem to find some new detail I haven't noticed.

Of course it depends on the passion one has for whatever material is in question.  Nothing wrong with not being able to rewatch or not.

I was just having a discussion with a newer/younger anime fan about how what most people consider must-watch series like Bebop, Tenchi, Trigun, Eva, etc, etc, have been edged out by this generations must-watch series, sometimes with younger fans not having grown up on Toonami, and the DVD releases being quite old at this point. 

It's very much a possibility that a large number of fans are only familiar with the theme song, or other elements of the show but not having actually watched it.

It's pretty awesome news. I'll definitely be watching Death Note and the sequel when it airs next week, though I wont watch the Cowboy Bebop movie until I see the show proper. 

Plus I just started the Death Note anime this week so it'll be fitting. 
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, the Bebop movie is chronologically in the middle of the series, and doesn't spoil anything. I'll have to get someone who's seen it to confirm that, however.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm aware that fact, it is true.

I guess i'm a little mixed since I'd like to watch the series first. Maybe I'll watch the movie maybe I wont, depends on if I can stay awake long enough since they put it on so late.
>> ARTICLE
If you have at least gotten to the point of the series where Ed joins the Bebop, then you have seen everything you need to know before watching the movie--hell, even most of the episodes of the show.

You can actually just watch the movie before even seeing the show if you really want, the only thing the movie can possibly spoil for you is the three characters that join the crew very early in the series...and most people who haven't seen the series still know who those characters are.

I guess the only thing it could do to you is spoil you with better animation...going to the show may be slightly more difficult after that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm already aware of all the members of the crew so that detail isn't all that important really. Regardless I'll figure out if i want to see the movie or not, it's just the fact that it ends after 2am at night that bothers me considerably since I don't even stay up that late.

Is the live action of Death Note good or will I be cringing the whole way through? I'm just kind of surprised Bebop is on so late compared to Death Note.

I'll give opinion to the contrary and say the Death Note live action movie is not very good. It doesn't have a lot of the great atmosphere, cinematography and cool writing that made the show so good. 


>> ARTICLE
It's a good adaption.

The guy playing Light's father is great. L and Light are pretty good. As an adaptation, it's a pretty good condensation of the story. The rest of the cast is pretty bad, IMHO. The SFX for the Shimigami are okay.

The dark stylization is definitely nice looking, and I really like the textures you masked over Spike and the typography. My only complaint (and it's minor) is that the copy could have used a bit more breathing room on the left and right sides. It feels just a bit too cramped.

This is great! may I ask how the design and printing aspects were done?
>> ARTICLE
I made this for a photography class centered around a black and white darkroom, and specifically the print is called a "photogram." Here's Wikipedia's definition of it (much clearer than any explanation I can give):
> A photogram is a photographic image made without a camera by placing objects directly onto the surface of a light-sensitive material such as photographic paper and then exposing it to light.  

In order to make this specific photogram, I printed out the Spike Spiegel silhouette and the text on a transparency. Then I grabbed some of that really thin tissue-like art paper (the kind you find in gift baqs) and layered it over for the texture. Then I placed the photographic paper under the materials, exposed it to light, and then developed. All done in a photography darkroom. 

EDIT: Clarity. Kind of hard to explain the procedure without using a bunch of photography jargon.

I agree with Jourdy. Watch it right now and don't stop till it's over.

The show is that good. Everyone has their tastes and preferences so I'll add that I like Space Cobra better than this. If you haven't watched that, you might also want to consider it. Both explore a number of common topics, you see, even though they're entirely different.
>> ARTICLE
The only show I liked from the one who made this was samurai champloo. What is the story about anyways? Hunting people or what?

Not exactly. It's better you watch it than I explain it to you.

*Is it any good*.

It's the best. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Right now. I don't care how.

It's perfect in every way, musically, artistically, and storywise. If you haven't seen it... I don't have good words for you. I'm a writer and you just ripped the words from my mouth. Just do yourself a favor and watch it. If you have a friend who thinks s/he couldn't ever like anime, have him or her watch it. It's incredible.

And the dub is surprisingly good too.
>> ARTICLE
The sub was good enough for me :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I prefer it with subs, but it's one of the rare anime where when I've watched it dubbed I haven't wanted to rip my ears off and cast them out of a window. It's also surprising for the time in which it was made, because most dubs around that time were *horrible*.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. However, nothing can beat NGE (from the small subset of anime I've watched) at being the worst of the lot (I know it's a much older series, just saying).

I think Turn-A and Wing gundam come pretty close to the trash quality of some 90s dubs.

I think it was a result of the Japanese intonation sorta being forced through the dubbing.
>> ARTICLE
Turn A never got a dub. It was going to get a sub-only release before Bandai Entertainment folded, but that's it.

ZZ, V, X, Turn A, Stargazer, and AGE are the only proper series presently that have no dub, so you could perhaps be thinking about any other. Zeta's is probably the worst Gundam dub around though.

Wow. What hipsters you guys are.

/u/resolc,  it's Cowboy Bebop.  Watch the dub.

I'm ready for the downvotes. Don't do anime stuff at school. It may be an awesome work for you and few people but the majority, including most teachers, will have no clue of what's going on and your grade could be affected.

Well I take back what I said but I still think the text is shitty maybe that's just me
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it's a Japanese show, and it's somewhat common for anime to wind up with pretty awkward phrasing when they attempt to write something in English to be shown on screen. Plus, most of it is only on screen for a second and you're only really able to see about 60% of the words. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I get what your saying
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think they were very aware of how poorly written that is based on how little of it you actually see in the show. Its never presented as anything more then maybe what the pitch for the show was. Still cool
>> ARTICLE
you did a great job

this is horrifically written- if it's a direct copypaste of spike's monologue, then you should have paraphrased. if it's your words, or your paraphrasing of spike, and english is your first language, then goddamn you should learn to write.
>> ARTICLE
The text I used comes from the op / episode "bumpers" seen throughout the series.

I agree that it's not the most well written script, but changing it felt sort of wrong (and I DID consider it). Even if poorly written, I feel as though it still captures the essence of the series.
>> ARTICLE
 Yes! Finally my favorite non-story episode! I find Waltz for Venus to be one of the various pinnacle episodes of Bebop! 

* I really like the world building of terra-forming having adverse effects and not all planets being completely habitable

* Spike training Rocco and the fighting like water was a cool homage to Bruce Lee

* I looooveed the shots of Swordfish flying around Venus, just thought it was gorgeous art

* Shoot out scene with the mobsters and the music picking up only to be cut off by when Rocco gets shot

* Stella and Spikes solemn meeting as she finds out Rocco's death

* The music box playing while the the spores come down like snow will go down as one of my favorite scenes in the whole anime 

>> ARTICLE
Ah, we're back and in style after yesterday's clunker. 

Waltz for Venus pulled me back on track after the past two episodes left me less than impressed. The game changer for this episode is that, up to this moment, we've always had our one-off side characters, but none of them were really all that likable, in fact, most of the time they were just crooks, bounty heads, or blank slates. 

Our man today, Roco Bonnaro, changes the trend. He's a goofball, a hyperactive youth, but he's instantly likable through his boyish charm, which contrasts really nicely with Spike's more adult, suave personality. In the short time we spend with him, we see a mentor-mentee relationship unfold shortly.

The sound direction is back on point: Roco's voice actor does a fine job, but the standout is the music box tune. Its haunting innocence really captures how much of a boy Roco really was... and the imagery of the seemingly innocent, yet actually dangerous seeds falling down to that tune demonstrates that in the state Bebop's world is in, there is no place for such innocence.

Maybe, just maybe, in a better time and a better place, Roco might not be too far off what Spike would have been. 

As a last note, after (hell, even during) watching Bebop, I concluded that it is neither a plot, nor character driven show, but rather a show centered around a theme: the exploration of what it means to be alive, and what it means to live. Today's episode showed us someone who clearly belongs in the latter category, but he paid for it with his life. On the other hand, our main man Spike is firmly in the first.

Which begs the question, even though we know of Roco's ending, which one is actually better off?

Anyway, food for thought, so savour the taste, but not too much, there's more to come. Tomorrow we'll see the introduction of our last main, urr, *character* and by far my least favorite of the main cast, but again our session will have a unique vibe. 
>> ARTICLE
> I concluded that it is neither a plot, nor character driven show,

I would argue that characters do have big role in Bebop's story. Bebop is the home to very different individuals who somehow find their place in this ship working together as Bounty Hunters. None really reveal more about themselves and are very reserved which to the viewer looks like low Character development but I think is on purpose. The only way we see these characters past is when it catches up to them. 
I would say near the end we see the a lot of development and focus on the characters and how they deal with their past, in particular[Spoilers](/s "Spike and Faye")
>> ARTICLE
Oh for sure, the characters are very important, but they're not the centerpiece of the show. I'd argue that they are ultimately the vessels through which the show gets its theme across, rather than being the focus with a theme on the side.

This is also why they are so similar: all three main characters (I've left out Ed, because he's just a very weird case) are lost, lonely individuals on the run from their past. That's why I wouldn't say their past catches up to them, but rather they stop running away and confront it.

And that's what the show is all about: searching and running. When we are running away from ourselves, we are merely alive and it is only when we stop running and start searching for our goal/purpose/place in life, embracing our past and personality, that we truly live...

Even if we never really find it, or if it all ends suddenly, like it did with Roco today. 
>> ARTICLE
God I love the music in this show. The way the weave and tie it in just adds an untold amount to the overall experience. That said, hearing that music box gives my goosebumps every time I've watched this episode. Easily one of the best episode endings in the show.

The bums that are talking as VT walks to the bar are talking about the great bounty hunter Terpsichore, aka VT's husband. I like this as it gives the audience the ability to guess her name too, not that I noticed at all my first time watching.

That good for nothing mooching squatter is a friend now? Damn Spike you're quite the accommodating gentleman.

Welcome Back!

>> ARTICLE
A few thoughts after rewatching:

First off I love heavy metal, so that may contribute to my viewpoint.

Really loved the "Spike shoots his gun for propulsion in space to get back to the ship".

A clever [Guns n Roses nod](http://www.inetres.com/gp/anime/bebop/07/bebop_07_22.jpg)

The culture of truckers in space, loved it!

The fact that Spike doesn't take VT's money at the end for the guessing her name bet, just his initial guesses worth.

They're broke, but it's not the Bebop way.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like i could watch an entire "space truckers" spinoff.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, it's time to jam again. Unfortunately, every band has some sessions that don't click and this one is, imo, the worst offender of them all. 

Every other episode, even the ones I didn't like, they all had something, whether plot progression, character development, thematic weight, or even just a different vibe. This one is just... nothing. It's bang average and that is not a compliment in any way. 

It doesn't help that I do not like metal at all as a music genre and it also doesn't help that in the English dub, otherwise fantastic, V.T. was not up to standard. With Bebop's best asset, the normally perfect sound direction, uncharacteristically off, the episode just doesn't offer anything worthwhile. Everything is just bland, which is very unusual for Bebop.

Anyway, I'd rather not dwell on this one for too long. Tomorrow we'll be in better shape, with a new planet, a new bounty and way better side characters for what I feel is one of the better standalone episodes.

Not to nit pick, but the mixing on the song kind of sticks out. At many points in the song did it sound like she was out front of everything. It made the music seem distant. I had to go re-listen to the Japanese version to make sure I wasn't going to make an ass out of myself by saying this. Also at times her voice over powers the music. It feels like two layers of music instead of one song. 

Feel free to compare the two.

I feel the opposite way about almost all music. In 95%+ of songs I hear, the instruments overpowers the vocals, and drums usually overpower the other instruments. The thing you're complaining about is one of the things I loved about this song.

I'm definitely in the minority on this, as most songs aren't done this way, but hearing one of the few things mixed to levels that sound good to my ears made me happy.

I either mean See You Space Cowboy, hidden track on the third OST album "Blue", or The Real Folk Blues on "Vitaminless". One of those is the normal ending, the other the track I mean. I'm at Uni at the moment, so I can't check that, but you probably already now which one. :)

Honestly, while not bad, it doesn't sound amazing to me. The music sounds pretty awkward, like it was recorded through a wall and then voiced over, and the lyrics are not very impressive. Decent voice but not on the same level as Mai Yamane.

I much prefer either one of the Japanese versions (Real Folk Blues or See You Space Cowboy, take your pick). There's just so much more emotion in it, and the production is a lot better as well.

On one hand, your complaints have truth to them.

You're in for a ride

All I know is ep5 is supposed to be the "all or nothing" episode, if you will, that usually determines how much you'll enjoy the show. I hope it's great
>> ARTICLE
Not really... Bebop is style- and character-driven, and those stick from the first episode without really letting up all the way through. Episode five is just a really good episode that everyone needs to watch.

Make sure you watch it in english dub.. this show is wicked and you're going to love it!

Yeh I watched Baccano dubbed so i thought this would be good dubbed aswell

Steins;Gate?


>> ARTICLE
One of the best anime series I've seen. Episode 22 is enough to make the toughest man cry. 
>> ARTICLE
You need to watch more anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, A ton of people told me to go read the light novels for, and to watch, SAO, so I did. And I completely regret it. They were all like "You will totally cry!" and "Its so actiony, It's great!"  and I never shed a tear and the action was decent at best. 

So please, please, please, tell me this isn't just people overhyping another anime because it is "in" right now. I don't want to waste my time again. :(
>> ARTICLE
No guarantees on crying, but it's a damn good series, full of time-traveling twists and shit while maintaining an old school sci-fi vibe mixed with moe, humor, and intrigue. If you love mad scientists, then this is the series for you!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I don't think I'd cry over it, but as a person who used MMO's to escape the rest of the world from 10 years old (Runescape. Holy shat, it's been 10 years.) until I was able to grow up and face people, I feel I can connect to it really well.
>> ARTICLE
I will definitely say that the setting for the show was top notch, the idea behind it was one of the better examples of "stuck in a videogame" that I have seen... but the actual execution of the story left so much to be desired... 

Also, if you want something to read that is like SAO... only better (in my opinion) then go read Ready Player One by Ernie Cline. With any luck you will love the hell out of that book. 
>> ARTICLE
Just snagged that off of Amazon, thanks for the recommendation!
>> ARTICLE
You are welcome, It is by and far the best "videogame" book out there right now. Enjoy it, and if you do, pass the word on to someone else who will enjoy it too. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that most of what I could say has already been said, but I will just say that while it's a great anime for a lot of people, it's not for everyone. 
The first couple of episodes are slow, and it took me a while to finish it. It wasn't till I was done I realized how good it was. I like it while watching, but looking back it was better. 
>> ARTICLE
But have you read chapter 16.5?
READ.IT.NOW!
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate is a much better show than SAO. Sword Art Online is not at all sad, the can get goofy, and it's not the best action out there. I watch it not expecting much, mostly to tide me over. Steins; Gate is one of my favorite anime I've ever watched. The plot is wonderful, managing to stay unique in a cliche pitfall, the characters are all pretty well developed, humor is pretty good, and it's pretty emotional. Make sure not to stop halfway.
>> ARTICLE
"Don't stop halfway" And "Looking back on it makes it better than watching it" seem to be very common responses. xD

>managing to stay unique in a cliche pitfall

I like the sound of that. So, overall, this show tops SAO completely and without reserve?
>> ARTICLE
To offer a counterpoint to OrangeWool's comment and to play the devil's advocate, I would say that Steins;Gate is slow to start, poorly-paced, and has a lot of shallow and/or unlikable characters. It's definitely not a bad show, just not the absolutely perfect anime that many make it out to be.

TL;DR for both of our comments: Opinions.
>> ARTICLE
How poorly paced? SAO was "poorly paced" and that turned out to mean that it was a train wreck of time skips and missed character development. 

are the shallow/unlikable characters serving a point in the story, or are they intended to be the characters that the audience connects to and they just happen to suck? 

And while both comments may be opinions, I like the opinions on r/Anime because people on here know what they are talking about (generally). :)
>> ARTICLE
I agree that some characters didn't get enough screen time to fully develop in the anime, however the ones that matter the most did so i have no problem with it :D

As to the "slow start" , I had tonnes of fun watching them fooling around. 
>> ARTICLE
SAO made someone cry? wut?

Anyway, Steins;Gate, objectively is a pretty good/great anime.  One of the reasons why it's one of *my* favorite series is because of the cast, with two characters in particular.

When you start watching SG, don't expect it to be *epic* every moment.  The greatness of this anime is only actualized after finishing it and looking back on how well the story was woven, and how great the character chemistry was.

That said, there will be a lot of talking, and little *doing* in many of the episodes, especially early on.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't watch this show.

However, if you're really curious to see how an anime handles the concept of time, while pulling in several existing theories, check it out.  It's part comedy, part sci-fi, part thriller.
>> ARTICLE
You are the second person to say that looking back at the show is when you realize how good it was. 

And if it handles the theories and talking realisticially then I'd be more interested in that than an action-y anime. 

What was it about the cast that made them memorable to you? 

And supposedly the "daughter" scene in sao was the "saddest scene in an anime evah". I honestly don't know, but people insisted that I would cry when I watched it. :/
>> ARTICLE
The theories are handled reasonably well, but it doesn't risk getting too technical, which could lose viewers.  But if you're interested in quantum mechanics and particle accelerators, there will be quite a few fun references that will definitely catch your attention.

This combined with the character interactions, really made the early part of the show more enjoyable to me.

Now, the cast really sticks to me, because of two characters in particular.  First, there's the MC, who's easily one of the most unique characters I've ever seen play a lead role in an anime; not your typical, messy haired, headstrong, overpowered, too cool for school, pretty boy MC.  He's very *weird*, and the show wants you to know he's weird.  He's obnoxious, delusional, full of himself, and pretty scatter-brained minus a few strokes of genius.

The second character is a supporting character, who is basically the MC's foil.  She too is invested in science, but calls the MC out on a lot of his bullshit, and grounds the show in reality.  She provides the viewer with perspective on just how delusional the MC can be.  Their interactions make up a great deal of the show's comedy, and even plays off of anime tropes and meme-humor.

Last note:  If you do decide to watch Steins;Gate, the beginning will seem pretty confusing for a couple of episodes, but just trust that it will all make sense.  I found that there was very little *wasted time* in this series, as everything serves an explicit purpose.

May we ask why?
I thought it was pretty well rounded. It was a nice Mecha that made it seem not Mecha and the story was good along with the ending.


Just curious.

oh I just couldn't stand the main character. 

I thought the story was pretty intriguing though, but my loathing for the main character overwhelmed my intrigue and I couldn't get past the second or third episode.
>> ARTICLE
Have you thought about trying it again it really does get better he starts out eh but really devolps more and more emotions as it goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
I might give it another shot when I finish Guilty Crown.

I saw a few episodes of the abridged version which were hilarious, so a few of the plot points might be ruined for me, but I'll still give it a go around eventually. :)
>> ARTICLE
Guilty was actually made by the same two writers and is pretty similar in some aspects.

The reason I loved guilty is because I knew the authors a bit in my mind and just tried my best to not question stuff and feel for the characters.

It's always sad to see an Anime that could of been one of the best get reduced episode numbers and be forced to speed the show up.

Be warned though you will cry so hard in the last episode! 

And honestly I've rewatched code geass about 5 times now. If I have a day off I just all night it and watch it in a day lol .

It's worth it I feel and lellouch does open to a very extravegent character and if you still hate him there are a lot of others always trying to steal the lime light :) 
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha!  You know, I thought the idea looked very familiar from the first episodes!  I just seem to gravitate towards GC for some reason haha.   

I'm looking forward to finishing it now!  I had to take a few months off from watching it because of some videowork I had to get done, but now I can get back to it.

I'll make sure I finish Code Geass before I start any other shows though, my friend has been bugging me to finish it too.

Welcome to the world of sensitive men. But hey, look on the bright side. There are plenty of beautiful women who want sensitive men. Also as a side note they say that crying is good for you. Apparently (and please don't downvote me to hell if I'm wrong about this) but men have a higher rate of vision loss because men cry less than women do. When you tear up during the feels moments it makes your eyes healthier.

When you mention Clannad, you're watching Clannad After Stories also, right?  Just wanna make sure you properly cleanse yourself of any remaining tears :)

Not a tear-jerker really but another anime that really gets you thinking about life is Honey & Clover.  

Not deep philosophically but it hit me hard.  As somebody that's had some love failures & problems establishing a career when I was first in College ... so many things in this anime forced me to recall some of the major moments in my life.

===
See that you don't list anything I consider a great suspense or tension builder.  Try Monster & Death Note anime & see if you like this type of genre also.  Monster & Death Note are also complete manga series.

Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai is another interesting anime that I've really enjoyed.

Now, read the Steins;Gate visual novel! Although the story is the same, there are a few more scenes and everything is given more depth. 

And while you're at it, read the Chaos;Head visual novel too (but not the anime adaption, that was bad). Chaos;Head takes place in the same universe, one year before Steins;Gate.

Once you go through at least Chaos;Head (since you already know Steins;Gate), you can watch Robotics;Notes, which is airing now!

Does it have more things than the anime? Also could you recommend any LNs that aren't already a anime? 
>> ARTICLE
Unforunately, I only read LNs that turned into anime. A lot of LNs are untranslated and many novels that did not became a anime are hardly translated. That's why I am planning to master my Japanese (I am still a beginner) so I could read then first-hand.

For Chuunibyou, LN is completely different story and have different feels as well. While anime emphasized on Rikka's moe, LN focused on Rikka's character. While anime had been rollercoaster of emotions with strong drama, LN has been series of conversations between Rikka and Yuuta. If you love Rikka delving into her Chuunibyou, then you will like LN more than anime. I am more disappointed about Yuuta in LN because I felt that author did not develop him enough, but he is not dense and have common sense compared to other male leads, so I like LN's Yuuta. If you like Rikka and other characters and want expansion of their characters, then you should read the LN. Rikka is more cute and her loneliness, which was covered a bit in anime, has been emphasized. To be honest, I would preferred Kyoani to stick with original storyline, but I understand why they developed completely different story, since LN is less of a plot (anime has better plot) but more of strong characterization. I think it is safe to say that LN's author has strong potential to write better storyline later on and, although there won't be second season of Chuuniyou, the LN would continue with Rikka adorableness. (And second volume is out. WOOT!)

For LN, you should visit: http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Main_Page

I recommend you to read LN that became anime, since these LNs tend to be better story than LN that didn't became anime. Also, LN that became anime expand on the story and characters. Sometimes, the actions of characters shown in anime are well explained and it boosts the fun in the anime. Because I read Chuunibyou LN, I emphasize with Rikka in anime and I honestly feel sorry for her. (In LN, she is treated worse by her family than she is treated in anime)

I like LN because anime does not expand on the plots and character very well.
>> ARTICLE
I read the Haruhi LNs. I can hipsterly say I was into Disappearance before "Disappearance" :P

Being a hipster, I was into Endless Eight before it was a thing, and I laughed my ass of at the community raging all over then the second season started off!

That being said, Haruhi LN is one of few LNs to get translated, so buy the books! Two releases a year and they have almost caught up with the Japanese series.

While the LN was great, the movie turned out really good, too. No disappointments.

Haruhi LNs are best LNs.

Try Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood too.
>> ARTICLE
This anime was easily one of my favorites. Full Metal Alchemist and Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood were excellent. I also enjoyed the movie. It would fill your need for action and then rip your heart out after. 
>> ARTICLE
If you mean the original FMA movie, I hated it.


I can take bad stuff happening to a character, and I can take WTF'ness of a plot. But the level of bullshit in that movie in terms of plot and wtfness was too much. 


That's probably one of the reasons I like brotherhood so much more. In a lot of ways, it's a lot darker, but it keeps it from just being a depressing show by having comic relief all the time. The original one, as far as I can remember, kind of forgot to do that about halfway into the show. 


Edit: Speeling.

iv seen Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Hellsing and many other action animes but iv yet to watch  Angel Beats, Stein's Gate, Elfen Lied, and Clannad,Berserker,trigun just so many which should i look at first..
>> ARTICLE
Probably Elfen Lied or Berserker first, both IMO are great. Trigun was awesome as well, I haven't seen Clannad but I've thought about it and I've yet to start Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
what are elfen lied and berserker about  and hows the story in your oppinion? 
>> ARTICLE
It's been so long since I've watched either Elfen Lied and Berserk to be honest. Now that I'm drawing complete blanks on both, I might even go back and watch them to refresh my memory. LOL 
>> ARTICLE
LOL nice one ill add them too my list  im still watch gurren lagann, then i have Welcome to NHK to watch then ill check them out  i spent last  2 months watching one piece from start to current and then reading the manga lol.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I stay away from anything that's longer then 50 episodes. xD Roughly like my 12-13 episodes and my 25-26 episodes. As for Gurren Lagann is AMAZING. 
>> ARTICLE
ivf watched like 50+ anime series and short manga series so many  i actually need too keep  a book mark folder for them i always said one piece was shit being an idiot started watching it got fucking addicted too it now its my favourate anime and also started my anime model collection because of it currently have a zoro Model the series is soo good better than all the top ones like naruto and bleach  even tho im a big fan of both have been for years. the character development in one piece is in a whole different plane of existance. too everything else iv watched!

edit! i recommend sword art online its fucking awesome!

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I stay away from One Piece/Bleach/Naruto... They're just way too long. Especially since I like action/fighting. If they got rid of all the filler and got straight into the fighting in Bleach/Naruto I'd watch it. I'm not really one for character development, I wanted to get into Bleach/Naruto for being action fighting packed and all I got was a lot of drama and stupid stuff I didn't want to follow.

As for Sword Art Online, I'm on like the 18th episode I believe. I stopped watching it to let rest of the episodes release and just paid a bit attention to other animes I've been watching. I just finished Strike Witches, Hellsing, Rosario + Vampire (First season gotta start the second one soon)... I'm all over the place. xD
>> ARTICLE
One piece is like 95 percent action and its good action too Luffy and zoro are legends  they dont keep that  same shit resengan/getsuga type shit every single attack  luffy just makes attacks up as he goes along and only sometimes uses the sameish types of attacks  and zoro rarely recycles an attack  so many awesome fights i find my self all the time rewatching fights luffy and his crew dont always get  there face smashed in and then magically win nah  there are times when they just kick the shit out of there enemys like there nothing somtimes they enem yare so weak they just   ignore them lol its so good!

Dude honestly... the end of the last episode of Cowboy Bebop, when [Blue](www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8) was playing during a certain... event... had me crying into my ramen noodles(I was in college at the time and lived on Ramen...)  
  
A few of mine:  
**Fushigi Yuugi** [for the](/s "heartwrenching death scenes")  
**Elfen Lied**  
**Saishuu Heiki Kanojo** "SaiKano"  
**Maria-sama ga Miteiru**  
**Usagi Drop**  
**Aishiteruze Baby**  
**Kimi ga Nozomu Eien**(not as good as the game, but they cheat their way to your tears a couple times in the anime)  
**Now and Then, Here and There**  
**Fruits Basket**  
**Kanon(2006)**  
**Tenchi Muyo: Manatsu no Eve**(It's a movie, the only Tenchi that I like, and really hit me in the feels in one scene)  
**Code Geass**(Primarily the finale scene(s) at the end of the last episode of R2 while [Continued Story](www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFVekqnj2cA) is playing.  I literally had no emotional reactions to anything for awhile after the first time I saw these scenes)  
**Turn-a Gundam**(again, at the very end.  While [Tsuki no Mayu](www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u4JNDV2R6c) is playing... primarily for a certain female character's scenes in the finale...)
  
  
  
And these made my cry for a COMPLETELY different reason...

"If like anime I'll like Angel Beats."

Seriously. It took me a bit to accept the world they 'live' in and the character's motivations because I have a very linear way of thinking. But I can honestly say I've never plowed through an anime faster, almost starving for the next episode by the time the credits rolled. I'm not an expert on newer animes and there was a lot of stuff in Angel Beats I've never experienced in other shows.

Your arguement is over the fact that the old ones are full of fights and gore, yet I have seen no anime gorier than Elfinlied. Angel Beats is something not everyone likes so I wont argue with you about not liking it.  Trigun on the otherhand wasn't that violent and the protagonist is a pasifist and only kills one person in the entire series.

The space-ships in outlaw star have arms.

So yeah. Go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
you left out that several times in the series, they use the arms on their ships to wrestle. so if "wrassling space ships" sounds good....

(also, the Outlaw Star itself has gigantic pistols that it pulls out with its space arms.)
>> ARTICLE
this is like apples and oranges, really, but I'd say its closer to Trigun than Bebop in its tone (completely different universe though.)

as far as what its about: Its about a few people who come into posession suitcase with a mysterious girl inside (yes, Firefly is not that original) and they steal a spaceship that was designed for a very specific purpose, and they go and have adventures as they bide time before they put the ship's primary design to use.

its good stuff. just watch it and enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I would say Bebop > Outlaw Star > Trigun, so go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
this, exactly. better than Trigun, not as great as Cowboy Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your statement. It's not as good as Cowboy Bebop, but it's superior to Trigun.
>> ARTICLE
If you consider both of those a 5 then I would say Outlaw Star is a 4. So yeah definitely worth a shot. 
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star is my favorite series of all time.  Just thinking about that show gives me shivers of awesomeness.

Outlaw Star has epic spaceship battles, awesome music, crazy cool characters and situations (prison episode rocks), and the animation is freaking cool, even though it's dated now.

Oh yeah, and Outlaw Star has my favorite anime weapon of all time: the mother-fucking Caster.
>> ARTICLE
I liked outlaw star a lot but it definitely is on a different level than Cowboy Bebop and Trigun(both of which i love). 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Outlaw Star and hold it in the same regard as Bebop and Trigun.  Some people hate on it, but I recommend watching it all the way through its only 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
'Outlaw Star' is actually quite amazing and I would consider it almost on the same level, but not quite as high as Bebop.  It's probably just below 'Trigun', in my opinion; however, there is one major drawback to 'Outlaw Star' and that is all of the filler episodes.  Literally from episode 5-20 is pure filler and only gives (what I consider) minimal character development.  However, if you can stomach those episodes and focus on the amazing plot, you will not be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
It's not particularly deep, but still entertaining.  There are definitely worse animes to watch.
>> ARTICLE
GET OFF HERE AND GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!!! Outlaw Star is probably my favorite series of all time. It has a great mixture of comedy, drama, has great character development, an amazing story, and it keeps your attention. The final arch is great and beautifully drawn, the opening theme is an epically bad 90s rock song full of guitar solos, hot sassy girls who kick-ass make up most of the main cast, the ships computer is amazing, the main character is a creep with a heart of gold, his sidekick is a spunky 12 year old genius. It follows every good anime stereotype in an amazing manner. You want a spunky cat girl? BAM! Meet Aisha, a shape shifter who can be super cute and crazy at the same time. You want an amazing samurai assassin? BAM! Meet Twilight Suzuka, she can cut a bus in half with a wooden sword with one cut. You like series with a girl-in-a-box? BAM! Meet Melfina, a girl who doesn't know who she is or why she is in the world. You will not be disappointed by this series, it is like all the great animes of the 90s blew up in your face! AND IT IS ALL IN SPACE!
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to give a different take on it and just say this... My memories of it on toonami did not stand up to a recent viewing. 
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star is brilliant on all three fronts mentioned, and like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop, has amazing action sequences.

The series is absolutely worth watching, and you will be hooked from episode one; even the dub is great. Watch it at night to get the full effect :)
>> ARTICLE
I would put Trigun and Outlaw Star on the same level of great if you have nostalgia for it, entertaining if you don't. Bebop on the other hand is top-tier.
>> ARTICLE
I like Outlaw Star a lot more than Trigun (but I still do like Trigun). I am not sure how to compare it to Bebop - the shows have very, very different approaches to space action/adventure. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a good anime. A must watch, as everyone else has said.
>> ARTICLE
Similar to Bebop, but not nearly as deep. Still not a bad anime, and a good one to watch with friends.

Hint: the drinking word is "The Galactic Leyline."
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star is decent, but if you're expecting Trigun or Cowboy Bebop you might want to look elsewhere. It's not a bad series, but it isn't a great one either. 
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star follows a lot more of the stereotypical 90s shonen conventions than Bebop or Trigun.  This is probably the main reason it's not remembered as a classic like the other two.  It didn't do a lot to differentiate its self.  If you want some shonen fun time, you're probably better off watching Gurren Lagann again.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently, r/anime is saying "your opinion is bad and you should feel bad"
>> ARTICLE
The 3 of them together comprise my favorite anime probably.  I lump them together as the 3 cowboy anime.  Outlaw Star is not as good as teh other 2 but they are still on the same tier.

Things which tie the series together for me include all of them having Heros who are already developed and bad-ass from the beginning, and strong sense of justice.

Moreover, all of them have a nice sense of discovery along the way, with pasts and mythology to be uncovered.
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star was okay for me but nothing special like the two you mentioned were.
>> ARTICLE
I put all three into the exceptional category. Comedy with very well written stories and engaging characters. I usually pair these 3 with the Gun X Sword as it shares quite a bit in common with the others.
>> ARTICLE
I remember enjoying it. Outlar Star taught me that it is typically better to watch a series in Japanese with subs if you can help it....ESPECIALLY if that series has any sort of cat girl. English dubs + catgirls = bleeding ears.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't touch Bebops greatness and is less of a comedy than Trigun, but I watched it before I watched the other two and still like it.  
>> ARTICLE
The Trigun Anime is hack cliche dribble that only people with pedestrian tastes will like. I've watched the series about ten times now and it is pathetic how poor the narrative is structured. There is no reason for you to worry about any of the characters, Wolfwood only dies because they changed the story so I didn't give a crap. What's worse is that none of the villains actually present a challenge to Vash because he can't be hurt. All of the 'danger' he's in is just the writer forcing him into that situation momentarily to try and amp up the tension, yet we know for a fact that Vash pretty much cannot get shot. And what does 99.9999% of all bad guys in the show use? Guns. 

Trigun is the lesser of the three shows because all the while it takes itself seriously. The humor is just a distraction from the depressing story that we're supposed to relate to. Outlaw Star is different from Trigun for a multitude of reasons. The most important two differences are this:

Outlaw Star isn't a serious show, it is primarily zany wacky comedy with some action. Where as Trigun is primarily about the depressing redemption story, with some comedy. Outlaw Star is good at being silly and the action sequences in space are pretty awesome. If you take the show seriously, you aren't going to like it. It isn't meant to make sense, it is more like a constant stream of Zack Snyder thoughts animated. Except funny. Outlaw Star is closer to Bebop by several multitudes (the setting is key for this), but they are still very different shows. Bebop shows how you do a redemption story right, Trigun does not. If I had to rate them?

Cowboy Bebop: 9/10
Outlaw Star: 7/10
Trigun: 5/10
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering if you have read the Trigun comics because honestly I thought they were superior to the anime in every way. They just offer much better story arcs, characterizations, art, and Vash is way less obnoxious. I just watched the anime recently because it was on Netflix and all I can think is damn the comic blows this out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
I would say that Cowboy Bebop and Trigun are pretty nearly the same story, with just the details different.  (You know, little things like Vash lives in the end, and Spike dies.)  Both have depressing stories overlaid with humor.

I would also say I really like Trigun.  Maybe the problem is that I have only watched it 3 or 4 times, but certainly not anything like 10 times.

Also, Vash can be shot.  He gets shot quite often, and has tons of scars for injuries not covered in the story.  Nothing in the story implies he can't die, though he doesn't.


>> ARTICLE
While I agree with your assessment of Trigun, if you disliked it so much, why did you watch it ten times?
>> ARTICLE
It is on a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
Ha, fair enough
>> ARTICLE
I think it's time we **blow** this scene, get everybody and **the stuff** together... okay, 3, 2, 1, **TRIP BALLS**.

And here we have our one and only true solo Ed episode. To everyone who thought this was going to be insightful: the fuck did you expect? The session is pretty much like Ed: strange, mercurial and almost entirely comic relief. 

The episode is just a constant stream of visual and running gags. I can't really fault the show that much for anything in terms of writing, sound or animation, the latter being pretty exceptional today. And as always the entire high paced, wacky vibe is perfectly executed. But whether today's episode succeeds or not depends mostly on whether you like Ed as a character and whether you like silly jokes.

I'll be honest and say that even though it's a fan favorite, I was personally not fond of this one. Don't get me wrong, I like silly humor and I did laugh at some of the jokes, like the coffin getting run over, or our female cowboy's arrest.

But the episode's big gags come off our characters being high as a kite and the chase. And I'm sorry, but both are not the least bit original. Our main three getting high had the benefit of being off the wall absurd, so it worked to some extent for me. 

As for the chase (and this is where I might get some flak) I genuinely *hated* it. I've never, ever remotely liked the trope of 'the unwitting, nave character being unaware of the danger surrounding them, but miraculously surviving all odds and winding up with the reward'. **IT IS LAZY AS FUCK.** I know I should be enjoying the motions, but I just hate that trope so goddamn much that it soured a lot of the episode for me. The episode redeemed itself somewhat with the 'reward' being worthless, but to me the damage had already been done. 

There we have it. There's almost nothing else to this one besides jokes, gags and high tempo action... almost. The one exception being that our main trio's delusions actually reveal some of their deepest hidden thoughts and feelings, ones they are denying and/or running away from normally, but ones we've already seen simmering below the surface.

But all in all, depending on your taste in humor this episode succeeds or does not. To me it's not all bad, but it's not nearly original enough to deserve its reputation as one of Bebop's best. 

Speaking of Bebop's best, tomorrow wil be the last of my three favorite episodes, where we return to our femme fatale... and a blast to the past.

Side note: I love Jet's introduction to tomorrow's episode. He's not saying anything that isn't true, but it turns out that nothing he says is actually a negative for the episode, even though it seems that way at first.   
>> ARTICLE
Hey there, I just began watching Cowboy Bebop a few days ago, and I've been reading through these threads along with the episodes. I know this post was made a month ago, but I wanted to comment about Ed in this episode, since I know that you don't feel there was much useful development shown, and you're right for the most part.

However, I do think we're shown one trait about Ed that is pretty great; she's a go-getter who is ready to stand up along with the rest of the cowboys and go after a bounty. I don't like useless characters, and although Ed would be the typical genki techno geek in any other show, the fact that she had no qualms about chasing after Domino on her own shows that she isn't just a squatter on the Bebop, but is really a part of the team. It's felt more like she's been a squatter up to this point, but here she gives us a taste of the potential that she has, even if it's all wrapped up in comedic hijinks. I still have to discover the other episodes, so I really hope that she continues to stand toe to toe with everyone else.

Anyway, that's my two cents. I really enjoy this show, and I like to hear what everyone else has to say about it.

I definitely wouldn't mark this one as a favorite. Bebop itself is such a masterpiece, I can't bring myself to say my favorite episode is the one that is basically summed up by "lol, they got high, bro."  

But I always get a good kick out of it. Spike walking up the endless stairs never fails to make me laugh. Excited for the next episode, it's definitely up there as far as my favorites go.

Bebop rarely changes pace, so let's enjoy it when it does. And do I enjoy it. No other session packs as many jokes and in my opinion none of them fall flat. However on this rewatch it was the directing that stood out.

* In the very first scene the camera pans 360 around our crew. While nice, what makes this scene great is the fact that the audio dynamically moves along with the camera so that the vocals always come from their logical direction. It's the little things I love.

* I cannot think of a single time the animation quality of Bebop dips, and this can be attributed to the show's great management of resources. Around 3:40 we sit on a [single frame](http://i.imgur.com/34ihMRA.png) for about 10 seconds. This scene ends up being fantastic in my opinion because it serves three purposes while being just a still frame. It serves as our establishing shot so that the audience knows we're on Earth, but it also builds tension as the audience wonders what the spec of light, which takes very few resources to animate, is. Finally the frame is also used as the shot in which we get our payoff as we hear the rumble of a ship crash. There is a notable delay between hearing the crash and the frame vibrating, which also takes very few resources, and this is necessary for the scene to make sense in our minds. If the vibration wasn't delayed it would appear that we're close to the crash and so the Bebop would have to have been much larger than a spec of light while falling. All the factors have to coalesce just right to work effectively and they do, providing one of my favourite scenes in the session.

* Bebop's animation quality is so good that we often forget it's age. Bebop was drawn on animation cells, so somethings that aren't too difficult today were difficult to Bebop. Take Ed and Ein's walking montage as an example. There are quite a few instances of the use of [haze](http://i.imgur.com/jLK0UpY.png) in the desert heat. This haze would've been difficult to animated at the time and yet Bebop does it flawlessly. The perfect track for this situation, [Chicken Bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5ofs3xbdc), does help the montage maintain it's bizarre mood.

* I have [a lot](http://i.imgur.com/m6xV0Ru.png) of questions about Jet's trip and they all go unanswered. Probably for the best...

I've always felt deep down that my interest in hallucinogenic drugs came from this episode, and I couldn't help but be a little disappointed that I didn't see the world become a giant ocean or attempt to climb a never ending staircase.

Yay this is my favorite episode through entire series. This episode is from a perspective of a kid (Ed) so enjoy it from kid's PoV! No need for deep analysis by adults.
