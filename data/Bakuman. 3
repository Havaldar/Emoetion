Great work man.

I would love to hear first part of Platinum disco from Nisemonogatari.

Definitely. Even if that's not how reddit works,

Oh god, this. OP, Ah need it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33y6vd/nisemonogatari_platinum_disco_mallet_arrangement/

It's not exactly 8-bit but it's close enough? =P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have heard that one and obviously loved it but i need more.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I'd be lying if I said I didn't come in here looking specifically for Platinum Disco, even though I'm already using the one I linked. 
>> ARTICLE
On that note, any of the other Monogatari OP/EDs would be awesome. I especially like Marshmallow Justice and Ambivalent World
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, all of these would work great.
>> ARTICLE
If you could do "only my railgun" or "sister's noise" from railgun, that would be great. (main parts)
>> ARTICLE
There is an [Only My Railgun mallet arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tpdDPoPXtY&ab_channel=AnimeMalletArrangements) that someone recently posted here if OP doesn't deliver/you want to use that.

Edit: There are also several 8 bit versions already out there, so you could look through those and see if you like the sound of any of them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I saw that mallet version a few days ago, but I forgot about that. I liked OP's style so I wanted to see how his work would be with those songs. Anyway thanks for the share.

These are great ^^.

Connect from Madoka Magica (it's the OP) would be great in this style https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9S2Irq5KE

The opening to Lemon Angel Project (and most of the songs featured in the anime) would sound good too.

Not exactly what you're looking for, but related:

I don't know how much this would help (if at all), but [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7swLsi4544w) and [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D81twfhxwa0) exist. They might help you tide over for the time being. Or not '~'

Oh god, Nichijou. I write chiptune and I think I might take a stab at those. No promises, though.

Could you do the first twenty seconds of the [Carnival Phantasm OP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvbaM-URygs) All of the ones you made so far are really good.

This is AWESOME! Currently at work, will check these out later. I'd love for you to do an 8-Bit version of "The Real Folk Blues" from *Cowboy Bebop.*
>> ARTICLE
Not OP, but I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofmXIpFxWrQ) and I think it's pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Can you do "Happily Ever After" by Nakagawa Shoko? It's one of the insert songs from Gurren Lagann? Thanks btw <3 
>> ARTICLE
Could I possibly request the intro for [Gundam 0079 opening please?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPB54YaZu5I) Just between 10 and 28 seconds in the video. It's already kind of retro so I think it'd fit perfectly as an 8-bit ringtone. The ones you did are really catchy, there's just something about 8-bit sounding stuff. Is there a word for it? I've always heard it been called chiptune.
>> ARTICLE
If I used any of these as my ringtones I wouldn't answer calls ever again.
>> ARTICLE
These are great! If you have the time/like it could you do the ED for [Kyoukai No Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwl6Polwq4Q)?
>> ARTICLE
[Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI4dOUQ1xaU)

The song from Bakemonogatari in 8 bit would be godlike.

If you decide to do this you can feel free to PM me if you need a 320kbps mp3.

Awesome pieces btw, am using the Gurren Lagann one atm.
>> ARTICLE
I would totally love a [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHDfeZqLA5I) version if possible! I think either the intro portion, or the chorus would be awesome.

The parts I'm thinking are the first 13 seconds, and the section from around [0:48 - onward](https://youtu.be/YHDfeZqLA5I?t=48).
>> ARTICLE
[Just search on youtube for the title of the anime you want and add 8bit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrSMOvErHOM) :)
>> ARTICLE
You're right -- and I found a couple more. But I'd like to hear OP's take on it as well, as these others sound, dare I say it... a little bland?

edit: Bland may not be the right word, but perhaps just a little too true to 8-bit style. I like the chiptune sound of OP's tracks more.

Komm susser tod would be wonderful. Either the intro, or "It just keeps tumbling down" from 2:22.

Hell yeah on that. I'm actually using a guitar cover of Komm susser Tod as my ringtone right not but I'd switch to an 8-bit version easily if it's the same quality as OP's.

What is this guitar cover of Komm susser tod, if you don't mind me asking?

I took the audio from [this cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeVRd7VWo5M). Specifically, I have the ringtone start at [2:25](https://youtu.be/VeVRd7VWo5M?t=2m25s). MP3 link in the description if you're interested.

Thanks bro that was the one that I wanted most 
>> ARTICLE
I liked the SAO one. The sound font seems different.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah me too. These are all cool but the one that actually appealed to me was the SAO. I'm not even sure how to put it in the words but the others felt a bit too electronical.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's mostly just that it's simpler. Didn't recreate all the different instruments/parts, and only used one waveform for the 2 layers I did use. Wasn't sure if people would like them more barebones, or more faithful to the originals. I'll try to use a variety of styles in the future!

I just want to mention that crossing fields really made me think of something out of  a NES game.

Great work, I loved the Kill la Kill one.

If I may, I'd suggest Ideal White from Fate/Stay Night UBW season 1. It has a great intro to be made into an 8-bit ringtone.

Here's a few that I'd like if you don't mind:

[Skyclad no Kansokusha, from 1:02 to 1:32](https://youtu.be/9qY-fdXgWQQ?t=1m2s)

[Another Heaven, from 3:53 to 4:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qAE_Th1b_4&feature=youtu.be&t=3m53s)

Can you do the intro of Mirai Nikki? That would be amazing!

Haha "Before my body is dry"is dope.

I train MMA and fantasize having it for my "walk out" intro song before a fight lol!

DONT LOSE YOUR WAY
>> ARTICLE
Do you think you could make versions of these without all of the slides? To be honest I think you used sliding notes a little bit too liberally.

Edit: the Sorairo Days one is really good
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed that too on a few of them (especially the ones I did first). These were my first attempts in 8-bit stuff, so I'm still kind of tuning things :P . Should be more balanced in the future! If there's a specific one you want I can edit it real quick and shoot you a download link.

oh if you could to the FMA:B ones that would be the best

I think a great one would be the Angel Beats intro :D

Well... there's only one opening. I don't have it, but I found some other stuff from [Hunter x Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMHlAAIKcM) though

Probably as 8bit would sounds quite the same
>> ARTICLE
Thats pretty good :D
>> ARTICLE
Can you do the intro (first ~5 seconds or so) or the chorus of Bloody Stream?  
It's the second OP to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) if you can't find it by the song name. And it's fucking amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The YuYu Hakusho theme would be awesome. From the intro, if you do it.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone can check out [this person's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsej4tgCoXDgVH3J7M3NMgw/videos) for some good 8-bit stuff as well.
>> ARTICLE
I had high hopes for the Lucky Star one, but I guess it's kinda impossible for it to be a nice transition haha  
Kidding aside, most of those are really great. I especially like Sorairo Days and Unravel.  
What I'd really love is a rendition of any of Madoka's opening themes, OP.

Let me just say you're like a dream come true for me because I've always wanted to have a ringtone like that! Thank you!

Now, as for my request, I'd be very thankful if you could do the intro to aLIEz by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki (one of Aldnoah Zero EDs).

Edit: Also, this song isn't released in the ost yet, but maybe you could try doing the insert song in ep 2. of Triage X which appears between 2:20 and 2:35

[Tora Dora 8bit opening. Posted a while ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZT8BPhcDJk)

No offence to you but this doesn't sound 8-bit at all because of all the chords and reverb. It sounds like someone's dragged a VST or two over a fan MIDI.

[Here's a quick example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaPkApPnQw) I made a while ago as a response to someone taking credit for someone elses MIDIs. Compare it with OPs which sound a lot more authentic!

Someone explain to me how to make this my iphone ringtone!
>> ARTICLE
Pretty impressive stuff. Is this done through ear on a tracker or transcribed into piano roll/VST?
>> ARTICLE
Just done in a piano roll after listening a billion times, because it's the fastest method for me right now. The hardest part is dealing with songs that have complex chords/basslines that are also VERY quiet >.> . Can be a little tedious but it's fun!
>> ARTICLE
These are nice. I think they need a bit more 'pop' I think? Like a way to make them more attention grabbing for something like a ringtone.
>> ARTICLE
I agree I think! Still trying to find a good balance between loud and complex. If I have too many different parts, it's super faithful to the original, but not great as a ringtone. Of course, I don't wanna make it too simple either. I'll continue to tune things in. Thanks for listening!
>> ARTICLE
Lost Heaven from Fullmetal Alchemist, I think it's from one of the movies. Either part. Into and chorus, or the chorus medley at the end.

I normally look for these on Zedge, but u have an Android phone. On iPhone (someone asked) I think you can import as ringtone with iTunes on your PC? As for getting them, a few are on YouTube, look for a downloader. If it's only on Zedge, and some are, someone with Android can get it for you (they download as mp3) or you can run the Android emulator in the SDK I suppose.

I second a redo of the SAO opening, it feels like it kinda loops and just doesn't have that individuality to it. And maybe the end opening of the second season, Courage, dunno why but that really resonates with me, from the 50 second mark, that little section which might be the chorus?

I'm more interested to know how OP made these. An instructional video would save them a lot of time and be more a contribution to the community than individually trying to tend to everyone's request. 

Please OP, an instructional video of the process would be great!

>> ARTICLE
HELLO THERE. Month late reply, because I'm a terrible person.
I'm working on Vol. 3 of the Ringtone collection now, and I wanted to do the KnT OP you mentioned. I just listened to it for the first time and IT'S QUITE DOPE. Would you prefer to have the part near the beginning (where the drums start), or the chorus? Both sound cool I think, but doing the whole song would take forever. I'll also have to find a good mp3 but I'll figure that out somehow xD

Thanks for listening :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha. All good. Just happy you saw the post, and listened to the song. 

I suppose the chorus has more going on for it, but it's truly up to you, as you are making them. 

Thank you. 
>> ARTICLE

Speaking of the current airing shows, I really dig the OP of Triage X. Not sure how good it would sound in 8 bit though.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWstRASJVek) it is. Especially the part that starts around 1:00/1:01

Take my up vote for this awesome series and your work to write this WT.

I can only agree that Bakuman is worth the time watching it. 

Started and finished the manga and I was overjoyed when the 1st ep of the anime aired. 
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this about a week ago, and I literally finished season 3 10 minutes ago. Bakuman is actually one of my top 3 favorite anime, out of over 160 series finished, truely a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the compliment :)
>> ARTICLE
it was such a pain to wait for a new manga chapter...every week...

Now I can freely read or watch any amount I want. (Did a rewatch in sommer last year :) )
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman was one of the few manga that I eventually lost patience for release, & used scanlation sites for. Couldn't help but notice that the story was happening **NOW**! (2010)

It should be noted that the first 2 seasons are on Hulu/Neon Alley (Viz's own site, which I prefer to support).
>> ARTICLE
Woah, this is the first I've heard of Neon Alley. But sadly it's just yet another place which I can't use; there is no love for non-US users.

But really, I know tons of people who would happily pay for anime if they could, but all they have as an option is Crunchyroll (which would only offer them Gintama and Naruto in their region).
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the US, but I often hear the option of "using a VPN" when trying to log onto a foreign site.

I hope it works
>> ARTICLE
Well, I would if there were good free ones -_-

Because it would really feel sucky to *pay* for a VPN to watch what is *free* for a bunch of other people for crummy licensing reasons


>> ARTICLE
Yes! Shonen Jump preview! & Jumpland 2009.
>> ARTICLE
You might enjoy this a bit more too if you know the mangaka behind some of the popular WSJ manga at the time, such as Eiichiro Oda and Hideaki Sorachi. Their personalities find their way into characters in Bakuman.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really read manga much; would you mind telling me more about those authors?
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that I've actually not yet finished Bakuman, but I know a few things about it and the inspirations. So yeah.

Well, I believe Oda is the main inspiration behind Eiji. He's always been talented, has an insanely active and odd mind, and is full of ideas. He's the creator of One Piece. 

Sorachi is the inspiration of Kazuya Hiramaru. Someone who has struggled a lot, but is ultimately a different kind of genius.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty cool. Thanks for letting me know!
>> ARTICLE
Wow after you wrote these names and I searched for their published manga I really can relate them to the Bakuman characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Hiramaru is a composite of Sorachi and Togashi. Togashi also likes to use antropomorphic animals as characters, and is commonly praised for authoring very interesting works.

Fukuda is probably inspired by Tamura Ryuhei.

Aoki = probably a composite of Amano Akira and Naoko Takeuchi.
>> ARTICLE
I need a Niizuma Eiji spinoff, I would watch the hell out of that shit.  Amazing voice actor.  CRAWRRR!
>> ARTICLE
He's my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! He was just *so* likeable as a character, and it really made the show much better with him as the main rival.
>> ARTICLE
I was planning on writing one but this is much better!

Bakuman is an amazing journey as you see the characters grow up throughout the show and their lives. 

Also there are Death Note references too as you pointed out it is by the same combo of Ohba & Obata (who just released a new monthly manga too which is amazing so far).

A complete adaptation for the most part, a few things were skipped, but overall great. One my favorite shows!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your kind praise! It definitely makes me want to write more about anime (although most other things have already been covered)
>> ARTICLE
Ohba and Obata recently started a new manga, Platinum End which is really good so far as well if anyone is into manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nice series and I've had a blast binge watching it over Chirstmas. My personal nitpicks, though:

* It seems to condone things that I believe to be serious problems with Japanese society. Working yourself to death, absent father, sexless marriage - those things are never morally assessed and are presented "as they are".
* It's a shounen through and through. The whole main cast is either unrealistically young or acts too young for their age.
* I actually liked how the main duo has progressed. For such a rage-inducing premise they played it really well.
* The main plot was really well-paced. Didn't expect it to be that nicely timed.
* I wasn't satisfied with the resolution for the secondary characters, though. [endgame spoiler](/s "Aoki's marriage came kinda out of nowhere, she had more potential dynamic with Fukuda, but hey, it's Japan, the girl cannot be active in the relationship, it's all on the guy - also, for the love of God, Iwase has sexual frustration written all over her face, she deserved at least a one night stand with just about anyone from the cast, from either gender")

EDIT: Overall, personally, I cannot possibly agree with a 10/10 note. I wouldn't give that even to Shirobako, and by all accounts it was a better anime, even in its halfway done state.
>> ARTICLE
>Iwase

Completely agree. [Spoilers](/s "I could be wrong, but I remember both her and Kosugi having a discussion near the end. Not sure if it was implied, but they seemed well off together. In my mind, them ending up together would be a nice touch as both were in need of someone")
>> ARTICLE
Eh, you really expected sex stuff from this? Beck and Nana are similiar series with more relationship stuff, maybe you should try them (assuming you already haven't).
>> ARTICLE
I meant *affection*, which indicates a healthy physical relationship that a marriage should be. Takagi and Miyoshi never show any after getting married. It's as if them getting hitched was a plot device to keep Kaya around for exposition purposes without ever revisiting their relationship again. She even sleeps in a single-person bed.

It's not my major problem with the show - Mashiro's (lack) of relation with his father being left completely without any commentary or impact, and regarding his uncle dieing of overworking as a positive thing are - but still kinda a problem.

As for Iwase, it was 100% a joke. She and many others were just left without any closure.
>> ARTICLE
[It's a bit small, but the bed doesn't seem like a single (from ch 75 pg9)](http://imgur.com/kxxdt8t)
>> ARTICLE
Well color me puzzled.

Still it all looked a bit alarming in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
You echoed my thoughts but missed one that almost put me off the show. Mashiro's parents relationship and their initial relationship with him. 
>> ARTICLE
I've just finished it and it was awesome !
>> ARTICLE
My biggest problem with the show has to be the characters, i understand that they are supposed to be caricatures of other people in the industry but there were times where the characters didn't even feel human (the biggest example of this being the awfully unrealistic romance).

I also always thought that the whole section where the director tells them that it's their fault and not the editor's is absolute bullshit but i guess that's Japanese culture for you.

Besides that the show itself was incredibly enjoyable and highly addictive, i would definitely recommend it to anyone since it really gives you a good (although obviously exaggerated) look at the manga industry.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap it's been 3 years since the manga ( 2 years since the anime ended).

There is not much difference between the manga and the anime, except the anime leave out an arc (that many consider to be the worst), and the anime adds some extra fluff here and there (especially at the ending).
Bakuman is not a perfect work, but it was very enjoyable. The main criticism I have read about Bakuman, which carries over from Death Note, is that Ohba does not know how to write female characters. They are often more shallow and some people have said his writing is quite sexist.

But, besides that I am very surprised that Bakuman is not talked about more, it seems many people know about it, yet it is never brought up. It is one of my top 5, very good characters and story imo. I re-read the manga recently and couldn't put it down. Would recommend Bakuman. 

>> ARTICLE
Call me stupid, but I didn't find the writing of the characters is too sexist, at least in comparison to the Japanese culture. I never found Kiyomi Takada or even Misa Amane or Miho or Miyoshi too far beyond "realistic" comic characters.

In fact, Kiyomi & Miho both looked to be model citizens, & intriguing, stoic leader-types.
>> ARTICLE
I agree.  I haven't seen Death Note, but I found the female characters of Bakuman to be strong, driven individuals who didn't take garbage from anyone.  Miho, Kaya, and Aoki had lots of other admirable qualities as well.

I was also thinking of Iwase. I've never been able to finish it, & the hype/motivation dies off after half-a-decade, so you forget names.

But Aoki was set up very well. There are actually very nice-but-also-very-attractive ladies I knew in real life; there are also very preppy types, like Iwase; loud (but not anime-loud) types, like Kaya; real-life moe types (femme-smart) like Miho, etc.

The most unrealistic characters were the young adults, Shinta & Fukuda I think.
>> ARTICLE
I finished this series last week. I was so impressed that I actually searched for the creators of this manga/anime. I never did this before. I was never interested in checking who made X manga/anime. But this series is special, will always have a separate spot for me.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is great. I'd say it's the Ohba/Obata duo's best work. I like it more than Death Note (and, at the moment, Platinum End).

I loved all the references it had to real manga, like One Piece and Gintama. And some of the manga made by the characters looked awesome (Otters 11 got its own real-life one-shot, but I'd like to see Crow as a real manga).
>> ARTICLE
I liked the two main protags and also their rivals a lot (mostly) but I wasn't a fan of the main romance at all.

It just seemed so silly and childish. Thankfully there were enough good things to overshadow that aspect of the show (which wasn't even needed to be the main motivation, felt forced)
>> ARTICLE
> Bakuman, is an anime from the creators of Death Note

No wonder why I thought Hattori looked so similar to Ryuk
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! And also the start of Death Note was [DN episode 1](/s "Light finding a notebook"), while in Bakuman. it was Mashiro [Bakuman episode 1](/s "forgetting his notebook")
>> ARTICLE
I really loved bakuman too. Haven't watched season 3 because i binge watched the first 2 seasons and the 3rd one felt a bit too much and i had to take a break. The anime has great character development, probably one of the best i've seen in any anime.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first 2 seasons and then I was in another country with my family for vacation, so I had a forced break before the last season, and I think that actually *increased* my enjoyment of the show. So I think you can easily pick it back up
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman. is also my number 1 favorite anime. I remember reading the manga when it first came out and I watched the anime about 4 months ago(I started watching more anime about 3 years ago but I've always been reading manga). I love all of the characters especially Yoshida and Hiramaru. Those two always gave me a good laugh, especially to the end.
>> ARTICLE
Totally! Those two always brought a stupid-looking grin to my face and had me laughing throughout
>> ARTICLE
I have only read it, and in my opinion, the ending is crappy. Did the anime do this better or no?

>> ARTICLE
It ends the same, but there's a *slight* bit of extra stuff after the ending. It's not really worth watching if you read it.
>> ARTICLE
I also didn't think much of the ending.

But there really was no other easy way to end it imo, so I just see it as alright. The most enjoyable part of the anime though was the journey, imo.
>> ARTICLE
I understand it's an anime [but massive spoiler] (/s "I don't think any kid is gonna graduate from HS and ask his crush to be his wife after they've both got to their dream and decide to never meet until then but even they still met before") It's like [why] (/s "don't you just fucking date and achieve your goal while you date and get married later?")

Other than that one problem I had with it, I felt that the show was one of the better throwbacks in anime.
>> ARTICLE
You can kinda explain the reason with Mihos [mindset](/s "as she loves Mashiro so deeply, that she knows for herself, that she would just invest all her time to chase after him (just being the girlfriend) instead of chasing after her own dream.")

When I'm looking around how many of my friends lose big things of themselves in a relationship, I kinda can accept this as a reason... but yeah, looking at the length... it's clearly an anime-only-theme :D
>> ARTICLE
Their relationship is cheesed up for drama but there are some people that willingly put off relationships to focus on careers. It just happens the two of them had each other in mind for after they could relax a little. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, (first spoiler) that is definitely unrealistic. It bugged me, but not enough to reduce how enjoyable it was, in my opinion, because the main focus was usually the hard work in making manga and the main duo's struggles
>> ARTICLE
Found this series randomly halfway trough last year and I devoured it in less than 72 hours, really loved it, dreamed of an actual Reversi adaptation, but I honestly couldn't accept such far fetched relationship. Oh well, at least the end fixed some of my issues and didn't leave a bitter taste! 
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I had an issue with their relationship too, but I took it more as a fantasy/idealistic approach to that because of his goal/promise/uncle etc., and why I prefer Kaya & Akito's relationship a lot more.") But still, it doesn't detract from the anime imo.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it until I looked back on it to realise how ridiculous the love story is. It didn't change my view of the anime because I still enjoyed for everything it is.
>> ARTICLE
@spoiler 2:

Dude, have you seen their infernal schedules? They wouldn't have had time for any [](/s "dating").
>> ARTICLE
They still could of done it before they [](/s "became VAs and mangakas as they get no free time at all, especially the latter.")
>> ARTICLE
Hello, 

I just started this 2 days ago! I've only seen 3 episodes so far but it's really intriguing and I'm probably going to binge on it tonight. 
>> ARTICLE
bakuman is realy a great a story , but the end in manga is better.

>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga (but I would like to one day if I can); would you mind telling me how it ends in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Same way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. Then I guess they executed it better or something like that?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... Bakuman is a nice show. Was actually on my list for my own WT!, but I don't have enough time right now :-/ So I'm being lazy and just scream +1 :D

I like the main theme of Bakuman with its shonen "If you just work hard enough, all your impossible dreams will become real!"-theme. And that's probably also the reason, why I kinda like the [ending.](/s  "It's just ''feel good'' and one of the anime I can rewatch some episodes when I'm sick...")

Of course one could nitpick a lot about being hypocritical/twisted in some aspects of its world/society views (especially from the western point of view), about unrealistic growth, stupid decisions, unrealistic romance, bla bla bla... but in the end the anime achieve what it wants to be... and sometimes that is just enough :)
>> ARTICLE
Heh, the only reason I could write this was because of vacation ;)

I think you put why I love Bakuman so much perfectly with the latter part of your post; I wish I was able to phrase my thought quite as well 
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga a few times and it still stands as my favourite of all time. I've came to understand it's not without flaws and isn't as perfect as when my first read through, but this series will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you for doing this WT and I really hope more people get to read this fantastic masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
I read a few volumes of the manga years ago when I was getting into Manga/Anime. It was pretty great. Didnt realise it was so long.
>> ARTICLE
It's only like 5 years old, too, so many of us, I think, read it as it released, without a set ending
>> ARTICLE
One of the most interesting points in Bakuman itself is how I find most of Takagi's ideas can be a hit manga. And the differences between many authors' and editors' styles. Thank you so much for making this thread. 

But the anime definitely should use blue bird for the end scene though. It would be much powerful :-) 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the movie on the plane and thought it was pretty funny and good. Is there a lot more in the anime?
>> ARTICLE
As much as I didn't enjoy the anime, the manga was perfect. Read it if you dislike the anime version ! :)
>> ARTICLE
Dang. Hearing that makes me want to get all the volumes; RIP my wallet :(
>> ARTICLE
Bump. Great series and WT! I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
You can't bump on reddit you silly rabbit.
>> ARTICLE
Gomen gomen 
>> ARTICLE
"...as long as it doesn't affect PCP"

Yeah, that's gonna happen...

I haven't read the manga, but I imagine the drama CD will also do poorly, and it'll affect Miho's chances of being the VA if they get an anime.  There's no guarantee that VAs used drama CDs are used in animes after all.  The show seems to be foreshadowing that a little bit, but I'm just theorizing.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they say the Drama CD did really well cause of Takagi's story?
>> ARTICLE
We don't know yet.  Takagi decided that he'd revise the work on the drama cd (done by a not as good director or something), and submit an interesting crime story into it, so that it would have comparable quality to the manga.

However, I don't believe anything was brought up yet about its success.
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure? I could have sworn that the drama CD was a big hit and that's why they wanted to start making a novel.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure they just got a novel offer and a Drama CD offer at around the same time and aren't actually related to each other.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing how poorly that they're doing in terms of creating an anime, I feel like the end of this season will not be the end of the show. I think that this season will wrap up with them JUST getting an anime, and the fourth will be what they face creating more stories, conflicts with Jack, and problems with voice actors.

Just my 2 cents

>> ARTICLE
goodnight sweet prince.
>> ARTICLE
As a fan who was somewhat let down by the manga's ending, I thought that the anime's epilogue was a welcome inclusion and did the manga justice.
>> ARTICLE
the manga didn't show what happened to the rest of the sub chars? how did the manga end?
>> ARTICLE
Manga ends with Miho and Mashiro basically saying that they will be always staying by each others sides (after sharing a kiss)...nothing else, no closure with any of the other minor characters, it just ends with that with no epilogue chapter after.

I guess it is supposed to be symbolic of "ending a manga the way you want" vs "being forced to end it"

I hope i don't have to come back and spoil this...i shouldnt have to, but if i do someone tell me.
>> ARTICLE
Your post should be fine, the discussion is marked as spoilers anyways.
>> ARTICLE
ahh, thanks for clarifying it for me
>> ARTICLE
It was a great anime and i'm glad I stuck through it from start to finish. Also, the Reversi anime gave me a real Death Notey feel. I guess that is to be expected.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, The author had to figure out how to make a super interesting manga without distracting the main focus from the plot of Bakuman. Thus, recycle a previous work that has been critically acclaimed.
>> ARTICLE
An expected but well executed ending. It was a wonderful anime with a lot of character. I've watched the first season and second season about three times, but I must admit that the tension decreased a bit overall. It's mainly that my favourite part were their original ideas for new manga or one-shots, that "story inside a story" feeling and that naturally was less present as it showcased their ogoing serialization and the Death Note reference (which was a smart choice, but I couldn't help being a bit disappointed).

If you look at the art and mood of Bakuman it's remarkable that it's done by the Death Note duo. These aspects are completely different, yet you see the same thought-through storyline and character designs that fit said story perfectly.

A lot of things about Bakuman are typical shounen-anime/manga elements and yet they were not content with just projecting it on a realistic, uncommon setting. The character developements had a unique twist to them and felt really sincere. The side-cast isn't just used as a means of projection to showcase the main characters, they felt alive and made for a cohesive network that evolved naturally, it rarely felt forced at any given time.

Fanboy over.
>> ARTICLE
or Zombie Gun
>> ARTICLE
Waited almost a year for the story to get a proper ending as the manga felt so abrupt and it was worth it since this is one of my favorite stories. They did cut a few of the smaller arcs out but I feel they handled the main plot in the best way possible, so for me it felt just right. They wrapped up all of the characters stories and even explored a bit of the anime for Reversi which I thought was great because it was such a neat way to exemplify the moment that their dream became reality.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this anime, their work ethic was infectious and drove me to push myself harder with my music.

While it wasn't perfect, its message was. 
>> ARTICLE
nothing unexpected i guess :P they wrapped up everything nicely and that last kiss was rather sudden at that moment didn't expect it right there but well...can't say i didn't like how it went.

also moving in to the new house made it clear that they are together eventhough i would have rather had some wedding scene at the end but the hiramaru one made up for that one.

all in all i loved all 3 seasons and the unique idea behind the manga/anime...really refreshing after watching too much mainstream (though i won't say no to more romcom :D and manly tears drama)

ahhhh i liked the reversi OP and how the shadow in the anime looked like ryuk at some point^^
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely loved this series from start to finish. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel so sad that it's actually over. Loved the entire three seasons. Lets see what the next manga the author will come up with. :)
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea that it was ending until it was all said and done D:.  Enjoyed every episode, and it's a real shame that it has come to an end.
>> ARTICLE
Another fantastic anime has just ended this past week. I am so sad that they all have ended, but even more so this one. I have been watching this for a long time now, it feels sad to let it go. Either way I enjoyed the ride and cannot wait for the next anime for me to get into.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked how they staggered the seasons. At the end of it I almost felt like I had been growing up with them.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love watching anime where the characters grow up. Bakuman was one and so was Hikaru no Go. I don't know of many others.
>> ARTICLE
[Major](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?q=Major), would be one of the great ones.

Are there any others?

>> ARTICLE
Awesome thanks, I will definitely be checking these out.
>> ARTICLE
I am glad it has turned out the way it did. I hadn't liked the apparent direction the characters were taking the last two episodes. But the last couple of minutes in this episode really sent my nerd chills into overdrive.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, just when I thought the anime was slipping, it brought itself back up
>> ARTICLE
I loved how Masshiro and Takagi just started fist fighting each other as an attempt to remove their misunderstandings.
>> ARTICLE
I hate having to wait a week every episode, but neither can I resist the urge to watch it. Thinking I may re-watch it all once it finishes, since I forget alot of stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a bad development. I believe Mashiro should realize his lovelife by himself. And as such he should create the manga that will be animated by himself. Even if it will be just some oneshot. They had a chance to let him grown there :(

On the other side, that Takagi just plays the role of some teacher and that they put up some action in the end, was really good. But i think the whole story in this episode was too fast. They had played out it for some more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, when he kept going on about how he couldn't get the dialogue down, I was hoping he would do what Eiji did with Crow and have no dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
I personally liked the ending of that arc. Admittedly, yes, it would be nice for Mashiro to realize his lovelife by himself, but as stated a few times by the anime, they are a team, and they want to stay a team. Plus, he wouldn't be able to be as social as he is right now if it weren't for people like Takagi helping him.
>> ARTICLE
Well, yes and no. They are a team at work, and friends in private. But there are also some things anyone must make out for themself. Point is that I don't see that Mashiro has really grown up as a person, or a man. He is working with Takagi, grown in work and as an artist, but is still kinda like a good (work)wife, always staying behind, stuttering at private things and kinda targetless. Basicly he has barly change since given the promise, and besides the overromantic dream of someday marrying, he does'nt follow any specific goals for his future. Like where will they live, how many children should they have, what will they do for their first date... The Contest-manga was a chance to let him think about all this. Heck, it was even a great chance to grow up as an artist, by creating some dialogless story, like that one crow(?)-chapter.

>> ARTICLE
As someone who has read the manga, can someone tell me where we are at in the anime?
>> ARTICLE
Just after when Takagi wanted to do work on Rabuta, but decided against it
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, there is a lot left for them to do...so a 4th (maybe 5th depending on pacing) is plausible.
>> ARTICLE
Really disappointed with the love fest, it was quite possibly my favorite arc in the manga because i thought it was hilarious and they just kinda breezed through it in the anime, made me sad
>> ARTICLE
So im obviously not a hater (since im still watching and its 3rd season now) but does this formula (gotta start a new manga!) seem a little repetitive?


>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
[](#nozakishock)

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.

Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.

Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Quite frankly, I would enjoy seeing the anime in its entirety, while some parts of the manga may not have been as popular, I'd really like to see the while story in anime form.

I'll spoiler my post for those who haven't read the manga, but it's rather minor so it's not a big deal if you read the first two. **Last part is definitely big spoilers.**

I am really enjoying the manga too. I'm not that far in though. Is it reasonable to think they will wrap up the story with this anime season or is there still a lot of ground to cover from the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Can't say for sure.  It is jump, so there's a decent chance that they made a deal with the production to milk this show if it proves popular.  There could be filler.  I'd guess that they would need a fourth season to completely finish the manga without leaving stuff out, and with no filler added in.

Cool, well as long as the third is as strong as the first 2 I'm all for more :)

The most underrated anime. But probably one of the best mangas I have ever read. I hope the anime finishes properly. It has to.

I agree, I think the anime is really well done, along with the manga from what I've read so far.  I've heard people bring up the manga before as being really good, but never heard much about the anime. I think it does a solid job of keeping true to the source material and bringing the characters to life in just the way I imagined.

Gives me a reason to finish Season 2.  I sort of randomly stopped because I figured one would have to read the manga to see the actual ending; I really didn't think there would be a season 3.

I decided since it looked good, I would watch the first two seasons before s3 came out. So, about a month ago I watched s1(in a day, because it was so good) it was a wonderful experience, and i gave it an 8/10. Then about 2 weeks ago I started s2 and it was much better than the fist season, and I gave it a 9/10. So now I have high expectations for s3 and I can't wait. Hopefully the pattern persists, and it will be worthy of a 10/10

TTGL Episode 4

>Takami Akai, the producer of the series and a co-founder of Gainax, announced that he would resign his position effective episode five, which aired on April 29, 2007, over comments that he made regarding posts on the Japanese Internet forum 2channel. Akai and another Gainax employee, Keiko Mimori, made disparaging remarks about comments criticizing the animation style of the fourth episode of Gurren Lagann, which was completely directed by guest and friend Osamu Kobayashi. With regard to reading the fan criticisms, Akai stated that it was "like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply." Fans later became aware of his comments, and he announced his departure from the company he helped to found.

That might be more culture related than anything else... it is not uncommon to rear about japanese (and korean as well) managers/directors resigning over something that affects their reputation that elsewhere would be considered pretty harmless. 

The Japanese VA for Asuka (NGE) Yko Miyamura got into some crazy trouble over a sex tape - she literally moved to Australia because her reputation had been tarnished, even though that was really unrelated to her professional work...

If I'm not wrong, there was some issue a few years back where people working with the author of the shirokuma cafe manga gave go-aheads to the producers of the anime adapting the manga without the authors knowledge and consent. Eventually when the author found out she put the manga on hiatus, thanking the makers of the anime while voicing displeasure with those who were working with her. The people working on the anime did not know that the author was not informed of what they worked on for the anime, and so continued production thinking that everything was approved by the author. This was referenced in the shirobako anime where a similar incident happens in the anime. Interestingly, some of the people working on the shirobako anime worked on the shirokuma cafe anime too.

Voice actress [Aya Hirano](http://myanimelist.net/people/4/Hirano_Aya/) has been involved in a few things that led to her being dubbed the "scandal seiyuu."

[ELI5 Thread on the topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1ymcz1/eli5_aya_hirano_scandal/)
>> ARTICLE
God I hate otakus.  The fact that her career was actually damaged because she was having sex is such bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
It goes a little beyond "having sex," honestly.  Before the scandal occurred, she had already made it known she had a thing for older men, so the fact that she was "having sex" was already out there.  Post-coitus photos then surfaced, leading to the revelation that she was "having sex" with everyone in her band, minus the bassist.  She was officially the Grace Slick of Japanese idols.  While that may not seem career-damaging in the West, idols in Japan are expected to uphold a certain notion of morality, which, in light of the circumstances, she clearly didn't.  Don't think for a second she didn't know those "rules" going into her career.  She thought she was above the law, so to speak (or just wouldn't get caught), and she paid a price for her hubris, however briefly.  I don't blame otaku, nor do I shed one tear for consequences entirely of her own making and which, ultimately, only affected her short-term.
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with you. Bashing the anime that you work on, plus having sex with multiple men and allowing photos to surface, then making fun of your fans despite knowing full well what the industry was like is nothing less than her fault. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, it sure as hell can be tough to try and shed some light on the other side of the story here on /r/anime.


>> ARTICLE
Nice victim blaming you got there.

I assume the photos weren't published by her under her own volition, which means somebody published them without her consent, thus damaging her career. She did not need to "allow" or "prevent" those pictures to be published: the person(s) that leaked them should have not done that.
>> ARTICLE
And is it not her fault for allowing them to be taken?
>> ARTICLE
Again with the victim blaming, congrats.

What if she wanted them to be taken because she likes that particular thing?

What if those pictures were taken with her under duress, or under pretence?

Just because you consent to having your picture taken, or you take the picture yourself, it does not mean you consent to having that picture published/leaked.

The issue is that somebody violated her trust and decided to damage her career, or slight her personally; the person, or persons doing that are the wrong party, and they have the whole blame.

You can accuse Aya Hirano to hold fans of her work as a VA in contempt  which is a minor etiquette infraction; you cannot make her the villain for anything else.
>> ARTICLE
> What if she wanted them to be taken because she likes that particular thing?

And this is somehow not her fault?

>What if those pictures were taken with her under duress, or under pretence?

Say something about it

>Just because you consent to having your picture taken, or you take the picture yourself, it does not mean you consent to having that picture published/leaked.

Those are potential risks that come along with the action. Once you commit an action, you accept the potential consequences. 

>The issue is that somebody violated her trust and decided to damage her career, or slight her personally; the person, or persons doing that are the wrong party, and they have the whole blame.

Not really. By trusting someone, you accept that they may betray your trust. Simple as that. She's a victim, but she's also partly to blame.


>> ARTICLE
This is *literally* the same argument as "if she didn't want to be raped she shouldn't have worn such skimpy clothing."

Not even close. There's a difference between being held down against your will and consenting to sex, and also consenting to pictures being taken of you and those getting out because you entrusted them with someone.

>> ARTICLE
> I appreciate the idea that idols are expected to be not just entertainers, but role models as well. 

Honestly. If you want millions of people to literally idolize you, it should be your top priority to be someone worthy of being looked up to.
>> ARTICLE
Not all voice actresses want to be idolized. Some get in the industry because they just love anime. It's a niche culture in Japan and most anime series don't hit the mainstream so many voice actresses don't get to that point. Voice actresses are only human.
>> ARTICLE
> Not all voice actresses want to be idolized.

Again, it's a consequence. It's like saying I don't want people to know what I do in my spare time or have the paparazzi follow me, but I want to be an actor. It's a consequence that you have to accept.
>> ARTICLE
True. But it doesn't mean that voice actresses have to have a top priority of being this amazing nice person when they aren't. I would say it's better to be true to yourself and face the consequences rather than live a lie.  

And it's not a consequence that we have to accept. What Aya Hirano did is an extreme but you have these otakus attack seiyuus for having a boyfriend. The fandom gets insanely bad in not only Japan but in Korea as fans of idols have to deal with slander and stalking. DBSK stated that one of their members ate food poisoned by a fan. These aren't consequences we have to accept and we should call otakus out. 

The only mistake Aya Hirano made as a voice actress was letting the news leak out.
>> ARTICLE
I do think that having a boyfriend isn't a problem, but having a sex-harem and taking pics isn't something people should idolize IMO, and she should probably be concious of her reputation
>> ARTICLE
Idols are people too. If news broke out that a popular voice actress had a boyfriend and had sex then otakus would react similarly to that. And voice actors should definitely be the best role models for children right? Cause anime is something that EVERYBODY watches right? Aya Hirano's only mistake as a voice actress was letting the news let out.

I didn't dispute it because name-calling and making assumptions like that isn't worth responding to, other than to say the act itself belies a lack of arguments other than [*ad hominem*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem).

Why are you presuming that the nature of morality changes across national borders? Couldn't different societies simply be *disagreeing* about what the single appropriate set of morals are? 

Besides, wouldn't the world be horrific if what constitutes a morally right action was determined by the majority of your national culture instead of by your personal observations and convictions? For example, why should I be morally obligated to support female genital mutilation just because I happened to have been born in Egypt?

Stop the strawman assumptions. Just because I'm saying there are common societal moral values, does not mean that people can't have individual opinions.

It's not a strawman, it's the core of your argument. You responded to this

> What people do with their private life behind closed doors is none of your business or anyone elses for that matter.

with this

> Western morality does not apply in Asia.

If you think people can have personal opinions on morality within different cultures, why don't you think an idol in japan can choose to separate herself from the norms that usually surround her job?
>> ARTICLE
What people do with their jobs and what they do with their private lives are separate things.  Believe it or not, voice acting is a *job*, a means to make money.  Would you be okay with your boss retaliating against you because of something you did that had absolutely nothing to do with work?

People should be allowed to be human beings, regardless of what career path they go into.
>> ARTICLE
Many jobs (including a few I've held) have standards and repercussions for off-the-job conduct.  These often include prohibitions against intra-office relationships.  Yes, if I broke the rules, I would accept the consequences for doing so.  But I didn't want those consequences, so I followed those rules.

She broke the understood rules for her profession (as an idol), plain and simple.  She earned her consequences.

>He things anime gets worse because nowadays a lot of "otaku" work in the business. And they produce stuff for such otakus. His problem with those people is that they have no comprehension of humans and thus all there characters are flat tropes. Afaik.

Popular misinterpretation of the article. He says modern anime lacks realistic animation because the industry employs otaku who don't get outside and practice drawing real people. Like most experienced artists are supposed to.

It's still an unfair statement for him to make since his studio is one of the only few with enough budget to produce realistic animations.

Also, wasn't the "otaku" he was referring to were the gun maniacs? Remember, "otaku" can be a general term in Japanese as "one with a hobby".

The best example I know of that in Hollywood cinema was in *Star Trek VI:The Undiscovered Country,* where all the Klingons have pink blood so the film could escape with a PG-13 rating.
>> ARTICLE
What's more hilarious is that the streaming websites have to censor scenes that are already censored by the anime staff, resulting in a "double censorship". For example, [in this scene from Shokugeki no Soma Episode 4, they add unnecessary fog though Soma is supposed to be blocked by that toy duck.](http://i.imgur.com/Gg2xHRL.jpg)

I should start checking some anime on bilibili - this is outright amazing.

Apart from the silly censorship, bilibili is actually a very good website and many Chinese anime fans like me are very grateful to it. Nowadays it has more legal releases than before. It doesn't have ads, and the niconico-inspired danmaku system is funny overall.  
P.S. bilibili's mobile app is the best thing I've ever seen because you can cache (or download, to be exact) the video with it.

>Chinese anime fans like me

Kinda curious since your English is so good, are you Chinese or did you move to China? AFAIK, since most (if not all) of the chinese dialects use ideograms (letters that relate to a meaning, instead of a sound) it is fairly hard to learn other languages for chinese people.
>> ARTICLE
Chinese students actually learn Pinyin (Mandarin written using latin characters) before Chinese characters. And when typing electronically, they actually type the Pinyin and select the Chinese character (at least on the mainland, in Taiwan I think they use some insanely complicated system I could never wrap my head around). And Chinese characters aren't actually ideographic, most of them are simply used to represent certain syllables. Also, although you can technically write Cantonese and other dialects using Chinese characters, most commonly all written Chinese uses Mandarin grammar and vocabulary (but not sounds) as the base (it takes non-Mandarin speaking students longer to learn to write because of this).
>> ARTICLE
I'm Chinese (Cantonese, to be exact), and English is one of my majors (the other is education.) I started to learn English in grade 3 though nowadays some schools teach English from grade 1.  
I think /u/watermark02 has explained that ideogram thing. Written Chinese follows Mandarin grammar. Although dialects can be written technically, written dialects are almost forgotten and rarely used in daily life now.

>> ARTICLE
Jokes aside yes, my Chinese friends love and use the website. Is all anime there free and legal, by the way?

And I assume most of them are with subs, right?
>> ARTICLE
All anime there is free though not all of them is legal. Two or three years ago every anime there was basically illegal, either fansub releases or reposts from other major streaming websites like Youku, Tudou, iQiyi, Letv, etc.. Then it started to purchase licensing rights for some shows. bilibili is non-commercial, so it can't purchase as many shows as we want.  
And yes, most of them are with subs.
>> ARTICLE
I see! Also how does the danmaku system work?
>> ARTICLE
The Chinese character/kanji of danmaku is // which means "bullet hell". On websites like niconico douga and bilibili you can post your real-time comments in the video player and they will go across the video from right to left at that moment of the video. These comments are stored in their server so you can see them anytime. So if there are a lot of comments at the same time, it will look like a bullet hell in a shoot 'em up game.  
Overall this system is good because it's interesting to know others' real-time reaction or receive others' explanations of what you can't understand in the video. Low quality comments are unavoidable, but you can simply block those annoying users or block the keyword.

what. the. hell. It's pretty much a bunch of kids writing crap on a book... just because its titled *Death Note* all of the sudden they're all criminals and plotting real murders? For fuck sake people are getting pretty retarded with all this over the top reactions over stupid things that pretty much any kid does nowadays...

Unless of course there is an actual attempted crime committed I'd say that this boils down to stupidity... If the show had a name in Japanese and the exact same plot I'm sure no one would react.   
>> ARTICLE
You can thank school shootings for the amount of paranoia involved with this. At the same time though, you have children writing other children's names down they wish to die, some in detail.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I get that the paranoia is driven by the fear of not reacting early enough and ending up with another massacre. But is expelling a kid over something that will most likely end up in nothing, wrecking his (and its parents) lives in the process really the answer?

Next thing you you know we'll be living in a society where our crime *potential* dictates our entire future^(yup that's a reference to Psycho Pass!)
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing though, you have to make a choice, suspend the kid who is having issues at the school. "Prevent" a massacre, have him moved to another school, instead of just trying to figure out who's picking on him.

Most kids won't tell someone when they are being picked on, and won't tell people when or why it's happening.

In truth in these sorts of situations I think it would be best to just move the kid. Sure it may seem harsh, but moving to a friendly location is always good.

Also it could be worse, we could be born a sinner from the start and have to work our way into being a happy citizen. (*freedom wars*)

Pretty much spot on, parents and authorities wont belive that the whole class can turn against one kid, but its just what happens, no one would rat on the bully and its just better move on.

[Oreimo Ending](/s "Oreimo was supposed to be full blown incest ending. IIRC the author of the LN first submitted it exactly the way he wanted with Kirino and Kousaka actually kissing and dating, with Kirino ending the book with "After we get home, we should get some counselling". His publisher then forced him to come up with a bullshit ending since they changed their minds about supporting an incest story. When the VN got released, they revised the story and made Kirino and Kousaka adopted siblings or something like that and had them completely dating. I believe the original author gave full support to that "revision", but either way people consider the two of them actually together as full canon whether or not they're related.")

I feel the information is too spaced out. You have to scroll a lot if someone has a ridiculous about section. You actually have to click to see someone's full top 10, and on a standard laptop resolution you also have to scroll to see them all.

Then if you don't partake much into MAL's community (we're here on reddit...), there's a bunch of 0s and a picture of my lone friend (edit: now 2!) under my name lol. There's a whole bunch of empty space if you don't read manga, and the last anime/manga updates are honestly near useless.

Anyway, here's my top 10:

1. Chihayafuru [10]  
2. Cross Game [9.5]  
3. Kemono no Souja Erin [9.5]  
4. Glass Mask (2005) [9]

8. Aria the Origination [8.5]  
9. Hanasaku Iroha [8.5]  
10. Major S1 [8.5]

Just a general question for anyone here, can someone explain to me what makes hyouka so great to them. I also rated it a 9 but I'm not sure why though. I thought it started out great and was always super entertaining. But the last 5 episodes felt like filler to me. I still really enjoyed the anime but I wouldn't say it is a favorite. I felt like they coulda developed the romance a bit more and even throw in another mystery or two.

One Outs (Baseball Anime) is my favorite anime but I cannot for the life of me watch an anime with middle schoolers, especially in a school setting. 

Is CG a slice of life school anime or is there a twist like One Outs that makes it good?
>> ARTICLE
You could also consider [Major](http://myanimelist.net/anime/627/Major_S1) if you ever feel like watching a long series. The 6 seasons (+ 2 OVAs and a movie, ~150 episodes total) are all rated between 8.39-8.61, and follow pitcher Goro's life from childhood to him representing Japan in the World Series. He leaves highschool (to try out in the Major League) at the end of S3.
>> ARTICLE
SoL anime with sport, complete different from One Outs. I suggest to you to try the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, maybe they are very diffrent
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is a SoL that follows a couple of teenagers' lives who actually deal with their problems and shit, interspecked with comedy, drama, sport and romance without either one being more or less important than the others.

It's hard to talk about Cross Game without getting carried away. It has fantastic characters that have traits grounded in realism on top of excellent interaction. It's about chasing dreams, overcoming the past and living in the present. It doesn't have Monogatari levels of ridiculously convoluted dialogue and instead it simply cuts the crap and shows you non-retarded high schoolers dealing with their own stuff.

It's not flashy but doesn't drag on either. It manages to find that perfect pace to give situations the time to develop and for the characters to find solutions. You'll get to feel for the characters in a heartwarming way without it becoming a tearfest. You'll have a laugh because Cross Game is perfect at putting day-to-day life situations in a comedic spotlight.

It's a children's show for adults and at the same time an adults show for children.

It's 50 episodes of enjoyed relaxation and contentment that I haven't found in but a handful of other shows.

>> ARTICLE
I have never heard of this show, but your description made me add it to my Plan to Watch. :) Any show with characterization that inspires that level of passion is one that I want to watch.

Incredible show. It's a shame so many people just write it off.

doesnt MAL separate geass r1 and r2? iF so, wouldnt that push UBW out of the list?

It does but if I rate seasons equally I group them together in my rankings list (see Madoka & Rebellion, and Zero & UBW). [This is my top 20 in my profile](http://puu.sh/kMsaT/60c1e25d27.png)

You liked S2 best?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm an Aomine fanboy, and while Season 3 had better animation, a lot of hype moments, and the Teiko flashback, I just felt more hype for the Touo and Yosen games, although to me Seasons 3 and 2 are practically on equal ground.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that made S2 only a 9 for me was that I felt Kagami's friend didn't live up to the hype and that certain parts of their backstory weren't explained very well
>> ARTICLE
1. Spice and Wolf (10)
2. Crest of the Stars (9)
3. Gintama (9)
4. Toradora (9)

That's it. There are several more series that I rated 9 or 10 that aren't on there, but those are two different lists for a reason. These are the handful of shows I always like talking about and enjoy watching multiple times. Gintama's something of an exception there as I haven't rewatched more than a handful of episodes, but that's a matter of time rather than enjoyment.
>> ARTICLE
My top favorites change often. In no particular order (top 3 is in order):

1. Shinsekai Yori

1. Mawaru Penguindrum

1. Gunslinger Girl

1. Koi Kaze

1. Kino's Journey

1. Saekano

1. Neon Genesis

1. Toradora

we have the same top 2! have yet to see gunslinger girl but maybe i'll give it a shot since our tastes are similar
>> ARTICLE
Of the shows I've seen on there (all but Gunslinger, Koi Kaze, and Kino), Saekano is sticking out like a sore thumb (I agree that the rest are fantastic). Mind explaining why you rate it so highly?
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing.

It's an incredibly entertaining anime series and I'm pleasantly surprised with the amount of thought that went into its writing. The anime knows how to make fun of its own tropes but at the same time, it embraces them.

Your list is great.
>> ARTICLE
LOOK AT ALL THESE FEEL GOOD SHOWS. I like you


>> ARTICLE
The first two (#'s 6 and 7) were easy - *Sword of the Stranger* and *Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen.*  For the next three, I had a bit harder of a time.  I could easily have gone with some combination of *Shinsekai Yori,* *Detroit Metal City,* *Chihayafuru,* *Haibane Renmei,* or *Time of Eve.*  But I didn't.

Full List:

1. [Seirei no Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito)   
2. [Princess Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/164/Mononoke_Hime)

4. [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou) (as a franchise, though [San](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10379/Natsume_Yuujinchou_San) is my favorite season)   
5. [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477/Sakasama_no_Patema)  
6. [Sword of the Stranger](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2418/Stranger:_Mukou_Hadan)  
7. [Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/44/Rurouni_Kenshin:_Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Tsuiokuhen)

9. [Wandering Son](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko)  
10. [Gosick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8425/Gosick)  

I quite like the MAL changes - I think it gives you a better feel for the taste of a given user at a glance than the old profile layout did.
>> ARTICLE
>I think it gives you a better feel for the taste of a given user at a glance than the old profile layout did.

I think so as well. I've also just noticed that they changed the anime compatability formula because mine went down by 7% with my friend.
>> ARTICLE
The new "Affinity" formula seems to take shows you've dropped (even if you've left them unrated) into consideration now.  

As someone who dropped *TTGL*, *KlK* and *Welcome to the NHK,* I can safely say my compatibility with most of the MAL users on this subreddit utterly tanked.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...mine probably tanked pretty badly as well. [Here's my dropped list BTW](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/RogueKnight777&status=4)
>> ARTICLE
*Baccano* and *Champloo* probably don't help, that's for sure.

But... Fellow *Higurashi* dropper! Heh.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped higurashi after the first arc... I don't know, I just found the characters really annoying.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, it doesn't seem like they've changed the formula at all. They just changed the domain from 0-100 to 100-100. 

i.e. affinity=(compatibility-50)x2  
e.g. 45.8=(72.9-50)x2

This is ours, you can still see the old compatiblity% by looking at the top of someone's anime list)
>> ARTICLE
Interesting.  
>> ARTICLE
Haven't added any more favourites and to be honest probably won't even bother. A top 5 is easy to do but with the number of stuff I've watched a top 10 is considerably harder.

The update itself I'm fine with they just need to cut out the bullshit on the left and put the favourites back there. Never really look at my profile anyway
>> ARTICLE
I was only on four anyway, 4/5 of my 10s. Felt like having two seasons of Black Lagoon there would be stupid so I just put one...

9. Black Lagoon

10. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)


The next five wasn't easy to decide. Darker than BLACK, Baccano!, Bakuman, Great Teacher Onizuka, Usagi Drop, Oreigaru, Kill la Kill, Cowboy Bebop, The Devil Is A Part-Timer, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Spice and Wolf, Samurai Champloo, Trigun, and Overlord all waiting on the sidelines.

For me adding new favorites was really easy.  I keep a ranked list of every anime I've watched anyways for myself, so it was just a matter of taking the next five down.  My favorites on MAL now look like:

I actually added additional favorite characters in my profile section because I didn't think 10 was enough.

It is actually really hard to pick just one part of a franchise sometimes. I love KnK movie 1 for the rooftop stabbing scene and its dreary atmosphere, but movie 5 is also pretty amazing. Feels like a waste to put both on the list though.

1. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann **AND** Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I can't choose which one is my #1, so it's a tie. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one the anime that both is mindless fun, has amazing story, characters, and storytelling in the best possible way for the story to go. Only "bad" part is the every bittersweet ending, which is still my 3rd favorite ending, it just ender the way I didn't want it to, but even then it succeeds by a larger margain. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is all the amazing of the 2003 counterpart was and made it much better, characters felt more depth into them and every character is likeable and understandable with their own ambitions, specially that we can relate to most of the things in this story. The ending of FMA:B is just absolutely AMAZING, not even topped by the FMA Movie ending, which I liked only a tad bit less.[FMA Movie Spoilers](/s "I disliked the fact that Winry had to go through all that pain with first loosing Ed, which she loved, and then Alphonse which she wanted to see grow up. She never got the fit ending for her")  It is the way I wish the FMA Movie ended, but everything ended up the way I wanted to invision it.

2. Welcome to the NHK is a show that actually changed me as a person and actually has struggles that everyone has. It is by far the show that has made me feel and contrast between me and my self, changing who I am, with an amazing story that actually is made accurate since the creator of the original novel was a Hikikomori himself.

3.  Golden Time. I'm a sucker for romance anime and golden time does everything that Toradora did, more it twice as good, and the bad of Toradora is made into good in Golden Time. I loved every second of it. Even Ghost Banri, I enjoyed his character since it is actually what his old self is contradicting on him, how things are supposed to be laid out for Banri, and the ending just made both ways of the ending absolutely amazing.

4. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. In my opinion, this is the absolute BEST way to end a story. It pretty goes into detail and set everything up perfectly in the whole story line. Every part of the story was set amazingly, it is what the original series is getting redeemed by. This movie just made me appreciate the whole Haruhi Franchise to a whole another level. Seriously, if you watched the series, this movie is an obvious must, you will not regret it. Only bad thing (and bad thing depending on how you look at tit) the movie is INCREDIBLY long. So if you are going to watch the movie, be sure to have nearly 3 hours open to watch the whole movie.

5. The Tatami galaxy. It is a anime that absolutely succeeds at story telling, the comedy was on point every times, with perfectly made jokes and great stories that all eventually end to have an  absolutely masterpiece of an ending.

6. Kill la Kill. For me, Kill la Kill is Gurren Lagann, but with a much different premise, and one fatal flaw that keeps it from being around Gurren Lagann levels. Most of the characters in the shows are pretty fucking bad, and Matoi's motivation is retarded. Only characters that got good enough plot, reasoning, and enough to make me care is  Ryuuko,Satsuki, Senketsu, Ragyo and Mikisugi. Which is pretty good, considering that most of the characters are the main focus of the story, but some characters like the elite four isn't emphasized as much for the viewers as the show made them out to be.

7. Anohana movie. This is the show Anohana except shorter, but putting more emphasis on the characters. It made me cry much more than the show itself, so that really shows. I found the main-ish characters not get enough emphasis on them, even if they're all in the same group. It focuses on the 3 main important charactersm Menma, Jintan, and Anaru. They really stretched out and made every character much more better. [Anohana Movie Spoilers](/s "Why tease us with that ending, just make Jintan and Anaru just kiss, I prefer this ship over Menma. Bite me")

8. Katanagatari. This show did and fit  absolutely perfectly with the 1 hour episode thing. The story in the show really shows that the dedication in it was real. The Characters really go through an amazing amount of character development. Only for that [Katanagatari Spoilers](/s "amazing backstab/traitor ending") really made the ending amazing with the amazing power that the male main character really did shine. 

9. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumia (2005+2009). I loved the whole series, I found that the whole twist with Haruhi being god and all the adventures and mystery that happened in the show was perfectly paced. All the characters are very like able besides one that leaves on your personal -dere tastes. Yuki Nagato is a character that you either like, or dislike. I enjoyed her character a ton, and made me love the show. The infamous Endless eight make this stay behind, even if [Endless Eight semi-spoilers](/s " Yuki Nagato's pain that she had to go through that for well over 500+ years"). It hurt the show as a whole. If endless eight was only 2 or 3 episodes, This would be tied with Golden Time.

10. Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) + The movie. This show really outdid it story, really emphasizing with Hughes and the Tuckers arc really made one big thing that FMA:B did not do AS good as the 2003 version. The ending of it is very subjective and disliked and liked depending on large difference of tastes. The movie straighted it out and gave it the ending that it deserved. All the characters are just fleshed out more in this version, making their sad parts really shine and show the depressed kinda tone that the show gives, with the perfectly timed slap stick humor that is for the most part, really good.


**Notable Mention**

Durarara will definitely take place on one of these shows if the show keeps its show as the same pace as it is in the first half. I just need to hope that the 2nd half isn't a disappointment.

>Can anybody stop Nizuma's Crow? 

More importantly, can anyone stop the characters from closing one eye and talking to each other while winking?

Honestly winking in anime form would probably look like they have something wrong with them, rather than what it's suppose to look like.
>> ARTICLE
Lol this aspect of the anime pisses me off so much. Does the manga do this too?
>> ARTICLE
It does.
>> ARTICLE
Wild guess: One Piece takes the #1 spot. Turns out Oda didn't want Crow to end either. (It's amusing to me that the big-name manga are never mentioned during discussions of rankings)

Possibly better guess: It's a tie! Or is it? At the last minute, Niizuma turns in a reader response card of his own, pushing PCP up to #1.  He is their fan, after all.
>> ARTICLE
This series always keeps the audience eager for the next episode, they always seem to find the perfect spots to end the episode to make it interesting! Having read the manga, i'm sure i'll enjoy the rest of the season with ease. Also, the trick they pulled with the center page was so clever! 
>> ARTICLE
Do us anime-only watchers know the trick yet? I was so confused, trying to work it out!
>> ARTICLE
Allthough it felt like the anime didn't go all that much in depth with the trick, it was still there. The challenge from Sigma on the colour-page, which is a  picture that appeared in the PCP-manga. **Edit:** Not an invite, but a challenge.
>> ARTICLE
An invite for sigma? Am I missing something? I'm willing to blame the terrible subs the past couple of weeks
>> ARTICLE
Sage-subs always does a fine job IMO, hehe.
>> ARTICLE
Sage have been great. I was referring to BFS.  

I still don't get the trick
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't been explained yet. It's only been identified: There are numbers in both bottom corners of the color page. 
>> ARTICLE
This sort of has to do with the group that does the subs for Bakuman, but does anyone else get this annoying lag while watching their epsiodes? It can't be the 10-bit issue, since I have watched plenty of series at 10-bit with no problems what so ever. But for some odd reason, this series lags the fuck out, and it gets really frustrating.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It was worst when they translated the ENTIRE chatlog on the computer screen a few episodes ago. My overclocked i7 couldn't even keep up. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you found a way around it? I really like Bakuman and it seems like this is the only group subbing it.
>> ARTICLE
Install xy-vsfilter. It sounds like the typesetting is the problem for you.
>> ARTICLE
The only *good* group. I was glad to see the back of BFS this week, as much as they helped us out the past couple of weeks.

I haven't found a solution for it yet though. I've just been putting up with it and trying to speedread the subs as it catches up over the following few seconds.

I love how I'm saying to myself, "holding hands is a big deal? REALLY?" and then Kaya complains about it 5 minutes later. Aren't they supposed to be in college already? I feel like this is a dilema a 5 year-old would be having. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually love this aspect of the show the most. Their relationship is just so innocent with a bit of lameness mixed in, it's awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Considering the content that is missing there could be at least one more season.  If I remember correctly there is a good cutting point that was in the manga that could transition it to a season 4. 

I really wouldn't want them to rush the anime adaptation of Bakuman since the manga was so damn good.

As for the first episode of season 3.  I really enjoyed it and I felt the same way when I read it, being on the edge of my seat (even though I knew the outcome lol).

I'm also satisfied with the endings to the following anime series:

1. Cowboy Bebop

2. Death Note

3. Shirobako

[SY](/s I wish that the girl - forgot the name - died when she put squealer out of his misery. It would have been perfect. She finally recognized him as a human, and killing him activated the response in her brain which causes her to die. It would have been so tragic and powerful. But I guess that her *not* dying was also a powerful statement, since it means that she never regarded him as a human even after learning the truth)

Just finished this show a while ago. It was the first show I started from the beginning after being away from anime for almost 3 years. Wow, what a way to come back. This show reminded me of why I got into anime in the first place.

I couldn't have asked for a better ending to that show, either. It left me thinking back about everything that had happened, and it of course raises some questions that linger.
>> ARTICLE
My god the death note ending was so lame
>> ARTICLE
The ending was fine, but issue was the 8 or so episodes leading up to it.
>> ARTICLE
Why was it? I thought it was pretty cool.

The last episode was pretty great but honestly the whole last arc was inferior to all the other arcs

A lot of people debate over Death Note's ending. But it mostly ends up returning to a L vs Light argument

but [](/s 'how many kids will it take to get a proper kid T_T')
>> ARTICLE
The Shinsekai Yori Ending was the most satisfying, mind-provoking and well thought out ending I've ever seen in a series.

The Anime itself had a few boring parts between the amazing stuff that happend, but the ending made it all more than worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm 9 episodes in and while I find it interesting, it's not really giving me the "wow" factor that everyone said it would. I plan on finishing tonight and I'm hoping it ends strong.

ED is god tier, though.

The beginning is mainly just for world building, it gets significantly better IMO.

Not counting the films, I thought Madoka Magica had a perfect ending.

FMA: Brotherhood 
>> ARTICLE
I like it because it didnt leave many stones unturned. The show was thorough and tied up almost all subplots.
>> ARTICLE
Some may call it an asspull. I call it badass.
>> ARTICLE
If i may, what was the asspull (at least to those that call it such)?
>> ARTICLE
[FMA:B Ending spoiler](/s "Someone else posted something about it a few days ago. It went something along the lines of this: They manage to get Al's body back from the truth guy by trading Ed's alchemy for it. The way they figured it out was by "just thinking really hard about it" which pretty much means that all the bullshit they had to go through for the past 60+ episodes wasn't directly necessary. I don't fully agree with it personally, but I do also think that the final solution was a bit sudden since nothing of the sort had ever been mentioned or hinted at before, so I can see why some would call it an asspull.")

>> ARTICLE
The thing is that [Spoiler](/s "it had sorta been hinted at. IIRC Truth kept on giving hints about what exactly the gate did. Also, everyone who had gone to the gate was seeking to use their alchemy to revive the dead, and instead had something symbolic taken from them (Master's ovaries/organs because of baby, etc). Alchemy, at that point, is pretty much what defined Ed at that point, and also defined what most of the other human transformationists were at the time, 'we gonna use alchemy to break all the rules and it doesnt matter because we alchemists'.")

Does that make sense? I can't type very well right now,  and it's been a while since I read the series, but I think that's the general gist of it.
>> ARTICLE
[FMA:B Spoiler](/s "Sorry for the questions, wouldnt have Father still need to be defeated eventually even if Ed and Al hadnt lost their bodies? Practically, they had other goals in mind. Also, Ed didnt gain his leg back right? He really didnt get everything back  then if so. But nonetheless, imo, i found the ending perfect.")
>> ARTICLE
[FMA:B Spoilers] (/s "Well Ed didn't get his leg back because Al's soul was only worth Ed's Arm.")
>> ARTICLE
While I haven't watched FMA:B, I've read the manga numerous times and just went back and checked on the fact that [] (/s "Ed didn't get his leg back by choice as he wanted it to serve as a reminder. When he is getting Al's body back, Truth tells him to take it all; Ed simply chooses not to.")
>> ARTICLE
oh, I forgot about that then.
>> ARTICLE
Happy endings only work if the characters earn it. And *by god* did FMA's cast earn theirs.
>> ARTICLE
No that's not the ONLY time that happy endings can work, that's some really dumb logic. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I don't see people complaining when something like Snow White has a happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
That was a sweeping generalization, I'll admit. Maybe I should've prefaced it with, "In shonens or other stories with large, overarching conflicts."
>> ARTICLE
Equivalent exchange. 
>> ARTICLE
It's satisfying because it's a complete ending. Everything wraps up. It's just a nice ending. And you know what sometimes that's all I want a nice, happy ending. 

None of this open ended and their wacky adventures continued forever, no mind fucks, no bitter sweet, no lack luster endings. Well I do like sad endings. They can be awesome as well. But, those tends to be the case more often than not in anime (maybe it's just the ones I watch haha). I so rarely see a cookie cutter, happy ending in anime that I'm delighted when I do. 
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass
>> ARTICLE
Whilst the ending was imo is the best that I have seen, I wouldn't call it satisfying purely due to the last scene causing the ambiguity, I was left wanting answers. If they finished with [CG](/s "Lelouch's death") I would have been satisfied.  
>> ARTICLE
It seems like I'm the only guy here who doesn't think Code Geass' ending was *that* satisfying. Even so, the ending is still good.
>> ARTICLE
I know /u/Durinthal and /u/rascorpia aren't the biggest fans of it, but I partially blame that on them practically having it spoiled for them by some assholes in the rewatch who couldn't keep their mouths shut.

I know this because I was one of said assholes.
>> ARTICLE
How is it their fault if those "assholes" spoiled the ending for them? Were they asking for spoilers?

> I know this because I was one of said assholes.

You should give yourself another swirly haha
>> ARTICLE
> How is it their fault if those "assholes" spoiled the ending for them?

I think you misunderstood me. They weren't asking for spoilers, but a lot of the rewatchers in the threads gave reactions to things that made it pretty damn obvious what was gonna happen.

> You should give yourself another swirly haha

[I already did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjH5X32Itw)

1) That ending was predictable as all hell, even for a show with zero logic!

I sort of felt bad, since it's just the standard answer that always dominates these sort of threads.

It doesn't dominate threads through some gimmick though.  It does because it's ending is genuinely really well done. 
>> ARTICLE
It felt so rushed yet at the same time it was perfect. I personally would have prefered they lengthened r2, with episode 21 as the finale, and then extended the last 4 episodes into an entirely new season with either 13 or 25 more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I felt it would be okay if they had like a 1-2 episode between [spoiler](/s "Schneizel's defeat and Lelouch's death. That way it would feel less rushed.")
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love the ambiguity in the ending in that people even now will debate [whether or not](/s "He's alive")
>> ARTICLE
Its actaully not "decide" or anything. If you take the clues from the last episodes you will know wether he is or isnt

When you say "there's no debate"... that's part of the debate.  I'm pretty sure different creators of the show have given different answers to that question, so... yeah, there's definitely a debate to be had.

Hunter X Hunter

"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."
>> ARTICLE
As i'm walking through life and experiencin new things i agree with that statement...
>> ARTICLE
As much as I want Hunter x Hunter to continue, I think the current ending for the anime is pretty much perfect if they don't decide to continue the anime for the next few years because it allows for the imagination to expand and theorize what kind of adventure that might happen in the future arcs
>> ARTICLE
Ye i sort of agree, it's gonna be hard to follow up with a better ending then with what we have already
>> ARTICLE
But there are so many loose ends that I'm curious about so I absolutely want Togashi to write more!

Bingo.

Not only satisfying but also incredibly cathartic and visually stunning. My favorite anime ending beside EoE.

I was debating between Tatami Galaxy, Katanagatari, and Kyousou Giga. They are all very thematically satisfying.

Buuuuut Tatami Galaxy wins. It's just perfect in every way.

School Days.  Although it was shit for 95% of the show, the final 5% was hype as shit!

Your Lie in April was satisfying yet left a gigantic hole in my heart.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't "shit". You just didn't like how it went, that's a whole lot different! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh trust me.  I liked how it went but all the stuff in between was just ridiculous.  I mean, I did say it had a satisfying ending.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, no. I mean everything between the beginning and the end, not the end. You can't deny the end was satisfying, that's for sure.

I was mostly saying this jokingly, but you know what I mean! It's not really shit, but highly frustrating to see how it unfolds after he realizes every girl want his dick. But it's *probably* not shit! 


>> ARTICLE
School Days was freaking horrible, and that's exactly why it was so good. No other anime has made me so angry at ppl, which is why the ending was truly satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Man. Idk why school days was "bad" ???
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the large majority of the people that dislike it, only really watched it at face value i.e. a harem with girls who have even less personality than usual, a completely unlikable protagonist, and cliche relationship drama. I thought the show was entertaining, but you have to watch it knowing that it is being self-aware, like any good dark comedy. 

Would American Psycho be consider good if it was viewed as just a slasher flick?
>> ARTICLE
The characters are pretty unrealistic, also my hatred for the mc was so great that it kind of ruined the show. That being said I don't really think the show is bad.

I think Your Lie In April definitely ended perfectly, sad, but perfectly.

Am I the only one that didn't think it was as bad as everyone made it out to be?

The ending was really bad, agreed, but it's not shit tier like everyone says. I guess my expectations were so low that I was genuinely surprised that it wasn't as bad as everyone said it was.
>> ARTICLE
It's the first ending that had me burst into laughter at how thoroughly we just got boned. But yeah, it wasn't a terrible ending.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed on that end, most of the episode was [](/s "Kaneki just walking, and while I really liked that part, they shouldn't have made it that long. Also, ending the episode with Kaneki and Arima staring at each other. What.") 

It might have been a good episode overall but it was a mediocre ending since it didn't resolve most of the plot lines at all.

Gunbuster and it's sequel, Diebuster, every time. No question about it. Diebuster especially, there was no way anyone could end anything better than that. It's absolutely genius, and it still shocks me Gainax managed to one up Gunbuster's already perfect ending with the sequel.

I really liked TTGL, Gundam Build Fighters and Giant Robo's endings as well but they're no Gunbuster or Diebuster

>Diebuster

*retching noises*

I don't get why people like Diebuster's ending more than Gunbuster's.

[](/s "With Diebuster you kinda know it's coming and yeah it's emotional, but compared to Gunbuster's ending where you don't even know if Humans are still around or not... - when Earth lights up and Noriko and Amazon react - it's a lot more powerful.")

Diebuster was fucking crazy. I kind of knew it was coming, but it still hit me hard as fuck. It also makes the Gunbuster ending even better.

100% Diebuster. Best ending I have ever seen in any form of media. The moment I realized what was happening I got chills from how goddamn clever it was - still gets me on rewatches too.

>> ARTICLE
Mawaru Penguindrum - If you weren't digging all the symbolism up to this point, then the ending was probably lackluster for you. But for nerds like me, this was the perfect ending to what I view as one of the best love stories I've ever seen. This show was thought provoking thematically and terms of presentation, but the emotional crescendo in the final episode showed that Penguindrum taps into something bigger than itself. This show is a masterpiece, but sadly it's one that is likely to turn off Anime fans and general audiences alike.

>> ARTICLE
[There were some hints that](/s "the surviving parasytes would eventually fully integrate into human society and die out since they can't reproduce. Those that can't integrate would eventually be caught and put down by the police or military, but the majority of them, aware that they can't oppose humanity for long, would choose to integrate.")

Oh yeah! You make an excellent point. That totally makes sense.

I'm planning to get into this. Am I correct in thinking the movie "digest" versions are pretty much episodes combined together to form a movie with no content cut out?

Is it recommended to watch in movie or episode format, or does it not matter at all?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think there even is a way to watch the movies. The BDs sold at the theatre showings had the episodes on them, not the films.

Either way, I presume the only difference is that the movie versions wouldn't have the OP or ED for each episode. And episode 22(?) was unfinished at the time of the theatre (and TV) broadcast.

whats the difference between how informative this is and how informative mal aggregate scores are?
>> ARTICLE
One thing I note from one comparison (Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere that was mentioned here), is that there seems to only be about 1000 votes on AniDB compared to around 20,000 on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Given that both are international anime sites there shouldn't be a huge difference between the two. However, from personal experience, I noticed that anidb tends to attract snobbish cranks in contrast to mal's huge community of passionate younglings (scores at anidb tend to be lower for everything). I guess it depends on which community you'd identify with.


>> ARTICLE
AniDB's problem is how its weighted score is completely dictated by the opinion of a few dozen of users outweighing the score of thousands.

Horizon's weighted score is **4.51**, yet, [take a look at the vote distribution](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=votes&aid=8323). 
>> ARTICLE
The same list from mal would look like this (second score is mal). The list is for the most part the same with some minor shuffling, but I think you can see a slight preference of shounen and action (Jojo, Shingeki) as opposed to more slow paced shows (Shinsekai Yori).

White Album 2 - 7.66/8.09

Servant x Service - 7.64/7.92

Minami-ke Tadaima - 7.65/7.85

Except you also lost lists that don't appear at all on Anidb when you just look at the stats those who did appear there, such as Hajime no Ippo, and Fairy Tail.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I excluded Hajime no Ippo because it is still ongoing and Fairy Tail because it started airing back in 2009. There are probably some lost anime in 15-20 range though.

Hajime no Ippo - 8.38/8.64

Fairy Tail - 7.81/8.57
>> ARTICLE
Seeing it compared like this, I have to wonder if folks on MAL simply tend to rate things higher than on other services... 

Anyone care to do a Hummingbird comparison as well? 
>> ARTICLE
Hummingbird has a 1-5 scale rather than 1-10, you tend to lose quite a bit of distinction there.
>> ARTICLE
But their 1-5 scale also allows for half-stars. So it could be translated to a 10 scale with a little multiplication.
>> ARTICLE
Guess they upgraded it. Back when I brought my scores over from MAL, it just made all 5-6 3 stars, and all 7-8 into 4 stars.
>> ARTICLE
I went manually over MAL's top 210 anime, and pulled the 2013 shows (so I could've missed something), cut out the movies, you can compare:

1. Shingeki no Kyojin - 8.92

1. Monogatari Second Season: 8.80

1. Bakuman 3rd season - 8.75

1. Chihayafuru 2 - 8.67

1. Battleship Yamato 2199 - 8.66

1. Hajime no Ippo: Rising - 8.64

1. Fairy Tail - 8.57

1. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - 8.56

1. The World God Only Knows S3 - 8.52

1. Psycho-Pass - 8.52

1. Shinsekai Yori - 8.46
>> ARTICLE
Why is Fairy Tail in it?
>> ARTICLE
Because it ended in 2013.
>> ARTICLE
Ippo on #6, huh, at least is on some one's list I guess.
>> ARTICLE
In a few episodes I think it'll probably jump over to #3.
>> ARTICLE
Always brings a tear to my eye to see JoJo's place highly.
>> ARTICLE
It deserves to be higher on the list. It was a way better show than SnK.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of sad that Kyousougiga didn't make the list though, I thought it was amazing!

Intial D is higher than Uchutan Kazouku ?! 

Bakuman higher than Monogatari ?! 

>> ARTICLE
> Intial D is higher than Uchutan Kazouku ?!

> Bakuman higher than Monogatari ?!


I know it's fucking great isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman has a pretty big following after all.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is a second sequel which bumps up the score significantly (people who don't like the adaptation like me won't bother sitting through 48 episodes before getting to this one). Monogatari is more popular and takes more risks hence the lower score (its a sequel too, the score is still somewhat bloated)

>> ARTICLE
anidb's rating system makes it much easier to judge whether something is good or not. there's also the fact that on MAL, anything with bishounen (like d-grayman and pandora hearts) gets high ratings from all the fujoshi
>> ARTICLE
Don't want to sound like a snob, but this list is pretty crappy. All of the shows are enjoyable, but I can't understand some of the ratings. Also ratings suck they don't reflect on how good the show is the slightest. For example a great show like Uchouten Kazoku is rated at 7.68 while Sakurasou, which is is pretty much inferior in every way, also has the same score. 

It's pretty much popularity contest. For example Attack on Titan is rated at 8.48 which would be great and all, but the show just isn't that good. Yes it was enjoyable for a lot of people and some even found it to be great or the best they've seen, but rankings shouldn't be about that. Did it innovate in any way? No. Did it have great animation? No. (The animation was less than mediocre and shined only sometimes). Did it present any interesting ideas/concepts or made viewer think? No. Were characters interesting? Maybe a couple so NO. Was the pacing good? No, it was way to dragged sometimes and other times it was rushed. The audio work? Superb. That the only part which they pretty much nailed, but it still doesn't grant such high score. All in all, it was a decent action show with mass appeal, but it wasn't even close to how well done some other shows this season were. 

So a question arises, why the fuck do people even care about these shitty lists? 
>> ARTICLE
I just have to say, that is entirely your opinion vs the opinion of thousands of people that rate those shows. And while I sometimes think the masses are a bunch of idiots (I mean, for example, how can Angel Beats score higher than Suzumiya in pretty much every site?), this reflects what most people think and you just have to see it as that and not how much the show is worth. 

If you think that Shingeki was a mediocre show, that perfectly fine, but most people believe that it is a pretty good show (including me) and that is why it scores so high. And no, this is not a popularity contest, since Shinsekai yori is a very obscure show (it is finally starting to get recognition) and yet I'm very pleased to see it scoring so high on this list.

I care about these list because they usually help me with choosing the best shows to watch (I've never even heard of the first show on the list, but now I'me interested in what the hell made it score first place). And it is interesting for me to see what most people think about anime. If you don't care about any of that, maybe this type of topic isn't for you.
>> ARTICLE
Well but does one opinion which is based on a quite vast experience of few hundred shows equal the opinion of people who have maybe seen a dozen shows? And that's the majority of people who influence those ratings. That's why I said it's a popularity contest rather than informed opinion. And to my delight, as always, the rabid battle shonen audience downvotes me to hell every time I say something negative about their favorite show. This just shows how pointless the system is. They are usually the ones that just give 10s without even thinking and since things like SnK attract massive attention due to their simplicity and accessibility plus hype. 

Shows that are "obscure" like SSY are rated more fairly, since a lot less people vote for them and they are usually rated more fairly as they are mostly watched by people who have different outlook on the medium, f.e. more experience with the medium. But that doesn't change that even pretty bad shows like SAO have bloated ratings. 

It's the same situation as with video games. CoD kept getting amazing scores from users even though it didn't deserve them. So that's that. 

I wonder how many fanboys I've pissed off this time by poking the beehive which is the fanbases of CoD and SAO. 
>> ARTICLE
I can agree with you to some extent, it is true that most of the fanbase overrates any shounen and tends to stay away from "smart" shows like SSY or Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, which I finished before checking its surprisingly low score. But at the same time, I also think that most people overrate any show that makes them cry, like Clannad, Toradora, AnoHana or Angel Beats. I'm not saying these shows are bad (except Angel Beats), but even if they eventually made me cry (none did) I wouldn't rate these shows a 10/10 just because of that.

It boils down to how you view the scores, and so far it has proven to be a useful tool for me to find a good show. If you don't like to check the score, that's fine, but I think that you have a great chance of stumbling upon bad shows.

What is needed, in an utopian world, is a website with only "certified" people rating anime, under the same parameters, and with, let's say, over 100 shows watched. I don't know about the existence of any site like this unfortunately. It would still have it's fair share of problems, but I would trust the opinion of the "experts" more than the opinion of the masses any day.
>> ARTICLE
From personal opinion and experience checking ranking for recommendation shall very much be taken with a grain of salt as it cencor away a lot of anime that actually is good. I can see the use in a ranking system for someone that don't have a lot of time to look around as it will push more reasons to watch something on that person, but at the same time I think it harms the community greatly as sadly far too many people see ranking as a "best" list and thus become blind towards everything else.
>> ARTICLE
I can say I have been mislead by rankings sometimes, but far more often the rankings are somewhat close to what I think about the show. The only show so far I've watch whose ranking I think is very "wrong" is like I said before Angel Beats, but even so I can't say that someone else will dislike it purely because I didn't. I never watch a show below 7 in MAL simply because the ones I've watched with lower scores are pure garbage.

One needs to be smart and choose shows to watch based on their scores, positive and negative reviews and of course personal interest in the show.

I see the scores this way: the higher the score, the more chances you have of finding a "good" show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you can't possibly watch every anime ever released. Lists like this, of course, won't include your personal gems, but they might introduce you to an anime which you did not know or thought wretched and skipped. I would have never thought to pick Silver Spoon up if it wasn't so favorably received and it turned out fine. 

I usually add the anime I think are underrated as extra slots to the list, but, frankly, I couldn't think of any this year. My personal stance at watching anime is to mark top 20 of the year as a must-watch, you never know what might surprise you. Then skim through the descriptions of every single show released that year and mark the other ones which sound interesting to me personally.

From personal experience of having watched hundreds of anime I found that most of my favorites usually have both premise which personally interests me and high ratings (Death Note, Berserk), with a couple being highly rated stuff I thought I'd hate (Princess Tutu, Kodomo no Omocha) and only a few underrated gems, usually stuff which does weird things to your mind like Serial Experiments Lain or Texhnolyze.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting, well I'm one of those people that watch most stuff that comes out every season. The downside of this tho is that I've come to despise "rankings" a bit as I know many shows has been discareded by the majority of people and small voices can't always make it through, Especially if a hype-train is in motion that season.


Hmm... It's hard to explain, but you start to noticing patterns after some time.

This problem also remain with shows that aren't airing, the big "loud" crowd push down the smaller one which make many people miss a lot of shows that they actually might find good or great just because they follow a ranking list.


EDIT: Just to not start confusions, I like personal rankings as that can create dicussions. What I don't like is that "masses/majority/mainstream" rankings has too much weight within the community.
>> ARTICLE
One thing that I have noticed while watching the series is that there's always this notion that the project they're working on is the best thing they've ever done...until their next project which is somehow the best project they've ever done.   

Apparently nobody in Bakuman has heard of diminishing returns. 
>> ARTICLE
Well if you notice the ranks for their Reversal series they are writing; they are dropping through the ranks quickly. Ashurogi Mutou think that Reversal is the best thing since fuck, but the general populace does not agree. Sure by the end it will all work out, they will beat Nizuma and they will have the long awaited Anime and Marriage, but at the moment the Manga they are currently working on is not as good as they expected or continue to expect it will be.
>> ARTICLE
Reversi is just a parallel with the authors' previous work Death Note. That series was definitely short but if you ask a lot of people who have watched it, majority do say it's good. It's also one of the easily recommended anime here in /r/anime .

The only reason us readers don't see it very good is because we're just hearing things from what's happening in their manga, not actually reading it, so we can't really judge it. Bakuman is just about the story of manga after all, so if anything, we mostly get to learn about is how they do it and what are the results.
>> ARTICLE
No no, I'm not talking about US, the audience, I'm talking about the audience of the manga in the actual Bakuman anime. The rank that Reversi got at the start was the very top, and quickly started dropping in popularity and rank throughout the episode. The main characters think that Reversi will be the next god of manga, but the local populace of the Bakuman universe do not like it as much as other series.

That is what I was trying to get at last time I commented, I wasn't trying to suggest that the real life audience did not like it.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha, got confused earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Eh? What about Tanto? That one took a bad shot.

It's just that they learned a lot of things now and of course much more experienced than before...
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it's shounen. The protagonists couldn't possibly power down, that goes against the genre principles. I do agree that the story could have been stretched a bit more with some more failures added in, their two major failures really amount to Mashiro getting hospitalized during Detective Trap's serialization (leading to Trap's ensuing cancellation) and Tanto in general.

Oh well, Bakuman still ended up ok.

I did feel they perhaps rushed it a little bit, not to mention skipping quite a bit of some manga parts, like Nanamine's part & some minor stuff, but overall, i'm just happy they're even going all out & it'll probably wrap up things nicely. They still have a pretty MAJOR ordeal coming up with Reversi before ending the anime though.

I love this show! I always enjoy seeing all of he rivals they have gained over the years duke it out in friendly competition, and the ideas that Ashirogi Muto come up with always make a giant grin spread across my face. Their reactions to their results are always awesome (especially if they do well) and I genuinely worry about their ranking due to the unpredictable nature of this show. 


**TL;DR**: Its the shit.
>> ARTICLE
One thing that always amused me by this show is that everyone is idealistically polite, so you always get that 'I won't lose, but I wish you the best!' kind of lines.

I enjoy the series overall though, and I'm actually surprised something like this could keep my interest for so long.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I wasn't aware they made more episodes than the first season of Bakuman. I read the entire manga, and really enjoyed the story, characters pacing and plot developments. I do admit that something seemed to be lost in translation when I watched the first season. For those who have read the series, and watched seasons 2+3, has it improved in those regards?
>> ARTICLE
Did the manga end? If so did we get a happy end or one of those shitty we are just going to let you guess what happens kind of thing. Try not to spoil it as much as you can lol.

Yes the manga finished. From what I remember things were tied up pretty well, so there isn't a ton of guessing to be done.

yay thanks for the response~

Season 3 is ongoing, but both season 1 and 2 have finished and are both amazing. Definitely worth a watch

How does the show compare to the manga? I'm almost done with the manta and I'm loving it so far.

The first series has some filler and pacing issues. But season 2 is much quicker and season 3 seems to be the same. The animation had occasional dips though. I'd recommend it overall though.

I can't really say, I haven't read the manga, although I've been meaning to

I love this show!
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is definitely gonna be one of my all time favorites. The manga is exponentially better than the anime and the anime is pretty darn good! There's something just amazing about Obata sensei's art and how the story takes shape. I am always in awe at the fact that all the fictions manga in this series could e a massive hit I it was real eg. Classroom of truth, PCP, Crow. I feel like they've put all they've got into making this series amazing and it definitely shows. I've cried and laughed with this series. It's such an inspiring story especially to a person like me who ha always been the drawing type. I've learned so much from Bakuman!
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't know why it isn't more popular. I'm not complaining, I love it regardless of its popularity! 

Regarding this ep, I have a feeling their arc plan will fail, but somehow they'll keep being serialized. I just don't see it working out.
>> ARTICLE
I only read the manga, and found it an entertaining shounen that was kind of more interesting in how very much it revealed of the author's worldview - his passion for his craft, his opinions about the industry, and then much worse stuff like his incredibly backwards views towards women, etc (something also clearly visible in Death Note). I think this authorial voice expressed itself most clearly and deliberately at the end (spoilers for Death Note and Bakuman ahead). [The final conflict of Bakuman comes down to the protagonists' choice of whether to end their "masterpiece" in a few chapters, giving it the artistically correct choice to let it survive as a piece standing the test of time, or to prolong it artificially in order to accommodate the upcoming anime. See any parallels there? Yeeep - at the midpoint of Death Note, the "antagonist" of the series up to that point, the one who's been dueling with Light the entirety of the series, is killed off. He's then replaced by two complete unknowns, who finish out the series in a second half that's widely considered weaker than the first. In Bakuman, the protagonists get to make the decision that I'm guessing the actual writer/artist weren't allowed to - ending their popular series at the height of its popularity because that's what their love of craft demanded. Bakuman's last act strikes me as basically a statement of protest against the commercial machinations that they likely believe weakened their prior work.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Something that also striked me about Bakuman is how badly the manga company treats their artists.  Having them working 7 day weeks, often requiring staggering overtimes without much to show for it afterwards. Bad work morale like psychological manipulation of assistants to force them to work overtime on ridiculous time tables. Threatening them with cancellation (of popular series) if they don't adhere to their often childish demands. The manga often just brushes it off most of the time in order to keep the tone uplifting, but I suspect some of this might be the artist trying to criticize the industry he works in, having to do it in a very covert subtle way, because the people he is criticizer is his own bosses.  If real manga artists work in conditions like that i feel really sorry for them. 

I didn't think Death Note had a bad view of woman (the writer might, I don't know, but the anime didn't), but woman didn't really play a big part in that anime apart from Misa who have some questionable traits, but those are pretty much in line with her character and she was considered kind of a weirdo by everyone so the way she behaved wasn't really considered normal in that univerce.

This anime did have some questionable views on woman. Mainly how none of them really had any personality and all of them seemed satisfied by basically ending up as housewives. This would be fine for one, maybe two of them, but when most of them ends up like that it makes me scratch my head a bit. A lot of anime do this, and I wish they didn't. But who can blame him for writing poor female characters I guess. If he works in conditions like that he probably doesn't have time to meet any real woman to draw inspiration from.

>> ARTICLE
It's not that they're forced to work 7 day weeks, but if they want to turn in a manuscript every week then they probably have to work that much.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, they are contractually obligated to deliver a certain amount of pages each month/week, and they can't do it without working themselves half to death. 
>> ARTICLE
> Mainly how none of them really had any personality and all of them seemed satisfied by basically ending up as housewives. This would be fine for one, maybe two of them, but when most of them ends up like that it makes me scratch my head a bit.

I can't remember who was happy being a housewife besides Kaya, and she technically worked for Ashirogi Muto.  Azuki wanted to be a seiyuu and all the other women were mangaka.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I might have been a bit unclear. I was getting at that that was basically the only noticeable characteristic and ambition any of them had. Unlike most of the male characters everyone was content at being at the station or position they were and didn't have any real ambitions or goals that they strived towards achieving.

They were very bland and uninteresting and often the only real plot function they had was being potential love interests for the other characters. ;)
>> ARTICLE
Really? You're describing the opposite of Iwase.
>> ARTICLE
Its an impossible question for a writer/creator to answer. Clearly, there is a level of dedication and skill required to create something that is so popular, but the choice to end it in the 'correct' spot and therefore reduce the amount of money and popularity you gain is a very tough decision.

On the one hand, there is often potential in new arcs to be good, and to enrich the original arc, but they always run the risk of Shounen Syndrome, in which things drag out and affect the reception of the series as a whole.

On the other hand, ending it in the 'correct' spot is entirely subjective. From the writers point of view, things may be 'finished' and the arc may be wrapping up, but if it isn't finished from the consumer point of view, you're left with an 'unfinished' anime that is poorly recieved as a result.

Decisions, decisions.
>> ARTICLE
>and then much worse stuff like his incredibly backwards views towards women, etc (something also clearly visible in Death Note)

*Thank you*. I read and enjoyed *Bakuman*, but the manga's portrayal of women made me pretty uncomfortable at times. However, no one else ever seemed to mention it so I always thought it was just all in my head.  
>> ARTICLE
That was actually the reason why I couldn't get into Bakuman. When I watched Death Note again afterwards I started analyzing the female characters and realized they were much more disappointing than I'd remembered.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Bakuman in ages and I'm wondering what you mean, can you elaborate? 
>> ARTICLE
The main character is "in love" with a shy, pretty girl with a 2-dimensional personality. She apparently likes him back and agrees to marry him for no good reason. 

The MC's arrogant personality and defeatist attitude aren't exactly lady killers, so the romantic premise (and female character) felt like a very self-serving and forced fantasy on the mangaka's part.

EDIT: Read chapter 2 of the manga real quick if you're looking for a better reminder.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it. It was very inspirational. Eiji is one of my favorite characters and seiyuu.
>> ARTICLE
SPIN!
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it quite a bit, but the main romance was painful. As is usually the case, the other romances were a lot stronger.

I didn't really care for the characters or anything, but watching it each week was entertaining enough. I can imagine it being better to marathon, because longer shounen like this seem to be well-suited for that.
>> ARTICLE
Well, yeah I didn't watch it week by week. I started after season 3 was finished, so I got to watch it in large doses, which probably made it more fun for me to watch
>> ARTICLE
The love story fell a bit flat for me too. The main characters didn't really have any reason to like each-other apart from physical attraction. They never really spoke to each-other apart from the time he proposed (and barely even then) and some short conversations on the phone from time to time. One of their mayor interactions was a fight they had over a simple misunderstanding, which doesn't really bode well for their future after the series is over I guess. They had one nice scene where he followed her home and they talked on the train. A bit more of those would make the relationship seem a bit more natural, but unfortunately there were only one.

Also the female characters in this were pretty bland and porly written.

I'm critizising a lot, but I really liked this show and would recomend it to others. It's a really good uplifting anime, and I can't wait to see what the writer plans to do next.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is one of the best anime out there. 
Besides the great story and art you also learn a lot about the life of Mangakas and how much hard work they put into their mangas so we can envoy them. 


Must also add that Eiji's voice is just f*cking awesome.

A really great anime, I love how they handled the pacing of the storyline, and amazing characters and character development. I recommend any anime lover to watch this series if they haven't.

Marathoned all three of the seasons in like 4 days and loved the fuck out of it. [Hiramaru](http://0-gate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bakuman-hiramaru-happy.png) must be my favourite character
>> ARTICLE
1. watching it makes me want to work super hard. in anything  do i like to recall at how hard they worked at being the best and it motivates me. very much like sakurasou non kanojo.

2. i have this theory that "reversi" was a reference to death note. it was an unorthodox battle manga that focused on two protagonists with differing views on "justice". the arc where the publishers wanted reversi to continue beyond the scope of the two protagonists seems to reflect the latter portion of death note that saw the introduction of mellow and near. the feel of death note after the first season felt a bit off and forced and im wondering if reversi ended at its proper point was a reference to this.
>> ARTICLE
1. I totally agree with that, except for the part where I lose the motivation an hour later

2. I didn't make the connection before, thanks! It really provides better insight on it
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it never leaned too much towards a certain aspect such as the manga, or the romance. It kept a perfect balance!
>> ARTICLE
I love Bakuman, so far. Reading it as the manga comes to the US and I watched the first season. It's silly but as someone who wishes they could create authentic manga (though I know it'll never happen), learning the processes was very interesting but it's not just informative, I loved the vast array of characters and their passion is heartwarming. It's hard not to root for them. It is a bit repetitive sometimes but the creators manage to add new twists to make the repetitive plot points feel fresher. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not impossible to make your own manga. Quite difficult if you want to be published, but it's doable. If you make that a major goal, and work hard towards it, you could probably end up with your own published manga. Who knows how far it'll go?

I'm shooting for it myself, actually. It's a life goal and I keep writing and rewriting to have the best script possible, and I'm working on my art to get it to a professional-looking level. It's difficult, but when it's my main goal in life, then no time's wasted.

If you want to try, figure out what story you want to tell, and have it go from there. Make realistic characters, not all perfect.

For me, it's less like I'm a writer and more like a director. I figure out the scenario for the chapter, and imagine how the characters would act based on their personality. It can take a while to get to this point. I've been working on it for 4 years and I'm finally happy with the first chapter. Probably could've done it quicker, but I digress. Don't be afraid to do rewrites, I've done like 6 on the first chapter. And most important of all, get a friend that has read quite a few series, show them, and have them respond bluntly. Blunt, no holding back responses are the best feedback you can get, if they also give reasoning.

I know you have a passing interest in it, but if that's what you want to do, shoot for it.
>> ARTICLE
Good luck, you seem extremely motivated :) I had that motivation for years, and I still sometimes work on it, but unfortunately a LOT of people trashed my dream and insulted me for it. I would cry at night because of the things people said about me for it. You're the first person who actually has whole-heartedly encouraged me and I thank you for it :) 

I originally just wanted to be a standard novelist but I could never finish a story either because I thought my ideas were no good or a new idea came along. But when I started writing manga I realized I was much more suited to it, and have had countless ideas and actually completed the script for a 13 volume story (and have worked on many others that are still in-progress), I just can't get my art the way I want it and artists I've tried to collaborate with always end up vanishing on me. So like Akito I am primarily just the author, which is part of why I love his character so much. He reminds me of how I was a few years ago. 

Sadly though because of so much discouragement I decided to make writing my secondary goal :/ I'm going to school for advertising because I know writing (especially manga) is a difficult dream... But it's still what I want to do deep down. 

>> ARTICLE
Good story and characters but should've been shorter, after the second season of the same stuff it just gets boring.

You know what? I was going to type a long paragraph about why I loved this series and how good it was but I actually agree with you on that. Not saying it is bad (it's really good) but by the mid point of season three I was anxious for the series to end. I guess that is the curse of watching it in bulk. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't decide how I feel about the length. On the one hand it felt like it was streching itself a little bit. On the other it really made me feel the weight of what the characters were feeling. Showing all the times they failed and making you sit through the length of time it took to achieve their end goal made the ending extremely satisfying to me. I don't think 2 seasons would have had the same effect. . .

I believe he also does Accelerator from Index/Railgun

Amazing, I thought it was incredibly well done. I didn't even go into it knowing it was made by the artist duo that did Death Note. Learning a bit about the process of manga and anime was very cool, the characters are all fantastic and it has plenty of humor. 

The thing that stood out to me the most however is that I became attached to the characters so much that when they succeeded, I got that same feeling of success. 

A unique thing about this as well was because it follows manga authors you end up seeing their work and their competition's as well. By doing this it compensates for the simple setting by introducing more wild and exciting concepts through manga, in their own manga (I'm calling it manga-ception).

I felt the manga was a lot better. The anime is just too slow paced, and this isn't the kind of show where seeing it animated really adds all that much. Also the manga art is really good while the anime looked a bit wonky.

I do wonder how much censorship and sample size (only a few thousand votes) play a role though.

The links are for me to keep track of some random things I feel like I could easily mix up. Also, some of the ranks seem to have changed slightly, so OP's list and mine won't match up on some places.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...
>> ARTICLE
The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

> MAL: Rank 764.

China > West. 

Also the fact that all the GitS being rated so much higher says quality tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can get behind this list a little more (one piece is higher :D) 
>> ARTICLE
> 86 WALL-E

wat
>> ARTICLE
It's an animated movie, and a damn good one at that
>> ARTICLE
Yet again, Gintama within the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is fucking huge in China (pun intended)
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised Hikaru no Go is there, no one talks about it
>> ARTICLE
This is the first ranking Ive seen which puts Steins;Gate and FMAB that low. 
>> ARTICLE
This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

[](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

Fumoffu at75, everything is right with this list

>> ARTICLE
Well this season has been way better because they are doing around 4 chapters per episode 

Glad this is out since everything I am following has been on breaks
>> ARTICLE
I think it's the opposite. The story is to rushed, the whole progress is flooded and lose it's important details. The conflicts get solved before they could even build up completly. Actual, the Season is just a series of highlights, like an episodeguide, without real tension. That is really bad.
>> ARTICLE
So you're saying the whole Nakai think should have been it's own episode?
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised they didn't show Takagi apologizing to Kaya in the end.  Usually they're quick to do stuff like that unless they're saving it for next episode?

I'm liking the conflicts they've brought up this season; I thought they'd run out of ideas by now, but Nanamine and the PCP imitations have made it pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely loving it! 3rd season in and anime still feels refreshing. 

Waiting for Nanamine comeback though! I hope they won't suddenly forget about him. 
>> ARTICLE
I hate that Crunchy Roll doesn't have this anime.. It's one of the best animes I have seen lately.

I was surprised when they called Takagi delicate? I think they changed his character a little bit to fit the story, because he doesn't seem like someone who takes stuff to heart. 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that threw me for a loop as well. On the other hand, it made for an excellent episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, this episode was great. I love how excited Hiramaru was when he was thinking Niizuma might cancel his manga. I'm really interested in what their unorthodox standard battle manga will be. I mean, I like PCP, but that storyline seems to be all done, especially with us knowing it won't get an anime and the copycat incident wrapping up nicely.
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping for some fresh ideas too. Maybe not in a new manga, but even in the current ones as they try to compete with Nizuma.
>> ARTICLE
Did it strike anyone else as kind of inconsiderate that Takagi and Mashiro (and heck, the other mangakas too) wanted to get 1st place to prevent Niizuma from cancelling his manga?


In a previous season, Ashirogi Muto were in the same boat. They had that mediocre gag manga that they didn't really like and didn't want to work on anymore. Niizuma said he didn't like Crow. Strikes me as kind of strange that they'd force him to work on Crow as long as possible. (Of course, nothing wrong with them aiming for 1st place just for 1st place's sake)
>> ARTICLE
Nizuma didn't say he didn't like Crow. He said he didn't like how mangas end as in they get canceled once they lose popularity. That's why he wants to end it the way he wants when his manga is still at the top. 
>> ARTICLE
I was so surprized about which manga Niizuma wanted to end, it's a nice turn of events isnt it? I find it interesting, hope they will keep it up through the season.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Sage subs, if I remeber correctly.
>> ARTICLE
Sage started but they have not subbed the past 3 or so episodes, only ones doing it now (I think) is BFS, they work but they have some minor problems.
>> ARTICLE
Fall 2014 is definitely my favorite.  Shirobako, Shigatsu, Parasyte, UBW, and probably some others that im not remembering right now.  Those are all some of my favorite shows, so that was a great season.

Edit - just remembered Seven Deadly Sins came out this season too.  Definitely my favorite single season.



Haven't been watching seasonally for long enough to give a least favorite, but if I were to do so it would probably be Fall 2015.  Apart from one punch man, which was awesome, there were only a few shows that I truly enjoyed watching.  


Plenty of people say that Summer 2015 was really weak, but there was still a good group of 5 or so shows that I really enjoyed watching.  However, there were no real standouts, which wasn't a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
Fall of 2014 was my favorite as well. My least favorite was probably Winter 2015, because outside of Death Parade most of it was meh. But then I'm really not counting leftover series
>> ARTICLE
Personal favourite would probably be Fall 2013, KlK, NNB and Monogatari SS are just fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
2013 summer had nothing worthwhile imo, no wonder I didnt watch anything tht summer.

My fave...maybe Oregairu/Nisekoi/Rokka no Yuusha's season, one of them. Im partial to Rokka's summer since its when I got into anime deeply.
>> ARTICLE
Best - Summer 2014 - *Locodol,* *Hanayamata,* *Yama no Susume* S2, *Sabagebu!,* *Nobunaga Concerto*   

Worst - ~~Summer 2015~~  Winter 2015 gets my vote. *Junketsu no Maria* was my favorite that season, and only at a 7/10.
>> ARTICLE
> Worst - Summer 2015 gets my vote.

D:
>> ARTICLE
I know you loved it, but...  Oh hold on... *Cinderella Girls* S2 aired that season, though I didn't watch it then.

I'll change my answer to Winter 2015.

>> ARTICLE
Much better ;)
>> ARTICLE
I base my original statement on *Gangsta.* dragging everything else down with it.
>> ARTICLE
Was pretty bad towards the end, I see it as more good that season than bad though!
>> ARTICLE
I only watched like 5 shows as they aired that season, including *Arslan* as a holdover from Spring.  Most of the shows just didn't interest me enough to even start, or I haven't watched the first seasons of them.  One show out of five being terrible (*Gangsta.*) influences my perception an awful lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I had a couple sequels and some great surprise SoLs so I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
Best: Spring 2013, Railgun Oregairu, devil is a part timer, nyaruko, Aiura and yuyushiki

Worst: Winter 2014, can't find anything that would redeem the season. Sakura trick and Mikakunin were cute but weren't anything special imo
>> ARTICLE
I take it this just means anime *starting* in that season? I hope so.

> Concrete Revolutio (AOTS)

You, sir, have excellent taste. 

Especially for Fall 2014 - we got Ange, we got more Gundam, we got /u/DestinyFucker, we got TWINTAILS THURSDAY, we got Aoi and we got YuYuYu...

*^(mutters something about /u/LordTakuro being a Nicofag)*

Winter 2015 was a crapshot for me tho. On the one hand we got the second half of Cross Ange and on the other hand we got A.Z S2 (aka. "Everyone Hates Slaine - The Not-Musical")

As for other seasons, I really only got into seasonal watching with Fall 2013 with GBF and Log Horizon (both of which were great, btw). Watched KLK later on and wished I watched it earlier. Most of the other stuff I can't say I really got into, tho.

---

As for other seasons:

Winter 2014: 

* Haven't forgiven Buddy Complex. (Note: DO NOT LET DAISHOMARU WATCH THIS SHOW)

Spring 2014: 

* We need more Mahou Shoujo Taisen *(do all the provinces).*

* Also, how the hell does Madhouse make two LN adaptations that are as different in both content and quality to air *in the same season*?

*tilts head at /r/mahouka & /r/NGNL*

Summer 2014: 

* Sabagebu (Mokarin best protag), the good half of A.Z, SAO's Death Gun arc (makes for good cure for insomnia in certain episodes)

Spring 2015:

Best - Summer 2015. You call it the season of disappointment but I got Akagami, Joukamichi no Dandelion, more Drrr, that godly S3 of Working, NNB S2 and Classroom Crisis!

Worst - Winter 2015. Not counting leftover it was not great...
>> ARTICLE
Prison School was a disappointment?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I was promised the most hilarious sexual comedy, and got light beams and awkward body jokes.

I guess it just wasn't your thing then, I enjoyed it though.

Winter 2014 looks best to me on paper, but i'll go with Fall 2014 because Parasyte was a nice surprise that year.
>> ARTICLE
I might try to calculate some mean scores from each season later as in the OP.

Instinctively I'd say that the best season in the last 3 years would be Summer 2013, and the worst either Winter 2014 or Spring 2015.
>> ARTICLE
Either Fall 2013 (Monogatarai SS, KLK and Nagi No Asukrura are all 9s. Plus Non Non Biyori was solid) or Fall 2015 were my favorite (Owari, Noragami Aragato were 9s. Enjoyed OPM, Yuru Yuri, Gochiusa and Underwater Ray Romano)
>> ARTICLE
Man 2015 all around had some of the worst anime I've ever watched... in every season, but Summer was just not for me.

Best..? Biased 2014 Spring & 2015 Fall. NGNL, Zoku Shou, Ping Pong && 1Punch, Noragami, Rakudai, Utawarerumono.

Couldn't really choose.
>> ARTICLE
Love Live aired in 2013! The show I recommend to almost anyone I know who watches anime as the greatest idol creation ever Started 2-3 years ago. Holy hell.
>> ARTICLE
i have a special kind of hate for the Summer of 2014, because the only thing I watched that wasn't somehow a disappointment was Space Dandy.
 
Zankyou no Terror's flaw wasn't necessarily fatal, but it was enough to take it down a point or 2. 

 Tokyo Ghoul ended up being garbage, Aldnoah Zero ended up being garbage. . . not to mention both those shows 2nd cours weren't any better (AZ's 2nd cour negates anything good about the first), so this is disappointment that ran into future seasons of anime.

 Also, there was so much comic book death.

 I don't rate Summer 2015 much better.

 Summer 2013 was the best.
 Best part of Shingeki no Kyojin and Watamote ruled, plus big surprises in Silver Spoon and Gatchaman Crowds.


 also, Jojo Stardust Crusaders was running for 4 of those seasons and you completely forgot it.
 . .and what about Garo? Garo was Fall 2014/Winter 2015
>> ARTICLE
Best seasons are the ones with Non Non Biyori and GochiUsa.
>> ARTICLE
Best: Spring 2015. Kekkai Sensen.

Worst: Everything else.

Really though:

Best: Summer 2015 had some of my favorites of the year, Shokugeki, Rokka no Yuusha, Gakkou Gurashi, and Ushio to Tora. Also Kekkai Sensen, anime of the century.

Worst: I haven't watched enough of previous years to really make this statement, but probably Summer 2014.

Also Concrete Revolutio is very underrated.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Second half was in Summer though.
>> ARTICLE
I hope Rokka does decent 
>> ARTICLE
How many copies sold is decent?
>> ARTICLE
5k is decent, about top 13-18% of the annual production.  
10k is "good", about top 4-7%.  
33,813 is the line for "masterpiece", known as the Moppy Line. Which is the sales number for Infinite Stratos. There are now 50 Japanese TVanimations in the history to have toppled this number, not counting IS itself.
>> ARTICLE
Geez I never knew that IS was actually that popular in Japan. It's sold as much as SAO did but it doesn't seem to be as popular as SAO is, especially with regards to polls.
>> ARTICLE
IS is so awfully generic and nothing can be talked about except really good quality animation.  
Which is exactly why it is considered the Wall of Masterpiece.  

Yes, most of my personal favorite didn't make through the wall.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely seems like a dumb and fun turn off your brain show, especially if the animation quality is good. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more that the female cast carried the show *hard*. (Let's be real, in a harem the girls are what matter most)
>> ARTICLE
Would you say its like Nisekoi but with mechs? 
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no. They're both very well executed and have a fantastic cast of characters but Nisekoi is an entire order of magnitude ahead on both counts (Charl is the only IS girl who is up there, and that's because HanaKana). Nisekoi also has much much stronger comedy.
>> ARTICLE
probably because SAO audience are teenagers and i don't think a lot of them have 500$ to buy an anime series 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC the stalker estimates for Rokka weren't very high (around 2k I believe).

I know which is sad

it is at .7K unfortunately even Chaos Dragon might sell higher.

Rokka was constantly out-of-stock for many weeks, it was more of a production and marketing issue.

**Final Vol BD sales and Other Info**

Saekano Vol 7, its final volume sells 521 Copies briging its total to 8,560, and the series average to 9,765.

Evangelion BD Box adds 443 to a  total of 25,094. Moves to #4 by sales in yen.

When Saekano first started airing I did not think it would break the 10k barrier at all and now it'll be doing that easily, so I'm very happy at its success!

Kekkai Sensen volume 4 is coming up? How many episodes per volume do they have? If it's 3, wouldn't this mean that they're releasing episode 12 on there, or do they put the recaps on blu rays as well?

It's 2 episodes per volume

Final volume (with the last ep) comes out November 18th IIRC. Still a while to go.

wow next week looks like the moment when we get to look at how our friends over in the Nippon like what we consider this season's up and commers. I hope Rokka does well, but I bet MonMusu and this season's sports shows will probably dominate. 
               
                
Ookami Shoujo's special edition sold 6,458 copies?? are the Blu Ray figures that high? I'm surprised, I mean, I know the manga did well, but numbers like that might mean a second season, which I'd be super grateful for.
>> ARTICLE
The trend with AmazonJapan now, SymphogearGX probably will claim the seasonal top with about 16-17k prediction, and Overlord taking the second place with about 12-13k.

These are Volume1 numbers.

OK, plea to the /r/anime community (no spoiler tags because it's not really plot-related):

Niizuma Eiji talks about a manga where the superheroes belong to the periodic element table; his editor tells him there is already such a thing.

Twist: This is true in reality. There was a comic (Marvel?) from the 50ies or 60ies with exactly this configuration. I read it, it exists.

Does anybody know about it and could give me more information or a link? Tried to google it, no success.

I have a question wasn't the Chief Editor presented with an anime adaption of PCP back when it begun? Whatever happened to that?
>> ARTICLE
I recall some character claimed that PCP is the sort of manga that would never get an anime adaptation, but I don't recall which episode that was.

I don't recall the chief editor talking about an anime for PCP.
>> ARTICLE
PCP never got an anime adaption because it can be easily imitated by children. But PCP was adapted into a Drama CD and into a novelization.
>> ARTICLE
I just love how we never got to really know what Crow was as a manga throughout this anime so far and not even knowing this amazing ending yet knowing PCP and some of their other manga's more I just love the feeling that was like "Damn Crow is awesome" plus as everyone has said Ejji really is cool

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default

Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.

It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed

lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.

OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.

I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Two things from Fate/Zero

1. Each of the servants life before coming heroic spirits. When I saw lancer's flashbacks I thought it would've been really cool to see stuff like that made into a series of episodes where each episode or two focused on a different servant.

2. Kiritsugu's Magus killing days. The 2 episode backstory for him was cool, but it would be really cool to see what happened in between some of those missions with Natalia and [Fate/Zero Spoilers](/s "What he does after he kills Natalia and is alone.")

The only one I can think of is the [show](http://i.imgur.com/um1r0pF.gif) they watch in Mayoi Neko Overrun!, that'd be interesting to see I guess.

The story of L's life (Deathnote.)

It's not really a story but i would still love some back round and memories from that character.

13 episodes of L watching people eat potato chips

I'd still watch it though.

I was thinking the day dream Satou has at the beginning of Ep2 could make a fairly interesting story. I would have liked to see it go further!

Yes, everything from Bakuman really, especially that one where they ranked intelligence or whatever. I'm more than confident Ohba and Obata could pull it off and make it really good if they tried to.
>> ARTICLE
The story that has been in the armstrong family for generations!
>> ARTICLE
I want to see Mashiro's manga from Sakurasou become an ani- Oh wait.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Bakuman doesn't have the same impact on me if I watch it while airing. I watched the other 2 seasons after they finished, and basically marathoned them. Now I have a single ep to watch, then have to sit around picking my nose for a week.
>> ARTICLE
Naw, Bakuman discussion is still a pretty lively field. 

I'm seeing your point with Iwase. I always thought that Ohba made a bit too much needless drama with the inclusion of her romantic side. I never really considered her that much of a likeable character.
>> ARTICLE
I don't quite like her either but I have to give her props for giving Ashirogi Muto that advice.

And what about that 'working together' (for lack of better words) between Iwase and Nizuma?!
>> ARTICLE
Ashirogi Muto will prevail!!!
>> ARTICLE
i lol'd
>> ARTICLE
is this worth watching from season 1? or rather, what would be a good reason for me to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Both seasons are amazing definetely worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
season 1 is great and season 2 is even better!
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the show just cause I love the concept of following your dreams and Mashiro's crazy relationship with Miho. There isn't much to discuss when everyone has probably read the manga ending. 

Although I do like seeing their reactions with the Crow +Natural crossover. Some intense scenes between Mashiro and Nizuma though, I like how those are portrayed. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, but please tell me Nizuma, and Iwase don't work out. That is a terrible combination. Iwase is just trying to get anyone at this point. Kind of sad. 

I'm glad Mashiro is able to figure stuff out on his own now. It shows a drastic difference between now, and at the beginning when Hattori basically held his hand. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga either, but I prefer that going into this anime, nt knowing what will happen next, so I'm not too sure what will happen between Nizuma and Iwase, although it would be interesting to see.

Agreed, it does show his growth throughout the anime, and all he needed was that little push from Iwase
>> ARTICLE
Nizuma doesn't get in a relationship with anyone. Just to make you feel at ease. He said it himself, he's an eternal boy, that's why he can make shonen manga. xD
>> ARTICLE
its a good anime... i just cant figure out why its called bakuman. is it the name of their manga that will get an anime or something?

>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's been cleared up yet
>> ARTICLE
is the manga still running?
>> ARTICLE
[According to MAL, no.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/9711/Bakuman.)
>> ARTICLE
I figured it was a combination of the words that describe them. Remember in season 1 where Saiko says that his uncle always said that unless you're a genius, you're a gambler, just looked it up and its BAKUchi (or something like that), and they're MANgaka, so they're gambling manga writers.
>> ARTICLE
that sounds right. wow... you are really smart.
>> ARTICLE
I love Bakuman but it's really annoying watching Mashiro blushing when holding hands with a girl he plans to marry. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, he doesn't know how to deal with that, as he's rarely ever close to her
>> ARTICLE
I was genuinely interested in the manga they showed at the very start. I actually still want to find out what happens in the classroom of truth.

- Also, thank the lord it was finally subbed
>> ARTICLE
I've got a feeling this new guy will be around for a while, not like KOOGY, who frankly, sucked.
>> ARTICLE
Well the new rival is really something else. I would've thought the editor in chief could see through him.

I'm a sucker for the manga ideas in this anime and classroom of truth was really exciting. I hope we get more of that soon when Ashirogi Muto start their new project.
>> ARTICLE
> I would've thought the editor in chief could see through him

I think he has, but because of the situation he will play along with him for the time being. What other choice has he after all?

Using crowd intelligence for a fight between pro's is BTW really unorthodox. I love that point about bakuman that they do the things themself they describe in the story :) But i can already see the outcome of that system. After all it depends on the constant cooperation of high quality-workers.
>> ARTICLE
It is a business, as he said, he wants to publish it ASAP before the guys popularity dies down. So there's that.

"You weren't even trying to make it good, but it was". 

Best line of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
By the way, this isn't a filler episode. It's in the manga and their relationship does matter. The manga ended already so I highly doubt they'd put filler episodes on this at all.
>> ARTICLE
[I haven't started this season yet..](/s "Did Hiramaru ask Aoki out?  I'm just trying to peg where this episode is and what all the commotion is about.")
>> ARTICLE
Yep it's at that part
>> ARTICLE
The fansubbing group at one time took over a week for one episode during season two, I guess they are pretty busy and just want to do it right.

It was a pretty funny episode, but I agree on the filler assumption... but I'm not to sure, this was a huge developement for the two characters and I hope they wouldn't let the plot differ that much from the manga. Maybe someone can enlighten us.
>> ARTICLE
The manga has been done for some time now, I'm not sure why they would do a filler ep, unless they were shooting for a particular chapter to be the last episode of this season. 

I'll have to check it out, I'm a bit behind the anime right now. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's not a filler then.. [Aoki] (/s "just seemed out of character to me").
>> ARTICLE
That's because Aoki has character development over the course of the manga. All the authors that we know right do matter with the overall story since they're rivals.
>> ARTICLE
HIRAMARU YOU'RE THE FUCKING MAN.

BROFIST

Amazing episode.
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe that in all of the anime community, only one person is dubbing episodes of Bakuman. It's really a bummer to have to wait nearly a week between episodes. I hate to complain about things that are free and all that, but I just wish someone would take over the subbing that can do it as fast as every other series seems to be getting subbed every week.    

As far as the episode is concerned, I actually really enjoyed it. It was a funny episode, as well as having just the right amount of heart given the overall feel of the episode. I think if anything, maybe the relationship will serve as more motivation for Mashiro to get an anime so he can finally be with Azuki. 
>> ARTICLE
$539,085 ring. Way to show everyone up Hiramaru. :D
I'm glad everything worked out for Hiramaru, but I think an entire episode should have been devoted to that alone. 

You can really tell they are racing through the content. I don't know if I love it or hate it. I obviously have liked Bakuman since season one or I wouldn't be watching season three, but I did think the first two seasons were a tad slow. Now I think they are a tad too fast. Maybe I just don't know what I want, but a compromise between the two paces would be nice. 

At any rate, this season has flown by, and I'm going to be a bit sad when it's over. Such a great anime. AOTS without a doubt. Possibly AOTY, but only time will tell.

I think it's time for Ashirogi Muto to rise to Eiji's expectations. However, that preview makes me suspect they'll have to make a choice between an anime or beating Eiji. Not sure, but "Pride or Dreams" sounds ominous. 


>> ARTICLE
As someone who has read the manga, I can tell you that things are going to be getting a little hairy coming up. (If you know how highly some VAs are held in Japan, you might have an idea already)
>> ARTICLE
explain pls??!
>> ARTICLE
In Japan (At least from some instances I have read about), companies hold their VAs and Idols in the same light, no relationships while they are part of the company is pretty normal; and backlash is bound to ensue if a relationship is discovered. (Most recent that I can see is the AKB48 idol Minami Minegishi, and one that has been going on for longer is Aya Hirano)  As far as I can tell, this is because they market them as "Belonging to Everyone" where if they are in a public relationship they "Belong to One".

Hopefully that is going to be as Non-Spoiler as I can make it.  I believe the I''s manga had a similar scenario.
>> ARTICLE
Why am I so happy over a fictional relationship? Holy shit, YES. I love them both (yoshida and hirumaru).

No wonder why Sword Art Online got a second season.

Wait, *Jinrui* broke 5k? That's...rather surprising, actually. Also, I thought *Space Brothers* was ridic popular in Japan, why'd it only sell 873 copies?

Space Brother doesn't end, people don't want to try to buy it all / are hoping for some eventual bundle? :3

Note this doesn't include re-released sets and bundles.
>> ARTICLE
Space Bros is a long running late afternoon show that exists to promote the manga and also gets decent TV viewer ratings (so it makes money via commercials). 

This is different from the late-night shows that exist to sell BDs (although there are late-night shows that exist to sell LNs & manga, too).

I completely forgot its not a late night show. I should pick the manga back up, it was like the only long-running I could stand to read anymore.

I'm surprised Kokoro connect didn't make it that high.

**EDIT:** [This](http://wakarimasenlol.com/2012/09/04/the-kokoro-connect-bullying-incident/) pretty much covers it.
>> ARTICLE
Why would they do that?
>> ARTICLE
The creators of the show did something to a voice actor, they pulled a mean joke, making a fool of the guy. The show did sell some copies, but a lot of people decided against buying it because they heard about this story. The creator even tried bribing the guy they pulled that joke on to tell everyone it was all a joke, which came out too.

It sucks though, I loved the show, would have really wanted another season.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the songwriter for Eufonius (singer for the OP), right around that time, called Momoi Haruko's dream "pointless" on twitter, grabbing lots of hate (which is understandable). The staff had to immediately change the OP for the anime because of backlash.
>> ARTICLE
That explains the sudden OP change at an odd point in the series. I rewatched it recently and couldn't work that out.
>> ARTICLE
I think they were trying to save it for the OVAs, but were forced to play their cards early.
>> ARTICLE
> called Momoi Haruko's dream "pointless" 

What's her dream?
>> ARTICLE
To summarize:

"My dream was to have people sing the songs that I made at the karaoke box. That dream has now come true, and people are still singing my songs today. Interviewers often ask me about my aspirations, but I don't think it's a time for that. I want to do something that would make someone happy."

That's what she tweeted, to which Kikuchi (the songwriter for Eufonius) tweeted back "Pointless."

They just kept digging their hole deeper.

*Inu Boku SS* really did that well? Surprising. I dropped it around the 3rd episode. Might give it another spin.

I continued to be saddened by the fate of the incredible *Kokoro Connect* and the stupid politics that left it where it was. I'm rewatching it right now and it's still lovely and wonderful.

*Jinrui* breaking 5k makes me so happy. Jinrui makes me so happy.

*Psycho Pass* earned its second season the hard way with a series free of fanservice and focusing on an intelligent and fascinating concept. Excellent stuff. Genuinely loved it and eager for me.

*Accel World* is also deserving of a second season, but currently living in the shadow of its sibling series, *Sword Art Online*. SAO had its moments but never impressed me or wowed me the way Accel World did - its antagonists were less interesting, its combat less kinetic and powerful. Here's hoping that once SAO2 is done (and here's hoping SAO2 is a huge improvement over the Alfheim arc), Accel World gets a second shot.

*Mouretsu Pirates* remains the greatest love-letter to electronic warfare and the politics of performing ~~insurance fraud~~ space piracy. Not the greatest thing ever, but very much a personal fondness of mine as an EVE Online player.

Need I say anything but *Panzer Vor!* for the other big gun up there? That got a rewatch recently too, it's such great fun. Also another series to forgo as much objectifying fanservice as possible, even if it is still cute girls being cute (with tanks).

I still don't know why I watched all of *Nyaruko*. I know even less why I watched all of the second series, too. Maybe something about the flying cat manta.

*Fate/Zero* and *Chuuni* are both great fun, but I don't have much to say about them. I'm watching Chuuni 2 right now. It's good! I just can't put an opinion on 'em.

*AnoNatsu* was alright, but fairly forgettable fluff. I finished it and it was nice?

I thought *Another* was more popular than that, even if I disliked it myself. The more I think about it the less I like it in retrospect. Dumb Ways To Die, the animation. Unfulfilling, unlikeable, goth doll nonsense.

*Kill Me Baby* has the worst OP and deserves to suffer for it. The absolute worst. Ow.

*Thermae Romae* was excellent fun and had the BEST ANIMATION EVER. Didn't expect it to do anything of note though, although I hear the live action movie was popular.

*Recorder and Randsell* is a show with precisely one joke, that somehow manages to be consistently funny. A nice break between shows.

*Nisemonogatari* is... well... *Bakemonogatari* with the Limiter disengaged. So very worrying. So much fanservice and... questionable everything. Such dental hygiene. I can't say I don't love it, but it's not as good as Bake or Monogatari 2.

*Eureka AO* is a disservice to the name Eureka. Dropped.

*Tsuritama* (fishbros) was surprisingly compelling. *Nichibros* was funny but less compelling, I didn't stick with it.

*Tasogare Otome x Amnesia* was a really, really beautiful, funny and smart show. It was rather unusual though with its tonal shifts and story variation. I can see why it didn't do great. DRAMATIC EGGROLL.

*Sankarea* was also very pretty, but felt very incomplete and slow. Definitely needed more content. The antagonist was genuinely unpleasant but not in a particularly interesting way.

*Zetman* wasted my time, first by rushing through the manga at breakneck pace, then slowing down for the uninteresting parts. Catchy OP though.

*Shirokuma Cafe* is literally the most average and inoffensive anime I have every watched. It is my new defining line for middle-of-the-road.

*Black Rock Shooter* surprised me with its moments of depth, was visually pleasing the rest of the time, but ultimately comes up short. The combat sequences needed to better reflect the actual struggles of the characters, and the character designs needed better unity across the material world and the Other world.

*Robotics;Notes* also fell short for me in the long run, but I feel was worth watching. The last few episodes felt very rushed, while earlier episodes seemed to drag.

*Phi Brain* is just awful and earns its place as a DNC.

Speaking of awful, *Aoi Sekai no Chuushin de*'s first episode is a mandatory watch for anyone who likes Hyperdimension Neptunia or less specifically the console wars of the early 90s. It's staggeringly bad, but so bad it's hilariously, brain-burningly funny. I was in literal pain from laughing by the end of the episode. I still can't bring myself to watch the second (I hear it's less funny).

*Moyashimon* terrifies me on an instinctive level. I wish I could explain why. It just does. Creepy creepy.

*Blast of Tempest*, despite leaning a little too heavily on its Shakespearean namesake for bits of dialogue and references, had the best discussion about the plausibility and systems of time travel I've ever seen. While the second major arc wasn't quite as fascinating, it was better paced than the wandering and talking heads of the first arc. Continually surprising anime, even if it did lead me to name the "purple swirly despair zone" and remark "OH NO IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN" practically once an episode.

Nearly forgot the bleak and fascinating *Shin Sekai Yori*. There's a series it takes some time to decompress from. An insight into an alternate sort of culture, emerging from drastic changes to the world - but one still familiar and relatable to the real conflicts between people today.

*Bakuman*'s conclusion was a long time coming, but necessary. A sweet slice-of-life series about writing manga from the duo behind Death Note. Great characters and relationships, but very mild and lacking any sort of dramatic tension all too often. Nice to put on if you're eating or ironing or just doing something monotonous and want something to watch. However if you dislike the main duo early on, or their love interests, stay away. It never gets better but it never really gets worse, either.

*Btooom!* felt skeevy all over. Wasn't impressed in the slightest. Dropped early on.

I think that's everything I watched in the 2012 season, give or take a few. Man, and originally this was just gonna be the first sentence.

I'm incredibly happy that Girls und Panzer was that high. I was not aware how popular it was in Japan, and this, combined with Arpeggio of the Blue Steel's showing in 2013, makes me hopeful for more military-themed series. Hopefully the Kantai Collection anime will be a continuation of the ideas behind these tactfully done series, and not cater too heavily towards the fanservice viewer base.

Vacuously clever animes are called DEEP, easier to write, let's go with that

Anime, even if it is a full fledged medium on its own, is still a medium to bring mainly entertainment. I don't think there is always a need to think about any messages as long as it is enjoyable. It does seem like it became chic to add some philosophical questions to your series as many authors try to reproduce the success of Ghost in the Shell or similar titles, so that is a given. Nevertheless, if all animes were as dark and serious as GITS or Neon Genesis Evangelion, I would get seriously depressed. I never watched anything just to seem smarter and I refuse to act like animes are more intellectual than something else. That's like watching hentai to learn about female anatomy. Or to learn about female behaviour (lol).

Anime is fun. I want to have fun. Therefore I want animes.
>> ARTICLE
*Ghost in the Shell* is actually an interesting example.  It had a lot of artistic polish and internal consistency.  It also had an amazingly voluminous amount of material - TV series, movies, and a huge amount of original manga stories.

I think it preached several hundred messages, some of which were deep and serious and true, but most of which were probably false.  For example, I think one of its messages is "It's cool for governments to terrorize their own citizens with police brutality," and I don't agree with that message.  I love the visual art of that series;  I think the messages were mostly bad.  By contrast, I liked the message of *Ergo Proxy*, but I think *Ergo Proxy* is less artistically impressive than *Ghost in the Shell*.

As for *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, I don't think it succeeded in preaching anything.  I only watched the original TV series, but I think the writers failed to achieve internal consistency.  

I understand the director's life totally sucked, I understand no ordinary person could have done that job under that much real-world stress, but in the end I think the director failed to tell any kind of story.  He generated loosely connected ideas for 24 episodes and then threw up his hands and said, "I'll finish it later, if I get more budget.  Meanwhile here are some episodes that barely qualify as animated, so there's no point trying to write a meaningful script."

Whenever people talk about finding deep meanings in literature, I think back to Grade 10 English class where we discussed Catcher in the Rye. At one point some of the people in the class chose to analyse some line about some ducks that I don't even properly remember, because it was just one line in all of the novel, without any relevance to anything else in the novel, that was taken to be a particularly significant metaphor. Or something.

I think that 'deeply thoughtful' anime is necessarily a rarity, because anime is primarily entertainment and vacuously clever sells better. Do you expect the average American to read Animal Farm or Brave New World for entertainment?

On a related note, I found SAO, the Light Novel, to be an interesting piece of science fiction. There is a subcategory of science fiction that deals with the near-future and the effects of technology or possible future events on society and their possible implications. SAO had somewhat less of this than other fiction I've read, but it does qualify for the category (Western examples would include Blindsight, Accelerando, Daemon, and Cory Doctorow's works). In contrast, the anime adaptation, while it covers the same events, lacks the details and weight that highlights such (not to mention that atrocious adaptation of Aria that destroys pretty much all of Asuna's potential character development in the series). In other words, in order to creation an adaptation that fit within the time constraints imposed by the medium, both characterization and 'deepness' were cut. Such is entertainment.

Where did you see that? It sounds more like Akira.

>As for Neon Genesis Evangelion, I don't think it succeeded in preaching anything. I only watched the original TV series, but I think the writers failed to achieve internal consistency. 

The main theme is "humans need to communicate, otherwise things stagnate / bad things happen". (Examples: Toji at the phone failing to call Shinji; the telephone pole falling apart at the beginning of [End of Evangelion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrUvol0Hr7U))

I think the director actually wanted to show cool stuff to underline that message, but in the end had to "throw up his hands" because of money and because they wrote the story as they went, not finishing it before starting production.

>Where did you see that? It sounds more like Akira.

The first TV series convinced me that the Major was totalitarian.

I got the feeling that the author was pretty deranged with glee whenever he depicted police brutality.

The Major seems to be the author's ideal woman, and her ethics are highly inconsistent.  In the first movie, she seemed like a typical good-guy cop.  In the first TV series, she seemed pretty deranged to me.  However, I haven't watched that show in a long time and I should re-watch it before trying to explain the specific lines of dialogue that made me write off the Major as a fascist.
>> ARTICLE
If you **really** want to extract some perspective out of GitS, it's much more worthwhile to view the show, it's characters and the events it portrays from the vantage point of Togusa and not the main protagonists/antagonists.

He's the base for the "Human" point of view throughout the series/franchise, in much the same way that Duncan Idaho is the recurring every-man in the Dune novels.

Why the emphasis on application. Why can we not be purist in our musing?

I mean at a certain point all these ideas we can apply to our lives become kinda trivial. I enjoy Miyazaki films for the atmosphere and animation not for the "no shit sherlock" messages. Similarly even the complex messages of Welcome to the NHK! and such become obvious eventually. I always find that the most interesting examples are the hypothetical. They often speak not of the obvious wrongness of current society but of the potential failures in the far future, which is where we should be looking. Take Stuff like ghost in the shell and serial experiments lain with their interesting though provoking ideas on the future of the internet, direct interfacing, limitless connectivity and the effect of unrestricted communication on society and the mind. Yeah it can't help you with your life decisions but it is far more interesting. 

In the case of bebop I never felt it was meant to have a *message*. That vacancy, lack of direction and certainty was the message in itself. Instead of being obvious with it's message it conveyed all that thought through atmosphere alone which is why it is often considered a masterpiece but that is just my opinion.

Really I can't understand your interpretations of the messages. The most interesting shows are the ones that have messages you **don't** agree with, it means stepping out of your comfort zone and being rounded, because if you escape from some opinions by saying "I don't agree with this" you may slip into the habit of not evaluating them properly (everyone falls into this trap me included, it is the beginning of logical fallacies).

Finally, err ghost in the shell preaching that terrorizing the citizens is cool? Umm, that's exactly the opposite. Just because something is shown does not mean that is the "message", I feel you miss the subtlety here. The police brutality is shown as something that should not be, by showing you this scene unadulterated the creator allows you to decide for yourself what to make of it. If you decided "By showing me police brutality his point must have been endorsement of police brutality and I don't agree with that" then you are just looking for a fight. I feel that the correct interpretation is, "look at this police brutality, as I witness it I come to see how bad it is how bad it is. By showing this to me the creator has given me a genuine way to understand how bad it can be though is media".

About the "Supression by the government is okay": I only watched the first two movies and did they really said that? Sometimes, only a topic or question is brought up and its implications are shown, but in the end it's up to the viewer to interpret as he/she likes. This is also a methode I like more.

Neon Genesis Evanngelion was never about being smart. Anno even admitted he only did some things because he thought it would be cool. What can be considered mature about is are the characters and the mental scars and illnesses they bear and how they interact with each other. This was interesting to watch so I have no complains.
Also about the budget part, I have read once that they actually tried to become bankrupt in order to aviod taxex as NGE was the final project before everything goes down.

I need to re-watch the first TV series to find the exact lines.

One of the key points is something the Major says to a suspect when she arrests him.  It sounds like a trite platitude - something along the lines of "if you don't like the world, change yourself."  But a lot of her dialogue convinced me that she's a sociopath in the TV series.  I got the impression in just about every episode that she had been corrupted by her cyborg lifestyle.  I got the impression that she was trying to be a secular humanist and failing miserably.

Conversely, in the first movie, she's a fairly decent police officer and secular humanist.

When you look for lessons in any form of popular media, you're going to need to pluck them out in small bites like vegetable pieces from a stew. Most good/popular/critically acclaimed anime have a few very cool or thought-provoking ideas that they present. And then they have lots and lots of material that exists just for the sake of entertainment. It is extremely rare that every frame of animation, word of dialogue and measure of musical score is put in place deliberately by the show creator to teach you a lesson.

You can CHOOSE TO FIND messages in anime such as "Ghost in the Shell condones police brutality" but you can choose to find any message, in any medium. I think it's unrealistic to expect any given anime to express more than two or three deep thoughts, and equally unrealistic to severely judge an anime series for "conveying the wrong ideas" when it more than likely exists as an entertainment device, not a teaching tool.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure why the OP is looking for messages in the first place. Not every story's purpose is to communicate a message, and it doesn't need to be.

Specifically with Ghost in the Shell, there's no real message there. It's an exploration of themes: The nature of the "soul" and how (if) it's tied to the body, speculation on what it might be like to live in a world that's being enveloped by a sort of Kurzweilian singularity and how it might affect both humans, technology and other forms of sentience brought about by the marriage of the two, or how would a cyborg body (androgynous or not), even a non-existent body, affect gender identity and sexuality.

There are strong ties to other literary works, particularly J.D. Salinger; see The Catcher in the Rye and also The Laughing Man.

If what the the OP took away from the GitS franchise is "It's cool for governments to terrorize their own citizens with police brutality" then, fuck me, I don't think it's the shallowness of the franchise we need to be worrying about.

>Death Note... logical rules

The rules were pulled straight from the author's ass
>> ARTICLE
Where the rules came from isn't really the point. You can point to almost any speculative fiction and say the same thing, from "hard SF" to "pure fantasy".

But I'm surprised that people don't find the meaning, or at least the questioning, posed in Death Note: what is good vs. evil here? What is Justice? Sure, the bulk of the enjoyment of the show is in watching the chess game between Light and everyone else, but still the theme leads you to ponder these questions. In some sense, that is a better treatment of these topics than preaching the answers at you.
>> ARTICLE
I like where we're going with this.  
Short thing is, like every anime, every rules was pulled out from different asses. The amount of pull, tug, the sheer size of the asses, even up until the length of you-know-what, are bound by what kind of rules are being pulled by the author. The only thing we, just like any other viewer can do, is to thoroughly experience the lovely moment.
>> ARTICLE
Well, obviously the rules of an entirely fictional supernatural device are made up.

The difference is that the rules in Death Note were made up as the manga went along and weren't derived from any Grand Unifying Theory of the Whatever. They were like Superman, a shitload of different functions. Laser eyes, super speed, super strength, ice breath, and so on (I'm forgetting a ton of different powers here).

Compare that to, say, Superboy, who has exactly one power: tactile telekinesis. He can move whatever he touches, no matter how heavy it is. And this power can be used in different ways by different writers: lifting heavy shit, catching people who are falling at terminal velocity without them going splat, flying, punching dudes really hard. But all of these different uses are justified by the original power, while all of Superman's powers are separate powers entirely.

You see where I'm going with this? The Death Note rules mostly don't derive from anything already established in the Death Note world, they're just introduced by the author as we go along.
>> ARTICLE
>The difference is that the rules in Death Note were made up as the manga went along and weren't derived from any Grand Unifying Theory of the Whatever. They were like Superman, a shitload of different functions. 

The difference between *Superman* and *Death Note* is that *Death Note* had a unified vision of the story.

*Superman* started as a team effort and degenerated into writing by committee.  The story was meant to ramble on endlessly.

*Death Note* was a polished effort toward a clear ending.  I wouldn't be surprised if the author(s) came up with some of the logical axioms on the fly.  However, the author(s) treated all axioms and derivations rigorously.

They don't even make sense, at least not the name one. I spent too much time thinking about this.

What counts as the person's name? Isn't a name something the person identifies with?

I don't understand why writing "L" and visualizing his face wouldn't kill him, it's the name he goes by the most, so that's his name, end of story.

But what does the Death Note consider to be a person's name? Their legal name in society? If someone gets their name legally changed, married, adopted, does their name for the shinigami change too? What if you live in a tribe where you are not given any legal documented name?Does the Death Note consider it to be the name they were given upon birth?

None of this matters for Shinigami, for them it's just the name above people's heads, but what is the name that shows up above people's heads for them, and why is it that the Death Note only accepts that name?

You are massively overthinking this, and looking for meaning where the creators intended there to be none. Anime is a form of entertainment. Sure, there are a few out there that will really make you think, but they are a small minority. If you really want that kind of intellectual stimulation, read a book or go see some plays. Even mediocre books and plays will make you think more than a great anime will most of the time.

Also, I thoroughly disagree with you on Cowboy Bebop. Both the show and the movie are centered around dealing with the past. Sure, our pasts are not as brutally violent or adventurous as the characters within Cowboy Bebop, but the takeaway message is that running away from your past never does you any good (wherever you go, there you are).

> You are massively overthinking this, and looking for meaning where the creators intended there to be none. 

This seems pretty common with some anime fans. For example, fans found far more stuff in NGE than Anno put in.

Yeah, I agree. Evangelion is really not that complicated. People frankly just pulled meaning out of nothing to make it seem super crazy. I think this happens when people get super obsessed with anime and it becomes their only form of entertainment. They lose sight of things that have actual depth and meaning behind them, like books and plays.

Honestly, I don't think he's overthinking anything. Rather he's underthinking it. A lot of the "messages" he's given as examples drawn from the shows merely touch on surface level narrative and not the actual themes being explored through those narratives.

Cowboy Bebop and GitS blatantly stick out like a sore thumb.

It would be pretty easy to conclude that vacuously clever would be better applied to the person critiquing the subject matter rather than the subject matter itself.

The problem with "messages" in entertainment is that you can see whatever message you want from any work. Instead, relax, and just enjoy the show. And if the show is not good, no message in the 'verse can save it.

As I said in another post, not all stories have or need a message, many are just thematic exploration and that's OK. If you force yourself to find a message (and you're really bad at doing so, like OP) then you're going to come across as an idiot when you critique those "messages" as shallow and asinine.

Imagine if I'd walked into /r/Shakespeare and proclaimed that the message "talking to skulls makes you cool, apparently" was pretty weaksauce and Hamlet isn't all that deep after all. I'd get fucking eviscerated on the spot.

Actually, no, I do the opposite: I don't search for messages. I consider anime as entertainment, period. What the author thinks is his private life.

I'm curious: Where does that conclusion comes from?

Sounds interesting. I should try it some day.

>I'm curious: Where does that conclusion comes from?

It comes directly from his post where he concludes that the people who think Cowboy Bebop has interesting themes to explore might tell him that it's something like:

>If you live a life of adventure, some of your friends might fall in love with you, and those friends will be very sad when you die a violent death at a young age.

That's dumber than a bag of hammers.

I don't care if you personally, or anyone else for that matter, don't want to dive any deeper than surface level narrative. That's cool man, do your thing and enjoy the narrative (or don't).

However, if someone chooses to dig no deeper than that, and then criticises a show and medium in general for being shallow simply because they didn't pick up on (relatively speaking) obvious thematic exploration that lies beneath the surface like, oh, I don't know, *how we choose to deal with traumatic or tragic events from our past and how dwelling on them can be ultimately destructive*, no-one is going to take them seriously.

I think Cowboy Bebop is about how people to deal with the past. Spike can't let go of it, he wants his revenge, even if he has to sacrificing his curent relationships. Jet confronts his past when meeting the woman that left him years later, and get over the hurt he felt. Faye [Spoiler](/s "has problems due her amnesia").

I think good anime may use a [Central theme](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme) (warning TVTropes), but if the characters are bad developed the "theme" goes to waste.

Some series are all about characters: I don't watch Hunter x Hunter for some deep meaning, I watch because of the characters, watching them exploring this "world". Kurapika revenge and his interaction with the "spiders" are the highlight of the series, on my opinion.

One anime that really moved me was Revolutionary Girl Utena. The prince Utena was waiting didn't apear? She goes and resolve the problems herself. At least for me when things got bad, no one came to my "rescue" and I had to be "the prince" myself or I would still be waiting...now, I don't expect many series ring a bell so close... most are just mindless fun.

If you're looking for complex ideology, you should probably stop looking in Shounen...


On a serious note, here's the problem: it takes a smart person to write a smart story. Not that anime producers or mangaka are stupid, but lets face it, they are not all genius-level wordsmiths. 

Truly complex and thoughtful anime certainly does exist. Take Serial Experiments Lain, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or basically all of Satoshi Kon's work for instance. These anime have such heavy themes and intricate characterization that they're open to multiple interpretations. You can't really say the same thing about something like Death Note. Light and L are smart characters and the twists in the story are certainly well-written. But everything is spelled out for the audience. The rules of the Death Note are carefully explained, Light's schemes are broken down piece by piece, etc. Truly intelligent stories don't explain their symbols or their meaning, but leave the audience to decipher them. That's what makes them engaging. And not all of them succeed. There's a fine line between thought-provoking and outright confusing.
>> ARTICLE
A very good point. However I don't think forthright narration is an automatic sign of the author's lack of intelligence or sophistication. Rather, it is a stylistic choice that is often informed by the limitations of the medium. 

I think reading Bakuman gives a lot of insight into Ohba an Obata's creative process. They clearly depict the struggle of balancing intelligent story design with the need to fit a visual medium and to be marketable in manga.

 The characters in Bakuman, who are arguably avatars of O&amp;O, are specifically aiming for a shounen audience and Shueisha/Jump as their vehicle. Perhaps, if they were pursuing a more indie or niche publisher, they would have more freedom to tell nuanced story without laying it out piece by piece for the audience.

When a show is directly about a specific intellectual message, it tends to get extremely preachy. I feel the best kind of "intelligent" show is one that raises a variety of viewpoints and themes through its characters and story, but leaves it to the viewer to draw their own conclusions, or no specific conclusions at all. Plus, I just don't think anime is the medium best-suited to long-winded philosophy. Anime's strengths are, in my mind, twofold:

A. The medium is incredibly adaptable, and can both starkly depict stories impossible in other mediums, as well as combine storytelling, visuals, and sound more perfectly than most other media.

and

B. Anime as a medium tends to focus sharply on character's interiority and the subtle ways they interact with others. This isn't a strength specific to the medium itself, but it is a tangible piece of anime's tradition, and so I consider it tied to the medium itself.

Because of this, I feel the best anime are those that combine a strong visual aesthetic, a powerful synthesis of storytelling, visuals, and sound, and a sharp focus on characters to tell specific and personal stories that nonetheless are universal in their applicability to viewer's lives. Often the messages involved are not complicated, but their execution can put a spin on these messages that invokes something in the viewer's own life, and make them reflect on their own experiences.

Basically, I consider anime a storytelling medium, and the 'intelligence' of a show to me is how thoughtfully and powerfully that story is told - do I believe in the characters, does the animation and music propel the themes, do I feel this story reflects on my own life in some meaningful way, am I emotionally involved.

Frankly, I find most art that is specifically about some specific idea or point pretty empty - it is very rare that a story like Animal Farm will come along and raise a strong point while still standing as a powerful story in its own right, and most imitators end up with stories and characters that ring hollow, just serving as vehicles for the point. Even Animal Farm I find a pretty tepid read; what's so intellectually stimulating about being told the correct viewpoint to have? I much prefer something like Evangelion, which is filled with painful ambiguities and forces the viewer to draw their own conclusions.

I think when Bakuman refers to anime as being about "ideas" they are not saying it's about having a message, they are saying it's about well-designed plot events that push the story forward. This seems more obvious to me because the writers of Bakuman also wrote Death Note, a story where the characters *are* pretty much just pieces on a chessboard working in service of plot events, and are never really developed to be three-dimensional people. At the other end you have a show like FLCL, where the plot is made into an overtly absurd sci-fi metaphor because the show is really about Naota handling his adolescence.

Ultimately, I love characters, so I'm biased, but my opinion is that something has to first be about characters for it to even begin to be about ideas. If I don't believe the characters on screen are fully developed people, I won't believe the words coming out of their mouths or the actions they take reflect a reasonable response to their world. If a story is told well, people will feel something, and because of that, they might also learn something. Cowboy Bebop doesn't have one specific message, but it is a lovingly crafted slow-burning rumination on fate and identity. You don't have to be a space cowboy to empathize with Spike's inability to grow beyond his past; that show takes a personal experience no other human being could have, and finds that which is universal within it. That, to me, is the purpose of art.

>I think when Bakuman refers to anime as being about "ideas" they are not saying it's about having a message, they are saying it's about well-designed plot events that push the story forward. 

Well, Bakuman contains excellent plot devices.

I'll reiterate what I started with:

 I would really, really like it to be true that anime is all about ideas. ...
Realistically, I would say that every story has a message, but many of those messages are trite and counterproductive.

So it's entirely possible that the writers of Bakuman don't have any kind of Central Theme, and I am seeing the trees as epileptic.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees

If I tried to argue that Bakuman is meant to teach people about some of the painful details of real-world dedication to self-actualization, people would probably accuse me of " a state of mind that, for example, interprets every plot as an allegory for the rebuilding of one's soul, every setting as a manifestation of purgatory, and every protagonist as a stand-in for the Christ":

What you seem to be asking for are themes and messages that can be conclusively proven by the text. Real art *virtually never has those* - it has a multitude of messages or ideas that can be conclusively *supported* by the text, but not one 'right answer'. The point of art is to be a fertile canvas for audience interpretation - art is a conversation, not a lecture.

So if you have evidence from within Bakuman that supports that interpretation, that's great - Bakuman meant something to you, and thus is succeeding as a piece of art. That "Jesus in purgatory" link only applies to bad art, and to deny someone an interpretation because they're 'looking too deep into it' is to deny the audience-creator exchange that makes art anything more than entertainment.

Although your interpretation of Bakuman is in my opinion fairly obviously supported by the text, and people arguing against that are probably just against looking at any art as more than entertainment.

That's an interesting viewpoint.  I don't think everyone would agree with you, but I suspect a lot of contemporary artists would agree with you.

I think a lot of art in the past was meant to be inherently preachy or propagandistic.  Consider the fact that before printed novels, people with the time to read would amuse themselves by reading books of sermons.  Many of the earliest novels were pretty darn clear-cut in terms of message.

These are some issues I could argue about at great length, but I should probably take that to a subreddit devoted to art theory, if any such subreddit exists.

Great comment. 

I too love character driven stories. When people who don't watch Anime ask me why I watch Anime I tell them that there is so much possiblity for character developement within the medium. Anime alone has the ability to create and depict a character exactly how the creator sees them in their mind's eye. Without the limitations of actors. Well maybe voice actors...

The best animes in my opinion are great stories with depth and layers where I can get emotionally invested in characters, explore ideas/themes (the whole gambit from Sociopolotical to Metaphysical) whilst entertaining me.

Ghost in the Shell was more about the "soul" and who we are. Whether that be a physical being or our mind who makes us who we are. Along with the encroachment of technology and its influence on our lives, whether that be good or bad. You decide. Meanwhile I am entertained by action and Sci-Fi.

Monster is about a brain surgeon who has to deal with the guilt of performing a life saving operation on a boy who turns out to be a killer. It's a little deeper than that but don't want to give away any spoilers. I highly recommend Monster. Only have way through it so I haven't finished it yet. 

The biggest peeve of mine is when a show dictates what theme will be protrayed by the way the story is told. Don't just spoon feed me your ideology, I'd prefer to be gently guided in the direction, figuring it out myself.

I like to think that the episode [bookends](http://paleocave.sciencesortof.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/4218072088_3f282ea71a_o.jpg) are pointing to the fact that we already are, on some level.

So you don't enjoy allegorical stories? You mention Animal Farm, but I don't think that's a fair example to compare character-based stories to. Orwell needed his message to be transparent enough for people to understand without explicitly referencing political events or real-life people. As a result, the book is not a stand-alone story for sheer entertainment. A fairer comparison would be Lord of the Flies, which I think has a better balance between theme and actual characterization. 



>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Animal Farm is a bit of an unfair example. My two problems with that book, which aren't necessarily inherent to allegorical stories, are first that, as you said, the characters take a back seat to the point, and secondly, that there is a Single Big Point in the first place. 1984, for example, fixes this; the characters seem real, and perhaps more importantly, the points Orwell is making are much more ambiguous and general. It's like Orwell himself is sorting out his feelings on the nature of humanity and government, and isn't just trying to Tell Us The Truth. I would wager that I wouldn't enjoy any piece of art where the creator set down primarily to demonstrate why he is right about some specific point.
>> ARTICLE
I think you are trying to be overly critical of a medium, who's shows are mostly aimed at young adults to teens. This demographic isn't generally the best for inserting philosophical points or a driving narrative promoting deep conversation, especially at the "younger" end of the demograph. That said there are still anime out there that will offer these sorts of things, perhaps you are just looking the in the wrong places. 


This is true of the majority of audio/visual mediums in my opinion. There are very few western movies and shows that have deeply thoughtful narratives that make me reevaluate my opinion on things or reflect on where I am in life. Much more of that will get put into books, where it is much easier to drive stories with internal conflict and characters reflecting on themselves. You generally need action or conversations to flow in audio visual medias to keep an audience engaged. 


With regards to Cowboy Bebop, one point I thought that could provoke conversation was about the way [Spoilers](/s "Spike allows his rejection of the past to completely destroy his future. In one episode he says about his fake cybernetic eye: >I lost it in an accident. Since then, I've been seeing the past in one eye and the present in the other.
Implying he doesn't see a future for himself, which is why he leaves the ship at the end to confront Vicious. He can't see any future for them and can't stop looking to the past, so he needs to confront the past. Though it turns out he was too late in confronting it and suffers from it. Leaving the message that you shouldn't dwell to much on the past and regret, as it ultimately serves you no purpose and ruins what you already have.")


Even despite this I think the anime would hold in terms of likable characters and such, but I do think it makes some points that are worthy of reflection and discussion. But it's important to remember that most anime won't be making grandiose philosophical points on the state of humanity and personal choices in life. 
>> ARTICLE
You make an excellent point about *Cowboy Bebop*.

It's not that I expect all anime to be full of grand philosophy.  One decent philosophical statement in an anime is enough.  For example, *Samurai Champloo* has a bit of dialogue in a Zen monastery that is pretty deep, but the rest of the show doesn't preach at all.  I'd like to think that the deep philosophy reflects the author's sincere feelings.

The line is, if I recall correctly:

"People are originally born free.
They were not born to be bound by anything.
But isn't that contrary to a warriors duty ?"

"Freedom isn't something that you earn through suffering, or by pushing yourself hard. Also your social status or job doesn't matter.
You must accept yourself the way you are, and live your life according to the flow of things.
That is true freedom."

Read a book.

Anime is a medium whose main purpose is entertaining people. Often those people are the viewers, sometimes an investor, and not as seldom as hoped it could also the producers or writers ego that need entertainment. In every case the form of entertainment is based on the target und context. Like an investor seeks productplacement and viewers some good story, or sexy girls or even a satisfying message or lection on some topic. And also have different people different interpretations of what they see. If you don't understand that, you should enhance you knowledge, so...read a book. Read many books. Watch many movies and series, and not only anime, but on a wide area to get a wide spectrum of understanding.
>> ARTICLE
> [](/s "Fiction always makes sense and is easy to understand;")

You, sir, have never watched a Shaft anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, "clever" is more of an entertainment sort of purpose rather than the "real life application" like in Bakuman. It's more about having fun, those kinds of anime/manga. Most anime, when they're based on manga, are usually more popular/widely acceptable manga. And they then end up as just "characters that have interesting qualities in an interesting plot" rather than "breaking down and examining characters and the human condition".

If you want things more deep about the human condition and the nature of the world and such, try more seinen manga. Kokou no Hito, NHK ni Youkoso (The anime is much shorter/shallower and completely flip-flops the entire series' premise with its ending.) Uchuu Kyoudai, Vinland Saga, 3-Gatsu no Lion, Skyhigh, Hito Hitori Futari, Hachimitsu to Clover, Historie, Kingdom, I Am a Hero, Kuragehime, Liar Game, Oyasumi Punpun, Real, Shamo. Those are a bunch that fall into more of that kind of "Bakuman" category that I can think of.

When it comes to FMA there is a very thought provoking subject in the anime. 
Throughout the whole series they claim almost every episode that alchemy is based on the law of "equivalent exchange" and they take it as an established undeniable principle, [Spoilers](/s "but in the end all of it is thrown out of the window as you find out alchemy itself can only be performed by sacrificing the souls of those in the other world, drawing a parallel to our own world, Earth.")

Ergo. Proxy.
>> ARTICLE
When I was watching Ergo Proxy, I liked it. I felt it was deep, but then I became scared: was it actually deep, or was it DEEP? From a certain perspective, you can always twist deepness into DEEPNESS. AFAIK there's a similar quarrel about Neon Genesis Evangelion.

I then did a meta-MST3K-mantra and just relaxed and enjoyed the show.    
If you have not seen EP, well, you know. Watch it.
>> ARTICLE
On Full Metal Alchemist, the world it creates is based on fantasy, but I thought the story itself has many things relevant to modern life: the questions about scientific ethics (experimentation on human subjects), the questioning of the established rules of society (the fascist order of their society is based on an inherent falsehood), the speculation that the ills of humanity (war and conflict) may be due to a secret cabal that manipulates people against each other for their own personal gain (very relevant to our times today), that reason and cooperation can win the day in the end, not discord, FUD, and hatred.

All of these are very interesting and relevant themes that do apply to how we operate in a complex world. Now and Then, Here and There is a case study deconstructing the shonen worldview--that their positive humanist worldview, naive as it may seem, should be a light that guides in a world of darkness. Hence, I have come full circle, from disdaining the bright-eyed machismo of typical shonen to giving it a grudging pass in most cases.

Either way, despite some flaws, FMA is as good as any decent light SF/Fantasy novel.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. What I've concluded is that most successful stories are either calculated from beginning to end or are just written on a whim. The former tends to feel forced (but internally consistent) while the latter feels natural (but interally inconsistent). However, I feel like this represents a larger issue, mainly that most people see the world either abstractly or realistically. The abstract type like clear-cut messages, universal themes that are unambiguous and reliable. They like logic and philosophy for its own sake, painstakingly creating their fictional world as a vehicle for their message. The realistic type like making stories mirror real-world actions and motivations. As a result, their stories are more character-driven and their messages tend to be ambiguous in that interpretation plays a large part in how the viewer receives the theme. While I think it's possible to find a balance between the two, it's very easy for a mediocre writer to mess up this balance (and the audience WILL notice because the work will come across as confusing and cluttered). 
>> ARTICLE
>What I've concluded is that most successful stories are either calculated from beginning to end or are just written on a whim.

With anime, the interference of editors and producers must be considered.

A writer might have a completely consistent "beginning to end" vision for his story, but he might be forced to compromise on getting it implemented due to production constraints.

Like the ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion?

That's true. Sometimes there are time and economic restraints that force writers to curtail their story prematurely. On the other hand, you have shounen series that seem never-ending, even after exhausting almost all of their good ideas in previous arcs. This is okay if the creators just want to ride the gravy train, but ultimately, the series suffers for it. 

Thus, I think the success of a story comes from how the writer decides to pace events in the long term. Do they want to tie everything up the first time around? Great, but that means they shouldn't add another season or volume once they see how popular it's become. In contrast, the writer has a great formula that potentially leads to an indefinitely long series? Great, but make it more character driven (or more episodic) rather than create plot-driven mini sagas because it just isn't going to come together well.

Long-running series often benefit greatly from very large ensemble casts.  

If there are dozens of important characters, a very long story can stay fresh.

When it's one major hero going through similar conflicts over and over, it gets stale.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga because I was too impatient to wait for the anime. This will almost definitely go on for a fourth season, possibly a fifth at the pace they're going at. On the other hand, they seem to be intentionally leaving out at least one character, so they might skip elsewhere as well.

I didn't notice it while reading the manga, but the line that the sister says ("If you give up here, that's game over") is from Slam Dunk, and was apparently voted [the most popular one-liner in manga](http://www.psu.com/forums/showthread.php/294654-And-Japan%C2%92s-Most-Popular-Manga-is%C2%85-\(Survey-Says\)?p=5848178).

I agree this anime is moving really slow now. This is also probably my least favorite arc so it's getting painful for me. I'm really hoping they don't drag it out into a 5th season. I'll still watch it though it's still a good anime. It always gets me a bit excited whenever I see them progress as authors
>> ARTICLE
Completely agreed. Currently, it's painful to watch it just because it's so slow.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming you haven't read the manga?  I would say it's definitely going to go to S4.  Also they are skipping a ton of material and the pace is actually rather brisk for everything they need to get past.  It's only episode 5, give the season a chance to warm up.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still as hooked as ever, and I haven't had any problems with the pacing.  Each week, I'm excited to see what happens.  With PCP not ever being allowed an anime series, what will Saikou be able to do??  Will Shuujin really be able to write three stories at once??  How will they manage to create a series that goes to anime?...  I guess it's also easy to stay excited when I hear that so much stuff happens in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised the discussion for this anime is so slim. I actually really like Bakuman. I heard about it on this subreddit and ended up marathoning the first seasons because I thought it was so good/hilarious.

Noone was seeding any of them. I managed to find one that had all 3 seasons in it on a site and got it now. But goddamn was this not a popular release or something? It has such good ratings on MAL and the previous two seasons are fucking amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think you are talking about the same one I checked. Glad you got to it.

Anyway, I think more of an issue is its age. 3 years might as well be a century on the internet. People stop seeding stuff over time, and when you combine it with the fact that most anime (including bakuman) is not exactly mainstream, you get lots of dead torrents and no legal ways to watch certain shows.

It's an old show and seldom do people feel like seeding something 2+ years old.

I have literally never had trouble finding a legal place to watch or a torrent. Hell I even went to Amazon to go buy it but its literally 400 dollars for both sets... Im all for paying for anime in fact I do often but fuck if im paying 400 dollars. And I have honestly found numerous older shows that were seeded by people. Season 1 and 2 for example had plenty.

This is probably my favorite episode of Bakuman so far, for obvious reasons. It touches with a real issue many idols and seiyuu have to deal with - a crazy portion of their Japanese fans. I think most foreign otaku would agree with me that it's crazy and reaaaally stupid that idols and seiyuu can't date openly.


And also it was probably the most honest and heartfelt Azuki and Mashiro have been about their relationship so far. Looking forward to the next episode! I'm hoping that anime director will support them and cast the best seiyuu regardless of how it looks to the media (hopefully that seiyuu is Azuki).
>> ARTICLE
"Here's a person that brings joy and happiness to my life, lets get in the way of his!"... sigh. Sometimes I wish the anime market was big enough to push these obsessed otaku into irrelevance. Alas, its hard to compete with people who spend virtually all their money on something. I guess you could "blame" the producers for banking on them to support their projects. 

EDIT: Specially when it comes to idols, its harder for a newcomer to sell 1 copy to 100 people than 10 copies to 10 obsessed otakus. Of course they also end up jizzing on their hands before going for the handshake on the next meet and greet.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so heart touching. Death Note (The previous manga of bakuman's mangaka) was strong, but this one, just about dreams and love, is still so intense and so beautifull at the same time. 
>> ARTICLE
This was a really interesting one to me, I was not aware of these issues present in the lives of an idol/celebrity.  What struck me most was Azuki's boss obsession with trying to preserve her image as an idol, at the expense of robbing Azuki of her true personality and humanity. Although it was for the fans' and ultimately her own career's sake, speaking the truth and dealing with the consequences is much more beneficial than trying to prop somebody up as being a (false) symbol of purity and innocence.
>> ARTICLE
I am really glad to finally see more of Azuki. It's really a shame we didn't get to see more of her through the whole series, because she's a very likable character.   
I really have loved this series so much and I like to think I know where it's headed, and if I'm right about that...then there will be many manly tears to be shed. Such a wonderful series, bittersweet to see it come to a close, but the timing is right for it.

The series is split into different arcs: child arc, teenager arc, adult arc. Something like that. But the first arc really blew people off with a lot of same-sex romance.

From what I can gather, the first two seasons were really just a split cours thing with a continuous production schedule (like VVV and Fate/Zero). They could do the same again, but I'm sure it ultimately depends on what Kadokawa wants to do.

Yea, but it was an adaptation of volume I and volume II. Volume III is larger in length and size. Idk, they *could* do it again, but I don't know if they would want to.

Does Ascii Media Works want to promote the novels more? Does Warner Home Video feel another season would be profitable (Ryo-Ku-Byo may scare them)? Disc sales are only one part of the equation. Here's the committee for it:

* Warner Home Video (Video/Music distributor)
* Ascii Media Works (Publisher)
* Bandai Namco Games (Video game creator)
* Sunrise (Animation Studio)
* Genco (Animation production company)

It takes all of those companies to agree to make more if and only if AMW wants to promote the novels again. If they want to move to another franchise, there's nothing anyone else can do.

well they want the series to continue for as long as possible so I guess you can really say that it kind of is predictable to guess what happens.

IIRC, when they announced this season as Bakuman, they advertised it as the third and last.

I've heard the manga goes a long way beyond where the anime will end up, though, so you've still got a point.

It was nice to have a more Kaya-centric episode, even if it was only for the first act or so. I've always been surprised that people don't seem to place her on any lists as far as "hot/cute characters" go.   

It seems like maybe the story is coming to a head and will be wrapped up with this season, but I've never read the manga so who knows, something could happen and we could see a season 4. I would have no problem with that.    

I couldn't agree more about Eiji. I was expecting him to be the prototypical antagonist of the story when he was first introduced, but it turns out that he's actually one of the best characters. But, I'm still rooting for Ashirogi.

Ok, I just re-read the final few pages of the manga. I dunno how it's in the anime, but in the manga Miho says after the kiss: "From now on I'm always on your side, and you are on mine." (translated from the german manga by myself) that could be somehow related...

But maybe even the kiss itself was the "2nd promise"? Since they never did it before.

Yeah they did the same thing in the anime. I was also thinking that the kiss was the promise. It's just bugging me that I cant remember when or what promise they made. Thanks anyway xD

iirc, the first promise was not to see each other until they make their dreams come true, the second was, upon completion of what "dreams coming true" entailed, to marry, both mentioned when MC. obviously the first one was compromised on. and at least the anime gave a wedding scene, the manga ends at the first kiss.

Thank you for sharing this. Good to catch up.

Am i blind, or i see no zetsuen no tempest in it?

[edit] 

Nvm, it had its translated name.


It's a shame the sales were bad, ZnT was definitively one of the most underrated anime this year in my opinion. Ending may have been underwhelming, but the writing was definitively more clever than in most anime. 
>> ARTICLE
i don't know what they were thinking by subverting everything in the first half of the show and turning it [into](/s "a cheesey romcom"). i watched the show with zero expectations, got beefed up for this interesting magic war and [then](/s "the climax neuters the show's driving force via an impotent villain, wrapping the conflict up in differences of opinion settled immediately and everything that follows is like a lighthearted comedy/romance.")

it wasn't bad. i liked the show and how it ended but it could've done a lot better if it had kept its initial feel.
>> ARTICLE
This is the same problem I had. I was so bored in the second half that I quit watching with two episodes left. I usually like rom coms a lot but it just was so different from what it started out as. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but it was still nice to see them debate the metaphysics of the issues rather than brute force it like they do in any anime.  It was a welcomed change of pace for me.

How the fuck did Chuu2 outsell Hyouka?

It pandered harder. Anime rankings are not hard to figure out.

I am very pleased to see Accel World on this list. I had a blast rewatching it this week. Personally I think the story and animations (as a whole) were better done in Accel World than in Sword Art, but I do agree that Sword Art has a much more compelling hook and main character. I still would have liked to see AW come closer to SAO

Have you by any chance read the manga for Tokyo Ghoul?
>> ARTICLE
I have.  I watched the anime before reading it though. I do have a few gripes about the adaption, but I think they did a decent job. I think a lot of manga readers give the adaption way more hate than it deserves. Some of the anime additions didn't quite hit the mark, but I think some did. The biggest problem with the adaptation is just not having enough episodes to fit the content it needs to, but that's not the writers fault. The main thing I love about the ghoul franchise is the psychological themes explored and the deep symbolism. The anime did a really good job of preserving those imo.
>> ARTICLE
Which one is better? Anime or manga? 
>> ARTICLE
Without a doubt the manga. If I hadn't read the manga I would have rated TG a lot higher, but they absolutely butchered the story
>> ARTICLE
As I said bellow, the anime gets a lot more hate than it should. The story isn't butchered, it's just condensed. The anime is a good standalone watch if you prefer the medium. Having said that, the manga is better in all aspects except one. The fight scenes are done better in the anime, but that's probably to be expected.

watched ghost in the shell season 1, is the second one really that good that it is so high up on your list? Also how does it compare to the first season.

the main difference is the animation is better. I think they had a bigger budget for the 2nd season.

One of the best that came out this year in my opinion, my friend recommended it to me and i loved it. Great anime

It really was.  Made me feel all the feels. Great show.  If you haven't seen the directors other work (Please Teacher, Please Twins) they are very similar and just as good.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I'm planning on watching Please Teacher cause I heard it was also pretty good. Not sure if i'm gonna watch Please Twins

>> ARTICLE
I honestly enjoyed Please Twins more.  Teacher (IMO) tended to drag a bit in the middle.  Also IMO Ano Natsu de Matteru was the best out of the three series.

Is steins;gate really good? i have only watched 1 episode then never watched it again, is it something you recommend to revisit?

It's one of the best done anime I've ever seen. I wouldn't say it's perfect or anything but the way it's executed is masterful and every moment is important in the end.

It's reeeeeeeeally slow to start, but once you get to episode 10 (or so), you wont be able put it down. If you're impatient, I'll understand if you skip it; There are a ton of great animes out there.

that's exactly what i did, i went back to it like 4 month's later and loved the crap out of it.

 so yeah give it a longer go, its worth it in the long run

Really?  At what point does Clannad start to pick up?  I'm stuck at episode 4 cuz it's slow...
>> ARTICLE
Clannad Afterstory is when it gets interesting, imo of course.
>> ARTICLE
It's supposed to be slow. That is how romance works in well written anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Heh, that's also how romance works in well-written real life. ;)
>> ARTICLE
I loved how it was slow and well thought out. It made it so much more believable. Tomoya, while in school, is just a carefree guy that's just going through life, although he does have some drama in life. Kinda shows very well the life of a high school student. Then AS is where the real drama of life comes out as he matures and works for a wife and later on a family.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
You're right. But...no idea how to use spoiler tag.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is super slow until about half way through season two where it tears your heart out and repeatedly kicks it until theirs nothing left. If anything it hurts more because it was so god damn slow. By the end the slowness will kind of be worth it but if you're anything like me you'll never want to watch anything like it again... not that it's bad it's actually amazing, just emotionally draining.
>> ARTICLE
No offense but if you already think it's "slow" and so on you should just stop watching it, maybe you're not in the mood for it or maybe it's simply not your kind of anime.
>> ARTICLE
I feel doing that kinda holds you back though. I think all anime should have at least a go at. Might regret it later down the road.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I asked, a lot of them seem to start slow and then pick up later, and if you quit early you miss it.

There's enough other things in common on this list that I started to wonder.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably not your cup of tea. There's two seasons, and it really doesn't get to the meat of things until the second season. The 1st season is more "slice of life/drama" and the second is just pure drama.

Okay, thanks for that insight. :)

Steins;Gate gets honorable mention, because I haven't finished it yet. Otherwise I'd imagine that it'd be on the list.

Also, this is a ranking of my opinion on series, not shows. Pretty much what I mean is that how I have Evangelion as number 1, I mean the entire Evangelion series, not just the original 26 episode anime. This applies to all the titles I listed.

no particular order here but here's mine

1. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (if you haven't seen, just trust this is an 11 episode masterpiece)
2. FMA Brotherhood (I can't begin to explain HOW good this shows characters are)
3. Durarara (If you can handle the unnecessary amount of exposition the first few episodes throw at you, then you're in for a treat)
4. Kokoro Connect (main series just finished and there's 3 more episodes to be released in march next year, It will be worth the wait)
5. Toaru Majutsu no Index (Both seasons are really strong, particularly the 2nd. I'd suggest skipping out on the spin off series though)
6. Mirai Nikki (Oh boy if you like cool plots with even cooler plot twists and characters you OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check this out. Don't let the start fool you though)
7. Darker Than Black (All Seasons, it's just good)
8. Kaicho wa Maid Sama (hilarious,cute,fun, and an amazing main duo, if you're in to this kind of thing it's one of the best of it's kind)
9. Hyouka (some of my least favorite characters types still somehow made AWESOME)
10. Soul Eater (Regardless of the mixed feelings I've seen about this one it'll always remain one of my favs)

Sorry for being so long >.<

I'll give my top 9/154, seeing as nine are rated 9 or 10 and if there was something else I could include, I wouldn't have given it an 8. Rough ordering since at this level it's hard to choose them over each other.

New LIST! :D

1. Gintama (Who doesn't love some gintoki.)

2. FMA: Brotherhood (Very good story)

3. Naruto (Been watching for so longs now)

4. Darker than black (Characters are epic)

5. **Steins;Gate (damn dem feels)**

6. Gundam: 00 (Story so good)

7. Hikaru no go (Loved the story)

8. Kenichi: World's strongest disciple (one of the best animes ever)

9. FMA Original. (such a good story too)

10. Bakuman (I just love these kind of stories)


>> ARTICLE
1. FLCL. In my opinion it simply can not be beat in the overall category. Its got style, characters, and message.  
2. FMA: Brotherhood. Its hard to beat a story like FMA has and the characters are the bees knees  
3. Cowboy Bebop. This is mainly a style and characters choice also one of my first so it will always be special  
4. Bakemonogatari. Bake has some of the best characters in any anime and the dialogue is unmatched also the message behind it all is great  
5. Baka and Test. This show exemplifies everything about being funny and ridiculous best if watched with a good group of people as I did
6. School Rumble. This show will always be special to me because its humor is unique and always manages to stay classy  
7. Another. I admit I stopped watching this show when it was still coming out but I was persuaded to go back and finish it and it was well worth it. Contains my absoloute favorite episodes of any anime.  
8. Vampire Rosario I want to clarify that I refer only to the english dub. the sub is rather creepy but the dub is full of comedic genius, also great watching in a group  
9. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I have watched this show including both seasons and the movie at least three times and every time it gets even more interesting.  
10. Mira Nikki. This show has just the right level of creepy and intrigue that I could not wait for each new episode as they were being released.

Honorary mentions(because its hard to limit lists):
Kore wa zombie desu ka? omitted cause first season was pretty bad
Nichijou. gets a little dry midway through but it makes a good comeback
Madoka Magika. Love it but it just wasn't top 10 material
Angel Beats! I get a lot of hate from people for not liking the characters as much as I should but honestly the main character was annoying. Overall it was really good though

Not everybody has seen it though.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is great, but after having seen as many anime as I have I can comfortably say that it is in my top 25, but not my top 10. I don't see anything wrong with a list without CB in the top 10; it isn't like they are saying the anime is bad, it is personal preference and if someone doesn't have it in their top 10 then it isn't one of their top 10.
>> ARTICLE
All I've heard is that it's 75 episodes of awesomeness!

>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, but I found Bakuman's plot to be extremely gripping.  To me, the most appealing thing about the anime was its intensity; it really captures the passion of manga creators and involves the audience in the ups and downs of their careers.  I wouldn't give too much regard to those criticisms.
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and I believe it captured the intensity quite well.
>> ARTICLE
They miss out on Ryu Shizuka, and his great way down. Other than him, i have no real problem. 
>> ARTICLE
Aw the show just completely leaves him out?

I mean he wasn't too central to the story but I thought he was fun
>> ARTICLE
The anime is good but I can see where that criticism comes from. There's a certain charm to reading a manga about making manga that you can't really get from anime.

Plus the art is done by [Obata Takeshi](http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads//2012/04/19674_bakuman.jpg) who uses a ton of shots and stylings that can't be emulated in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't read the manga so I can't answer you.

The best thing to do is to read the manga but I only read if the anime doesn't cover the whole manga or that there is no anime.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is pretty good but as with most manga to anime adaptations, the pacing could be a bit slower, especially for people who have already read the manga.

The anime is a very faithful adaptation though.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of my few 10/10 shows, but I still prefer the manga even if the Anime is a good adaptation, basically, in the manga it actually works better because the authors use the tropes the characters are talking about on the manga chapter itself
>> ARTICLE
I've seen and read both. Both offer different experiences.

The manga gives you Takeshi Obata's incredible artwork which generates a type of excitement you can't get from the anime.

Whereas the anime has great voice-acting and music that you can't get with the manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's great, and tells a complete story. Not really much else I can say.
>> ARTICLE
This is the series that introduced me to the SoL genre. It's a great series, a bit frustrating since its a bit longer than most other SoL series. There were a few times I felt the story slowed down, but usually by the next episode I was back into it. 

The characters are fantastic and for the most part are by the end of the series incredibly well rounded characters. There are times where you cheer right along with the characters, there are also times when you get a little unhappy with them too. 

One other thing I'd like to mention is this show has some of the best side characters I've seen in television. They aren't dull and threading just disappear when the episode doesn't center around them. They are fully integrated in the plot and it's fantastic.

Overall I think anyone who is at least open to the SoL genre will enjoy this series, and you'll enjoy it even more if you would be interested an inside look into the manga industry.
>> ARTICLE
Yea i love sol im sure ill get into this thx :)
>> ARTICLE
The Bakuman anime is a decent adaptation, though I personally prefer the manga. If you do end up watching the series and liking it, you might want to try Shirobako afterwards. It's got a similiar premise.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is one of my all time favorites. Definitely give it a watch. I wish it got talked about more on this subreddit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I dont hear it getting talked alot so i was wondering about it but now im convinced im going to start watching thx :)
>> ARTICLE
I love this anime. The story is so good. The ending was basically perfect. 

Now I think I want to watch it again! 
>> ARTICLE
Lol Nice ill give it a watch then :)
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman is one of the few anime that grows as the series continues. I think most of others agree, since the subsequent sequels received better ratings than the previous seasons.

Enjoyable, doesn't stick to too many tropes.
>> ARTICLE
I think Bakuman is the start of my love of "meta" series - series that talk about the manga/anime industry in general.  It really opened up my eyes to how the industry works and why anime is constructed the way it is. This continues to my love of Shirobako this season.

As a manga fan, It's a pretty spot on adaptation, with the exception of I believe one arc... it's been a while so I forget if everything got adapted.  And as an Obata/Ohba collaboration, that can only be a good thing. 

There are issues with some of the female characters, but the romance is still cute, if a bit unrealistic. But 
>> ARTICLE
Um
Bakuman in two days
*Are you okay?*
>> ARTICLE
dude i couldnt stop.... and im -1 subject in this cemester :/
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really care for the romance plotline or anything, I just loved the storyline. 
>> ARTICLE
Great story, loved the characters. Except the coupling for the main two MCs. Felt really bad for the girls the entire three seasons. 

Edit: also really enjoyed the layout. Not real enemies, just rivals and pushing themselves to get better, fight against time constraints. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought Bakuman was great, I didn't expect much from the plot in the beginning but it progressively got better and kept me interested throughout the show. The cast of characters worked well together, each with their own interesting personalities. It was really interesting to see little bits of how hard it is to become a manga artist and the struggle to get to the top. While I wish there could've been more seasons, I think it ended perfectly and ended when it needed to. Definitely a show more people need to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
> While I wish there could've been more seasons

It adapted the whole manga. There is nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
but but but maybe baby mashiro :/
>> ARTICLE
I really love that about Shonen Jump adaptations. As long as it's popular and not a long running battle shounen, there's a good chance the whole manga gets adapted end to end.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it and am very glad i watched it before Usagi Drop.

Bakuman is one of my favorite anime so it's nice to see it mentioned here. It's been a while since I saw it so I just rewatched the last episode and I'd have to disagree, while you don't actually see them getting married, you do see him proposing and them moving in together, so it's pretty much implied that they'll get married at some point. I think the ending wrapped up quite nicely, which seems to be unusual for SoL anime these days. A lot of them seem to have completely open "meh" endings, but this one ended at a nice place.
>> ARTICLE
You're right. I hadn't watched half of the last episode that's why I didn't know.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
So I did read the entire manga. I'm so disappointed. That is definitely my favorite manga and it ended so abruptly and cliff hanger ish. The only storyline I haven't finished is code Geass (my favorite anime) and its actually shaping up to what I want it to be out the hundreds of anime and manga I've seen. Why :,{?! This stuff is so stupid some times. American shit wraps up nicely and has proper endings. Wtff!!!!?!! 
>> ARTICLE
I liked that it was a kind of meta ending in itself. If you recall, they finished their last manga, the one that got serialized, in an ambiguous fashion. Bakuman itself ended the same way. I really liked how they did that.Also there wasn't much to do after that. The entire goal was getting an anime and getting married. What more did you want from the ending of getting an anime and getting married?
>> ARTICLE
Watching them get married. And the a few years after.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, loads of American shows don't wrap up well at all. For instance Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate: Universe, Undergrads, Space: Above and Beyond, Dark Skies, and Firefly come to mind right away.
>> ARTICLE
I don't watch any of those xD
>> ARTICLE
> The only storyline I haven't finished is code Geass 

Go finish Code Geass. You said that you wanted a satisfying ending.

The seasons get better as you go on.
>> ARTICLE
The second and third seasons go through the material faster, but they don't feel rushed by any means.
>> ARTICLE
I believe they cut out some non-essential arcs from the anime iirc. The show never feels rushed though. 
>> ARTICLE
They skipped an arc as far as I can tell. They also didn't introduce characters that didn't contribute much
>> ARTICLE
I've also read the manga and only watched the first season unfortunately.

As far as manga adaptations go, covering 3 chapters is common so it shouldn't be rushed at all.
