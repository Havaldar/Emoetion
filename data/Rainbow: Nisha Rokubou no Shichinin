What's  WT!
>> ARTICLE
It's the new system on reddit which means "Watch This", it's when people recommend series to others. I'm gonna be using that tag for all my reviews that I rate as the two highest categories.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that already existing in the animesuggest section ? I've seen people use a flair to recommend a certain anime  they liked
>> ARTICLE
Something similar, it's pretty much the same system as on /r/manga. there is a mod post around somewhere with explanations and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Watch This!
>> ARTICLE
> 7.96/10 

Why, thank you for letting me know it's not an 8, those 0.04 points really helped me in my decision. Changed my life around. Excellent use of the decimal system.
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome, in all honesty though all I did was simple math to reach those points so I figured why the hell not, would you rather I stick to one decimal?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think ratings altogether are relevant for a WT. It's not really meant to be an objective review, but more a recommendation for people who don't know about a show or who wouldn't have given it a chance otherwise.

I think it would be much more interesting to simply talk about what makes the show worth watching and what people might dislike about it.
>> ARTICLE
True but the main intent of the post was to be a review, I stuck WT! on the post simply because I believe it's worth the time and I rate it highly enough to warrant such a rating... so that's more of a secondary thing really.
>> ARTICLE
Whew....that was close. If he had given it those .04 points you might've wasted your time watching it. :)
>> ARTICLE
I was going to not read this, then I saw who wrote it and went fuck it, might as well.

Seems interesting, I'll give it a go after I finish my backlog (my incredibly long long long backlog). 

As for some feedback, maybe add a TL;DR at the bottom. Not sure about other users but I tend to skip to the TL;DR, and only read the review if the TL;DR says good things about the show. Might get you more reader Cryzzalis
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for reading bro! yeah a TL;DR is probably a good idea, I'll add one to this review immediatelly.

That would be Texhnolyze. Lol but you aren't far of at all.

Dropped the show at around episode 17. Haven't watched it in about 2 years but since this thread was made I may pick it up again.

Glad it was of help too you, hope you'll look forward to the next one, it'll likely be Nisemonogatari.

+1. Great read. Didn't know the author was also behind Kaiji. Wow.

Thanks! I'll try to have another one up by the end of this week or the start of next keeping some feedback I've gotten in mind, hope you'll check that one out as well.
>> ARTICLE
Please do, I love reading insightful posts and they add to the cumulative quality of this sub!
>> ARTICLE
People tend not to discuss anything old on /r/anime. Instead new threads generally revolve around airing shows or just a general like/dislike discussion thread.
>> ARTICLE
TIL:  2010 is considered old in this community.
>> ARTICLE
Some of my favourite shows are basically fossils in that case.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it way back and remember crying for different reasons for most episodes. It's just so powerful and really puts your own, personal problems in perspective. Beautiful animation and some incredible moments that you'll remember after the last episode.

And that OP really got me pumped. I would really recommend it, it's such a brotastic show of broness.

EDIT: I think it's a shame so much of this sub's focus is on newer shows. I would love to discuss older shows more. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it in 1 1/2 days and rainbow is a masterpiece IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I've never heard of this anime but I'll put it on my to watch list. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a good gar title, but the second half really dragged, and i think that took away from the overall series. Pretty underrated ost too
>> ARTICLE
Rainnow is pretty good, I actually recommended it in the last issue of Aninews.
>> ARTICLE
Rainbow Nisha is one of my favorite anime's I've ever seen. The plot, the theme, music all blended really nicely. Wasn't a big fan of the animation but I looked past that. Rainbow was the first anime in a while that really impacted me when I finished watching it. All the struggles that the boys went through during prison and after really depicts the problems people face today. In the end it also, despite sounding cliche, shows us the importance of friendship. I agree with you about how the show is underrated. Wish more people would know about this hidden gem. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it is not very new, nor does it contain a strong female character presence.I didn't think it lacked popularity though. It is in MAL's top 100 for rank.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Hence why I did not say 'no female characters'.
>> ARTICLE
It's old and at the same time not good enough to reach highest portion of the anime rankings. Even though it is an unique show, these kind of shows are also easily forgotten.
>> ARTICLE
Great anime, unnecessary second season imo tho.
>> ARTICLE
There is nothing to talk about it and it was pretty silly at many point anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Redline scraping by in photo finish.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.
>> ARTICLE
In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

I loved all of it, really enjoyable

Holy shit.

I feel like I need to watch this.

You should, it's pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

[](#yousaidsomethingdumb)

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

Yep, sounds like you understand!

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Eh it's also not popularity, or http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin would not have made it up there.

Reborn! at 86 is a nice surprise. I think Naruto part 1 deserves to be in this list but it makes sense that it isn't, considering the hate it gets on mal. The top review there complains about its popularity in its first paragraph.

From my quick scan it seems like I only got 30/100.

I don't believe the scores I gave them were that great anyways so I don't feel too bad about missing out on the rest of the top 100.

Well actually they come out to 5.3 which is slightly above my average. Guess they did a lot better than I expected.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.

It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.

Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.
>> ARTICLE
I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.

And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\

I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.

I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.

There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.

Konosuba is basically the only show besides Dagashi Kashi I finished last season; And I'd most definitely say Dagashi Kashi was just a guilty pleasure because I loved both the main girls while the show being a liiiittle bit informative. Konosuba was legit good/funny.
>> ARTICLE
I think people confuse "hype" with "overly memed". Just because people mention it a lot doesn't mean it's "hyped".

I feel like people made this same mistake with OPM. Manga-readers hyped it up. Anime-only kids talked about the art and the jokes a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a good watch. Neither was it the best thing in the world, nor was it absolute garbage.
>> ARTICLE
If it's any help, I specifically waited for the season to end before binging it and still enjoyed it.

Up to you, though.

I will  get to it after I finish my plan-to-watch list

So, never?

Soon (tm), this subreddit filled my quota for explosions for a life-time.

Honestly there are a lot of better anime to watch out there, no need to prioritize it. I really only watched it because it was currently airing and kind of fun. Rakguo and maybe Erased are the only real must watches of the season.

If you're anything like the typical /r/anime user, it should only take you a few years.

Oh hey... Tons better than [mine](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/VincentBlack96?status=6&tag=) (which I just added HHD to)

I don't usually comment on planned lists, but yours has a lot of high quality movies. Might consider watching a movie every once in a while.

That's not that bad. I have 178 on mine, and I'm pretty sure I've seen someone with 300+ on theirs.

Well Konosuba is actually pretty funny imo it does a great job on being silly parody, I would recommend if you havn't seen it.

Haven't watched it but it is sitting on a 7.9 on MAL, so I'm not sure it's gonna climb anywhere near top 100 anytime soon

Zetsuen no Tempest was fantastic, I would recommend if you've ever heard of it. Don't be fooled by the lame description it has.

What's wrong with Unlimited Blade Works? It has a score of 8.46 and 25 episodes.

I'm assuming it got lumped in with Fate/Stay Deen? The construction of this list is partially arbitrary.

The prologue for it is an hour, which puts it at 27 episodes time wise (which has been done for other shows as well).  All of fate is kiiiiinda intertwined but not really. It's in a bit of a weird spot.

Rakugo in the Top 10. NICE. 
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved too
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it, but it's probably a lot more deserving than Erased and OPM.
>> ARTICLE
It's the only one out of those three that could be in a realistic anime top 100, so yes it's worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Much more than Erased for sure (I enjoyed it, but it's ranking is way inflated right now). Also get on that!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

And only about 6 or 7 shows before 2000 on the list. To be fair older shows do tend to be longer, however there are plenty of shows before 2000 below 26 episodes that arebetter than the likes of gate and no game no life (which is inexplicably at no. 22).

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.
>> ARTICLE
I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here. Explain that. 08th ms team and pocket are two anime classics probably best in the entire Gundam universe. Im sure im leaving a bunch of quality anime from the 90s and 80s that are 10x better than some of the shows on this list.

>> ARTICLE
Jesus! Those three aren't on the list? I just assumed they were when I scanned it! See this is why I don't trust people...
>> ARTICLE
GTO is 43 episodes and currently ranked 28th on MAL.

>> ARTICLE
yeah I was mistaken on that, I edited it out and replaced it. Such a good anime thought it was much shorter than that.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't diebuster the sequel to gunbuster?
>> ARTICLE
Why is that relevant? 
>> ARTICLE
I misremembered the number of episodes in each series. I, for some reason, was under the impression that they were both longer, and adding them together would push it above 25
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no.  Same universe different characters.

> Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

Could be worse.

*stares at every Animebracket contest from /r/anime where Gundam keeps getting snubbed again and again*
>> ARTICLE
Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

Though Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try might exploit the rule 2 loophole tho...
>> ARTICLE
I think Kill la Kill deserves better than 58^th.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. Huh, I must have missed Gurren Lagann....

*re-reads three times*

He hasn't watched Gurren Lagann.

And I think Sakurasou should not be on that list at all. But what can you do with essentially a popularity list.
>> ARTICLE
how is kill la kill not better than zankyou no terror man... 

[](#torrentialdownpour)
>> ARTICLE
I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....
>> ARTICLE
KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.
>> ARTICLE
Madness, someone else who's watched Captain Tylor?!
>> ARTICLE
Seems there are so few of us these days. One of the funniest anime ever made.

TTGL didn't make it because it's 27 episodes. OP just couldn't bring themselves to make an exception I guess.

Yea thats a mistake imo since it is only 27 if you count an episode that isnt really an episode(recap).

Why is One Punch Man so popular? It wasn't that amazingly mind blowing...
>> ARTICLE
recency and hype bias. Just like Erased and Rakugo. Both great shows, but not top 10 material
>> ARTICLE
Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer. 
>> ARTICLE

Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic.

I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).

it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

Not sure but is Gurran Lagann or S-Cry-Ed on this list? They were both pretty good too, especially the latter.

Why don't you look.

I did & neither were listed so I was hoping there was an extended list since the top 100 list shows 107. I was thinking they were adding more so I offered two suggestions. How are you doing today?

I'll definitely have to check out some of these other series because a lot on this list I haven't heard of so it would be good to check some out for my art inspirations.

this is nice because sometimes you dont want to invest yourself in a longer series. although something like bakemonogatari can be seen as a standalone series, it is better to plow through the whole series

And although S;G is one of my face series, can it be counted as 26 or less episodes of you count OVAs and films? If so then that will surely change with the new series that I believe is coming out? Or is that just a fan dream

I can't believe Haibane Renmei is ranked 83rd...

Serial Experiments Lain and Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine are outstanding, I'm shocked that they both have just under an 8.0 rating.

Basing this on rarely ever seeing them mentioned in this sub (though realizing it is mostly hs and college aged kids that are active) and/or its rank in MAL. 

**Golgo 13** - low mal ranking and never mentioned....a travesty.

**Hajime no Ippo** - this is ranked #19 (and should be higher) so at least it is popular...elsewhere. Whenever I've seen a 'top/best anime' thread and the usual suspects are up there, this somehow gets snubbed...only mentions sitting at the bottom of the thread. Everyone, whether a boxing/sports fan or not, should watch this series.

**Black Lagoon** - sometimes mentioned, but no where near as much as it should. last season2006/ova in 2011...WHERE IS S3 I NEED MORE. 

**Shigurui: Death Frenzy** - Never seen it mentioned, and if anything ever needed a second season or ova it is this.

**Honey and Clover** - Highly rated, but like it doesn't even exist.

**Paradise Kiss** - I may have seen this mentioned once.

**Nodame Cantabile** - barely mentioned and as if a niche anime.
 
**Last Exile** - and as testament to this, I'm only just now finding out there was a sequel. WAT

**Crest of the Stars/Banner of the stars** - Now this is probably the most apt for this thread. A personal favorite, that isn't popular, but I can understand that it won't appeal to many.

**School Rumble** - best girls that never make the list.

**Suzuka** - criminally under-appreciated.

**Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit** - Even when it came out it didn't get the attention I thought it deserved. I think it's been mentioned once or twice here. 

**Bamboo Blade**

**Kimi ni Todoke**

**Kuragehime** - where is dat sequel?? though i guess i'm not surprised since no one saw it apparently. 

**Samurai 7** -this one also fits this thread well. I really liked it, but the only time I see it mentioned is to get shitted on. I get that it's not great and takes great liberties with its adaptation. Still, the hate is undeserved. 

**Abenobashi Magical Shopping District** - maybe 2 others here have watched this. 

**Ah! Megami-sama** - 

The rest of these are not personal favorites, but ones I've seen and thought were decent and seen highly praised on other sites, but very rarely mentioned here.

Basilisk - good score, but low ranking. 

Asu no Yoichi! - decent as far as harems go.

Romeo x Juliet

Witch Hunter Robin

Gankutsuou

Ai Yori Aoshi

Black Blood Brothers
>> ARTICLE
Some of those you've mentioned are quite popular, like Black Lagoon, Nodame Cantabile, Kimi ni Todoke. Maybe they're just dated?

probably dated.

Based off your description I'm watching this 
>> ARTICLE
* Ro-kyu-bu: Yes, there are loli-bait scenes. But the sports scene are very good, and realistic. If you love basketball you will like it.

* Seitokai no Ichizon: A funny harem comedy but with a extra value slowly emerging.

* Kamisama no memo chu: The original-anime ending has lowered it's value but it's a very very good series. Crime + moe + a cruel and realistic vision of the dark sides of japan.

It's from the early 2000s so the art style is pretty big eyed, but the story and characters more than make up for it. That and there are some serious tear jerker moments that never fail (10 years later) to make me sob like a baby.

And besides what's more peculiar than an anime about nuns with guns?

Hmm...I've seen some good ones that *used* to be popular but aren't mentioned much these days, do those count? Things like Full Metal Panic, Scryed, Read or Die, and Elfen Lied.

I liked these threads. Because the alphabetical criterion was pretty arbitrary, they allowed for a measure of serendipity, which is a rare and valuable thing now that we can search and find things instantly without bumping into other stuff on a physical shelf. (Which is, obviously, an overall improvement; I'm just saying chance discovery's valuable too.)
>> ARTICLE
While it wasn't the focus, it was an important aspect to get lesser known anime into the "spotlight" or at least some sort of discussion going about them, and well, ofcourse we talked about the same anime as always. I mean, look at the list right above us. There are only a few anime I have never heard about, only a handful.

Nothing new, nothing unheard of, nothing lesser known. I know it's in the nature of reddit itself that results like this happen, but I am still disappointed. Maybe it's because I like a few lesser known anime and desperately try to recommend them whenever I can and I didn't get much attention, probably.

Well, out of these 74 anime mentioned in my little chart I've seen 49 and have heard of 65. This series of topics was more for people who are less expereinced in the world of anime than we are. Sure, I also thought (and not once) that hyped/famous shows hit top comment spots, but there is really nothing could be done about it. I encouraged people to post anime they want to discuss/recommend, but many times threads were left only with my initial posts.

Currently thinking about next more "in-depth" series of discussions, but I'm also not sure will they hit front page if the topics would be *too in-depth*.

I'm actually surprised that there were only 35 posts. I guess my fears about it getting abused were baseless.

In terms of scoring them, I really don't think upvotes is the way to do it. As you said, it's pretty clearly biased towards how people feel about the show than the quality of the write-up. 

Especially if you're looking for something that isn't already blasted on mega-speakers, you have to look for ~<75 upvote ones.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, my thoughts exactly, that's why we need some better measure... and I'm yet to think about one.
>> ARTICLE
Why not just order them in order of their rank on MAL?

>> ARTICLE
Then more popular/acclaimed anime would take first spots, I don't really want this, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
how about reversed order? Then the more dissliked animes goes first
>> ARTICLE
Then worse sumbissions receive more attention than better ones? No, the reason is that we can't separate votes for *anime* and votes for *submission*. Maybe an anime is very good, and the post is horrible, or a post is great and the anime is 'for fans'. Here amount of upvotes/downovtes /= quality of the post.
>> ARTICLE
yes, but I meant like so the "worse" animes gets more attention. So say FMA:B gets the last place and School Days gets first.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this. A WT for a popular/well-acclaimed show may be more redundant seeing as recommendations for it can be found in a lot of places, but for less well-received shows it'd be more interesting to see why someone would recommend it, and maybe spark more discussion.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, if anything, it could be done based on quality, but that would involve reviewing the posts which themselves are part-reviews of anime, and I'm not sure I'd want to get that meta.

But you could award threads points based on certain metrics, like: is there some media present?, How is the formatting? Does the OP make valid points? Is the OP present in the discussion? 
>> ARTICLE
It will be my judgment, and I don't want to be the only judge. So I'm not sure I want to take this responsibility.
>> ARTICLE
I was trying to think of things that would be impartial (hence the stuff I suggested) but yeah, I wouldn't want to get the flak by ranking posts in a fashion that could be deemed 'arbitrary'/'personal'

Also, my post actually has 4 upvotes ... not that it actually matters though.
>> ARTICLE
Evaluation is personal... there is no way to rank effort without personal evaluations, unless you're looking at raw data that lacks any sort of human input.
>> ARTICLE
>you're looking at raw data 

partially what I was attempting to do, but with something other than just wordcount. 

but yeah, it completely ignores the style and persuasiveness of the writing, which is also key to having a good WT post.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I can think of one either though perhaps someone smarter than either of us will come along. 

Isn't ordering them by upvotesbut perhaps with a clear caveat at the bottom saying that this is *not* a measure of which ones are best recommendations or the best showsgood enough? Although, as you say, I'm sure people voted for shows they liked, Kaiji managed to get over 100 and the extreme case of a title which patently didn't need any noise made about it, Madoka, is down near the bottom. Given that the end solution to the problem of we, the crowd, voting for what we like already is 'Don't use Reddit', I don't know what more you can do.

I don't like the idea of ranking them by the shows' ranks on MAL, since presumably part of the point of the exercise is to help people hear about, or or hear again about and reconsider, things they hadn't considered previously. No point reproducing the same old hierarchies of attention more than is necessary (and a lot is necessary, as we can see from the table). And I agree with you that having someone making judgement calls on which WTs are best doesn't sound helpful.
>> ARTICLE
We need to gather all suggestions, but it seems that simplest 'by upvotes' decision is - surprisingly - the best one. I'll keep an eye on it, thanks for your input.
>> ARTICLE
I swear it felt like a lot more, but again that's like *6 WT threads a day*!
>> ARTICLE
Seems like it, will see how it turns out later. [WT!] threads are hot things now, don't know what's gonna be in, say, a month from now.
>> ARTICLE
Most people will forget it and the regulars that stay in the sub, unlike the majority, won't do them since they wouldn't feel the need to promote something that's known(to them mostly, which maybe include some more obscure titles), or won't bother promoting something niche since it wouldn't get the attention for the thread to be worth it like we see with the last threads here.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine they're going to die down pretty quickly. Most of them seem to be popular shows, and they're going to run out of popular shows pretty quickly. From there it will probably just be an occasional thread highlighting an older show, or one that was forgotten due to the focus being on another show that season.
>> ARTICLE
> occasional thread highlighting an older show, or one that was forgotten due to the focus being on another show that season

Which, again, will not get attention because of that.

I had a few gems during summer- Hanayamata, Shounen Hollywood. Fall had YuYuYu and Inou Battle, Karn Senki(this reminds me, someone do an Inferno Cop thread before S2 starts airing).

Actually with this idea there can  be a spike about completed airing shows that didn't get attention at the end of the season and the week brake between season so people have something to watch.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly about Karen Senki did you like? I was willing to extend it some slack since it was a series of shorts and was at least trying something different with the CGI, but there really wasn't anything there to get excited about in the least as far as I could tell by the first 3 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I looove my proper action shlock, whatever the show lacked it was made up by its enthusiasm and love for creativity and crudeness.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. Different strokes and all that.
>> ARTICLE
I have to be honest, some of these make me want to stop reading Watch This!'s all together, especially the ones that look like the Haruhi one, or the ones that have multiple recommendations.

My personal reasons:

About the ones structured like the Haruhi one:

* It seems unstructured, and doesn't give a real reason as why to watch it. It just gives some quotes, but it doesn't give anything about what a show is like. It might capture the feel of the show, but I feel you need to go in a little bit of detail about things like Characters, Development, Animation, Musical Score, Pros and Cons to the show, etc. 

About the Multiple one:

* This simply comes down to almost trying to ignore the rules of a minimum of 1500 characters. If you make one about 3, like pictured here, it's quite easy to just write 500 characters per show, and considering that by this point, this post is already nearing 1000 characters, to me that seems like you'd want to be lazy in your writing.

* The example this thread gave, was a bad example of my previous statement, but for that thread, i'd rather say that it seemed lazy and rather irresponsible, as I personally think a Watch This! per show is more structured and easier to read than a WT! about multiple shows, even if all the reviews in a thread are as long as necessary. I personally think (True personal opinion, but like to know your opinions as well) that WT! needs just 1 Show per thread, and at least double the amount of characters needed at minimum for it to be valid, because as you can see, in this short post, written in a mere 6 minutes, I have already reached over 1600 characters, and it's too easy to write about any show, no matter how much you like, or dislike it, or even if you only know the very basics about it, especially with just 1500 characters.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with multiple ones with you (though we had only one of this kind so far), but about 'like Haruhi' one... I don't know, I liked it because it was creative and interesting, it *drew interest*, and since the pont of these posts is to promote anime, I think that post made it very well. It's not like we will have these posts every day (I hope), but sometimes, if the posts are well-written and interesting, I have nothing against them even if they don't follow the formal structure 'plot-visuals-characters'.
>> ARTICLE
> It's not like we will have these posts every day (I hope), but sometimes, if the posts are well-written and interesting, I have nothing against them even if they don't follow the formal structure 'plot-visuals-characters'.

If they die down, I won't mind them, but having like 5 of them on the frontpage was really annoying lol
>> ARTICLE
I think they are still better than "your favorite romance" or "what MC is the most badass" that we usually get on the frontpage instead.
>> ARTICLE
I am, by nature, a man that thrives on logic, and to me, that Haruhi-styled post just didn't make any sense, it didn't tell me why I should watch Haruhi. I love Haruhi myself, and even knowing how much I loved the show, I couldn't see in that post, the reasons one should watch it.  
But when you're talking Haruhi, it's hard to describe it anyway, as it's an anime without clearly defined genres, story and goal.
>> ARTICLE
So what, do I stretch for 1 off OVAs/Anime Mirai stuff that I don't want to spoil completely? Make 10 analogies, comparisons and metaphors for what it is?
>> ARTICLE
Why would you even bother with OVA's? They're usually a 1 off episode following up on a series, and as such, you could better review the series, and include the OVA in there.

As for Anime Mirai stuff, again, why even bother, I mean, nothing interesting came out of it last time, except ME!ME!ME!, and even that wasn't truly spectacular. For things like that, they get writeups by a lot of people. I think that for stuff like that, it's better to just do a 1-off discussion topic on the short, and then let sleeping dogs lie.
>> ARTICLE
Only unimportant anime like Giant Robo, Macross Plus, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Bubblegum Crisis, Yamato 2199, Getter Robo Armageddon, The 08th MS Team, FLCL, Gunbuster, Diebuster, Patlabor, Area 88, Take the X Train, Roujin Z, Detroit Metal City and Gundam Unicorn are OVAs, yes.

(I agree with you about the script-format WTs, though. They're clearly for people with too much time on their hands.)
>> ARTICLE
http://i.imgur.com/GBma1eZ.gif

OVAs are not always extra episodes. Often they are fully fledged series, just with a smaller number of episodes. Like [Megane na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9335/Megane_na_Kanojo), [Alien Nine,](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1177/Alien_9) or [FLCL.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/FLCL) There are hundreds more like that.

Also, Anime Mirai =/= Studio Khara's Animator Expo (this is where ME!ME!ME! came from.) 

Anime Mirai is responsible for a number of short 'movies' every year. Notably Death Billiards, Little Witch Academia, Harmonie, and Ojii-san no Ranpu. :)
>> ARTICLE
I know what came of Anime Mirai, and I still think that's personally the only slightly interesting thing that came in last year. And when talking OVA's, I am not including the multiple episode OVA's that you can obviously EASILY write about, I was talking about the OVA's that come extra with most series' blu-rays.
>> ARTICLE
And I was talking about [1 episode OVAs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1759/) and [short movies](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/).

I mean one would be hard pressed to write a 3000 character post for such things.
>> ARTICLE
1500 characters really isn't that much.  I could easily write that much for a FLCL or Bubble Gum Crisis recommendation without pushing into spoiler territory.  1500 *words* might be a little bit much, but 1500 characters is next to nothing.
>> ARTICLE
This is great! 

Do you plan on continuing this? It'd be very appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, so far I plan to do this every week on Sundays (if /r/anime doesn't mind, of course).
>> ARTICLE
Well the numbers of WT! threads are probably gonna go down after a while but for the time being these threads should be useful.
>> ARTICLE
Great work! I have to wonder though, do shows like KnK, Moster, Haruhi, Monogatari, Madoka, etc, really need anymore plugs? I mean... they're already brought up constantly. Imo, this feature should be used to highlight lesser-known shows, since most people who post here will already be familiar with those titles. Many of them are already considered must-watches.

Nothing we can do here except remind people to bring lesser known anime to a spotlight. But I agree with you here 100%.
>> ARTICLE
In between the replaceable sports titles at the last position are those exact gems, but as you see, no one gives a fuck. While those who do have already done their homework.
>> ARTICLE
It's a problem, but is also not one which can be solved on Reddit, if you ask me. The best places to find out about lesser-known material are places which are undemocratically curated by one knowledeable person or a small group of such people: Mike Toole's column on ANN, or blogs like [Anipages](http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php), [Colony Drop](http://www.colonydrop.com/), [Obscussion](http://landofobscusion.blogspot.co.uk/) or [let's anime](http://letsanime.blogspot.co.uk/). Here on r/anime, on the other hand, it's about the odd gem that slips through and get some attention (like Kaiji). So yes, the feature should be used to highlight obscure things, but mostly I think it won't and never will be.
>> ARTICLE
Very good post. Do you plan on doing these threads int he future?
>> ARTICLE
I do. Depends on the feedback of /r/anime though.
>> ARTICLE
Man I'm not sure how my Kaiji one did so well. Kaiji only has a popularity of 557 on MAL, which is the lowest on the list until Wixoss. Does anyone have any feedback on it (format, writing, etc.)? Most people only talk about the show you recommend in the thread.
>> ARTICLE
Shitcom though? Really? Are we going to get a Boku no Pico WT! next? I'm not gonna bother to read it, but I want to assume that that was either a troll thread or meant to be ironic.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend you to read /u/Taiboss posts (#5 and #10), they are very interesting and creative.

I also can say that I liked posts #2 and #4, check them out.

And don't forget to leave the feedback!
>> ARTICLE
Aaand you just provoked people to make the same dialogue topics. WELL DONE!
>> ARTICLE
I was fully aware what I was doing was not completedly original (it's basically a [script fic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptFic)), but I don't think there is anything wrong with that. The bad ones will be forgotten, and the good ones will be remembered. Isn't that the case with most things?
>> ARTICLE
I feel so happy you all love them so much.

However, the more I start, the harder they are to write. I will try to write one per week.

Next week is either Higurashi or Lyrical Nanoha, look forward to it. I always take suggestions and requests, any [anime is competed](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Taiboss) is okay...I think.

>> ARTICLE
Yes, I don't think myself to make it as a comeptition, I just want people to make creative and interesting suggestions/recommendations about 'not-so-popular' anime.

Thanks, I'll do my mest to keep them weekly!
>> ARTICLE
I would scrap the idea of a "scoreboard" completely.  Upvotes on WT! threads likely have way more to do with the popularity of the show in question than the quality of actual post.  Order them chronologically; don't bother mentioning upvotes at all.  If you want to really recognize well made suggestions, hand pick a couple that are well written and boost attention to shows that need it.  Maybe put them in a "Highlights of the Week" section or something, but the only meaningful numbers in this sort of aggregate post should be the total number of WT! threads and the dates they were posted.

That's how I would run it, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I see. I also do not like the idea of upvotes as much as the next guy, but I even less want to judge which recommendations are 'better' or 'worse'. 'Highights of the Week' idea sounds nice, but I don't think I want to influence this post's information myself with my own judgment.

Thanks for your input, though, I will put it into consideration.
>> ARTICLE
I did something sort of like that with [fan music updates](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/yafq9/blaccus_weekly_music_round_up_81512/) on /r/mylittlepony a couple years ago, where I'd do round up posts of songs I thought were cool and worth sharing.  After the list, I'd give my thoughts on some of the more noteworthy tracks.  Granted, that was inherently biased towards my tastes, and thus not totally analogous to this.  In any case, I think some small endorsements or praise can work without pushing things into competitive territory.

However, I definitely see the value in keeping total neutrality here.  If you're not comfortable trying to pick the "highlights" (whether that's a well-written suggestion or just one that sparked a lot of discussion), it's best to let them each speak for themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll think about it, maybe it doesn't hurt it at all. Maybe I'll try it one week and see the response.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's a surprise. Had no idea mine climbed that high. Hopefully some of that popularity is reflective of the quality of the post. I know Barakamon's popular around here so that's kind of a concern. Hopefully more posts about lesser-known shows get just as much attention so long as they're well written.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really tempted to write a WT of one already written by another person(not madoka btw) weeks down the track because his pitch is essentially as retarded as saying "you should watch Madoka Magica because it's full of shock and twists!"
>> ARTICLE
I can see your point, though sometimes it is done intentionally because some shows are better with only vague recommendation. These anime are usually better to experience yourself, and that's why some reviews are dry. Though I can't deny there are reviews that are... subpar.

Regarding that anime... if the review was bad and it was agreed that the review was bad, I guess, another recommendation won't hurt. Or wait several weeks.

I appreciate this. :D

> I took anime topics from 9th-14th of February period of time.

Reasons: they still haven't got all the upvotes and they still sit on the frontpage. I'll include this topic in a next week compilation. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad somebody did a WT for Nana because I really wanted to, but I am terrible at writing reviews. 

Anyway, what surprises me the most is how few people on /r/anime have seen Nana, despite so many people who love romances here. It really is not an exaggeration at all to say that Nana is *the* best romantic drama anime/manga to have ever been written and any fan of the genre *must* see it. There are no other shows with characters as well developed, with romance as realistic and believable, or with stories as well written as Nana. 

Edit: Also, I wish you had titled the post "Queen of all Romances" because it's just as true and it would attract more attention
>> ARTICLE
I think it succeeds so well as a romance anime because there is legitimate romance between the characters, which the VAs, the animation and the story telling show extremely well
>> ARTICLE
> I wish you had titled the post "Queen of all Romances"

It's not just the romance, it's the whole psychological aspect of the two Nanas, and how their past brought this about. One is extremely possessive and the other is hopelessly dependent of others.  [](/s "The part that realy gave me the chills was when Nana is yelling at Nobou for letting Hachiko go, and how she really doesn't care if they like each other she just want Hachiko near her or "in her garden" I think was the phrase she used.")
>> ARTICLE
Nana is a lot of things, but what I meant was that the title of the OP has a lot of influence on whether or not the average user will take their time to read through the thread.
>> ARTICLE
> Anyway, what surprises me the most is how few people on /r/anime have seen Nana...

It's length, subject, and maturity tend to turn away the "younger" crowd. :3
>> ARTICLE
I think it's mainly just the fact that people see "josei" and are automatically turned away from the series, unfortunately.
>> ARTICLE
> I think it's mainly just the fact that people see "josei" and are automatically turned away from the series, unfortunately.

That could be part of it, too.

It is one of the best genres, though! :3
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Nana is that while it is really good at what it does, it may as well be considered genre-defying or even a separate sub-genre because it is so nuanced.  In the same token, because the story in unfinished in all mediums for the foreseeable future, it is hard to recommend.  
  
That being said, it is absolutely worth seeing/reading but only in the context of its uniqueness. It doesn't really define any genre though it has ties to josei/sboujo, but more importantly witbout the nuances of its storytelling it would otherwise be just another unfinished or hastily-cancelled work.

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It really is a josei, but MAL categorises it as a shoujo, and more people know what a shoujo is than a josei so \_()_/
>> ARTICLE
The MAL category for it could be something to do with the fact that the manga was published in a [shoujo magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shojo_Beat) in North America.
Though I'd guess that that itself is (probably) because there weren't/aren't any josei manga magazines published in English.
>> ARTICLE
Also, Nana won the 2002 Shogakukan Manga Award in the shojo category, but that's because they only subdivide between shonen, shojo, general, and children's
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was going to say this as well. Not only are the characters all adults but it also has mature themes and the characters actually have sex. 
>> ARTICLE
The real queens are Rose of Versailles and Glass Mask


>> ARTICLE
Ever since I watched it back 09' I have yet to find a story of romance and music that came close. Nothing quite feels as real the characters do in this anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the WT thread.

What this anime made me do:

* dropping scores of other animes in similar genres (and even some who are not similar)

* Not being able to watch romance/drama at the moment. I am just dropping every romance/drama after 2 episodes...

* Giving a 10 for an anime I basically didn't enjoy at all. When I was watching I had the feeling what would come next (drama) and wanted to drop it, but couldn't because the story was sooo real and well done.

* Making me regret that I watched Nana. I should have watched basically more romance/drama and finish it with Nana...


>> ARTICLE
It manages to do something that most romance anime can barely even convey, and that's to have a feel of a real romance, the moment when [Spoilers](/s "Nana and Nobou first kiss had a million times more impact than most romance anime put together because I actually cared about the characters and how they felt and who they ended up with")
>> ARTICLE
The differing characters and their relationships to one-another really make the show/manga what it is.

Wished they continued with another season, as the story deepened where they ended it. AS WELL AS FINISHING THE MANGA!

Bonus, dat change room scene with Nana and Ren. Mmmmhm.

Favourite character: Yasushi/Miu.
>> ARTICLE
This show definitely 11/10. The plot, the music, the pace of show, VA I just love everything about Nana and I'm glad I watched this show so late if I experienced Nana the couple first of romance then others show would be dull in comparison and I'd had drop all of them. Too sad the show and manga are still on hiatus. I wish Ai Yazawa would recover and continue to finish the story.
>> ARTICLE
Nana is queen of shoujo romance/drama. For shoujo overall, it's tied with Utena and Rose of Versailles. All three are excellent, in any case.
>> ARTICLE
I had this girl in my class that was obsessed with the manga and I meant to check it out but never got around to it. Later I found out it also had an anime adaption and again was going to read/watch it but found out it was on a hiatus and stuff and just lost interest. I like romance and stuff though so maybe I'll get around to it eventually.
>> ARTICLE
If you have any interest in the Romance genre, it is essential viewing, and even more so if you're a fan of the music genre
>> ARTICLE
Bonus points: Hirano Aya is there.
>> ARTICLE
I watched/read Nana a long, long time ago and this post brought back all sorts of feels ;__;

Seriously though, I would recommend following up or interjecting this series with something more light-hearted like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kin. Marathoning Nana made me so effing depressed at the end ):
>> ARTICLE
I really liked everything being done in this show until [](/s "it just got depressing for me. Both of the main characters were with people that I frankly hated, and after all those great episodes beforehand, seeing them with those guys felt so painful for me because it was so obvious that they weren't happy. I stopped watching, and when I looked up the plot of the following episodes, I didn't see them break up. In fact, they actually got MARRIED. I watch anime to be immersed in a good story, or to relax, not to see someone throw their happiness away.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have to agree. The ending of the show left so many loose ends. For example:

-Did sheen end up with rayra? 
-Did yasu ever find a girl? Did he ever find resolve regarding his feelings for nana?
-Nobu ends up lonely and unable to even face hachi? I expected a scene similar to the one with shoji at Jackson's. Yet they gave that scene to shoji instead? Seriously?
-it would have been nice to see nobu move on and end up with that new girl next door. But nope, I guess introducing her to the story was just filler? Wtf..
-at the end of the show when they are watching the fireworks, nana says to hachi something along the lines of "smack takume around if he starts cheating on you" and hachi basically responds with "lol yeah I guess so haha"...wtf. so basically you settled for a dude who is probably going to cheat on you..but u have a big flat screen at home and a nice house so yeah no problem it's all good. 

Maybe the manga was better. I'm sure it was. But I cannot say I enjoyed this much. There were some good life lessons from the show and it was very realistic at times. I don't always expect perfect endings but a little bit more closure on the rest of the characters would have been nice. Oh well. 
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly what I did. I stopped at episode 36 and just read a quick summary of the ending. I just didn't enjoy watching it at all anymore.
>> ARTICLE
[MAJOR SPOILERS](/s "I think that the depressing part in the last third really showed how it was a really good romance show. There was no sugar coating like the majority of high school romance shows. The scene were Shouji dumps Nana I found incredibly stressful, which really shows how the show got me emotionally connected with the characters. I also think the scene when Takumi basically rapes Nana and all you can hear is the bed creaking is one of the best scenes in any anime, and really harrowing")
>> ARTICLE
That scene tore me to fucking pieces. I've never had a scene in a cartoon make me as angry as that. It was that kind of squirming physical anger that makes you want to hit something. Like "HOW THE FUCK COULD HE DO THIS".
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I completely agree, more so with Hachi though. I feel so bad for her, and many times I just wanted to shake her and tell her to leave and move on. Baby or no baby. If I ever watch this again, I'll probably stop after she starts going out with Nobu.")
>> ARTICLE
Hachi was a pretty unbearable protagonist at times, I really wanted to tell her to just get her shit together
>> ARTICLE
I can understand why you feel that way, but personally, I feel there's more to take away from the story that simply happiness and sadness. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, by all means I agree with that. The "more" that you can take away from it is what kept me watching all that time. I just found that despite that "more", I didn't really enjoy watching it, so I stopped.
>> ARTICLE
I actually appreciated Nana *because* it made me so uncomfortable with some of the characters choices. It was almost like watching real people making bad life decisions (as we all do, from time to time), and it was a nice example of the way it's possible for a person to redeem those poor choices if they have people in their life willing to forgive and accept them as fallible human beings. It displayed an interesting juxtaposition between both the salvation and the pitfalls of unconditional love.

>> ARTICLE
It's funny, this has been on my backlog for a while...I've been afraid of falling in love with another unfinished work the same way I love *Crest/Banner of the Stars* (which...is...kind of continuing...at a pace slower than HxH ever will...it might as well be on hiatus. The anime certainly will go unfinished).

On the OST, for a long time Anna Tsuchiya's [Kuroi Namida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxoPZijXU0) (OP3) was outright  my depressed-kitty song for a while, and it asks a question I'm *still* asking:

>Kazari tsukenai de kono mama no watashi de ikiteyuku tame 
>Nani ga hitsuyou 
>Jibun sae shinjirezu nani wo shinjitara ii no?

>To live just how I am now, without changing 
>what is it I need? 

^^^Well ^^^okay, ^^^without ^^^the ^^^debt-over-my-eyeballs ^^^part ^^^of ^^^"now" ^^^but Seriously, at 27, I have a hard time fitting in to any social group around where I live because my interests generally don't align with anyone I'm around most of the time (aside from my girlfriend and our few friends). Around here, if you don't hunt, fish, have a small personal armory that makes the local police look under-equipped, hate Arabs/Latin Americans/Obama, speak any language other than English (even secondary), and bible-thump...you're an outcast by default. Okay, I'm stereotyping and generalizing liberally there, but I tend to avoid most of those topics (politics, religion, gun control (which is politics), race/ethnicity) and they come up far too often.

I'm also not a fan of putting on a front just to get ahead (I'd make a terrible Mikado...). 

>To live on without changing myself; is that the most 
>difficult thing in this world? 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone watch the live action movies? I enjoyed them. Nana was great casting but Hachi just didn't quite cut it for me especially the new actress in the second movie.
I really think this is one story that could easily be adapted to a North American version.
>> ARTICLE
My only criticism is that it can be a bit over dramatic at times but that is only a very minor issue.
>> ARTICLE
For a shoujo, it's almost under dramatic at times
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I have to say about this show, it is my absolute, far and away favorite romance show, and possibly my straight up favorite anime ever. I know people don't like it, or don't feel like watching because the story is unfinished ( and likely won't be) but I really think the show is worth watching anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
Plenty of people consider the original Berserk essential viewing, and it certainly is (especially since it'll show you how a show can be terribly animated and still fantastic), and it certainly doesn't have an ending
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch this but somehow I got the impression that it was a Yuri/Shoujo Ai show. Is it? Or am I way off?
>> ARTICLE
I kind of felt that way for some reason too. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a couple of sequences when Hachi basically talks about how sexy Nana is, following it up by saying "But wait, that's wrong"
>> ARTICLE
That's fine as long as that's all there is to it.
>> ARTICLE
I wish there was romance between the two MCs because their relationship is amazing, but the show isn't shoujo ai. There is definitely "sismance" (like bromance, but with women), but the main relationships are male/female.

Ok great. I'm generally not a fan of Yuri/shoujo ai so thank you for clarifying.

I think am at episode 38 of Joe 1, it is absolutely amazing.  
Joe really is a fantastic character, though he is, as you put it, irredeemable at the start.

And I actually liked the animation in Joe 1. It is nice. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh you have no idea about Joe's erratic behavior. When you think you know him, he reminds you why you really don't.

I agree, Joe is a truly emotionally and mentally hurt character.

Yeah I recognized it, but it spoiled gurren lagann too

Ah man, i'm sorry about that.

Don't worry I've already watched that part

I read the manga, atm watching the anime, during Wolf match. 

Definitely worth watching!
>> ARTICLE
Wolf match is just the appetizer of things to come as well. Wolf match really was when it started to go into a next gear.
>> ARTICLE
I'd also recommend skipping those last episodes of Joe 1. I would've much rather experienced them the way they were presented in Joe 2, it looked much better.

That said, this anime's age sucks. It's an incredibly story that really needs re-animated. The last few episodes of Ashita no Joe 2 really got me teared up and feel-y for a long time afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess I'll watch this sometime.
>> ARTICLE
By overlapping episodes in Joe 1-2, do you mean that it animates the same content from the manga, but Joe 2 does it Better? And does the anime (both of them) animate all of the manga, or does it skip/change things?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the overlapping episodes adapt the same arc from the manga.

The problem is that during the last 26 episodes of Joe 1 there is filler stuffed into it since it had nearly caught up with the manga at that point, and the last episode is nearly completely anime original and ends on a very unsatisfying note.

On the other hand Joe 2 cuts out a portion from that arc (In my opinion that portion was repetitive and unnecessary anyways) but when it adapted the same parts it did it *much* better.
>> ARTICLE
Joe seems to be like my favorite type of MC's, gonna give this one a try once i'm done with LotGH.
>> ARTICLE
Can't remember how many times I've whistled the opening because of Joe.
>> ARTICLE
I found this series great  and Im only 30% of Season 1 !

This is the oldest anime I have watched and for sure will complete (last one was LOTGH).It really holds up to the test of time for me and no problem with the style since Im a Oldschool anime fanboy (Mostly 90s).

I found Joe such a unlike-able cunt for the first 22 episodes(strangling a innocent girl,huge ego,not saying thank you sincerely to those who help him etc...) but I know it would only get better and more interesting.I know there are several anime MC who starts off as some edgy young person but Joe takes it to another level.

My only problem is that I already know/spoiled  [](/s "Joe's Fate in the end") since I got spoiled by several anime references to Ashita no Joe.


>> ARTICLE
>strangling a innocent girl

To be fair, she did smack the shit out of him a second beforehand. And she is a petty bitch. Not that it justifies him choking her of course, i'm just not her biggest fan for a long list of reasons.

> My only problem is that I already know/spoiled [AnJ 2](/s "Joe's Fate in the end") since I got spoiled by several anime references to Ashita no Joe.

You might want to spoiler tag that, even if it is vague.

And yeah, I went into the anime already knowing two of the major plot points, that being one of them. Yet both of them still hit really hard and made the more subtle foreshadowing leading up to the events fun to catch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I will spoiler tag it just in case
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo rip off..

./s


Didn't know anyone else had watched it lol. One of the best MCs and he's from the 60s. Sickening that he blows away your typical modern generic mc.
>> ARTICLE
Joe was unique because he truly was a damaged individual. I get why shows want to have  character who is heroic or good. So it's unique when a show/manga has characters who are almost irredeemable and basically is a criminal. Though I suppose fighting and school manga of the 60s and 70s had that archetype a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
He was a developed character. If you compare him at the end to when he first appeared a huge difference. What a great character. Inspirational as hell. Picked it up years ago when I was looking for anime. I really like it as a sports anime as well, my all time favorite easily. 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Rainbow Nisha a year ago and I agree that it was a great anime. I can see the similarities it shares with TTGL but the difference is TTGL has more of a lasting impression. That doesn't mean Rainbow Nisha is a bad anime, it's just the over the top scenes in TTGL is hard to forget. Same reason why Kill la Kill still sticks in my mind to this day.
>> ARTICLE
Rainbow is a one trick pony with lots of forced drama that gets less and less interesting as it goes on. TTGL on the other hand remains good throughout the story. Meaning, there is little to say or remember from Rainbow and a lot from TTGL. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure why you think it's forced. I guess the second half is, but I thought the first half was really done well. The main theme and the opening are solid, compared to TTGL in which I only really remember row row fight the power. I think they build an-chan much better than Kamina as well. Kamina (/s "dies in episode 8") and doesn't get much of a chance to develop well whereas An-chan (/s "dies later in the show") and he's always the main character to that point. With Kamina, you could tell Simon was the main character and they really didn't develop him till after the spoiler happened.
>> ARTICLE
An-chan was the only good thing the show had. Removing him, ruined it. Simon on the other hand replaced Kamina, and it was still fun. 

And don't forget the bailifs; talk about cartoony villains. Even the spiral king and the anti-spirals had more depth than them. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean it was a good show but it was incredibly melodramatic and the 'villains' in the show were so comically evil and the protagonists were so one-dimensional that it sort of ruined the incredibly dark and interesting universe they lived in. I enjoyed it but there were a lot of pretty basic issues with it
>> ARTICLE
I totally saw the similarities with TTGL when I saw it and I even think it's better. 
>> ARTICLE
It's talked about quite a lot actually, and usually in thread like this by people who are annoyed that no-one else is talking about it.
>> ARTICLE
> but I'm pretty sure Rainbow was published before TTGL so it should be the opposite.

Yeah but the anime came out three years after TTGL. I'm pretty sure know one knew about Rainbow before 2010. 

As to why it is never talked about here: well this is just my personal opinion, but Rainbow never had a lasting appeal on me especially when the quality of the show crumbled in the second half. I thought it was good, but it just didn't have anything memorable to keep talking about for the years to come. 
>> ARTICLE
Conversely, I've seen it mentioned dozens of times in threads just like this.

That's not the converse but thanks for your input.

I don't know if the anime is popular or not, but it is definitely worth mentioning.

Watch the first few episodes of Jojo' Bizzare Adventure.

I'll show you evil.

Yeah, there's absolutely nothing redeemable about Ishihara. The only one worse than him is the doctor, and he didn't even make it into the bracket.

Heartseed is pretty amoral, IMO. It's like calling [(Madoka Magicka spoilers)](/s "Kyuubey evil.")

Have you seen JoJo? The dude kicks a dog for literally no reason within minutes of being introduced. If that's not evil, I don't know what is.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I can't even bring myself to read the manga. 

[Big spoiler here](/s "An-chan :'(")

But I really loved that anime too, and it's pretty underwatched IMO. More people need to know about it. 

Not everyone will like this opinion, but this, is the kind of thing Madhouse should be doing. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see some love for this show. It's currently my favorite anime, but I'm also hesitant to rewatch it because it was so incredibly heartbreaking. I don't think I've ever cried so much over an anime.

In most shows I'll dislike at least one of the main characters, but not this one. I was rooting for all of them the whole time. I also have never hated any character as much as I hated Sasaki and Ishihara. The whole time I was just waiting for Anchan or Mario to give them the beatdown they deserved. [Spoilers](/s "Anchan's willingness to have mercy was frustrating because I knew it would come back to bite him. :'( R.I.P.")
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it yet but is on my to watch list. Before I start, does it have a satisfying ending? Or is it a read the manga ending?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it a long time ago so I don't remember too much, but the only complaint I had about the ending was that there was no more to watch anymore. Definitely worth a watch!
>> ARTICLE
It was such a great anime! I never see people talk about it though.....must be underwatched.
>> ARTICLE
It's really amazing - the story, the character progression, the music and the tears. ;_; I very rarely see anyone mention Rainbow which is a shame since I think it truly deserves to be more known. 
>> ARTICLE
Out of all the contenders that I know I'd pick Kimblee. [Spoilers] (/s "The dude was going to let an entire country full of people die just for the fuck of it, and even the most powerful of the homunculi could not control his malice.")

Sephiroth isn't evil man, he's just misunderstood.

Seryu isn't evil. She just wants justice. Is that so wrong?
>> ARTICLE
That's like saying kotonoha (School Days) wasn't insane, she just wanted her love.
>> ARTICLE
Kyubey isn't evil, just a really good antagonist. 
>> ARTICLE
He won't win overall, but Hamdo might actually be the most evil character I can think of.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless. 
>> ARTICLE
Also Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Mushishi, Kurono Basket, xxxHolic, Initial D, Yomamushi Pedal, Kingdom, Nodame Cantabile, Kaiji, Magi and Natsume Yuujinchouu.
>> ARTICLE
> If they rely on knowledge from previous shows, they're out. Gundam would be a good example - Gundam 00 might be fantastic (might be a bad example, I know nothing ab Gundam 00 *is* standalone. 

Gundam 00 is standalone and requires no knowledge of UC. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, figured something like that might happen.  Sorry Gundam.

I'll admit I did chuckle a bit.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.
>> ARTICLE
This is super helpful.  
Nice job! MAL should try and sort out their shitty list formats too.  

>> ARTICLE
Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!  
[Good job](#bestiathumbsup)
>> ARTICLE
Ha, fear not!  I'm remaking the list so there are no shows at all that go over 26 episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
YLiA #2, OPM #3, Code Geass #4. 

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.
>> ARTICLE
This list really saves me the trouble of watching the top stuff while having to sift through the long runners. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

EDIT: Also I never would have guessed to see Shokugeki no Souma that high, it's great and I don't disagree with it, I just never would have expected it to.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that CG is higher on this list than CB causes my joints to hurt.
>> ARTICLE
underwatched =/= underrated
>> ARTICLE
Ranked 57, Top 500 popularity, so I'm not sure it's underated, but it's a very dramatic, serious seinen, and most popular anime are comedic/shonen/action shows, so it's hitting a smaller demographic range. 
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't have many things to talk about it, and it is overdramatic as heck. Such titles tend to be overlooked by most.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's a good show. imo it's actually overrated though, everyone who watches it raves about it for days when it's really nothing incredibly special.
>> ARTICLE
How is it nothing special? I just finished watching it and it's definitely one of the best shows I've seen. It's compared to TTGL but I'd say it's better.
>> ARTICLE
It was predictable. To be fair I don't think TTGL is that great either.
>> ARTICLE
You're right that it's predictable but I think it was done really well. I guess if you didn't like TTGL then it's not really a big deal, they're pretty similar so that explains it.
>> ARTICLE
Did you like the first part of the series?
>> ARTICLE
Yes it is.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. It changes from a thriller to more of a slice of life, but it's still just as good as the first half. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I loved it but I just dont think that the secound half of the series will not give me the same bittersweet /dark feeling the first half gave me. But fuck , gonna watch it to the end.
