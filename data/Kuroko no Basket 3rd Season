The animation looks delicious this season!
>> ARTICLE
As expected from glorious Production I.G.
>> ARTICLE
Sasuga Production I.G. - FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Even the both screens that mark the commercial break (I guess) were looking pretty amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Both the OP and ED feel like the weakest the show has had so far I felt.

Season 2 is still king for those.
>> ARTICLE
 I know what you mean, they were still decent though.
>> ARTICLE
The Other self op hyped me everytime. I will be walking the dog and just start running listening to it!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Its gonna be terrible having to wait a week for every episode.....
>> ARTICLE
Pfft a week? I'm still waiting for Ippo to return. 
>> ARTICLE
Round 4? My body is ready.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching Kuroko as it airs. Hopefully they will go easy with the cliffhangers this season.
>> ARTICLE
rip.

>> ARTICLE
I've been following this one in the manga when it was coming out. There's going to be cliffhangers, hate to break the news to you.

That said, this season is going to be amazing :D:D:D
>> ARTICLE
I didn't expect to be free of them, but one can dream!
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I was reading the manga weekly as it came out. 

This is gonna be "The Cliffhanger in which Kuroko Plays".

You have been warned.
>> ARTICLE
after having read the manga, there will be PLENTY of cliffhangers.
>> ARTICLE
There's plenty of air time too. They can fit a whole paragraph of essay while trying to shoot the ball.
>> ARTICLE
It's good thing they don't call 8 second violations or 3 in the key. 
>> ARTICLE
 Or basket interference, as shown on the flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
GOOD LUCK LMAO

So looks like since Touou is out of the Winter Cup, they're going to try and [overtake](http://40.media.tumblr.com/77818f1580e11960793407f8fe656394/tumblr_nhz9k7HIG31qjqv2uo1_1280.png) the Free! world.

Where did you find this ? 
>> ARTICLE
its in the OP
>> ARTICLE
Actually its in the ED
>> ARTICLE
It's just a screenshot of one of the scenes in the closing credits/ED sequence. Don't tell me you missed the best part of the episode! 
>> ARTICLE
I just listened to it. I liked the S2 one more though , that was just pure badassness.

I'm happy for more of Satsuki in a swimsuit.

Can I just say how happy I am that someone pointed this out. Lmao
>> ARTICLE
Haru v Aomine

GET HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Godamn, Saturdays are stacked.

Kuroko no Basket S3

Aldnoah.Zero S2

Durarara!! S2

Log Horizon S2

How are we gonna survive this? I feel like my body is about to implode from 'HYPE OVERLOAD".

I was totally wrong...Body is **NOT** ready...
>> ARTICLE
I can't seem to like Log Horizon, maybe because I watched it after completely watching SAO.

When I have time again, I'll probably give it another try and stick to it until season 2. Hopefully the story goes well as the episode progresses.

Reason why I want to give Log Horizon a try again? SAO II is underwhelming.
>> ARTICLE
Did the art in Log Horizon improve? I watched the first episode of season two and it really put me off.
>> ARTICLE
If you ask me, I'd say it has.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'll have to check it out again.

Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Sequel Saturday is best Saturday. 
>> ARTICLE
Man why is everyone here crying about the recap. I marathoned the first and second season like 4 months ago, and after that read the manga till the last chapter, but I still loved the recap. Just seeing Kagami and Aomine go against eachother in the Zone again brings back a lot of epic memories of the show. 

>> ARTICLE
As someone that doesn't have a lot of time in his day, but still tries to watch the majority of anime each season. Wasting 30 minutes on recap when I could have been watching something else is the pinnacle of annoying. Even disregarding my struggles, they didn't need to recap EVERYTHING.
>> ARTICLE
Persronally I really enjoyed the recap as well, I've seen both seasons like 3 times and read the manga to the end once. I am so fucking hyped for this seasons games, and learning more about Akashi in the glorious voice of Kamiya Hiroshi.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. I thought the interview format for the recap worked rather well. Also, seeing all the well animated scenes from last season (no Meteor Jam though?) put together into half an episode is kinda cool. Besides, the 3rd season is showing months ahead of schedule and somehow people are complaining about having to wait another week for the match to start.
>> ARTICLE
The Recap was great for someone like me who marathoned the last two seasons once season 2 ended and haven't kept up until now.
>> ARTICLE
Mitobe is always so quiet, sometimes I wonder if he's actually a foreign exchange student and doesn't know how to speak Japanese
>> ARTICLE
He never uttered a single word in the manga, and it won't change in the anime either.
>> ARTICLE
thats not true he did once when they showed the past when the 2nd years screamed their dream and stuff from the roof :)
>> ARTICLE
I think that was still Koganei shouting for him.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't he just about to shout and then the school interrupted?
>> ARTICLE
I think the funniest part is that he actually has a designated voice actor though.
>> ARTICLE

Adorable!

When ending started I thought it would show the other players as babies, too, for some reason. Too bad it didn't, now I am curious how they'd look.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is best baby.
>> ARTICLE
That's impossible, him... smiling? What kind of rip off is this?
>> ARTICLE
It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the Taikou Flashback arc never got animated but... [Minor Teikou Flashback Spoilers](/s "Kuroko was told to steel his emotions by Akashi for the sake of his misdirection, he wasn't always blank faced.")
>> ARTICLE
[Kinda spoilers](/s "The entire Teiko arc") will be the death of me.
>> ARTICLE
Damn... you are making me read the manga again, I forgot everything. ._.
>> ARTICLE
ahh, I want to see the captain play so bad. They have built him up so much yet he's always in the shadows.

He looks like the anti-kuroko to me(he destroys teamwork or something like that)
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Not entirely wrong, and you don't need to outright spoil someone's expectations like that.
>> ARTICLE
Spoil expectations? There is nothing there to "spoil". Get off your spoiler tag high horse. It is very evident Akashi is bad in many senses of the word.
>> ARTICLE
LOL Whoa went back and realized that you said 

> Well you're *not* wrong.

I originally read that as 

> Well you're wrong. 

As if you immediately shot down his guess, hence my reaction. Sorry about that.

IT'S HERE

I actually bought a Kuroko plush in anticipation for season 3, since it would be my first time watching Kuroko weekly (oh god cliffhangers please no) and now for the rest of the show I plan to watch with that plush.

The hype is real. 

EDIT: [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/dpOewWo.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
You can't just say you bought a plush and not provide a picture? :)
>> ARTICLE
Totally forgot about that. Put it in the post now xD
>> ARTICLE
You see, we have been hurt before. 
>> ARTICLE
Team Fukuda in the OP? More underdogs? This new guy looks like a powerhouse, looking forward to seeing him challenge Kise.

MY BODY IS READY FOR YOU KUROKO

Really cool way to do a recap episode, it's half recap half continuation. Wish more shows did this. 
>> ARTICLE
The new guy is pretty cool. Like in an asshole kind of way. Also his "ability" is interesting. Can't wait for the game to start :)
>> ARTICLE
What's his "ability"? I don't recall them showing anything about it. The most we got was that he was extremely skilled, but very violent. Was there a hint somewhere I didn't catch? Unless you've read the manga and are dropping hints, I appreciate it. Subtle ones are something I can occasionally look forward to.
>> ARTICLE
No, it's in the manga and we aren't to that point yet. I'm on mobile and I can't remember how to spoiler tag but SPOILER SPOILER APOILER SPOEISPKEBS DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT 

he steals moves, like kise's copy, except the original can no longer use it in the game.
>> ARTICLE
Already got that down, but thanks :p Best to just edit that out for now, you've been beaten by 2 others already!
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "If I remember correctly, he has the ability to literally steal a person's move, so that not only could he do that move, but the other person could no longer do it.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Sounds plausible to be able to copy someones move the moment he sees it.. pretty much just like Kise more or less. But the other person no longer being able to? That sounds a little far fetched. I look forward to the next episode then!")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Haizaki's able to use the other person's move but he does it with a completely different rhythm which, after the other person witnesses this different timing, throws off their own rhythm.") Ridiculous, I know, but it's KnB we're talking about here.
>> ARTICLE
Oooh that makes sense! That's pretty cool actually, obviously unrealistic, but still cool. That's what we love about KnB though, I don't think I'd be able to watch a basketball anime without any bit of over the top craziness or fictional bull :p
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko no Basuke is as far fetched as it gets haha.  Oh and you might wanna fix your spoiler tag.
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, yeah, I'm not sure why the spoiler tags are so much more different from every other tag, never had to use them before... urgh

They're still not working even though I copied it exactly like it is in the sidebar. Did it change recently..?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, but then again I haven't had to use them in awhile.
>> ARTICLE
Alright nevermind then, I was only replying to you anyway. I guess I'll just leave it in purgatory as a blue link. *shrug*
>> ARTICLE
You have to put what you're spoiling in quotes like so.

[Spoiler](/s "Sounds plausible to be able to copy someones move the moment he sees it.. pretty much just like Kise more or less. But the other person no longer being able to? That sounds a little far fetched. I look forward to the next episode then!")
>> ARTICLE
I know evrybody is anticipating exciting games but Im just really happy to add another great Ganrodeo Opening to my workout palylist.
>> ARTICLE
For real though, the openings and endings for this show are beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
BASUKE BEGINS
>> ARTICLE
Not a huge amount happened this ep and that interview was a major excuse to recap the better moments from earlier matches. It's nice to have more Kuroko though and it should be a fun season even if it isn't the most realistic sports anime out there.
>> ARTICLE
I don't appreciate how the first 10 min or so was a recap of basically all of season 2, i wanted to at least see the first plays of the match before a cliffhanger  
>> ARTICLE
Yea I feel like there's more material left in the manga than would fit in two cour. I'm okay with this pacing as long as this season is longer than two cour and doesn't skip anything...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah if they keep up this pacing i'll be really upset
>> ARTICLE
It's not that I hate the pacing it's just that if they keep going like that we won't get the last games in season unless they skip content, like [spoiler from manga](/s "the Teiku arc").
>> ARTICLE
This season might not be two cour, you never know.
>> ARTICLE
According to MAL the number of episodes hasn't been announced yet, so I'm inclined to believe this season will go all the way to the end of the original manga.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and that almost certainly means it will have to be longer than two cour to reach that, unless they cut large portions of the source material.
>> ARTICLE
They've done it before for Shounen Jump shows.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko, Log, and Aldnoah? Feels like Saturday is the day of all days. 
>> ARTICLE
Im so hyped for this 

>> ARTICLE
Was there a reason Crunchyroll didn't pick up season 3?
>> ARTICLE
It did pick up S3. It's supposed to start streaming today, but I don't when it'll show up on the site. 
>> ARTICLE
I second this question.
>> ARTICLE
The animation has improved a lot since last season.
>> ARTICLE
Today I watched the first episode of Tokyo Ghoul sqrt(A), Death Parade, and Kuroko 3.
ODDLY ENOUGH, THE VIOLENCE IN KUROKO 3 FREAKED ME OUT THE MOST
>> ARTICLE
> Made this since /u/shadoxfix won't be doing this one I guess.

Just like Dog Days I haven't seen season 1 or 2 so I won't be doing this.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay :) I will just do this one every week then (Unless someone else does before me)
>> ARTICLE
No subs yet.(_)(_)(_)
>> ARTICLE
There are subs on Daisuki...if the ep doesn't show up for you then it's probably blocked in your region
>> ARTICLE
http://www.daisuki.net/anime/detail/KurokosBasketball3 
you nid to register to watch in HD
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!! ( #)
>> ARTICLE
Daisuki has it for free, if that is available for you
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I wonder what the hell Haizaki did at Teiko to get kicked off the team, every single one of the GoM players seemed almost scared of him. It's going to be the worst when an episode ends in the middle of a game.....also Kaijo vs Fukuda HYPEEEEE
>> ARTICLE
Like everybody said in this episode. He constantly was getting into fights or missed practice.    
Nobody in the team liked him so Akashi kicked him out.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, there's another reason (Which will be shown in the Teiko arc)

Teiko's motto was to win, they wouldn't kick Haizaki simply because of that, he was strong enough to help them win.
>> ARTICLE
This just completes my ongoing animes. My personal favorite sports anime is airing again and it started awesome as always. I can't wait to see Seirin play again regardless of how much love I have for Kise.
>> ARTICLE
So basically, like haikyuuuu i will be cheering for a sport anime!! Waited too long for this, the only thing i regret is the one week wait..
>> ARTICLE
Is this not going to be on CR? Noooo :(
>> ARTICLE
It's in their Winter 2015 section, but it hasn't gone up yet, so I'm guessing it's just coming late like Koufuku Graffiti.
>> ARTICLE
It might be, from the looks of things they have 2 more title announcements for this season.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope so. Having Kuroko and Ace of Diamond on Saturdays on CR to watch would be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Is it not available for you on Daisuki?
>> ARTICLE
You know Ive never actually used it before. How is their app? I tend to do most of my anime watching in bed at night, so hoping it will be on CR...
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I've never used the app, only the website. Sorry, you'll have to ask someone else or find out yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Kise hype train starts now!! \O/
>> ARTICLE
Those players are producing Bertolt levels of sweat. So dramatic and over the top, i love it.
>> ARTICLE
that baby Kuroko though... so fat 
>> ARTICLE
It's the trademark of anime babies. Have you ever seen one that looks normal? No, they all look like cake smothered under a blanket.

That being said, Kuroko was fucking adorable.
>> ARTICLE
So I kinda enjoyed this episode once it got past the recap. Though I did enjoy reliving the highlights of season 2, which in all honesty is good for people who finished it when it aired and for non-manga readers, it kinda dragged. But the animation looked nice and I loved all the music.

I also loved the ending where you see everyone with their teams. Aomine in a speedo yo.
>> ARTICLE
Will they show the rest of the manga in this season? There is a pretty lrngthy arc and the final game is pretty long.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, I hope they take their time with the flashback arc. Definitely enough for another season, especial with the final game being as long as it is.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I think they could manage to put everything into this seasons without cutting pretty much anything out of the picture, though I reckon the best format might be to use this season and then a season 4 with like 10 episodes for the finisher.
>> ARTICLE
The flashback arc is awesome. I hope they do it well!
>> ARTICLE
The true bad boy has arrived. This is probably my most anticipated game for this season. (unless they skip some content in order to finish the series which I hope they don't)
>> ARTICLE
This is a small random question but why is this not on crunchyroll, seeing as the other 2 seasons were?
>> ARTICLE
Wait I thought we already had the "player that plays really dirty and cheats all the time" now we're gonna have some new asshole that's also a dirty fighter? I'm not normally one to hate on evil characters since they have a reason for being there, but having been a basketball player myself I seem to have a hatred for rough/dirty players and that team really grinded my gears, I sure hope he doesn't end up the same way.
>> ARTICLE
Sooo excited to see this season. Saturdays got so much better. Also I like how [manga spoilers](/s " the interviewers remembered to interview kuroko, foreshadowing him losing his misdirection")
>> ARTICLE
I liked that too, was a really nice touch and setup for later in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Next episode HYPE!  Having read the manga, I know what's going to happen, but still.  This is so much better animated.  Can't wait for the matches to start up properly.
>> ARTICLE
>This is so much better animated.

You don't say
>> ARTICLE
First half honestly seemed like such a waste of time but at least we got to see Haizaki and catch a glimpse of him, and that op is so spoiler ridden.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love that [Punky Funky Love!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nrqgFkSw-M)
>> ARTICLE
im guessing it was an error on the last episode of last season? that guy was wearing grey-ish clothing instead of red
>> ARTICLE
So much of this episode was re-cap, which was pretty disappointing. But when that stopped and the stuff with Haizaki Shougo started, it felt like the good old KnB. This is the first time I've watched the show while it's airing so those cliffhangers are gonna be freaking painful. I'm hyped though!
>> ARTICLE
Did CR not get the 3rd season? T_T
>> ARTICLE
Not as of now, but they still have some shows left to be announced.
>> ARTICLE
Man it's going to hurt waiting a whole week for this :(

Great episode to get back into it, some people here were complaining about the recappiness(lol) of the first half, but I really liked it just to know what happened before.
>> ARTICLE
Soooooooooo hype!
>> ARTICLE
Wow I never expected for this to come back this fast!
>> ARTICLE
Was that recap for the first half of the episode really necessary?
>> ARTICLE
Probably because the Kaijo Fukuda match is so short they didn't want to split it in half. Also a good excuse to show some of the better animated scenes from last season. 
>> ARTICLE
Literally just finished season 2 last night for the first time... had no idea season 3 was coming out. This was an awesome surprise.
>> ARTICLE
Thought this said Kokoro Connect 3rd season - Episode 1.... I was likw "Aw sweet" then i realized what i said and that there isn't a second season
>> ARTICLE
There were so many death flags. Kise is definitely gonna lose to this punk and Kagami is going to have to show him what's what. 
>> ARTICLE
Kise is a great player, think you're writing him off too easy.
>> ARTICLE
Kise deserves more respect than that; he's one of the best, if not the best, Generation of Miracle players.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or do other people think that Kurokos Basketball isn't that good of a title for this show after 2 seasons ? 
>> ARTICLE
It seems like it, personally I think it's the 2nd best title out there... but that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
I like it , and I love Kuroko he's such a cool guy but I think there could have been another name to it xD ! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's what you meant with title... heh seems I misunderstood it as franchise. For the title I'm not all that sure either.
>> ARTICLE
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting so long! I am so fucking hyped for the following weeks, and comparing it to the manga I like the starting point.
>> ARTICLE
I read the whole manga after season 2 finished airing and seeing how i finished it almost 6 months ago, a lot of this episode is OH YEAH THAT ONE GUY HE DOES THAT THING. hold onto your butts this seasons gonna be amazing
>> ARTICLE
Is season 3 enough to finish off the manga?
>> ARTICLE
The ending makes me wonder.. When Kuroko was a baby, did his parents lose sight of him a lot. Of course they spend time tgether so it wouldn't work as much. Or maybe they didn't even realize Kuroko's mom was pregnant until like 8 months
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I enjoyed this episode. The suck felt x10 since I just finished Slam Dunk. Like both and one thing I hate about Slam Dunk is the pacing. Typical Toei. So you figure a 26 episode & different studio will have better pacing "GET HYPE" first episode back annnd it's 10-12 mins of recap. Then watching the new bad guy choke out Alex for a minute.


>> ARTICLE
Fuck man i wanted to punch kagami " oii stop that " * continues to stare for half an hour*
>> ARTICLE
Bets on how many players will get injuries this season?
>> ARTICLE
[Kuroko no Basket Spoiler!](/s "god I can't wait for Aomine to punch that dick'ed who is enemies with Kise, already forgotten his name im so silly")
>> ARTICLE
Fun show, looking forward to season 3, despite the show being stupidly unrealistic so I can't honestly enjoy it too much.

I would have liked it better if they either took it more seriously and made it realistic, or just went all out over the top, but they took a middle grounds of sort which is fine but just makes the show more average to me.

Still a very fun show, hopefully this season is as good as the first one.

Where were Akashi's gouged out eyes served on a platter?  

I was waiting for that. :P
>> ARTICLE
That was only against shutoku,  because he scored an own goal. 
>> ARTICLE
That was only applicable to the midorma/shutoku game
>> ARTICLE
Since his true self came back there was no reason for him to gouge out his eyes anymore. He took his first defeat like a real man instead.
>> ARTICLE
He will probably say it was his other self who made that promise to try and wriggle out of it
>> ARTICLE
Or he could just mention that he only made that promise for the Shutoku game.
>> ARTICLE
in my perfect ending akashi would see a psychiatrist... like everyone is ignoring that he threatened kagami with a sharp pair of scissors or something.
>> ARTICLE
If Akashi really wanted to stab Kagami then he wouldn't have missed him. The one who should be send to the psychiatrist should be his father instead for mentally+physically exhausting and brainwashing his child to the point where his subconscious mind had to create another personality in order to deal with the stress and to prevent the Burnout-Syndrom.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still feel like they went too far with that. Hell, it wasn't even a threat, it was literally assault.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was pretty messed up, but Akashi because of his Emperor Eye knew he was able to dodge it. He was just trying to intimidate Kagami.
>> ARTICLE
Is this what it feels like when you have a kid and they do really well in school and you're super proud of them but then they suddenly move to college and you know they will do great but you won't hear from them for a while?

I believe you might be describing *the void*.

And yes, I suppose you could see it in that way, oddly specific, but still true.
>> ARTICLE
No Hyuga and Riko moment, alas. :(
>> ARTICLE
From what I remember, the author paired Riko and Kiyoshi together. I was in the same boat as you thinking Hyuga and Riko would be the obvious pair. I had a friend start watching the show, and after reading about Kiyoshi and Riko being paired it became more acknowledgeable when I watching again with my friend.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC Riko and Kiyosh used to date which is why they seem close but i still reckon the true OTP is Hyuga and Riko 

>> ARTICLE
I am not too sure about this.  After grand finale got over, I read *Kuroko No Basket Extra Game* and seems like Riko and Hyuga went on a [date](http://readms.com/r/kuroko_no_basket__extra_game/1/2647/11). 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I'm sorry my memory completely screwed me and I think you are right. What I was getting at ment is this, [the Author says Teppei and Riko use to date](https://m.reddit.com/r/KurokosBasketball/comments/2o1gm6/fujimaki_has_confirmed_that_kiyoshi_and_riko/) 
>> ARTICLE
True.  Seems like they dated before Kiyoshi was injured but I did not see any sparks between them when he came back.  Compared to that Hyuga obviously have a huge crush over Riko.

Nope, it was after the final match as a birthday present for Kuroko, all the GoM got together for his birthday and played basketball and they took that pic. :')

There's gonna be an OVA this December (Q. 75.5) that will be about what happened that day.

Do you know if the extra game will be an ova?
>> ARTICLE
It's not finished yet so we won't see it for while if it gets animated, but KnB makes mad money in Japan so I'd say they'll adapt in in the far future since theres only 3 chapters of Extra Game out and a chapter is released every 2 months.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit im already rooting for Purple.

Man them feels when that showed up. Such a great episode.

is there anyone who have the HD version of that picture ? i want it for wallpaper

I took this screen-cap from the 1080p stream on Daisuki so this may be the highest quality you can get so far until the BluRays release in the future, I may be wrong though.

KnB- Extra game. 
http://readms.com/r/kuroko_no_basket__extra_game/1/2647/1
>> ARTICLE
KnB Extra Game. It's against an American team. 
myanimelist.net/manga/83807/Kuroko_no_Basket:_Extra_Game
>> ARTICLE
There's a spin-off (more like a sequel) in which the GoM+Kuroko & Kagami play streetball against an American team, or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't it just 1 unfinished manga chapter?
//oh shit i though it's just a teaser and it is actually full game!
>> ARTICLE
no there are 3 chapters so far but it only releases every 2 months. 
>> ARTICLE
3 chapters currently available with more to come
>> ARTICLE
There are 3 chapters now IIRC. they only release 1 chapter every few months. Look up Kuroko no Basuke: Extra Game.
>> ARTICLE
americans probably better then GoM I presume?
>> ARTICLE
The GoM with teamwork could beat almost any American high school team. They'd get stomped by a theoretical American all-star team because the best American high school players used to be able to go straight to the NBA. Even if you look in terms of players who could have gone to high school together, you have a lineup of Lebron James, Dwight Howard, JR Smith, Monta Ellis, and Amar'e Stoudemire.

If you jump back a couple years you get Kobe, Jermaine O'Neal, T-Mac, and Vince Carter.
>> ARTICLE
Given that the GoM are freaks of nature, they'd be competitive in the NBA with some time, since their base stats (size and skill) are already way beyond even the best Japanese players in real life. Kagami and Aomine are mini Lebron and Kobe (if Kobe was a forward) without the genius gene. 
>> ARTICLE
They're still kids. Without being sent off to US colleges I can't see them living up to their potential, even if they get experience in a FIBA U19 saga where team japan is the GoM. Asian leagues just have too poor of a talent pool for player development.
>> ARTICLE
No idea, since I haven't read the manga, but common sense dictates they're at least a challenge to the GoM. My guess is street rules will be the challenge.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they made a good decision by making the team from American streetball team. If it were an actual NBA team, the GOM wouldn't have a chance, lol. America has a monopoly over skill level in basketball like no other sport in the world.
>> ARTICLE
But Aomine and Kagami both played on the streets before, well in Japan though..
>> ARTICLE
Kagami played in America
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeahh my bad, supports my point even better lol thanks
>> ARTICLE
In a nutshell, Americans crush uni team, call all japanese players monkeys, Riko's dad ain't havin none of that shit and gets the GoM together to destroy them.


>> ARTICLE
That sounds exactly like the Eyeshield 21 final game in the manga. They put the best from Japan in a team vsing the best from America. 
>> ARTICLE
or any other sports anime/manga that went on long enough (major for example) :D + eyeshield 21 got really shit about that time.. it became about some weird inferiority complex bullshit
>> ARTICLE
Oh thanks,had no idea...purely anime watcher
>> ARTICLE
What a ride it has been. Now to waiting Extra game to be finished and animated
>> ARTICLE
eh, is that the spin-off were the miracles play against a team from America?
>> ARTICLE
Yes that is correct.
>> ARTICLE
It's technically a sequel not a spinoff but yeah
>> ARTICLE
And it's glorious 
>> ARTICLE
We're gonna be waiting for years T_T
>> ARTICLE
I already miss this show so much, holy shit... What a fucking wonderful story this was. Easily the best new anime I've seen in a long time, and it's a fucking sports shonen of all things... Not gonna lie, this anime made my year. It was so much fun coming back every saturday to mash the refresh button on Daisuki, hoping and praying for the new episode to come out and to continually be swept away by the adrenaline rush every single week, and of course coming here to talk about it with all you fine folks. Having no interest in basketball beforehand, I have no idea how or why I even started watching this show, but I am beyond glad that I did.

KUROKO WHAT A SERIES

AOMINE VS SEIRIN ROUND 2 STILL THE BEST ARC BUT THIS CAME CLOSE IN MANY ASPECTS ESPECIALLY LAST EPISODE
>> ARTICLE
True.  Aomine vs Kagami while both in zone was the best part for me in the whole series.
>> ARTICLE
That and Shutoku v Seirin round 2 where Kuroko broke out the vanishing drive and led that comeback. And Aomine vs Kise.
>> ARTICLE
[my face](http://i.imgur.com/vZn8j6W.jpg) when they played "Can Do" on the final play
>> ARTICLE
I'm using "Can Do" for alarm clock since I started watching the show, 3 years ago. Fat chance of changing it anytime soon.

Also, I won a bet with a friend about it (I've bet that they'll use "can do" in the final episode).
>> ARTICLE
I love this series so much!

This was a great episode to end it, but what will I be so hyped for every week now? ;_;

[See you!](http://i.imgur.com/ICVT5aL.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Right? So many series ending now too, so it's like, "So... Now what..?"

I think I only have like 2 still going so anyone who wants to give me something to watch. Pls. I will love you forever.
>> ARTICLE
It feels like the end of an era.  I remember stumbling onto this one during sophomore year of college on crunchyroll and wondering if it was for me.  Looking back on that foolish moment where I debated clicking 'play' all I can do is laugh and wish there was some way that I could relive that first time again.  [Thanks for the memories Kuroko :')](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9jhCPv87Wc/maxresdefault.jpg)

story time - 

I started watching Kuroko no Basket around March 2013, over 2 years ago. I decided to watch it because I couldnt find anything else to watch at the time. I didnt even LIKE basketball, just genuinely wasnt interested in the sport, so I had extremely low expectations, and honestly didnt even think Id enjoy the show. 

[**BRUH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GwAkthbKMc), I was so wrong. This show was so hype and so ridiculous, and I loved every fucking second of that first season. I loved the character tropes, I loved the Generation of Miracles story, and I loved the over-the-top abilities. I remember that right after I finished the first season(in 1 day), I flew right into the manga, cause I couldnt wait for a season 2. 

Fucking hell mate, I even started playing basketball because it was so hype. I started following the NBA and all this other shit. I mean, Ill never tell my friends that the reason I started playing ball was because of a chinese cartoon, but damn right I did. And on a pussier note, it made me want to try harder at other sports(Soccer), which I didnt give a fuck about, but I realized that I wouldnt be playing out of highschool, so I figured I should try my best.

I just felt the need to say something about one of my all-time favourite series, a series partially responsible for what I am today, I know many people may have a similar experience, but I just thought Id share this fuckbois tale. 

Its been a pleasure doing episode discussions with you guys, [goodbye friends!](http://i.imgur.com/k3i6LBI.png)

>> ARTICLE
 In my case, it helped me love it again. I played in middle school and high school but after i kinda stopped playing. I was losing interest, like Aomine. Not for the same reasons though, lmao. I'm not even 1/40 as good.
>> ARTICLE
> chinese cartoon
[Baka!](http://imgur.com/wur8XMk)
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I started playing basketball cuz of Kuroko, even during pool parties with mates I always dunk Kagami style with a ball into the pool ;D


>> ARTICLE
I thought I'm the only person who started balling because of this.Akashi and PGs FTW.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching NBA because of KnB too, before I had absolutely no interest, but holy shit am I glad this show happened. My dad was always disappointed that I didn't care much for sports, as he's a huge sports guy. He never said that of course, but it was painfully obvious anyway. He'll *never* know that the reason I like basketball now is because of an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Can I tell a story? I wanna tell a story.

The same as OP, I started watching Kuroko around August and finished it in two days. And being the impatient fuck I am, I then read the manga. Same as OP, I didn't enjoy basketball, I didn't play it, hell I still thought the Lakers were good (RIP).

So I go shopping, and I find a basketball, I thought why not? So I bought it. Was going into grade 7 at that point, hit a small growth spurt, going 4'11 to 5'4. And picking up basketball, and playing 1 on 1 against my friend everyday, I had this super cheap move. Box him out, hook shot it in. 

Around September-December, I was a literal garbage can, didn't know what a crossover was, when I put it behind my back it flew so far, couldn't even shoot. But I still enjoyed it. It was a new sport, and I strived to dunk on the 7ft, 8ft, and 9ft nets. 

Also around this point, my soccer team was on fire. First game we won 22-3, second game we beat our rivals 2-1. I didn't know it at that point, but everything about my physical abilities changed. I was able to run faster, jump a little bit higher, I was a physical player, and the way I thought about the game was a lot different. But alas, like Seirin, eventually we suffered a heartbreaking loss. We were tied 0-0, with around 5 minutes left. The team was good, and during that game I hit my stride, I played defense and nobody got past me, second chance opportunities, I was essentially in a 'zone.' But they got past one of my defenders and were on a fast break and about to cross it in, I sprinted back, and I slide tackled him. All ball.

Ref? He called a penalty kick, and we lost. In those last 4 minutes we tried to get one last goal, and we failed. That's when I knew, that I absolutely hate losing in a competitive sport. 

Around January-March, before a two week spring break. That's when I started improving slowly, I could put it behind my back most of the time, crossovers were iffy, but I could dunk on a 7ft and that's what mattered to me at the time. Around January, we asked about our basketball team. But we couldn't get one because we couldn't get a teacher to coach, the usual basketball coach was coaching badminton and ultimate, so I just joined those two.

Up until the start of highschool for me, it was just basketball, and make sure I don't screw up my knees by doing nothing during the summer.

If anyone cares, I can finish it.
>> ARTICLE
Finish it after your healthy dose of birthday cake, gratz I guess - Stranger on the Internet taking time to gratulate you, what a time to be alive

haha, literally half the people I talked to who play tennis started playing cuz of Prince of Tennis.

Cheers mate, I'm glad KnB gave you some inspiration. It's been a fun ride

#Anime of the fucking Season 

Sayonara Kuroko 
>> ARTICLE
That first OP, major chills.

Kuroko has been great. Hopefully they continue with the manga and one day make an anime adaptation of Extra Game. I'm gonna miss it.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a pleasure my friends.

May we all discover our inner ZONE someday.
>> ARTICLE
Best basketball anime to me, but I didn't forget what Junpei-chan said to Riko! He didn't deliver >=(
>> ARTICLE
I was kiiiinda hoping Hyuuga would sink that free throw and have it go into overtime, but I guess going for the rebound was the better option, considering Kagami and Kiyoshi were at the point of collapsing.

Hard to believe this series is finally over now, after 3 seasons and 75 episodes. It was pretty silly sometimes, but it was still really entertaining. I'm gonna miss it.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it won't go into overtime since not a single game went into one since the start of the series.
>> ARTICLE
in the manga there was a scene where die acknowledged that they wont stand a chance in ot, so they had to make this play
>> ARTICLE
Yeah for people who don't really follow basketball as a sport I thought it would have been ideal for them to leave that tidbit of info in the anime. I had to explain to my sisters why they wanted to miss the free throw :P
>> ARTICLE
3 years and 75 episodes of pure concentrated hype. Will never forget.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy they won haha with sports anime you never know :p

They like all got to shine in the last minute too :)

Wanted more MoimoixKuroko and JunpeixRiko moments though...
>> ARTICLE
Holy Hell, I cant believe its  over man. Every episode is so hype, even more so than any shonen I've seen. I'm always super hyped and loud when its on just because it genuinely makes me happy and super hyped. You will be missed. It pains me to have to remove it from myanimelist. See Ya D:
>> ARTICLE
B-but, i don't want it to be over....

I'm gonna go watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
**3 DAYS LATE.** Felt like forever

Some hype [BGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcF4Bjr-kIk) as you read through this episode discussion

I recommend reading the last few chapters, its just nice to read the end of a manga, ya know? Chapter 272 would be where to start.

And thats it!

I demand you check out **Kuroko: Extra Game**, a story taking place a YEAR AFTER THE MANGA, about streetball, and involves A LOT of characters from the original series, even 3rd years who went off to university make an appearance!

Oh, and of course if you arent convinced already (very minor 1st chapter spoilers) [THIS PAGE GETS ME SO FUCKING MOIST](http://i.imgur.com/2anbbG5.png) 

Extra Game currently has 3 chapters out, and a 4th should be out in July. A new chapter comes out every 2 months-ish.

Also, in case you havent seen this [amazing masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyq6wLesgms)

I'm sold!

Also, thanks for making these threads!
>> ARTICLE
Midorima and his 'lucky item' lol.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad you left out izuki's steal :(

Part of the reason I love the ending was because every Seirin member were playing their absolute best in the final seconds of the game.  It really shows that this game is about two teams battling it out,  and not simply Kagami vs GoM. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, you're right. I added it to the list. 

I totally missed chapter 272 because the site I use has the order of the chapters all messed up.

I started taking images from 273, but when I went back a chapter it brought me to 271(old chapter), I had never noticed though.

This is pretty odd. Going forward from 271 to 273 to 274. But then I go backwards from 274 to 272 to 271.

Best Sports Anime EVER.

the final episode is finally here~~ -loljokes kurokonobasket is now over boys TT__TT

STAY TUNED FOR THE EXTRA GAME!

That moment when you are looking at the time and see the seconds of the final episode ticking away...
>> ARTICLE
And now, we wait, for a posible OVA or Movie for the ongoing manga secuel KnB: Extra game.

It was a pretty good adaptation with no bullshit or fillers, I loved it
>> ARTICLE
I think they should've ended this in a bigger and much more tense way, like the episode before.

With that being said, this whole entire series **fucking rocked.** 

Loved it, and probably wont be topped for a while. It has been a ton of fun waiting for each episode to come out week by week.
>> ARTICLE
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS ANIME FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M TEARING UP OMG.
>> ARTICLE
It was an amazing ride. Kuroko is one of the best sport anime of all time, behind only Hajime no Ippo. I nearly died of excitement at some points, that's how hype this show is.
>> ARTICLE
Can we get some Kuroko no Basket: College Edition or, NBA Edition please. I cant go on like this
>> ARTICLE
I got into anime because of this anime. I got into basketball because of this anime. It's been a hell of a ride.  
>> ARTICLE
I was screaming throughout the whole episode..lmao
Even though I read the manga, it doesn't compare to the visual hype you get.
The feels T_T
>> ARTICLE
10/10 would've wanted Seirin to lose just for the Nude confessions.
 
But arrr WTF am I supposed to do with my life now that this is over? :( [T.T](http://media1.giphy.com/media/oAW9QPkQwJqJq/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
its finally over!! I hope extra game gets animated when they finish that.
>> ARTICLE
Man, can't believe it's over.

I'm glad I watched this, it was such a great ride. I'll never forget this anime, that's for sure. All the times it's broken my hype meter, made me fangasm, had me make sounds I didn't even know I could make. Kuroko no Basket, you will be missed. I havn't seen too many sports anime, but KnB is probably my favorite, thus far. 

See you.... T_T

Me too. Weird how it was indoors.

WHAT WILL I WATCH NOW?

That was the most I've cried since I was a little kid. Sometimes tears of joy and excitement hit the hardest, especially when you realize it's over.

One of the best pieces of media I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I fucking love this series.

Here's to hoping we get a mini series or OVA with the GoM and Kagami, that's my last wish for the show.
>> ARTICLE
Extra Game PLEASE
>> ARTICLE
Shit...... Has it really been 3 years already? Damn time flies. I'm going to miss this show. :(


P.s. i really hope they license this in the U.S. so i can buy the DVDs. 
>> ARTICLE
i watched it, it was great.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing journey, thanks everyone!
>> ARTICLE
Amazing, I've been watching it on Crunchyroll for so long I forgot I was 2 episodes behind. That made watching the last 2 episodes all at once fucking amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Fucking amazing! I started this show after s1 was done and marathoned it cause it was so good.  Then I read the manga after that because I couldn't wait for s2.  Just love this series so much and it's killing me waiting for the chapters of extra game.  Hope that gets animated as an ova once it's done.  I'm going to miss this show so much! 
>> ARTICLE
What an masterpiece. Definetly in my 10
>> ARTICLE
I feel like i'm gonna be watching it again, many times over. Time to read extra game.

Holy shit I'm surprised my heart never exploded from watching this show. It has been an honor :)
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad that I picked up this show 1 month ago. Is there any possiblity of season 4?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, because the story is over. This was the end.
>> ARTICLE
The hype train is finally over. Thank you Kuroko for an amazing ride.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing last episode! Kuroko no Basket is an awesome Story and i'm glad i've experienced it. Does anyone know if they are going to release the OST for Season 3 aswell?
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna search for it weekly, like a lunatic. Season 3 OST was on par to the first season's.
>> ARTICLE
Only weekly? :p
>> ARTICLE
I know, right? What a casual I am.

Gotta make a script that looks for it every 5 seconds then unleash it!
>> ARTICLE
Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was still SO excited watching the ending of that game. That's how you know the anime did a great job. 

It's been a fun basketball adventure KnB!
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the finale is getting a lot of praise. Worth picking up ? Here's my [MAL.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/neosic)

Never done a 50+ episode of an sports anime. Actually, thinking about it, I dont think I have a sports anime under my belt at all.
>> ARTICLE
Short answer: Yes, you should at least try.

Long answer: 

Yes. You'll enjoy the show if you go in with an open mind. Don't go into it expecting it to be a basic basketball game. I like to think of it as *normal basketball to the extreme*, because these highschool kids do have ridiculous abilities, but they aren't out of the realm of basketball. It's a shounen, that's for sure.

95% of the show is basketball action, and the non-basketball stuff is still really good (not filler), it's mostly just character interactions and minor character development, things that really add flavour to the show, because you get more invested in the character's personalities. The characters make this show what it is. They all have their little niche abilities and cliches, and the whole story is built around extremely interesting characters.

The production value is really good, like, super good. It's produced by Production I.G. who always put out quality shows. Season 2 is where things kick into top gear, and season 2 is known for it's extremely high budget. A lot of super hype moments happen in season 2 because that's where the manga material was most saturated. Now, that's not to say Season 1 is anywhere close to bad, but there is a significant difference quality wise between S1 and S2. 

In summary: Shounen, action, hype, characters, high quality animation, and a amazing soundtrack. Approach with an open mind and I'm sure you'll enjoy, just like 150k+ other people do. Kuroko no Basket is a show definitely worthy of it's praise.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for this.  Might have to pick it up as a daily show. And I just remembered, I do have ping pong under me,  so not the first sports anime. 
>> ARTICLE
But is it your first battle sports anime with unlimited ~~power~~ budget?

This show will become a favorite our yours. Too good not to :P
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really an anime type of person. Picked this up just by chance after seeing someone mentioned it on Twitter and it was about basketball. Watched like two episodes and ended up binging the first season. Forgot about it til after season 2 and ended up marathoning it too. Been more excited watching this season than anything else I've ever watched. Been a hell of a ride. Too many amazing moments to even bother trying to list them, although I will say hearing the s1 opening at the win brought up way too many feels.

Absolutely cannot believe it's been three years. Honestly going to feel like something's missing at the weekends for a while.
/fanboy
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe it's done... Started tearing up during the game. Then that realization that this is really ending with the whole "final" bit and it was all over for me, rain. 

Also bringing back "Can Do."  :')
>> ARTICLE
> Also bringing back "Can Do."

So many feelings when that played again :c
>> ARTICLE
Damn, insane episode.

Got goosebumps throughout the match.

Cried with seiren when they won the winter cup.

And an awesome ending for this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I knew how it was going to end, but seeing how it played out was still awesome. I love how they used the second half of the episode as an epilogue to close out the season. 

This and Plastic Memories is in my Top 5 animes of the year so far. We will see how the rest of the year plays out. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think I'd like him at first but Kiyoshi ended up being my favorite character. Get well soon, Iron Heart. 
>> ARTICLE
God this was such a great anime, it knew what it was and stayed true to it, awesome ride. Also in response to the last episode, DAMN THAT WAS SO HYPE!!!
>> ARTICLE
I am super sad. I found this serious by coincidence and loved it from the get go. Even though I knew the ending from the Manga I must say that the new things with the GoM Members after the final were great. Hope, when Extra Game ends, they will make a Anime adaption. Production I.G. if you read this please notice me 
>> ARTICLE
They adapted every epilogue except for the Kirasaki Daichi one (Edit: And the Seiho one). Watch the ep 76 ova be an episode-long adaption of that epilogue.
>> ARTICLE
It's all ogre bois.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna miss you, well mechanic... We had some good saturdays together ()
>> ARTICLE
Tbh I was hoping for some epic direct drive shit on the last play
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad that it's over but at the same time I'm glad that I don't have to hear the word ZONE as often anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Man I love KnB. I remember watching season 1 few years ago. Because my friends were reading the manga. And I was being sceptical about sports anime. So i decided to give it a try. I got so hooked. All episodes always ending in a cliffhanger that just made me want to watch more and more. Also the way they hype up games makes it so much exciting, new surprises around the corner. That makes makes you go "omg". Some games made me stand up with excitment. Hope they animate the sequal with the "Streetball". I will definetly re watch this show again.
>> ARTICLE
No words come to mind, just the void...

Seriously though, it has been a great ride with you all! Onto the next anime!
>> ARTICLE
This show was amazing really hope there is a re-watch for it some time soon.
>> ARTICLE
This has been one of the most spectacular animes I have ever watched. It saddens me not only because it is over, but also because I don't think I will ever have the pleasure of watching something so finely tuned ever again. Best anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie it's been an adventure with this show. Been watching it since it first aired and to see the conclusion is a bittersweet feeling. I have to give thanks to this show for getting me through some hard times. I loved the story and all the characters. I hope there will be more content (besides the scheduled ova) because I really want more of this world. Anyway it's been real, see ya'll in the upcoming seasons. 
>> ARTICLE
Tfw I have a free period so I can technically watch it but I'll probably end up bawling so I have to wait until I get home ;-;

Edit: Teared up near the end of the game and full on started sobbing when Can Do started playing, holy shit I love how they revisit OPs! Do any other shows do this??? Anyway, I didn't think they'd jam the game all in the first half but then again, the game only had what, 40 seconds left? I almost wish they ended it on more of a bang... not that I'm complaining, what an awesome ride :) Now for the final of Hibike! Euphonium!
>> ARTICLE
heh. another long running series comes to an end. it's time like these where i feel a little sad that time waits for no one and that nothing lasts forever. 9/10 for being solid and giving me a dose of hype every now and then.
>> ARTICLE
Now I just need a remake for Slam Dunk and I couls die with a smile.
>> ARTICLE
I totally want another season of it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's really over? Has the Hype Train reached its final stop? :O

I went back and re-watched the episode, and I noticed a purple-skinned dude lining up with Kaijo at the award ceremony.

Nooooo! The video's not playing on Daisuki...

Better hit f5 a few million times then.

Blubbers uncontrollably;;


What is this hole in my heart. IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE BOYS THANKS FOR THE 3-ISH YEARS!! ;_____;)
>> ARTICLE
In typical Kuroko fashion they win the game by dunking...

STILL AWESOME
>> ARTICLE
After 3 years, Kuroko is finally over. It's funny, I hated the slow pace of the show. I hated countless wide pans across the player's faces during games to show what they're thinking. I hated how they went with every sports anime cliche they could think of.

Yet I love Kuroko. It's been with me for so long that I see those cliches as endearing. This show is the most cliche, over-the-top, shonen, underdog anime I've seen in a while and I enjoyed it for the most part.

It's strange seeing it as "completed" on MAL, but I'm glad nonetheless for the story. It's been [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu-hyaeaROk).
>> ARTICLE
Wait...this is all of the manga?!
>> ARTICLE
Haha loved that bit. Forgot half the hilarious moments from s1.
>> ARTICLE
Willing to sell my soul and or eventual first born for 3 more seasons Japan PLS

Masterpiece is not even a word for this series anymore...great ending and also great that they were showing what the other teams were doing...Maybe we get a sequel sometime! :^)

>> ARTICLE
It's over..

I need someone to use the smoothing tool on the whole series so I can rewatch it in 60FPS.
>> ARTICLE
Wait for the BluRay raws. The S2 ones just came out.
>> ARTICLE
Whereabouts did they/will the s3 ones come out?
>> ARTICLE
If the S2 BluRay raws came out weeks ago, I'm going to guess it's going to take a year to get the full S3 raws. :/
>> ARTICLE
Hell with that. Gonna just buy the BluRays themselves.
>> ARTICLE
The final was okay I guess. Anyways, I've only started to watch this series because of Akashi and until the very last episode he remained being the best character in this series since the other characters were too simple (in my opinion. Don't kill me). 
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who felt that it was a little too rushed? Frankly I was disappointed at how they ended it, felt like it needed more polishing or something... 

>> ARTICLE
When the manga ended, people felt the same.

The ended matched perfectly to the manga. 

They had to cut out very minor things from the Rakuzan-Seirin game, but they trimmed a lot of the Teiko flashback.
>> ARTICLE
So this is the end of the manga and the anime? It was a fun ride. But it sure felt fast at the end, one could have expected some kind of last episode dedicated to more SoL / daily stuff, but nonetheless I enjoyed that finale. The serie went crescendo for me (or it grew on me?), that last season was a nice watch every week.

What a ride the series has been. I never felt as much adrenaline when watching an anime before.We've seen it all, from the beginning to the very end, and finally seeing the boys winning the big one just felt so amazing, its like you were part of the team. It was so fitting to play"Can Do" in there when Kagami made the final dunk, I dont think any other song would have been more fitting. Overall, Kuroko is an anime I wont ever forget.

Now we just wait until Haikyuu!! is released, which is just as intense as Kuroko no Basuke.
>> ARTICLE
Am i the only one who isn't happy about the end of the match? I really love this anime!!! I started to play basketball because of it, but still i think Seirin should have lost.

>> ARTICLE
It's just how sports anime work.

The author knew he wasn't continuing this part of the story, so he essentially had to end on Seirin winning.

In sports anime, a team always loses once. Then they have that whole *rebuilding* thing, they get stronger, and then they win. It's just part of the sports anime formula.

Seirin lost vs. Touou (Aomine) in the Interhigh. They then did a training camp, added Kiyoshi, and then won the Wintercup in dramatic fashion.

great 3 seasons loved it all season 4 pls :[

no chance sadly this is it .

there is a sequel but very few chapters and not a weekly manga so it would take forever to finish

OVA??

maybe

Its too bad we never saw kuroko go in the zone..
>> ARTICLE
He can't. Zone shows emotion. In order for Kuroko to play the way he does, he can't show any.  
Either that, or he's not a good enough player to enter Zone.

Yeah, pretty sure you need like Kagami/Aomine stats as well as the love of the game.

seirin fight!!!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
They were going for the win since they couldn't afford to go into overtime with Kiyoshi's knee troubles and of course stamina issues for the whole Seirin team compared to Rakuzan's... 
>> ARTICLE
I get what you're saying,but you have to understand that this is supposed to be exciting. 

The last 3-ish minutes of NBA games are absolute garbage **if** they go into the foul-strategy. Can you imagine if this game ended in just a countdown Rakuzan possession...

Rakuzan foul, Seirin hit 2, Rakuzan holds possession for the last like 15 seconds and then win. Not exactly the best way to end a 275 chapter/75 episode series.

The author never used overtime because it seemed too predictable and it was way to easy of a hype mechanic. Also, in reality Seirin would lose 100% of the time in any overtime games, they just don't have the bench that other teams do. Hell, Seirin themselves probably knew this, and that's why they had to avoid OT. 

If you're asking about Mibuchi's careless foul, it's explained in the manga as "Shooting guard [instinct](http://imgur.com/a/hO6Z8)".
>> ARTICLE
This. To add, careless fouls happen to the best professionals. JR Smith inevitably made one of the games in the Finals go to overtime because he handed GSW not just 1, but 2 lifelines near the end of regulation time with his [dumb fouls](http://nypost.com/2015/06/08/j-r-smith-cops-to-dumb-fouls-that-nearly-cost-cavs-big-time/). For a foul more similar to Mibuchi's, we can look at [Manu Ginobili's infamous foul in the 2006 Conference Finals](http://www.48minutesofhell.com/manu-ginobili-key-to-spurs-mavericks-series).

>And then all that Manu moxie betrayed the Spurs. On the following possession, Ginobili fouled Dirk Nowitzki at the hoop for what became a game tying And-1. Manu Ginobilis instincts are true. But in this case, the smart play would have been to let Nowitzki score or, at the very least, prevent him from scoring on the shot attempt, sending him to the line for two shots. Had either of those things happened, the Spurs would have likely won the game. Instead, the Mavericks crushed the Spurs in overtime, outscoring them 15-7.
But its an easy thing to live with Manu Ginobilis mistakes. Addle-brained moments come at a ratio of 1:10 to his brilliant ones, and the occasional lapse in judgment is always already forgiven.

I love how the real Akashi calls everyone by their surname, showing some respect for other people.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi went from adc to a god tier support.
>> ARTICLE
adc?
>> ARTICLE
its a reference to MOBA games, Basically the person who gets the team to victory.

(Attack damage carry)
>> ARTICLE
Is that because they have the highest damage done?
>> ARTICLE
They should, but basically they are really weak early game, then when the team needs them (20-30 mins later) they should be doing the most. 
>> ARTICLE
the ADC is the person on the team that everyone defends and supports for, as they build no suvivability (or in general not a lot) and are expected to be the main damage from the team in fights. This role is integral in bringing the team to victory as their dps is generally the highest out of anyone in the game
>> ARTICLE
No, because they output constant physical damage, I say constant because there are ad assassins that can do more damage, but at bursts, usually used to take out carries quickly. Highest damage done can be done by any role aside from the obvious damage, such as the ap caster, or assassins. 
>> ARTICLE
Just league really. ADC isn't used in any other MOBA
>> ARTICLE
ADC is used for SMITE actually!
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else want a KnB style League of Legends anime? A story focused on professional teams instead of the champions themselves sounds so fucking good. SKT Final Boss all the way. Man, I dump my wallet into that.

There's a manga about Daigo Umehara, a famous Street Fighter player.  http://www.amazon.com/x30A6-x30E1-x30CF-x30E9-live/dp/456981347X

Can't seem to find the first chapter on the internet anymore :(
>> ARTICLE
professional teams of warriors and mages? 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand the reference. I meant (possibly fictional) individual teams rising up in the professional world. Different champions for different matches, the individual backstories, some drama, the usual.
>> ARTICLE
An extremely high amount of potential, but also a fair likelihood at losing? Sounds like CLG guys. We got the Akashilift

One of my favourite non-action moments of the series is when the Generation of Miracles are cheering on Seirin, just so nice to see uncharacteristic development, and cheering from cool/stoic characters. 

Last episode next week, not sure how I feel about one of my favourite shows ending. :(
>> ARTICLE
> One of my favourite non-action moments of the series is when the Generation of Miracles are cheering on Seirin

Yeah, that was a major highlight for me too. The fact it was Aomine that went first from the GoM and his **manly** tears when he realised the truth behind direct drive Zone were just amazing moments. Midorima still sounded so serious too lol, made me laugh.

One thing, from checking those pages, it seems like the show has been pretty faithful where it can be.
>> ARTICLE
That flashback to the ED song from the Teikou arc though when they were all cheering... I cried some ugly, ugly tears.
>> ARTICLE
The art is really great. I'm not much of a manga reader but I might check this out.
>> ARTICLE
Do yourself a favor and at least read the Teiko flashback arc which was really lacking in the anime. It makes the reactions of everyone make much more sense.
>> ARTICLE
Reactions of everyone to what?
>> ARTICLE
I think he's referring to each of the GoM's feelings towards one another and their original concepts of "team play". The anime didn't do the manga justice when the "gears began to spin completely out of control".
>> ARTICLE
The cheering was a really great moment, indeed. 

Kuroko's reactions in the manga, somehow seem to have even more impact, it looks really great. Thank you for linking those.

Also, noticed that even Hanamiya seemed to have [a slight reaction](http://i.imgur.com/gzdXSAG.jpg) at the time, though I am not sure if he was annoyed or just [fidget-y](http://i.imgur.com/JiZKDMi.png) for some reason.  
  
> Last episode next week, not sure how I feel about one of my favourite shows ending. :(  
  
I don't want this to end but I can't feel sad after watching this episode. Was grinning too much during the aoe zone and the direct drive sequences to even think about it.
>> ARTICLE
In regards to Hanamiya, in the manga panel he's making like a noise of disgust. Haha he's probably all fidgety because he's about to puke from the show of camaraderie and friendship. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha this fucking anime is so ridiculous... but it's a lot of fun nonetheless.

Aomine even cried! LOL!
>> ARTICLE
> Aomine even cried

Yeah I felt that to be a bit weird. Teared up a bit I understand but that seemed a bit much, unexpected!
>> ARTICLE
Every GOM must cry because of Kuroko's basketball. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko makin' his past sidebitches cry. 
>> ARTICLE
Why was it weird? It makes complete sense considering aomine basically threw tetsu away because he regarded him as not useful to his progression to becoming he best. For aomine to realize his best friend was the only way to move forward and develop as a player shows just how much he has grown since he first met kagami.
>> ARTICLE
> For aomine to realize his best friend was the only way to move forward and develop as a player shows just how much he has grown since he first met kagami.

I just didn't expect that much tears, it was a nice moment but felt weird seeing it, weird in the unnatural sense more then the wrong sense!

I highly agree after the 2nd true zone. Man that shit was just outstanding

I watched the whole match from episode 67 to 74 with my friend right now, I am just super hyped and I don't know what to do with my life until next week.
>> ARTICLE
I like that in the end, it's all just a bunch of friends. No villains for the sake of villains (except for Hanamiya), no ridiculous evil tropes, just a bunch of people who got disillusioned by wins and losses which is completely relatable.

It's a pretty ridiculous anime with Akashi's basketball sharingan but the relationships are as real as they get in anime.
>> ARTICLE
> no ridiculous evil tropes, just a bunch of people who got disillusioned by wins and losses which is completely relatable

This was one of the developments that I absolutely love. Everyone just wants to play some basketball and have fun.

I've just started Season 2 and these comments are really making me hype. This anime is just too good.

I've already binged a lot since I made that comment. I'll be caught up by Wednesday probably.

I don't know if its good or bad that you are late to the game all i can say is that some of the cliffhangers in season 2 and 3 nearly get me heart attacks knowing i'd have to wait a week for the net episode

Yeah, I joined in on this show just a week before season 3, and I'm sooo happy I didn't have to wait a week for another episode in season 2. The ones in season 3 alone were killing me!

Bruh he is so lucky I binged it from the start after I got my appendix taken out up the the end of season 2 and had to wait like 5 months for 3 :<

The show is wonderful to marathon. I only started the show from Season 1 halfway through Season 3 airing. Sports anime are great for marathons.
>> ARTICLE
I discovered it just after the first season finished ive probably marathoned the first season 2 times and the first and seconded seasons 3 times I've never been this addicted to an anime
>> ARTICLE
Same for me, when I got caught up to season 3 I had no idea what to do with myself anymore
>> ARTICLE
That Direct Drive Zone........ Jesus Christ. I had been disappointed by the animation for Akashi's full-team Zone thing, but..... goddamn...

Also, if y'all didn't know, Direct Drive Zone is one of the abilities flashed through in the opening. I was worried people would notice it; I don't actually know if anyone noticed it.

I prefer the manga in a lot of areas, but when they get to shit like this, the anime is far superior.

Ogiwara's appearance and everyone cheering from the crowd was a really nice touch, especially the other GoM members. Plus, [Kuroko being all relieved](http://i.imgur.com/xDn6xTJ.jpg) was great after everything that happened before.

[Other than direct drive Zone being the best thing in this show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vEIDij8Q9k), what's really making the last episodes for me is not *just* the amazing plays, or the fact that there is no big boss, it's just two teams going at it for the sake of competition - It's the way they've managed to bring back everyone from the entire three seasons for the final.

GoM, Kaijo, Seiho, etc all cheering for Kuroko might be the best thing I've ever seen. Hell, even Papa was there. Aomine def had the best lines though.

KUROKO NO SPAAAACEE JAAAAAM 

BOOOOM SHAKALAKALAKA!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand why kuroko guards the gate....wat
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko (and by extension, Kuroko/Seirin's style of basketball) depends on teamwork to make things happen. In order to achieve the perfect teamwork you have to be on the level of understanding that Kuroko has with each of his team mates.

It *could* have been an entire team, but Kuroko is just a stand in for the idea of perfect teamwork. He can be inserted with any good players and help make them better, which is why he guards the gate for both Kagami and Aomine.
>> ARTICLE
My interpretation is that Aomine, because he doesn't trust others to help him succeed, interprets the person at the gate as a "gatekeeper," someone who is guarding the gate. However, in reality, you have to accept the person at the gate and become part of a team. Kagami realizes he shouldn't be antagonistic towards the gatekeeper, because the gatekeeper isn't guarding the gate, but is instead welcoming you into the gate.

Thought we will see Seirin do a twenty point spirit bomb or something. haha.

Great episode. Everyone talking about that team zone but my favorite was the early part where it got misty and Kagami just noticed the different aura Akashi was sending out. That really got me hyped up for the rest of the episode. And it was capped off by Akashi shooting that jumper in the end. 

7 point lead. Less than 40 seconds to go. Let's see if we get SSJ 4 Kagami. :D

I may be drunk as fuck but what the fuck when I saw the score and Seirin was in offensive I saw the score at 103 - 99 then suddenly they said but if they can defend they can win this but then suddenly the other team has the ball and scores. Shouldnt the second score table show 103 - 101 ???

Also, cheering gives you powers, fucking warriors at oracle must give them super powers.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone make a stitch gif of both the direct drive zone of kagami passing both akashi and doing that dunk
>> ARTICLE
It's hilarious how everyone's is all fuck Rakuzan go Seirin! Seems a little biased, no?


>> ARTICLE
Longest 5 Minutes ever ok there was a break inbetween but still
>> ARTICLE
Then think about how next episode is gonna be 40 seconds of game.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be soooooooooooooo suprised if this game ends on a buzzer beater
>> ARTICLE
they explain 'being in the zone' so weirdly. it's like lightning eyes = "OH HES TOTALLY FOCUSED NOW" 

guess that's what I get for watching a basketball anime. love it nonetheless. the team zone thing was pretty sweet.
>> ARTICLE
I like how the true form of the zone is everyone focused and working together and it's not are really an individual power up but a team one where everyone synchronizes and becomes the perfect team. In a way it's a full team zone.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's kind of weird how everyone in the arena can instantly tell when someone is in the zone as if they can see what we see. And how they also all know the names of everyone's signature moves, even if they were just invented (like quasi-emperor eye).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's pretty retarded. Kagami's eyes start flashing and Aoimine is already like "That bastard, he did it. He's in the zone" I'm like wtf he didn't do anything except makes is eyes gleam. The spectator scenes are the worst next to do the slow downs with close ups on characters faces and reactions, IT KILLS ALL MOMENTUM. 

I'm not saying they shouldn't show the spectators as it's a helpful device to let the audience know what's going on in the game at a deeper level but KnB overuses it. Each time someone makes any action we have to see 50 comments from people on the sidelines. Slam Dunk still remains the best basketball anime because of this and other qualities that make it shine. 

Sorry for the shitty rant I just don't have anyone else to tell. Maybe I should make a video.
>> ARTICLE
It's just a visual marker. I think most people have at some point experienced what it's like to be in the zone.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I used to play for my school team for a few years. I can relate to the feeling of your team firing all cylinders with you. It's something else man.
>> ARTICLE
I love that stuff though.

My favorite is dude talking on the bench only for a guy in the bleachers to answer him. Does everyone in Kuroko have super hearing?
>> ARTICLE
Haizaki is always licking his finger because he is so salty. 
>> ARTICLE
It looks so stupid when he licks his finger. I don't understand it. 
>> ARTICLE
"He can probably only do it for 5 minutes", what a coincidence. :D

Wow Aomine doesn't give a fuck, good thing too, that asshat had it coming.


>> ARTICLE
I feel like it is good progression for him and I actually like him as a character ever since he lost.
 
>> ARTICLE
Seems like with every member of the GoM that Seirin beats, the person they beat improves dramatically as a character. Kise and Aomine are probably the best examples of this, but this also applies to Midorima and Murasakibara.
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked Kise throughout the series. But I also marathoned it over the weekend so maybe I have a different perspective.


>> ARTICLE
especially after this episode Kise really grew on me as a character
>> ARTICLE
Apparently it applies to Haizaki as well (the not throwing away his shoes bit), although it wasn't canon.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe we see him in Extra game again. That would be awesome
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about that too. Haizaki not giving up on basketball paves the way for him to be part of Team Vorpal Swords. The Jabberwock team probably has serious moves that are on par with the GoMs', but I bet their showy streetball moves from chapter one can be pillaged by Haizaki. It'd be funny to see them try to show off in the same way only to find their moves pillaged by Haizaki. Narrative wise, it'll be a great way to make the Jabberwock team go from mocking to taking the protagonists seriously.
>> ARTICLE
Kise's second ability: Become an entire team of prodigies for 5 minutes. 

So basically at that point it was 9 v 5. 

Haizaki got absolutely rekt by Kise and Aomine, and I guess you could count Akashi in the past too. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah it was really ominous when he "scary people" the camera zoomed in on Akashi.

I cant wait to see him play.
>> ARTICLE
I think this second ability is equal to Aomine and Kagami's "In the Zone"
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what Kise is going to be like when he enters the zone
>> ARTICLE
I actually wish that was him entering the zone. It didn't make sense for him to be so down in the dumps with a hidden ability like that.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he knew it existed until it happened

the names for mobes and attacks just kind of happen on the fly so I am not sure
>> ARTICLE
It looked as if he was like, on the borderline of going "In the Zone", but I guess there really is no need to waste all that energy on trash like Haizaki, is there? We'll probably see it in the next game. HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
6 minutes
>> ARTICLE
But he will force himself into that state for an extra second and get a slam dunk at the end to win the match.

Well, that will happen if I base this on most Shonen fights.
>> ARTICLE
Is it normal for a (Japanese) middle school to have an open incinerator for students to just walk up to and use?  I found that part a bit odd.

Also, dat 1HKO.  Was hoping for Aomine to land one, and he did.
>> ARTICLE
Was really worried they were going to try and avoid that. Glad he just smacked him.
>> ARTICLE
I think so. I've seen other anime that have this kind of thing. Usually, there's a scene where some students are doing some sort of school duties/chores and they have to throw some stuff into the incinerator. It's just a culture difference thing.
>> ARTICLE
Oh!  Well OK, then.  I'll believe ya (I forgot it was shown with a chimney, as another commenter pointed out).
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was just a dumpster that he lit on fire.
>> ARTICLE
But it had a chimney, do dumpsters in japan have chimneys?
>> ARTICLE
That might be where the trash is coming from.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, OK.  That makes sense.  Seems like a 2edgy Haizaki thing to do..
>> ARTICLE
Akashi hype next week. That foreshadowing scene though when Haizaki was talking about scarier guys out there.
>> ARTICLE
Midorima vs Akashi next. So hyped
>> ARTICLE
Best Winter Cup match, get hyped.
>> ARTICLE
Lol you having a smoke man, the Touou and Yosen games were hella good.
>> ARTICLE
Aomine finally punched him! Somebody had to, ty Aomine.

The second half of the match seemed a little bit rushed, I hope that means we'll get much more intense and cool matches ahead, even though there are only 3 left. That's like 7 episode for one game, huh.
>> ARTICLE
There is also a fairly long arc other than the rest of the matches.  (that's as far as i'll go with no spoiler tags)
>> ARTICLE
Do you think there will be enough content in the manga for a (good) fourth season?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like there is a bit too much to fit into the third season, but I don't think it'd be enough to justify a fourth season. My guess is that some stuff will just get rushed through so it can get to the end of the manga this season. Plus [Manga spoilers](/s In the ending Akashi has two red eyes and is in the Rakuzan uniform, which doesn't happen until fairly close to the end of the last game, which makes me think that they will animate until that point, and therefore to the end.) I'm not sure if my spoiler text worked, I can never tell on my phone. If it didn't let me know and I'll delete it. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga spoiler worked. And thanks, I wonder how they'll do it.
>> ARTICLE
Kise needs nerfing he is too fucking OP also we finally get to see Akashi in action
>> ARTICLE
his injury is his nerf I think. The next game he will hurt himself from exhaustion or something
>> ARTICLE
I'm worried Rakuzan's going to be good enough to stop Midorima without Akashi
>> ARTICLE
I think he will play but i really want to see what he can do. I really don't think Akashi will be a good match up for Kuroko or Kagami because his strength isn't brute force or skill. 
>> ARTICLE
[Akashi spoiler](/s "He alone is enough to go up against those two.")
>> ARTICLE
[Akashi spoiler](/s "Akashi is enough to go against Seiren's entire team, he's a monster.")
>> ARTICLE

[Akashi spoiler](/s "I don't really have a spoiler but I felt left out.")
>> ARTICLE
Decided to only read your spoiler. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one disturbed by the fact that Haizaki stated he dumped Kise's girl after he banged her? Wasn't that like... the 2nd year of middle school?

Social context for this entire series would have made a lot more sense if this was college basketball and the past all happened in high school.
>> ARTICLE
Well it wouldn't be the norm by any account, but you may have too innocent a view of the world if you think there aren't kids out there having sex. I remember a lot of talk of sexual escapades when I was in second level, between people around the ages of 13 or 14. I didn't, but there was definitely a bit of it going on.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he was 14 at that time, pretty weird.
>> ARTICLE
2nd year of middle school in Japan is like the last year of middle school in the US, which is usually occupied by 13 year olds. I'm not saying It's normal for people to be active at that age but it wouldn't be a first in a lot of places. Keep in mind he's a pretty sketchy guy.
>> ARTICLE
Kids grow up pretty fast these day
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, look at Bobby Shmurda. He's been selling crack since the fifth grade.
>> ARTICLE
"He looks like a middle-schooler" That line gave me a chuckle.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's anime, so everything is hyperbolized. Be honest, what fucking middle schoolers look like these mother fucking giants.


Edit: Or rather GF fucking
>> ARTICLE
I just write them off as college students. I almost feel like the whole middle school thing was a misprint or a running gag. They looked sorta HS ish by their "end of middle school" flashbacks, and certainly college level now. I bet the writer(s) just threw that in to screw with people, it would weigh on your soul throughout every episode, nagging at you going "These don't look like HS students at all!"
>> ARTICLE
Well Prince of tennis is even worse, they are all just middleschoolers
>> ARTICLE
I think they just made it middle school/high school so more readers could relate to the manga, I'm pretty sure the author thinks of them as high school/college but is using the ms/hs to have more readers.
>> ARTICLE
He must have pillaged some nifty moves from porn stars.
>> ARTICLE
KISE <3
>> ARTICLE
He licks his fingers so much it becomes silly, and the actual motion seems awkward.
>> ARTICLE
This show keeps getting stupider and stupider by the minute and I love it. Also I was kinda expecting Thumblicking-kun to win and Kuroko avenging Kise for it.
>> ARTICLE
yea I learned to stop treating it as a shounen about basketball and more like a basketball themed Shounen if that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
exactly. i'm aware of the stupidity of the show, regardless this show was still entertaining lol.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind all the OP at all I actually love it!
>> ARTICLE
The pillaging moves was completely fucking ridiculous 
>> ARTICLE
Among all the absolutely ridiculous things in this show, that one makes the least amount of sense. It's the only thing that's bothered me so far so I'm glad he only got like two episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought it was one of the things that made more sense.

The Hawk-eye thing is something that makes no sense at all. I think they had a pretty good explanation for this one.
>> ARTICLE
Hawk eye is spacial awareness
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in fact hawk eye is one of the things I think is actually realistic in this anime. My HS teams point guard is really good at this.
>> ARTICLE
You need good eyesight and spatial awareness to be a good point guard. Thought it was kind of silly how they took an attribute every competitive point guard has and gave it a name. At least with Murasakibara, they didn't give his insane defensive abilities a name.

We know Akashi plays point guard, so I'm guessing he has some ridiculous version of Eagle/Hawk Eye. Either that or he has perfect ball control and can't be stopped while driving.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it made no sense, he slightly changes the rhythm so original users can't use them...okay? Then again this is shonen
>> ARTICLE
It makes sense to me because rhythm is important in basketball, the thing that makes it exaggerated and a GOM move is the fact that they can't use it the whole game. A quick time out can give you time to regain your rhythm.
>> ARTICLE
Don't you guys think that the consistent full court three pointers are even more bullshit?
>> ARTICLE
They are, but pillaging moves is utter ridiculous, in other news I don't understand how midorima can lose a game, just 4 man block the best jumper and pass to midorima whenever they get the ball, it's so easy. 
>> ARTICLE
This may be a spoiler (not sure if it is though but just in case) [Midorima's 3s](/s "He only has a limited number of shots he can take from far outside the line because it puts an immense toll on his body, like it would to anyone else shooting from that far out")
>> ARTICLE
[Basket Ball in general spoilers](/s "Even 15 shots is a ridiculous amount of points if all of them are threes. You could just sub him out after he gets tired and you'll have a huge advantage. You could also let him rest for a long time and bring him in 4th quarter.")
>> ARTICLE
But you fail to realize, it takes a hell of a long time for Midorima to wind up for the half to full court shots, allowing an athletic guy like Kagami to catch up to him and block it.  Akashi also has his own way of stopping Midorima.
>> ARTICLE
>  Akashi also has his own way of stopping Midorima.

Are you a Manga reader or was it said in the anime? Because it wasn't shwon yet iirc and I do not remember a scene where this is said.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno I mean it could partially be explained, think of the psychological pressure that puts on you to see your "unique" move be used by someone so easily, especially when you're already being slammed pretty hard by the other team. Essentially it just seems to really hit their psyche and moral, they think they can't do it anymore, so they can't. Kinda like the placebo effect.
>> ARTICLE
I get that but the way it was explained wasn't that great,never so slightly change the rhythm so they can't use the move, how does him barely making a visual change in their move make them unable to do the move to?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the explanation doesn't make a lot of sense at all, but it could always be something lost in translation? I'm just trying to think of a way it makes sense, cos it really doesn't make sense with how we know it :p
>> ARTICLE
Plus what you said is nice and all but if it's like that then kise pillages moves as well, either way it's a shonen don't question it and just see kuroko predictably win
>> ARTICLE
Ofc, we all know the destination we just like the scenery along the way :p
>> ARTICLE
This match wasn't all that great to be honest.. BUT HEY WHO CARES? AKASHI AKASHI AKASHI!
>> ARTICLE
That was really anti climatic
>> ARTICLE
It didn't seem that way in the manga. Choosing to rush the perfect copy part of the match while expanding on the other parts could be the reason why the ending seemed anti-climatic.
>> ARTICLE
You might be misremembering, but the Perfect Copy is only covered in a single chapter of the game, which is actually quite short.
>> ARTICLE
True, but it's still weird to see them expand on almost every part of the match except the main highlight.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, when the guys go into the zone they get at least half an episode of them completely wrecking/going at each other. Kise's was just him talking, making a three pointer, and then getting his foot stepped on. I got so hyped when he did the three pointer, then got let down :(
>> ARTICLE
I read every into I. The manga after season 2 ended except this match, cos I liked kise and wanted to be surprised, kinda let down tho. 
>> ARTICLE
God this Anime makes me wanna play basketball from all the hype

Embrace me bro, we'll just pretend we're excellent basketballers while watching and one day, with the power of friendship and determination, we will get over our sadness 
>> ARTICLE
Kise finally did it and I'm glad Haizaki got what he deserved.
>> ARTICLE
I freaking love this opening, it really gets you hyped for the episode.

And how adorable was it that Kuroko's little cheer was enough for Kise to turn around and take the game! That was so satisfying. 

Can't wait to finally see Akashi play now.
>> ARTICLE
Damn i was supposed to wait for the anime to end then watch it... Oh well i will drop it now and rewatch it when its done so i will have all the hype within me!!
>> ARTICLE
PILLAGED, I MEAN WTF, ITS EASIER TO SAY STEAL LIKE IN THE MANGA _  
>> ARTICLE
The latter half of the episode seemed really rushed. I'm not a reader so I don't know if it was that quick in the manga but it ends on Kise just going 'welp, time to pull out the big guns'.

They kind of just throw in that Haizaki can't copy the Generation of Miracles too. Sustained half court threes still sounds ridiculous but then again, one of them can basically turn invisible soo...

Looking forward to seeing Big Boss Akashi in action.
>> ARTICLE
It's really not that rushed in terms of adaption. The game in the manga is literally three chapters long. The game basically ends when Kise does the thing.
>> ARTICLE
Manga reader here and this arc definitely felt a bit rushed. There was more build up so it didn't seem like Kise just decided to get serious all of a sudden.
>> ARTICLE
Cant watch daisuki in belgium :(
>> ARTICLE
daisuke in Belgium? confused belgian here..

Daisuke is a website you can watch the episodes on if you look at the post^^

It's really odd that Crunchy doesn't have Kuroko 3. I mean, like, come on. I WANT TO SEE MY BISHONEN BASKETBALL PLAYERS LEGALLY AND ON MY CHROMECAST CRUNCHY WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US
>> ARTICLE
They do have it, just not as a simulcast. It's 2 weeks behind the Japanese release.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me sad that next episode is the last time Aomine [not really spoiler but w/e](/s "will have any real involvement in the story anymore besides courtside commentating. I'll miss him, he was my favorite character")
>> ARTICLE
wait what?!... aw man... that seems quite annoying...
>> ARTICLE
PERFECT COPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Sucks that Haizaki woulda won if he didn't try to 1v5. Didn't want Kise to win :(
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know the reason CR is 2 episodes behind? Guessing licensing shenanigans?
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko voice escalated quickly kappa
>> ARTICLE
Great lil plot point (Kise vs Haizaki) over the few episodes I think, it's nice to see some great scenes and plot put into matches not involving Kuroko's team, rather than them just being short filler with a lil plot like they usually are.

Is anyone else starting to get annoyed with the opening about the Generation of Miracles each episode? I mean, we're on the 3rd season now, I'm pretty sure people know about them by now.
>> ARTICLE
I love knb, but it's so slow paced and drawn out.  I don't feel any excitement at all during the matches, and I'm not feeling any tension either.
>> ARTICLE
If you think this is drawn out, you'd hate to watch Ace of Diamond
>> ARTICLE
Or Slam Dunk. Dat Sakuragi free throw episode...
>> ARTICLE
SAKURAGI!
>> ARTICLE
I thought the Fukuda/Kaijo match felt a bit rushed, but I'm guessing it's because of the remaining matches. Especially given how they normally pace things lol.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the first season had the best rate of pacing so far.  Season 2 had 2 matches in 24 eps, which I thought was ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
4 matches. Shutoku match. Kirisaki Daichi match. Touou match. Yosen match. There's also a few matches that last a single episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm betting S3 will be like S2 again, but I've only read the ~~comic~~ *edit: manga sry* up til Haizaki appearing so there might be more to it.
>> ARTICLE
There will most likely be a season 4 at this rate. The farthest I see them getting is the kise vs kagami game.
>> ARTICLE
Side note, caught up a bit with the manga and the Fukuda match plays out pretty much the same.
>> ARTICLE
Really? This past match was a lot faster paced than the ones from last season.
>> ARTICLE
wait till you see the next matches (Kise vs Kagami and Kuroko/Akashi vs Midorima). I guarantee you'll feel more tension in those games! 
>> ARTICLE
I already read the entire manga, so I know what to expect.  Initially, I was looking forward to those matches.... but now, I don't know if the adaptation will live up to my hopes.  It's not enough for me to drop the show, but I'll just skip a lot more scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I think for me, it comes down to how they deal with the flashbacks to Teiko. Seems as though they're doing a good job so far in my eyes!
>> ARTICLE
Wait did Kise just get NTR'd.  
I already despise Haizaki from the last episode but damn..!

Another episode, another cliffhanger ending...Never change, Kuroko!

It will be worth, next episode is one of my favorites from the manga

I agree, it's going to be amazing!

Hey, it still sucks if you just finished right now after two days.

They should just rename the show to Kuroko's cliffhanger

and during all the breaks apparently

Btw. can't get enough of [baby Kuroko] (http://i.imgur.com/5WpwP1b.png) too fuckin' cute.

lol so chubby!

Closest thing I found to a Murasakibara baby, after searching, was [this fanart](http://i.imgur.com/lJXqai6.jpg), which looks more adorable than scary.

That random NTR
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy just wait till next ep.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else feel like a scene was missing?

I mean they transitioned from half time to Kise lying on the ground, apparently on the brink of losing
>> ARTICLE
I assume they will explain what went on in the next episode and was shown like that for the episode ending/cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, felt like a bit of a jarring transition, but I think it was meant to imply that Kise wasn't able to avoid what had happened in the flashback to happening again in the present. I'm sure that'll change in the next episode. I really hate this Haizaki guy.
>> ARTICLE
He even took his girlfriend :(
>> ARTICLE
When did it show she was Kise's gf?
>> ARTICLE
In the flashback, one of the players watching the game said something like "Isn't that Kise's new girlfriend?"
>> ARTICLE
oh well..
>> ARTICLE
Next episode will be a treat, let me tell you that :)
>> ARTICLE
So he's probably going to the 'zone'?
>> ARTICLE
I don't see that Kise has what it takes to enter the Zone yet. I'm pretty sure he'll be like "I haven't shown you my true strength yet" or *power unlock via determination* and his copy will far surpass that of this new guy.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good possibility! We will see who was right :D
>> ARTICLE
Mine was the right one :P
>> ARTICLE
Damn :P :D , did you see the manga or was it just obvious? Either way Kise owned him easiy
>> ARTICLE
No, I haven't read the manga. It wasn't that obvious, but I over thought it. Kise isn't ready for the Zone when he didn't perfect his own main technique as a part of the GoM. I think it was implied somewhere that he couldn't enter the Zone himself, and he stated that he doesn't understand it well, and you need to love Basketball. Kise is a role model too :p
>> ARTICLE
Don't want to ruin it for you, just know that it'll be well worth the wait.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, i wonder just what else secret attack he has or sth
>> ARTICLE
One week to wait for the next episode is clearly too much
>> ARTICLE
In all honesty, if you're the kind of person who absolutely can't stand cliffhangers, I'd wait for the series to finish before watching it. I discovered I have absolutely no patience while reading the manga, and the anime is gonna keep going the Cliffhanger which Kuroko Plays route.
>> ARTICLE
The irregular shot at kaijo high?
>> ARTICLE
Even though I've read the manga every episode still gives me the chills. So good!
>> ARTICLE
I got chills from the flashbacks and I've rewatched the first 2 seasons 3 times. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for next episode, it's gonna be awesome
>> ARTICLE
So, the Fukuda Sogo team has a Kiyoshi clone on it. Akashi's out of place wink during the lunch flashback was also very seductive.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a wink, you'll see in a bit.

>> ARTICLE
If you are talking about his one eye being a different color, they already showed that in season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but they didn't show why or when
>> ARTICLE
It will be explained later.
>> ARTICLE
I was joking. Unless I'm missing it, are you talking about it foreshadowing boku Akashi?
>> ARTICLE
I dont know :) *wink*
>> ARTICLE
Was searching to see what the mini-Kiyoshi was about (he looks shorter, thus the mini), but noone else seems to mention it. Why do they look so similar? I wonder if it's like that in the manga, too.
>> ARTICLE
His name is Hideki Ishida. They don't bear as much of a similarity in the manga as they do in the anime: [Hideki](https://36.media.tumblr.com/b50034b44c8d5e4e577e4145786a7e4c/tumblr_nicb0jSZyo1s0ru8fo1_250.png) vs [Kiyoshi](http://40.media.tumblr.com/fce50149dcfc7aa2b74fcc780b60047b/tumblr_nicb0jSZyo1s0ru8fo2_1280.png). I think it's just a bit of laziness on the show's part, tbh, but I'd like to believe they're clones. 
>> ARTICLE
You are right. From those, it seems it's the eyebrows in the anime that makes them look so similar (though he still looks shorter even if they weren't in the same scene together) : [Hideki](http://i.imgur.com/gnrFzXa.jpg) - [Kiyoshi](http://i.imgur.com/kaipO2V.png).  

>> ARTICLE
I hate these totally over the top asshole kind of characters, just feels somewhat cheap and I hoped they were through with it after kirisaki.

Nevertheless good match so far and I always like to see generation of miracles flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe there will be some explanation for this. Probably not. But a few more episodes with him will definitely make him one of my most hated characters.
>> ARTICLE
I may be the only one but I love these assholes. It's a nice opposition from the goody goodyness of Kuroko and the others. Can't wait to see Akashi play for this reason.

As someone who's read the manga you're in for big ass flashback later on.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda hope they skip over the flashback and OVA it instead
>> ARTICLE
No way bruh, the flashback is gonna be great.

It'll also kill me, but it'll be great.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty awesome flashback though =D
>> ARTICLE
So who do I hate more... Haizaki or Hanamiya?
>> ARTICLE
Hanamiya is a dick hole, but hey, he's a dick hole with an actual goal.

Haizaki is just a cunt to everybody for the shits and the gigs.

Personally though, I hate Hanamiya, solely because he injured Kiyoshi and I love Kiyoshi.
>> ARTICLE
Hanamiya's strategy was an actual strategy.

Haizaki is just an asshole.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, imo, Haizaki is a lot more watchable than Hanamiya. Look at dat animation.
>> ARTICLE
The animation for the Kaijo captain's drive was so slick.
>> ARTICLE
If kise's team wins this in the 4th quarter ill be so sad...wanna see seirin destroy them

Haizaki really has a thing for his own hand.

[](/pointandlaugh)

This episode was done very well, I already hate Haizaki! (just like in the manga, you immediately despise the guy)

Oh man, in the manga, I didn't quite get the severity of his cuntiness to his teammates. As Kasamatsu said, even Hanamiya (who was the ultimate asshole and person I hate most in the manga) values his teammates.

It's a team sport, for fuck's sake. 
>> ARTICLE
Freaking cliffhangers man, they hurt so much.
>> ARTICLE
Arghhh bloody hell waiting a week for each episode is going to be the death of me.

I love all the players on Kaijo, especially rebound-guy, so I really want them to win against Haizaki dammit! I already despise him. What kind of asshole slaps their own senpai (when he looks like Voldemort)?
>> ARTICLE
Oh man what an episode!!
>> ARTICLE
Man and I thought that Kirisaki guy was an asshole, now Haizuki was just born to be hated. I mean, guy's literally an asshole in every aspect of life. At least the Kirisaki guy didn't hurt his own team mates or steal any girls. They were unfair asshole players, but they played unfairly as a team.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this series is so awesome it gets me pregnant 
>> ARTICLE
Haven't even watched it yet but still already like it
>> ARTICLE
Am i the only one who thinks that Haizaki licking his sweating fingers is just nasty, also [that girlfriend steal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6oy92KUYqM)
>> ARTICLE
officially im waiting untill the whole anime is over. Cant wait 1 week every episode, cause cliffhanger... Its just too much!! So cya untill the final episode!
>> ARTICLE
I should do the same as you, but manga reader here and also I have no patience.

Hurrah for masochism!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really have any opinion about Haizaki in the manga BUT JESUS CHRIST HE'S SO ANNOYING IN THE ANIME
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but I think Kise and Kaijo will lose, and it'll be Seirin who kicks Haizaki's ass... and it'll be glorious.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was amazingly well animated, I'd really love to see some of the plays in 60 fps!
>> ARTICLE
Pillaging moves and girlfriends. Haizaki, you're a well written scumbag.
>> ARTICLE
Cant wait to watch the 4th quarter of this game
>> ARTICLE
Damn if they already take this long for this rather short match in the manga I cant even imagine how many episodes the final match will take.   
They will probably start a whole new season just for this match if they continue with this pace.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure it'll wrap up in the next episode.

What comes next, another match or the Flashback arc? I can't remember.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi vs Midorima (forgot their team names)
>> ARTICLE
My favourite match of the Winter Cup.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of my favorites, shows how much of a difference in power between the two.
>> ARTICLE
I like it more just because it shows how much Midorima has grown as a character.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh yes, thank you
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know if the manga will be fully adapted eventually?
>> ARTICLE
At this point it'd be silly if they wouldn't.

This is the final tournament and iirc correctly we only have 3 big games to go after this one. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol, in the manga, the serialization of the last game spanned for more than a year. It was *so much fun*.
>> ARTICLE
especially the last few chapters omg...literlly ONE chatper every TWO weeks for like 6 pages  which translated PER POSSESSION  it was hell...its over now...good series.

though i still like diamond no ace and haiykuu  (even though i am a huge fantasybasketball nerd)
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is the shit, but I have learnt my lesson. The manga is currently in the middle of match, I stopped reading right before and will happily enjoy a cliffhanger-free ride.
>> ARTICLE
I for one, really enjoy Haizaki's character and think he has a great voice actor too!
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see some nice plays from Kaijo players. You tend to forget there are some good players aside from GoM and Seirin.
>> ARTICLE
Nahhh the flashback is after the semifinals. 
The next match is Akashi vs Midorima :) 
>> ARTICLE
Did they forget that Akashi has different colored pupils? Or is it gonna be like Kakashi from Naruto?

I like this episode. I like seeing Teiko flashbacks. I hate Haizaki more.

I disagree, because [Manga Spoilers](/s "he won't be playing anymore. I agree that this will be an awesome moment, but thats it. If you don't like Aomine now, then you won't like him in the future because he won't do anything amazing besides punching Haizaki and the tears at the final match.")

I still kind of find his ability (or at least the portrayal of his ability) kind of ridiculous. He just sharingans the opponent and they trip. It just looks so silly in action. Like at least have him do a cross over.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as many others have said, they sort of glossed over in its explanation here in the anime compared to when it's revealed in the manga.  However, I would be lying if I said it wasn't a bit outlandish in either adaption
>> ARTICLE
That's what I don't like about it as well. Even though we're talking about Kuroko no basket it just looks so inapplicable in real life. A simple cross over would have made more natural and seemingly possible.
>> ARTICLE
It's okay, I've got the best strategy to deal with it. I've just gotta stand still, he won't make me trip then

You've got this basketball thing all figured out, don't ya?

I might be crazy. And this might be borderline spoiler, just because it makes crazy sense.

[Cray Cray](/s "I think the white haired guy might have the same ability as Kuroko, because of how he is never mentioned and Kuroko's ability isn't exactly a Generation of Miracles type of power, so Akashi might have trained him in some way since he knew Kuroko from Teiko.")

[More Cray Cray Theorising That Is A Potential Spoiler, Even Though I Haven't Read The Manga](/s "I was just thinking the exact same thing! Could be that he turns out to be Kuroko's foil, or a similar but distinct variant of his style of play. Interesting how they made a point of him being barely noticeable. Even when he looked around in shock after he got dribbled past during the double-team, his face was mostly masked in shadow as if the creators were going ''THIS GUY IS MYSTERIOUS. WHO COULD HE BE? I WONDER WHAT HIS POWERS ARE lol''. Seriously though, I'm fully convinced that's what he is.")

I debated mentioning this and decided it would be more fun to have people notice it later.
>> ARTICLE
Is he like Kuroko's evil basketball doppelganger or something? Judging by how unnoticeable he was, it has the same feeling as Kuroko's style of play. Really cool way of subtly introducing his character, if so. When he was one of the guys doing the double-team for Akashi's plan to stop Midorima touching the ball, I was like "Who is this guy...was I meant to not have noticed him playing until now?" But then I just assumed he wasn't an important character. Reminds me of how Saekano deals with Kato's character. Kagami vs Akashi and Kuroko vs Silver-Hair?
>> ARTICLE
This has to be it - you have a team with the GoM's captain and three of the 6th-10th best high school players in the country, the fifth guy has to be special in some way. Akashi has been dropping lines about how he was the one who 'noticed' Kuroko's abilities, wouldn't be surprised if silver-haired guy (his name is Mayuzumi according to the Rakuzan line-up thing) was also noticed in the same way.

He looks a lot taller than Kuroko is, which makes me think he might have a different style of misdirection (maybe he scores a lot more, his position is listed as PF).

The manga one "Know your place". I'll check to see what CR subbed it add when they get to it.

Same. "Know your place" makes an even greater impact as if he's commanding peasants to get a reality check.

Couldnt help thinking of haikyuu this episode, so many parallels between Midorima + Takao and [Haikyuu Ep.4?] (/s "Hinata + Kageyama"), had me smiling the instant I saw their pass + shoot.

Akashi is too OP, I wonder what else we'll see from him in the future. Also, I'd be curious to see a match between him and Tokuchi (from One Outs), if they could play the same sport/game.
>> ARTICLE
Eh Akashi is too good of an athlete, I do believe Tokuchi would be smarter than him however, but Akashi's opness is just too strong. [minor spoilers for championship game](/s "he fucking dunks the ball, and he is 5'8, which is just 2 inches taller than kuroko. thats some fucking athletic ability. I'm 5'11 and can only JUST BARELY dunk a tennis ball")

He is actually 5'7".

On the wiki it says he's 5'8, where are you getting that from?

So Midorima found the unyielding tenacity to stand up after having his ankles broken and pride wounded, and while an epic soundtrack played in the background, he had a great internal monologue about not giving up, and then proceeded to  scream "AKASHIIII!!!!!". Seriously, just the way it was animated made it one of the best moments in KnB anime ever, for me anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first time he got back up was up there with the best moments in it. Watching him go from his usual calm to that was beast. Really made me think Shutoku could win it for a moment. Edit: Even though we've known Rakuzan will be end boss since the first season. We can but dream.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that tactic was awesome , but Akashi seems unstoppable , these semifinal match was really cool and quite long also lets see how the rest of the season plays out.
>> ARTICLE
>Really cool and quite long

Holy shit, this match is nothing length-wise when compared to the last match. I wouldn't be surprised if it took up 10+ episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
thats some naruto length fight time
>> ARTICLE
It takes Kagami 3 episodes to do one move.

No jk but how DBZ would that be lol
>> ARTICLE
Dbz was only 276 episodes long, js.

It wasn't *that* bad.
>> ARTICLE
I see it going this way; this match was 1/4 (6 episode), next match will also be 1/4 (6 episode) and the final will be 1/2 (12 episode) and the extra 2 episodes either as in betweens or just distributed somewhere

Nah, there's probably going to be another arc that's going to be after the next match but before the last one.

Well, we got to see the eye of the 5th player from Rakuzan. I still believe he's bound to be a counter to Kuroko.

Anyway, Seirin vs. Kaijo hype. I feel it's gonna be amazing.

That would make perfect sense. This entire time i'm thinking that Kuroko, being the person no body can predict, is going to counter Akashi. But i sure as hell doubt it would be that simple.

Akashi is starting to get ridiculous and from what I have heard the next two matches are also going to be ridiculous...
>> ARTICLE
The best episode of the season thus far!!!

>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me, but Akashi has a similar vibe to Oikawa Tooru from Aobajosai in Haikyuu!!
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that Oikawa is more similar to early season 1 Kise. They both have that facetious and sarcastic vibe about them.

In a way Oikawa is kinda like Murasakibara too. He doesn't care about it that much, he's damn good and if you piss him off you'll probably pay for it in-game :p

He IS better than everyone. And of course Kuroko and Kagami are gonna beat him, its a fucking shounen, not to mention that Akashi is the endboss.
>> ARTICLE
But he is better than everyone... lol.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno man, I reckon there will be others that are better.(haven't read the manga, so there might be) And i honestly don't see what is so good about his ability. Can't you just do some unpredictable shit? I honestly thought Shutoku were going to beat Rakuzan..
>> ARTICLE
his power is more along the lines of seeing the way somebody moves their muscles, and then instantly predicting what they're going to do. Take that power, and throw it on top of an already great basketball player and a mastermind, and you have something close to akashi. So far, i'm thinking the only way to beat him, is to do some improvisation on the spot that he can't account for. Let alone, whatever it is has to have a 0% chance of being stopped. 
>> ARTICLE
Well its not as easy as just doing something unpredictable because he sees what you're going to do as soon as you decide to do it. 
>> ARTICLE
Because the human anatomy is restricted. What Akashi can do is see how your muscles contract and expand to deduce the direction you want to go at the specific point in time. Unless you decide to pull an unhumanly fake to go right and then go left, it's almost too impossible to fake him.
>> ARTICLE
You really thought after they hyped up and held akashi in a shroud of mystery the entire first season they would lose in their first game? ha

Akashi really did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3X6Fn37Prg) Jason Williams pass from back in the day. Instantly recognized it when I saw it!

Well, Akashi is only 5cm taller than Kuroko. But it's more Akashi's eye can predict movements and the like.

Akashi still couldn't stop him because if he touched his arm it would be a foul
>> ARTICLE
wont work. just double team him with another of the generals and he is down... and btw dont think you know his power (except when you have read the manga and even then i wouldnt be too sure about it :D)
>> ARTICLE
Well something along these lines was to be expected, concerning Akashi's power. I wonder if it would work against Aomine/someone in the zone.

 I'm positive that shutoku will score with their "trump card", but I doubt it'll make a difference.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that the weakness to the eye is that sometimes it doesn't matter if he can predict what will happen if his opponent can get around him anyway (aka Aomine and Yagami going into the zone.  Maybe Kuroko can avoid detection?  No idea how he will play into it).  Here's my prediction for the next few episodes: I am guessing Shutoku will lose this match and Seiren will win their next one so we can see Yagami/Kuroko vs Akashi in the finals.  During this game, they'll probably start by Seiren losing but post half-time come back with Yagami going into the zone and Kuroko going nuts being the perfect shadow.  Akashi will attempt to use his Emperor's Eye and will see that he loses in all positions or something of that nature.
>> ARTICLE
Chances are we won't see the final game in this season. 
>> ARTICLE
Akashi's an amazing player, there's nothing to say he couldn't too enter the zone. But imagine how amazing Kuroko would be as deception/misdirection if he went into the zone o.o it makes me shudder to think.

Just making sure i got this right, he makes people fall by moving in a certain way that will influence them to make a response move that will make them trip?

You basically just get a persons momentum going one way then instantly start going in the opposite direction causing them to lose balance and fall. If done extremely well you can actually break their ankles

don't know, there's no way akashi give a position to a no-body given in the anime they already explained that akashi's eye is the one that gathers all exceptional players.

So it really is true, someone spoiled his skill for me but I wasn't it was real. Even for KnB this is kinda crazy since the normally try to explain the skills in a way that makes it sound like it could be real. But looking into the damn future, you can't talk you're way out of that.

I mean once you got to the guy who can consistently make half court threes, everything goes out on realism.

I was thinking the same that KnB was lying to itself with akashi's power, i was like "next episode we'll see someone being able to control gravity or wind ", but thanks to you i got the answer below that it isn't presented like this in the manga.

Instead of saying he see's into the future how about instead saying he has no reaction time + being able to read the opponent really well.
>> ARTICLE
But the steal ability from Haizaki is perfect fine lol 
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it it's just really intense focus combined with basketball iq and great vision/awareness which is why he's an excellent point guard.
>> ARTICLE
The anime wording hypes the fuck out of it but all it is is basically a combination of Riko/Takao playing basketball. 

It's the intense kineseological analytic skills of Riko matched a toned player's physique and the highest deduction skills of probably all of high school. (Akashi is known as the smartest of the GoM and I wouldn't be surprised if he was top in Japan as well.)

It isn't much about seeing the future.  The way I see is that he can tell exactly where the player is going with just the slightest movement.  More like a quick reflex.
>> ARTICLE
They kind of skipped the "real" explanation in the Anime, here's the explanation from the Manga : *"Aka-Chin's eyes can detect even the slightest movements. Breathing, heartbeat, sweat, muscle contractions -- Everything."*

So it's not like he can actually see the future and more like he can predict/see the movement of his opponent.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope that they will explain later in the anime
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's like Atobe in Prince of Tennis, with his Atobe Kingdom where he can see his opponent's weakness and where to shot at, right?
>> ARTICLE
So he basically has godly eyesight and reflexes?
>> ARTICLE
He's basically the Sherlock of basketball. Deduces what they're gonna do.

as of now how would u rank the generation of miracles based on team and then based on 1 on 1 abilities?

id say team wise it would go akashi>aomine>kise>murasakibara>midoriyama.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit biased as I read the manga but I'd rank them something along the lines of.

Akashi Seijuurou > Kise Ryota > Aomine Daiki > Midorima Shintaro > Murasakibara Atsushi.

Idk where I'd put Kuroko as his skill is somewhat situational.
>> ARTICLE
how come everyone always puts murasakibara as the bottom or worst.  I think hes a great player and is a beast.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but so are the others, and in my opinion they are even more so. You'll see what I mean when you see Midorima's trump card and Kaijo vs Seirin, not sure who else I could put below him other than Kuroko possibly.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I did read the manga so I knew what'd happen but holy fuck Akashi is badass.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi: chill mode ~~deactivated~~ still activated.
>> ARTICLE
Murasakibara is at least second best of the GOM's.  I would put him above Aomine if he couldn't go into the zone at will.  Remember Mukkun is already the best center, and he's even better at offense.  It took mind games from Kiyoshi and Zone Kagami to handle base Mura.  

Aomine>Murasakibara>Akashi>Kise>Midorima
>> ARTICLE
Agree about Murasakibara being 2nd best. For 40 minutes, outside of the zone, and if you consider both offense and defense, Murasakibara is second only to Akashi. Ignoring Akashi, he's got the best defense. Even Aomine admitted to having trouble scoring against him. His Thor's Hammer is so powerful that it took Kagami in the zone and his monstrous explosive jump power to block it. I seriously don't think Aomine outside the zone has the strength to stop that dunk. Kise is an absolute beast for 10 minutes (PC), but Murasakibara will destroy him in the remaining 30. Aomine can enter the zone at any time, but it drains stamina quickly, so even if you consider the zone, over 40 mins, there's no telling which is the better player overall. I still think Murasakibara has the edge, although it depends on how effectively Aomine can steal the ball while the big guy is posting up. Lastly, let's not forget he can enter the zone too.

Btw, Akashi 3rd? Seriously?
>> ARTICLE
Kise > Akashi > Mura/Aomine > Midorima

Maybe I overrate Kise? But he can copy the emperor eye and everything. Who says he couldn't eventually copy the zone too?
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko and Kagami tag team is probably the only way to beat Akashi and they'll have to be at their best with Kagami in the zone. Akashi is just too much.
>> ARTICLE
Dat Pass O.o

I love how they censor mayuzumi even when they show the playercards :D
>> ARTICLE
I don't get why sports anime have to get sooo ridiculous... seeing the future? Come on..
>> ARTICLE
Actually the anime didn't explain it properly. His eye can detect all the smallest movements. Muscle contractions, heartbeat, pulse etc. He uses those to detect the movements of the opponent
>> ARTICLE
> Muscle contractions, heartbeat, pulse

That's still terribly ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
It got ridiculous the moment Midorima showed up but what did you expect lol, it's a shounen manga not a documentary. 
>> ARTICLE
Seeing the future is an exaggeration. He is just absurdly good at predicting his opponents' movements. The Emperor Eye is just the high level prediction/observation powers of elite sportsmen taken to another level like how Hawk Eye is court vision taken to another level.

I read this book called Bounce and it describes the equivalent of Emperor Eye in detail over an entire chapter. Very good summary of the chapter is written [here.](http://www.blueprinttennis.com/featured/limitless/)

>For table tennis champion Desmond Douglas, he was able to react to cues in his opponents movements to anticipate where they would hit the ball next. He was therefore able to start moving in the right direction much earlier, rather than waiting to see where the ball was going before reacting. In this way, experts find shortcuts that allow them to bypass the normal restrictions imposed by basic physical abilities. Wow! This is probably why the very best are seemingly able to perform super-human feats.

Excerpts from the book itself:

>When Roger Federer returns a fast serve he is not demonstrating faster reactions, but quicker anticipation. He is able to make sharper and more accurate inferences about where the ball is going to go via the movement patterns of his opponent, so that he is in position almost before the ball has been hit. First class cricketers have figured out whether to play off the front or back foot 100 miliseconds before the ball has been bowled. Wayne Gretzky was said to have an incredible ability to skate ahead of the puck, turning up at the right spot before the puck got there.


>It is regular practice that has given them this advantage, not their genes. Federer's advantage has been gathered from experience: more precisely, it has been gained from a painstaking process of encoding the meaning of subtle movement drawn from 10,000 hours of practice and competition. He is able to see patterns in his opponent's movements in the same way that chess players are able to discern the patterns in the arrangement of pieces on a chessboard: the recognition of familiar scenarios and chunking of perceptual information into meaningful wholes and patterns. An expert returners ability to return is not limited by his or her raw reaction time, but instead relies on his or her deep tennis knowledge, which is gained from extensive experience and allows them to read the servers action.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSL-gPMPVXI#t=1056) also attempts to provide insights on how Ronaldo reads the subtle movements of his opponents when dribbling and executing the soccer equivalent of the ankle break.

my favourite scene in any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
That Meteor Jam....that was amazing
>> ARTICLE
That gave me goosebumps, man.

One thing that annoyed me, though, was that when he starts the jump it shows him leading with the ball in his left hand, but in the final shot, where he slams it in, he's using his right hand. Maybe you could say he switched hands mid-air, but that wouldn't make any sense. Just a minor production oversight, I imagine, but it still took me out of what was an otherwise epic moment.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even noticed that until I read your comment. Yeah, it's an oversight.
>> ARTICLE
i didnt notice such oversights in the past. does this happen a lot in the anime?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely. It's also not exclusive with anime. Even top Hollywood movies get the occasional continuity errors when they transition from one scene to another (like a car parked in front that magically disappeared).

In some cases you might even see modern gadgets in medieval movies if you pay close attention.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you'll occasionally get them, but they should be pretty rare in general. Sometimes you'll see a foot that looks the wrong size or an arm that looks like it's bending the wrong way, something like that. It's very hard to slip something like that through post-production, generally, but some stuff gets through. It would usually be very hard to notice in the middle of watching, though. I only noticed it because I went back and replayed the Meteor Jam sequence another two times. =P

This episode triggered me so hard, the hype is already overblown.

Yea, no kidding. I'm going to need a Ventilator for the next 8 episode, because even though I haven't read the manga, I'm expecting them to leave me breathless.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit zone already.
>> ARTICLE
IKR, like how is he expected to hold on to the zone for the entire game.  Hopefully Kagami won't get too burnt out and Seirin and pull a win
>> ARTICLE
Seirin won't win, because Akashi's basketball is absolute!
>> ARTICLE
maybe not, but I bet kuroko's basketball will still beat akashi's once they break his emperor's eye
>> ARTICLE
Of course Kuroko will win with his "bullshit" bascketball... if this anime was about his basketball they would have lost a long time ago. This should be called Kuroko's bullshit victories.
>> ARTICLE
[Last episode spoiler](/s "Don't worry, they will not win. Eat that")
>> ARTICLE
The only victory I don't agree with is the first time Kuroko play's Midorima because there was a lot of point fudging that was never explained and there's no way Midorima wouldn't just start hailing full court threes for the last couple minutes of playing time and yet they say it was down to a one basket game bs. 


That said all the other times it's been teamwork over one prodigy (more or less) and it's not like they've won them all so at least it's reasonable and entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
Most people don't like the Yosen finale either. That victory was only made possible via plot.
>> ARTICLE
I was really disappointed with how that ended :(
>> ARTICLE
What happened in that episode? I already can't remember haha
>> ARTICLE
Murasakibara was unable to jump anymore and Kuroko blocked his shot.
>> ARTICLE
Actually yea that's fair, even plot shouldn't be able to fix large height discrepancies. 


But at least on the majority of the games shown I'm more or less satisfied by the outcomes and how they came about.

[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/27WucAL.jpg)

That was one hell of a jump to end the episode, plus never expected to have the match starting with Kagami in the zone. What was more unexpected though was the start of the episode. [Was/Is Hyuuga planning to confess to Riko?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/7bdzwe7.jpg)

Liked the new Rakuzan OP and the first part of the episode with the families and everyone gathering to watch the game (saw tons of old opponents showing up, too). Can't wait for the next episode since the game will actually start then.

Side note though,  why can't Kise win anything? I love him, but they won't let him win anything

Kise just won Haizaki. That is something, right?
>> ARTICLE
Forgot about that. At least he got that then. Hw deserves to win them all, but I'll take what I can get 
>> ARTICLE
The author has said that it's not exactly coincidence that he keeps losing... Kise keeps losing because it's the author's little passive aggressive way of taking it out on "good looking guys." Haha poor Kise.
>> ARTICLE
He's not my top best looking guy, though the blonde hair does make me swoon
>> ARTICLE
Poor Kise  He's such a good guy too
>> ARTICLE

Kise has the most OP ability, if it wasnt for his injury he would win everything lol
>> ARTICLE
But bear in mind though, his ability can be only used for 7 minutes tops, and that's assuming he gets to rest for an entire quarter. I kind of feel that Himuro and Murasakibara will absolutely dominate Kaijou for the remaining 30 or so minutes, let alone Rakuzan.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and he presents the highest potential to go pro after highschool. Imagine the ability to surpass 7 mins.
>> ARTICLE
But the thing is, outside of that 7 minutes hes still a damn good player. He was considered great BEFORE he could even use perfect copy.
>> ARTICLE
He is naturally talented in everything he endeavored for. His ability to quickly master something is unheard of.

Fujimaki should do another manga with Kise as the MC playing football.

That episode did a great job warming up both players in the final and us. The OP just blew my mind, haven't seen such a quality one for a long time, and where, in the sports anime, I'm impressed.

It's gonna be awesome 9 episodes, and I'm ready.

If Kise won his match against Seirin, he would have sat out in the final and got rekt.

Man Kagami could jump ON the hoop. 

Also [Spoilers for match, safe for manga readers](/s "Opening has the move names and there is Kagamis Direct Drive Zone too")

>> ARTICLE
Akashi is so short though. He shouldn't be able to block Kagami or any of the taller players.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi has a huge vertical because its already been stated that he is a peek physical condition. but he usually has to jump before his opponent jumps in order to block luckily he has emperor's eye

Edit: took out a phrase that makes my comment sound like a spoiler
>> ARTICLE
>You will see later on

bruh, no spoilers
>> ARTICLE
It is really a spoiler to assume he can jump really high its already been said that he is a peak physical condition, only natural to assume he can at least dunk the ball which would require him to have an impressive vertical.
>> ARTICLE
You "block" tall players by tipping the ball as they bring it up to shoot. Happened a lot to dwight howard.
>> ARTICLE
He stopped Midorima, he should be more than capable of doing the same to Kagami. 

Akashi just attacks during the "Triple Threat" position, for maximum efficiency.

Unless you mean directly blocking... (Ex. Kagami jumps, Akashi jumps with hand up to try and block). In which case, would never happen because Akashi wouldn't let them get to that point. Or if Kagami manages to actually do it, Akashi wouldn't try to block like that, he'd just forfeit the basket. These situations are all 1-on-1 though, and Akashi's teammates would definitely *block* Kagami if he ever did get ahead of Akashi.

Man I love this anime's OP's, gets me pumped as hell every single time.

The HYPE is real!  


The buildup to the Final with Marasakibara and Aomine talking was excellent and really got me hyped
>> ARTICLE
Even though the result of this game is obvious (there is no way the protagonists will lose the final battle) I can't help but get nervous hahahaha

Also, I'm kinda sad we never saw Midorima in the zone (nor Kise, but I guess the perfect copy thing is his zone, probably).
>> ARTICLE
Well, Slam Dunk (another great basketball manga) [](/s "did a less obvious and more realistic ending and it was great")
>> ARTICLE
I've tried to watch that before but I like Kuroko too much now lol. Slam Dunk looks almost weird in comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because Slam Dunk is an old manga (style is obviously different) and it has no "special abilities" bullshit (not saying it is a bad thing, I love knb and that bs is what makes it exciting). So yeah
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm not hating on it, I just definitely prefer the modern style.

I didn't think Chihiro would be that handsome in Animated Form well I got thing for Silver Haired Bishies...

He's still of a Prick though..

Wish they could have put a little more budget in the last 5 mins of the episode but hopefully the rest of the battle will look amazing as it should be if the OP animation gives us any indication. Great op, great intro, great hype to start the greatest basketball game in Kuroko history.

You know something I don't like about Kuroko no Basket....Just about every other team has a bunch of groupies in the benches... and we see that all the time. But where are Seirin's?

It's almost like he's an antagonist or something...
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah but he's an awful one that's the point, he's just like yeah 'I'm a genius blah blah'. He's just a basic bitch
>> ARTICLE
Uh yeah. That's kinda who he is though.

An elitist who achieves the highest things possible. From school marks to athleticism, he wins everything. He says he's *absolute*, and he has the past 14 years of his life to back up his statements. 

He doesn't make an effort to bring up his elitism in every conversation, only when he is being question. Almost like he's saying, "***Do you know who the fuck I am?***".

Akashi is a god, and has all the evidence to back him up.

In summary, he's just another trope. 

And if we were to apply the same thinking to all the characters, we'd find that they are all, in fact, characterized tropes.

Guess i just hate that kinda trope cause it's really easy to do

You guys, stop overhyping things or giving hints. It was a major problem in last season's discussion threads  too. Hidden reveals are meant to be hidden. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it does clearly say spoilers, so if you don't want spoilers...don't read till after the episode...?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers] refer to everything that's happened in the series through the episode, which is what you also mean, but not what I'm talking about. What I'm referring to are vague hints like "oh man wait until you see what happens next" and "this match just gets crazier and crazier". These are "meta-spoilers" and easily ruin the trajectory of story arcs for people who come to these discussion threads. A good example of this in this thread is people talking about [spoiler all](/s "Razukan's 5th man"). 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh maybe you should make that more clear, sorry if I sounded like an asshole but it really does just sound like your complaining about people talking about what's happened in this episode, I do apologise. Though I see your point, people talking about what's coming next and things that haven't happened yet are pretty annoying and shouldn't be discussed in the weekly discussion :/
>> ARTICLE
Ah you're right, I wasn't being very clear, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
Not a problem :) just didn't want people being an asshole like I was because I was mistaken :p
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. Ive read the manga and all, but I dont look at discussion threads for series I havent read the original simply for that reason: people are ruining that sort of thing. I dont want to know that next episode is gonna be even amazing, that will make me expect a lot more out of it, and because of that, I wont find it as amazing!

These absurd powers are too funny, so they showed a cannonball dribbling already, can't wait to see what rakuzan still has in store.

I heard his backstory is good.

You have no idea

It's not really as dramatic as they portrayed. He's just dribbling harder which is actually a good thing because the harder the dribble the harder it is to steal not to mention improves control.

And apparently can make an entire stadium cover their ears from the noise it makes?

That's the dramaticness of anime but yes hard dribbles are pretty loud.

I expected this to be more like Aomine vs Kagami the first time, so right now Akashi is far from showing his true skill, or he isn't as good as I thought.

He's just far from showing his true skill, he's on an entirely different level than the rest of the GoM
>> ARTICLE
Lol he's putting in 0 effort right now.

You have no idea... Akashi is a monster and the strongest of the GoM by far (in my opinion).
>> ARTICLE
Though his ability does have a limit, Kise's potential is limitless and his ability lets him use all of the GoM's powers. 
>> ARTICLE
Though Kise also has a limit on how long he can use the GoM's powers, I believe that was said in the last episode when he first used Midorima's shooting technique

Yeah, in the manga as well. I can't wait to see his game against Seirin animated.

which chapter is that?
>> ARTICLE
> Thus, by witnessing my glorious form...

I feel like a little drama was lost when they translated some of those lines lol.
>> ARTICLE
No girls ranked.  Can you tell what this comic/show's core demographic is?? ;-)
>> ARTICLE
Does Miyaji appear more in the manga? Where is Teppei? Why is Hanamiya there?

So many questions D:
>> ARTICLE
No, they didn't change that much from the manga (other than making the teikou arc shorter), but Miyaji is good-looking! And this was polled when the second season was airing. Hanamiya, who was in the second season, was voiced by Fukuyama Jun, who is one of the favorite voice actors of females. Add then in the mostly female demographic, and it adds up. 
>> ARTICLE
Teppei is 16th. I have no freaking idea why Hanamiya is 10th. Hated that guy (which, to be fair, we were kind of supposed to).
>> ARTICLE
The fact that they were trying to make us hate him and succeeded is a pretty good example of how impressive of a character he is. I absolutely despise him to this day.
>> ARTICLE
The fangirls love bad boys and the creator is notably annoyed by the fact his bad boy characters are popular (so he made Haizaki).
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, just noticed the number on the upper panel for Teppei. Thanks!

Also, it seems Momoi is right after him on the ranking.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of fans (myself included) found Hanamiya's villainy and the fact that he never really repents or goes all sob story about it, i.e he's just being a dick for the sheer joy of it, really fun. I really enjoyed him as a character. He's probably one of my favourites actually.
>> ARTICLE
I am not surprised with some people liking Hanamiya's character, but more due to other characters being lower in the ranking since I didn't expect him there. He is the definition of a villain and enjoys it, which is both quite annoying and an accomplishment (to remain like that).
>> ARTICLE
Teppei being relatively low doesn't surprise me because he's pretty boring and would be even lower if he wasn't part of Seirin. Same goes for Hyuga, Izuki and Mitobe. The only top ten entry that surprises me is Kasamatsu, because I struggle to remember that guy's name most of the time, but then I guess the fact he can be paired with Kise (Kuroko has a big fujoshi following, remember) makes his popularity go up.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't that surprised with Kasamatsu, especially after the Kaijo match.

Imayoshi is an interesting character that I don't know the ranking of (did I miss it again?) but he didn't show up much so I have no idea if he is high or low.
>> ARTICLE
Imayoshi's kind of fun but I don't think he ranked on the third and final popularity poll. On the first and second he was #17 and #21 respectively, so he's never done that well on them. I enjoy him when he gets a line so I guess he'd probably rank higher if he got more screen-time.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi really never loses..
>> ARTICLE
Aomine only 7th? Poll is rigged.

And I don't see Murasakibara. Poor guy, only member of the Generation of Miracles to not be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah what's up with that.  Aomine is my favourite gom and I think he's the strongest.  After all he got demotivated because the only one that can beat him is himself.  He's probably stronger than akashi too because if he  thought only he could beat himself that means he didn't consider akashi a challenge either. 

 It was never said in the manga if he ever played 1 on 1 vs akashi.  I don't think he ever admitted in the manga that akashi was stronger than him either.   The mangaka built up aomine to be unbeatable so he kind of avoided any comparisons between him and akashi cause it would kind of throw a wrench in aomine's way of thinking that there was no one out there that could challenge or beat him until kagami showed up.
>> ARTICLE
Aomine was just the first of the GoM to blossom. If it came down to 1v1 vs them I'd probably still give it to Akashi because Emperor's eye is fucking op. 
>> ARTICLE
Well i mean hes the only one of them that was a complete jackass for basically the whole series and only got very minor redemption when he cried after losing to seirin. He also doesn't really stand out when conpared to the other GoMs. Like kise said murasakibara is just the most naturally talented. Hes big/tall and can give a mean block/dunk but thats about it.

All the other GoMs have better attitudes(even akashi) and are arguably better players overall.
>> ARTICLE
I think Murasakibara had the potential to be the strongest out of all of them, during his game we didn't get to see his midrange shooting ability which if he acquired one would make not just a threat on the inside but he may even be a threat from outside.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder that too. He's supposed to be the most naturally talented, right? And he's Zone-capable too. We barely ever see him seriously *try*. I'd like to see him go against Aomine or Kagami at full strength from the start.
>> ARTICLE
I like to think that when you play against Murasakibara, anything inside the 3 point line is basically his

>> ARTICLE
Given that Hanamiya is #10 while Hyuga is trailing at #25, I don't think people are judging by who's the nicest or most sportsmanlike guy. Given that Kuroko no Basket's fanbase (particularly the people who vote in these polls) is majority women, the attractiveness of the character is figuring into things massively (look at Takao sitting at #3) and though personally I like him, Murasakibara is an enormous lumbering giant with a childish personality that makes him come off as sort of sexless.

I LOVE how the show acts like Akashi entering the Zone was a foregone conclusion, because pretty much everyone assumed it was going to happen before the game even started. The show wastes no time in building up a "what? Akashi can enter the Zone?" because you just assume he can.

I do wish they animated that one really good panel of him in the Zone though, but the animation in this episode was godly.

(Also, I wish his Zone was yellow in one eye and red in another rather than pink)

>> ARTICLE
> Irrelevant, but the whimper here was hilarious.

Holy that bit killed me hahaha, especially after Hyuga's dramatic battlecry.
>> ARTICLE
Zone's zone keeper has to be Kuroko. It's basically the entire point of the anime's light and shadow spiel. Kuroko (and maybe the entire team) start doing some super beast teamwork light-and-shadow shit and bam, second gate opened.  Then Kagami turns SSJ2.

Makes sense, 'cos Kuroko's basketball is about teamwork. And it ain't called Kagami's basketball.
>> ARTICLE
Was thinking that it's a combination of both things mentioned here. Like it's oneself but Kuroko also has something to do with it.

It is a bit wishful thinking since I would REALLY love for a Kuroko in the zone situation, but since I don't think that's possible he must be related to the series dramatic ending somehow...and this is quite a good bet.
>> ARTICLE
I am betting it is oneself. It has to be. You reach your full potential in the zone, so you must surpass yourself to go beyond it.
>> ARTICLE
maybe its a different keeper for everyone just like everyones trigger is different. so aomine's would be himself but maybe kagami is his friends since he plays for his team
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it's Kuroko. Akashi goes godmode by completely giving up on his teammates - I wonder if the only way for Kagami to match that is to give up on the ideals they've been building up for all 3 seasons, and to give up on the shadow. If he has to abandon teamwork as Akashi has. I like your version too though. Major hype to find out.

>> ARTICLE
I finally caught up this week so now I get to sit and painfully wait for new episodes every week!^I ^^regret ^^^nothing
>> ARTICLE
Despite all of the Rakuzan shit that went on in this episode, I can't help but think that this is the first time I've seen Seirin as a legitimately good team. Every other game it's always standard game for them to rush in without much strategy, get their ass whooped, and then spout some "we'll believe in our ace" shit and miraculously pull off a win. Well, while they still did do the "we'll believe in our ace" thing this episode, I can't help but think this is the first time they were able to stand on their own two feet. Sure, they did get their ass whooped initially as per the standard, but we actually got to see each individual team member improve, and they reached a level where they could actually counter the opposing team solidly.
>> ARTICLE
Kagami got fisted so much in this episode. Multiple fisting. I was moved to tears. 
>> ARTICLE
oh the hype is real. pls have them rip each other apart next episode. i want to see more brutality, i want to see what all the hopes of seirin trusted in kagami has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
People were talking about the animation quality being a bit subpar the last 10 episodes or so. Seems like they saved all the budget for the finale.
>> ARTICLE
I am so looking forward to the final episode. So much hype I actually think it'll spill out of me. Lets go Kagami and Kuroko!
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kind of wanting Akashi and Rakuzan to win... Even if Akashi's an asshole regarding some matters (mostly basketball, apparently) Rakuzan just seems in general like the stronger team. And it's not like they don't work together at all, either.

But Kuroko no Basket still has a lot of shounen aspects, and there's no way someone as arrogant as Akashi wins in the end.
>> ARTICLE
But what if Akashi stops being arrogant?
>> ARTICLE
Do you see that happening without him losing a match? From what I can tell he hasn't lost a single match since he started playing basketball.

His arrogance makes sense in that regard, which is partly why I like the character. I don't really remember seeing another character in anime being this cocky with something to back him up. Usually they're all cocky because they compare themselves only with people worse than themselves - but Akashi is probably good enough to beat anyone except the professionals, and if he played as long as the pros... He'd probably beat all of them, too.
>> ARTICLE
I would love an epilogue like on shield 21 manga where they had to play and international team, GoM vs avarage USA player 
>> ARTICLE
If we are trying to predict what's going to happen, I would assume Kuroko and Kagami find some way to stop Akashi in the zone and he has to stop being arrogant in order to win. I think that he might go back to that state before he went nuts on Murasakibara. But honestly, I don't see why the author would end the series with Seirin losing at the finals.
>> ARTICLE
Also, I JUST noticed that this is episode 72 we're talking about here, but Crunchyroll posted episode 70 today. I just caught up to it, so can you explain to me what is going on? :/
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll is two weeks behind.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it totally goes against the show's ideals. It's "Kuroko's Basketball" - it's about Kuroko proving to the other GoMs that his style of basketball, playing co-operatively as a team, is a more effective and fulfilling method of playing than their attempts at winning by themselves at all costs. Now we've got the showdown that completely tests these ideals; Kuroko's team versus the one guy who could take on a team alone. Akashi has to lose in order to see that even the strongest player can't win without relying on and supporting his team. 

Rakuzan is the stronger team, but Akashi hinders from making it as strong as possible by only looking for the most effective and straightforward way to win without considering how the other players feel. He leaves out the human element, and because of it the team suffers when they get pushed hard. Mayuzumi feels like Rakuzan's tool and lacks the motivation to try and play synergistically with them as Kuroko does, and the three uncrowned kings all feel like they're more Akashi's underlings than his teammates, on a contract that expires when they stop being useful to the team. So when they're challenged, they freak out and panic because the appearance of anyone that can beat them can spell the end of their time on the starting lineup, and they can't afford to work together to beat anyone giving them trouble because that would be weakness in Akashi's eyes. Akashi's now made it clear that he thinks they're all useless to him at this point, so their motivation is going to drop to nothing and it really will be just Akashi against the whole of Seirin from this point. Akashi went for picking guys that excelled in certain areas, passing, defending, threes, etc., and just assumed that they'd be fine working on their own because of their strength, completely forgetting that they're human beings who need to feel like they're getting something out of the game to play. Really, he's holding the whole team back, ironically.

Honestly, if he won in spite of all that, it really wouldn't make any sense.

[major manga spoiler, do not read if you don't want to get the end spoiled](/s "the irony lies within akashi trying to rely on his teammates, that is when his nice personality comes back right after his current one is getting crushed, as he will do just that later in the match and still loses. ") 
>> ARTICLE
One thing I don't get - what's the pressure on Hyuga, because of having 4 fouls? He was already taken off the field for half the game, only additional risk of fouling out is doing the same.

Also, "The Zone greater than the Zone" = SSJ2. Kuroko no Basket is officially Dragon Ball and Akashi is Cell.
>> ARTICLE
Basketball is 5 fouls and you are out for good. It was the coaches decision to pull Hyuga out earlier. In all levels of play you will see players pulled out if they get two early fouls in say the first Quarter. This serves two purposes:

1. To let them refocus for when they return to the game.
2. Make sure they are available when "Crunch Time" comes

You want your best players on the court for the end of the game and if they foul out they can't be out there. That's where the pressure lies.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that, but at time Hyuga returned to the field, it was clearly crunch time already and if he didn't return, he would sit out rest of the game anyway.

>Akashi is Cell.

How dare you? Cell was ~~relatively~~ honorable. Akashi is just a motherfucker.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone noticed at 19:05 when he scores that he actually broke the basketball rules? He jumps (Clearly) then continues trippling... 
>> ARTICLE
hesitation move..you cant travel as long as you dont kill your dribble...and akashi didnt kill his dribble
>> ARTICLE
He didn't break any rules.  He'd had to have landed on both feet and/or carried the ball with both hands AND then dribbled for it to be a violation.  
  
But the ball remains in one hand.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, this is what Kuroko should be! Recently it hasn't been feeling as enjoyable, but Akashi's zone has reminded me of the hype I felt before!
>> ARTICLE
Can someone please make a Webm or gif or something of Akashi from when he enters the zone to when he lands the basket? Please I would love you forever.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely called the second Zone. Was too obvious from Aomine's comment the other episode. Animation was smooth af for Akashi's Zone, I'm seriously hoping it steps up in general for the last few episodes now. This episode was just great in general.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see, if/when Seirin win, if Akashi's personality will revert back to a nicer version. Like finally losing will change him for the better.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. Akashi doing the best he can to keep the OP Seirin down. Props! 

Kagami is like 20mins. in the zone already. And Kuroko still hasn't done anything major yet so he'll likely get the final say again.

Great episode! Fun to watch. Hope next weeks episode keeps it up. 
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think that the thing of Akashi entering the zone was a bit bullshit? Doesn't really fit with his character, just seems like an asspull to magic up some even greater conflict out of nowhere.

The thing with Aomine and Kagami entering the zone is that they're designed to seem more primal, that they're merely relying on their senses and instincts rather than anything else. It seemed like it was meant to basically mean that they're as close to pure predatory beasts as a human playing basketball can be.

Akashi just going "Oh I'll have a go at that too" just seems a bit stupid. I know it's silly to say this in reference to a show where players have superpowers-that-aren't-actually-superpowers, but it really broke my immersion during this episode. It still looked really cool, but it was an asspull nonetheless. I at least want ridiculous shows to be internally consistent, and Akashi entering the Zone doesn't feel internally consistent.

Edit: Also, it's kinda silly that I was downvoted for saying what I thought about the episode. I wasn't crude, abrasive, or factually wrong about anything, just saying how I felt about a major plot point. The subreddit seems to have the maturity of an 8-year-old at times. Guess you're not allowed to criticise KNB even if you clearly enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean, it seems to go better with Aomine and Kagami's play styles since they do have the wild skill or whatever. What's cool about Kise's perfect copy is that it's like a variation of the zone that's just for him. How do you feel about Murasakibara going into the zone?
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I'd say it seems like Murasakibara going into the Zone would require more effort than he's willing to commit. =P
>> ARTICLE
Uh, hello? Have NOT you been paying attention to the entire third season?

Akashi is obsessed with winning, it was made that very clear when he awakened Emperor Eye against Murasakibara in the Teiko arc. I can't see how it's an asspull **when we saw it all coming.** Rakuzan is the final "boss" in the storyline, and for all we know Akashi has never lost a match.

Remember, there are two conditions for one to enter the Zone: peak skill at the game of basketball, and the love for the sport. That has also been announced a number of times in the entire series.

Akashi wants to perfect everything in his game and make sure he will never have to experience losing. When he realized Aomine could enter the Zone on his own will, then that's when he realized he should be able to that aswell, since he is the Absolute. And guess what: he can't do it. As in the episode, he said had a trigger like Kagami's will to fight for his teammates. That trigger (of course), is when he feels his teammates are no longer a necessity. 

Besides, as another manga reader the term "asspull" doesn't even measure up to what's coming later.
>> ARTICLE
>>and for all we know Akashi has never lost a match.

[Mango spoiler](/s "Correction. Akashi has Never lost at anything. Ever.")

>> ARTICLE
Just don't think it really fits his character like Aomine and Kagami. His "power", the Emperor Eye, implies a completely different skillset. The Zone doesn't really go with the type of character he is, from what I've seen so far. It just seems like they're tacking new "powers" onto different characters for the sake of a conflict-creating twist. Also, nothing up until this episode, from what I can recall, suggested that Akashi would be able to enter the Zone. That, for me, is the definition of an asspull.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're taking the Zone for something that should only be done by certain types of players. When you say "skillset", I can only imply you meant he is more of a playmaking type rather than  an offensive powerhouse of Aomine and Kagami. Think of it like this: Emperor Eye is an *ability* that Akashi has, and Zone is a *state*. Abilities are signature to the user, and the user alone. Other abilities in the show are: Misdirection, Formless Shot, and Perfect Copy. The *state* however, can be attained by almost anyone if the conditions are set. Even Himuro was close to entering the Zone, but he never got in because he didn't meet the requirements. Anyhow, I can see where you're coming from in general, even if I don't agree with it. If anything, the entire Emperor Eye concept is an asspull.

And, yeah it was never implied Akashi could enter the Zone in the series, but it was said anyone can enter it.
>> ARTICLE
I appreciate that anyone can enter the Zone (after all, it's pretty much just Japanese slang for "being in the zone" anyway), so I absolutely see what you're saying.

My main point is that it fit Aomine and Kagami, what with them being freaks of nature in terms of athletic prowess, i.e. that it's an innate thing to them because of how they're built.

The same can't be said for Akashi in how he's portrayed, although the show obviously goes to lengths to portray how he eclipses the other characters in all-around skill at the game. Some characters just fit those kind of wild abilities, and some don't.

Otherwise, I of course see what you mean with that explanation, makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
well I personally think Zone is a term in saying the player is in the momentum and at their peak performance level instead of the beast instinct and senses lol
>> ARTICLE
The Wild is only shown to be one way to enter the Zone at will too, but I think the Wild is totally one of the requirements to get "deeper" into the Zone, since it's reliance on instinct. Akashi probably doesn't have that kind of instinct.
>> ARTICLE
I what you mean with asspull, this subreddit is gonna explode :D
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see that as something they pulled out of their asses, as Akashi will do whatever it takes to win, and he's out of options. It only makes sense that the most talented basketball player in the show, as well as the final boss enters the zone. What makes less sense to me is that he saved it as his final option. If he's capable of that and he wants to be guaranteed victory, why doesn't he just use that from the start?
>> ARTICLE
As explained in the episode, his particular trigger requires him to loose all hope and trust in his teammates. I don't think even if he wanted to, he could do that when he thinks his team is better than everyone else. His particular type of zone is very unhealthy in that he can only use it by destroying his team chemistry.
>> ARTICLE
Great point. I didn't even consider that when I made my comment.
>> ARTICLE
Playing your absolute best isn't simple as you think it is. Often it does involve some kind of emotional trigger, and I'm not even talking about anime. Furthermore, Akashi would never go all out from the beginning because he's been proven to test out the waters at first. It may also be smarter because if he only zones in the last quarter, Seirin would have less time to analyze and form a counterplay.
>> ARTICLE
Alright that's a fair point. I completely forgot that they actually covered my potential hole in the story. But at the same time, if Akashi could enter zone literally any time he wanted, there would be no counter. Him just entering zone completely destroyed Kagami already deep into the zone. And clearly it's going to take Kagami opening that second gate to win. But assuming losing doesn't completely ruin him, what if Akashi learns how to open the second gate in the future? He'd be unbeatable.
>> ARTICLE
well when initially u think lv1 is enough to win the opponent, why not stick to lv1? but apparently its not enough so lv2 :D
>> ARTICLE
> ~~The subreddit~~ Reddit ~~seems to have~~ has the maturity of an 8-year-old ~~at times.~~ all the time.

FTFY

Seriously though, it's never just been limited to the wild guys, remember Murasakibara entered too. If only for a little bit.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah remember that zone thing I just discovered a few days ago and entered the first time ? Guess what, its not enough so lets just switch to zone 2 !!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
First they need to reach ascended zone, an state of controlled zone where their ~~aura~~ sparks are more rounded. After that comes the super ascended zone, however as your muscles become bulkier and slower, your strenght hardly matters. Then, after an emotional trigger, comes the strongest of all, ~~super saiyajin~~ zone 2. 
>> ARTICLE
[I found this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKL5WiaPlcQ) for anyone who wanted a video of just the zone sequence.
>> ARTICLE
FFFFF I wish it had the subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
This show uses way too much guitar. In the manga, the reveals of the zone and the moment Kuroko rallied his team with his unbreakable will, all have build up and are made out to be epic moments. I think a problem the show has is that it is constantly going 100 miles an hour and just plays guitar in the background when it wants to let you know "hey shits going down".
>> ARTICLE
It's more dramatic in the manga, though.

Anime Akashi: It is when I lose faith in you and decide to abandon you.

Manga Akashi: "...when you truly disappoint me and I abandon you all." (the wording gets to me that's why hahaha)

PLUS Zone Akashi looks more detailed (well, duh) in the manga. But overall, great animation!

>> ARTICLE
It's exactly the same message/meaning... 
>> ARTICLE
Im really pissed off that Akashi now basically is Aomine that can force people on their knees by staring them down. It doesnt make the episode less enjoyable, but it's not very creative either.
>> ARTICLE
it was already explained how his "ankle break" works. 
>> ARTICLE
I know and i dont see how thats relevant. I wasnt complaining about ankle break, but more about the fact that he is basically Aomine with ankle break, I expected something a little more original for Akashi since he doesn't really have high ''specs''

[this shit right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQFObmVm7hk)

i'd pay good money to see an entire game animated like that
>> ARTICLE
Those are scenes we joke that they're saving up for when you have those questionable QUALITY episodes (though KnB has always been solid with animation).  You usually don't see a high number of drawn frames like that unless it's an OVA or movie due to time/budget I assume.
>> ARTICLE
See the way Kagami hung on the rim after he finished the oop? The attention to detail in that scene was amazing. Why couldn't they give Akashi this high quality animation?
>> ARTICLE
I'm only a casual anime fan, but I'm a huge basketball fan. I cringe whenever I see subpar basketball animation or when instead of showing an animation of the play, it goes into the whole 'panels' thing. 

If only the whole series was animated like that play....
>> ARTICLE
I feel this is the longest continuous and legitimate "gameplay" that we've seen in season 3. Everything else has been slideshows basically.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they had a full time basketball director or someone who actually plays basketball on their staff. Every now and then there'd be properly animated gameplay/basketball plays. The majority of the times, it's just zoomed in on their facial expressions or slideshows of basketball moves.


>> ARTICLE
I wonder why that is? On such a scale, hiring a basketball player for tips and stuff shouldn't be a problem.

If you watch Season 1, every move had a setup. The slideshows were few and far in between, and the actual "playing" was there. You could see how they ended up in situations, because someone passed that way and someone moved that way etc.

Now come to season 3, the "setup" to every play is missing. They just end up in those situations. No explaination, nothing.

And that's why Season 1 still remains one of my favorite. The music, the basketball, everything was perfect, even though it had less "excitement".

I mean come-on...Aomine's entry into basketball court against Seirin still gives me the chills. Nothing has come close to it. 
>> ARTICLE
> The slideshows were few and far in between

Really? Like, 80% of the first Kaijo game was just still images...
>> ARTICLE
I am talking about the Cup matches. Didn't say everything was smooth, but there was a flow to each game that is missing from the other 2 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
That's why Extra Game has to be a movie adaptation. A sports anime movie with Evangelion budget needs to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Let's get a petition started? A properly animated kuroko no basuke basketball movie.

Is Extra Game the sequel manga? Is it just one more game and it's over?

They have up to 3 chapters out. It's so fucking good. It's even better. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's the sequel of the manga where the GoMs are reunited (with Kuroko and Kagami joining them) to play against an American team. It's currently ongoing but yes, Extra Game covers only one game. The original manga was over after the Rakuzan match.
>> ARTICLE
is there any plan for an anime/ova/movie for Extra Game? I really enjoyed watching KnB

Thanks for the info. And yeah it would be amazing seeing that as an high budget movie!
>> ARTICLE
Akashi is a lot more interesting than I expected him to be. He's so different from the other gom, his biggest fear and the entire struggle of his character is him not being good enough, I honestly did not expect the quality of this writing. It's crazy that they can make someone that has literally never lost seem like he's struggling so much with insecurity.
>> ARTICLE
His break down during the episode and his coach's realization about how "brittle" he actually is was soon gooooood. He's my favourite character just because of his background.

[Akashi no Basket end card](http://i.imgur.com/Tk0yjMG.jpg)

Seeing Kuroko and Kagami overcome his emperor eye was amazing but it was a bit sad seeing Akashi like that. He looked so fragile which was nothing like what he's shown till now. I actually liked seeing the human side of him ([especially his change](http://i.imgur.com/CTIbcoM.jpg)), even though I still like his emperor side (it's too OP, what's not to like).

So, the [zone's zone keeper](http://i.imgur.com/QMVs1CN.jpg) does look like Kuroko this time around ([this was the one from Aomine's explanation on previous episode](http://i.imgur.com/ozRCnPi.jpg). If Kuroko's quasi emperor eye was not the best they could do, I really wonder what they are going to come up with next episode. I am both hyped for the next and a bit bitter we are coming closer to the end ><
>> ARTICLE
I'm 100% it's Kuroko after that shot. It's way too similar.
>> ARTICLE
I assume the person standing at the second door in the zone is something you need to understand, like personality wise. Like for Aomine's it reminds me of Aomine himself because of "The only one who can beat me is me" as for Kagami it would be Kuroko because of the whole light and shadow thing.

I don't know something I just came up with right now.
>> ARTICLE
The person standing at the door is a shadow, it clicked immediately.
>> ARTICLE
[This](http://i.imgur.com/wzEEGqx.jpg) page from the manga shows that the coaches from Rakuzan, Shutoku, Touou, Kaijo, and Yosen as well as Kagetora(Riko's dad) all played for Japan's national team together(Minus Yosen's coach who was on the Women's team). I always thought it was a pretty cool page and I was reminded of it after [this](http://i.imgur.com/kDABl0n.png) was shown in the last episodes ending. So I thought I'd share it.

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkRTE-zYMlY) a clip from the anime of Tora and Mabo catching up at the Touou-Seirin game. (Not in english, sorry)

Also, [Rakuzan's](http://kurokonobasuke.wikia.com/wiki/Eiji_Shirogane) coach is related (most likely brothers) with [Teiko](http://kurokonobasuke.wikia.com/wiki/K%C5%8Dz%C5%8D_Shirogane) middle school's coach.

Why don't I remember this color page?  Do you know which chapter it went with?

Could be the reverse that he stopped dyeing his hair grey

Or maybe as he gets older his hair starts blackening

That female coach is so hot ;')

That entire 6-8 mins of Akashi was amazing, glad they added it into the anime even though it wasn't part of the manga.

That episode was full of feels...So that's the "normal" Akashi. Wow, imo one of the best episodes by now, great job!!!

Don't know if anyone noticed but the OP and ED are a bit different now. The OP looks especially awesome.

Whoa, it looks great.

The op kept making thinking my mind was playing tricks on me because it wss rhe same but looked slightly diffrent/better
>> ARTICLE
I love the message of zone 2.0 - it's not about your own power, it's about power of the team. It fits the theme of anime perfectly and gives better message, than usual shonen "single badass character" trope. Even the best need others to rely on, to overcome their own limits.
>> ARTICLE
> usual shonen "single badass character" trope

I thought that was exactly where it was going, so this was a pretty interesting turn.
>> ARTICLE
Ladies and gentlemen, the other half of Akashi Seijuuro. Also, some points: 

1) unsettling that Akashi's voice actor is also cheerful Takeda's (Haikyuu) seiyuu

2) THAT ALLEY OOP, DANG

3) Akashi losing his cool breaks my heart 

4) The convo with the two Akashis [was] (/s "not in the manga anyway") but I like how they showed flashbacks of the times Akashi had the GoM subservient. Kinda heals the wound caused by #3 haha

5) Akashi's talking a lot in this episode and you see infant akashi toddler akashi teiko basketball trainee akashi

Oh my god you also watched that episode ? Thanks for clarifying...

In addition to 1) he is also happens to be pervy Araragi's (Bakemonogatari) seiyuu.

To be honest he kinda got his wake up call now.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi needed his "ruthless" side to win against Murasakibara, will returning back to "normal" really help him?
>> ARTICLE
That was in a 1v1, given the emphasis on team play in the whole series and the fact that the previous Akashi basically tried to 1v5, and the fact that Akashi used to be a cool guy team player, I'm guessing returning to normal will mean some good team play from him. 
>> ARTICLE
His "normal" side loves basketball as well, but has "morals" on. I'm guessing that he'll be able to communicate with his team more effectively - instead of just setting it up so that he manages all the passes, he trusts his team as well, while being able to push each member's abilities to their limits. 

The question is, can Rakuzan get used to the new Akashi with five minutes left?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Kagami have run out of stamina? I guess that's being saved for later. I remember Aomine saying he won't even last the first quarter; this is unreal.
>> ARTICLE
Dude he's the inspiration Lebron bases himself off of.
>> ARTICLE
Lebron wishes he didn't need to rest at the start of the 4th quarter every game and be like kagami.  Cavs would have already swept the warriors with kagami instead of lebron!

Kagami + LeBron team up? GG RIP 15 Straight Titles [I'm a Lakers fan, so I hate the Warriors]

LeBron needs a kuroko! 
>> ARTICLE
He was out of the zone for a massive chunk of the game.
>> ARTICLE
I believe he was told to only use his Zone for offense, and he only went into the zone for defense at the last second if the opponent was about to score.
>> ARTICLE
That was only at the beginning. For the recent stretch, the Zone has been used almost exclusively for defense.
>> ARTICLE
It only feels like a long time because they dedicated a lot of time to the second half.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's the other way around, it feels like he's been in the zone for the whole game because the parts where he wasn't in the zone were given little screen time.

EDIT: Can't tell if you were agreeing or disagreeing with me lol.
>> ARTICLE
Though, I've realized, there's a section in the manga where they discuss Kagami's stamina after they get the turnover on Akashi, but they cut it to have the focus more on Akashi, which I'm fine with.

Him having a conversation with himself rather than a monologue was a nice addition.

Agreeing, haha.

Welcome back, Akashi

You should put "discussion" in the titles so they show up when people search for new discussions.
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime has a discussion thread archive, btw.
>> ARTICLE
I know. But, I and a lot of people I know use /r/anime discussions as their anime calendar, with a search for "discussion" sorted by new. This way, rewatches and new episode discussions all show up. Except for this series, which for the last while has apparently not had "discussion" in the title unlike all other series.
>> ARTICLE
All they have to do is search for kuroko. Not really a big deal
>> ARTICLE
This is true, but it's an extra step that is unnecessary with the addition of one word to the title. A word that is present in all other thread discussions.

Also, someone wanting to check new discussions (searching for that) who does not watch Kuroko won't even see this thread, so there's no possibility of gaining new watchers who see the thread in that case.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, I never realized that.

I'll definitely make sure to have it on the last few episodes, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The difference between the two Akashi is that of a boss vs. leader, like in [this picture](http://rs1img.memecdn.com/difference-between-a-boss-and-a-leader_c_2358201.jpg).

Boss: Giving orders, asking them if they can carry through, intervening only when he believes that "if you wanna do something right, do it yourself".

Leader: "Let us fight together, with respect to our individual roles". This is basically the "unicorn" who combines human skills, listens to his employees/teammates, without sacrificing his personal traits and place (taking bold risks, be their superior). And I'm saying "unicorn" because it's really that rare to happen (in real life).
>> ARTICLE
I realize it's supposed to be dramatic but I can't shake the feeling of garbage coaching from Rakuzan. Your best player is out of sorts. The lead is closing. You wait for the opponent to go on a 10 point run before calling a time out? What the hell is this guy thinking?
>> ARTICLE
He was probably in shock
>> ARTICLE
Damn Akashi had some crazy Haki at the start, pretty sure the bench guys would had fainted

Any chance someone could make a webm of that amazing play (the alley hoop). That animation was insane

I really hope Rakuzan don't win because of Akashi suddenly letting his "meek" side take over. It's nice that Kuroko sort of wins the spiritual victory there but tbh this is Seirin's story and they deserve to win it all after all this.

Didn't you notice Akashi had two emperor eyes? He's been playing hero ball and his teammate literally opened his eyes. Rakuzan's got one more run in them.
>> ARTICLE
Meh... Kuroko used his 'quasi' emperor eye only twice so far and Kagami only just started opening the 2nd 'gate'.

Even with a new (old?) akashi, I'm pretty sure it is too late to stop Kagami at this point.

Do it yourself. Stop expecting others to do the dirty work for you.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if this was explained, but why exactly can his eyes change colour? I mean I thought it was just simple heterochromia, but it literally changed...
>> ARTICLE
The eye change is just a representation of his bipolar personality shifting to one-another. The heterochromia being his single-minded victory over all else vs. the red eyes being his love for basketball and victory through team play
>> ARTICLE
Of course I understand the shift, between personalities, but I was wondering if they had some sort of "real" explanation for it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's normal anime character design. You can notice how neither of Akashi's parents have red hair. It's a stylistic decision, I think.

Its just a representation so you can tell which ones he is in, theres no explanation other that "anime"

>> ARTICLE
Ah! Yeah, it is representational of his shift, but also it is representational of his leave from the GoM. All of the GoM have hair colors and eye colors that match their name (ex. Mido; green- for Midorima, Ao; blue- for Aomine, Ki; Yellow- for Kise, Mura; Purple- for Murasakibara, Momo; peach- for Momoi and Aka; red for Akashi) The exemptions are Kuroko (Kuro; Black- Like a shadow), Nijimura (Niji; Rainbow- Since he was the old captain of the "Rainbow" colored, and named, team), and Haizaki (Hai; ash) now, as we know, Haizaki's hair color changed from ash to brown, which may or may not symbolize his leave from the Teiko team and the generation of miracles. So, in a sense, Akashi gaining the foreign "Emperor's Eye" and adding gold into his eye color may symbolize not only his shift in personalities, but his derivation from the Generation of Miracles.

(Also, the GoM's colors match their Zodiac Signs.) (HOORAY for Midorima XD) (Coincidentally, the Generation of Miracles were introduced in order of age from oldest to youngest; Kise being introduced first and the oldest, followed by Midorima, Aomine, Murasakibara, and the youngest Akashi. Not only that, the hair color seemed to be a reference to determine their order of introduction. For example: Kise (Yellow), Midorima (Green), then Aomine (Blue). (Yellow + Blue = Green). Midorima was introduced after Kise and before Aomine. It means that the secondary color should be between it's two primary colors. The same goes for Murasakibara who was introduced after Aomine and before Akashi.) (Ok...Enough of my rant...)

Akashi's true self finally awakens... Holy shit I still get goosebumps till now

The best episode of the entire series, hands down
>> ARTICLE
Major plot twist here. Everyone thought this was Basketball Z... but it was actually Bleachball all along.

Akashi confirmed to be a Vizard, but could he also be a Quincy? The plot thickens. 
>> ARTICLE
Kinda sucks that the animators saved their best work for an Izuki play.   Would've made more sense to give us that high quality animation for the Generation of Miracles, don't you think?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah this season's animation has been a true disappointment. With how popular the show is in Japan we should get a movie after this. Hopefully it will be glorious.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure I called Akashi's switch back, but I wasn't expecting them feels along with it, that was a great scene, and it was interesting that they added in all that back story. Really hoping there's more with Kagami in the second Zone though.
>> ARTICLE
Welp.. Rakuzan tried their best but Seirin is just too good. Can't do much when a player is in the zone for majority of the game now. 

Good episode. The next couple episodes will just be a slow, sad, demise of the emperor. 
>> ARTICLE
Aha...Honestly, with the mindset and love for basketball that Akashi has now...Well, I believe that he will not enjoy his loss, but come to terms with it. He may even be happy that he returned to his "regular" self. And yes, the fall of the emperor, but the rise of Akashi. He will still be an Emperor, but he will be kinder; much kinder. 
>> ARTICLE
> The next couple episodes will just be a slow, sad, demise of the emperor.

Eh? I feel like it's going to be the exact opposite with that ending.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like he will start relying heavy on his teammates, building solid chemistry and performing well but still leading to the teams defeat.

It's the fall of the emperor and the rise of Akashi. :)
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh I see. Agreed. :p Gonna be interesting to see what they can bring to the table now.

I have the feeling that Akashi is going to go for a lot of threes when the 4th quarter starts.

[removed]
>> ARTICLE
It's not as obvious, but the colour+name theme applies to the flashback people too!

**(Hai)**zaki = Ash

**(Niji)**mura = Rainbow

**(Shiro)**gane = White (He's the coach)

------------------------

In case you don't know what I mean...

**(Aka)**shi = Red

**(Ao)**mine = Blue

**(Ki)**se = Yellow

etc...
>> ARTICLE
Everyone in KnB has a themed name actually, it's really clever! As you have mentioned, Teiko are colors. To continue what another person added, **(Momo)**i is pink/(peach is more literal). 

Seirin members are days of the week (Kagami is **** and Tuesday is ****, etc); Shutoku are Japanese mountains (Mt. Takao, Mt. Otsubo, etc); Uncrowned Kings are nature-related (Hayama has leaf in his name, Hanamiya has flower, etc), Touou are shrines (Imayoshi jinja, etc); Yosen's team's names are derived from ramen shops/food-related; Kirisaki Daichi names are hospitals; and Seiho's names come from castles. Kaijo names are rivers, I think.

These are from what I remember. I'm sure there's more, but the amount of thought that went into naming the characters is pretty amazing and it's a shame that it gets lost in translation. For example, the  in  (Teppei) means iron. 

Edited for clarification and to add Kaijo.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a place online that covers these in detail? I've checked the wiki, but they only cover Seirin's naming scheme.
>> ARTICLE
Not that I know of, probably because it's not definitive or canon. Seirin, iirc, was discussed in the Character Bible/Fanbook. I think the Uncrowned Kings are on the wiki. The rest is my own research. I could give you some of those resources, if you want. They're all in JPN and won't detail KnB though. They're things like databases, maps, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Haha just realized I forgot Momoi and was gonna add her. Nice info, didn't realize ALL of the teams had naming motifs!
>> ARTICLE
Some of it might be reaching (especially Yosen, which took the most research), but I refuse to believe that there being a Ramen Himuro or Okamura Noodle Houses are coincidences!

Yeah, what's crazy is that even the GoM and Uncrowned Kings could relate to the team's motif. There's a Murasakibar**U** chain restaurant, a Hanamiya hospital, a Mt. Midori in Hokkaido, and a Aominezan negoroji in Kagawa. If I had more free time, I would totally do more research on the other KnB names, but it took forever just to do the research I've already shared (parsing Kanji, going through hospital and river databases, maps, and general research on Japanese mountains and castles to confirm). Some day!
>> ARTICLE
Might as well finish it for those who don't know!

**(Midori)**ma = Green

**(Murasaki)**bara = Purple

**(Kuro)**ko = Black

And Kagami has "mirror" going for him, but no colour.
>> ARTICLE
Kagami's name in kanji is  which literally means fire god. Fire = red.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Kagami *does* have red hair but I personally don't like how it conflicts with Akashi. Also, it doesn't really work with Himuro and his ice kanji since his hair is black not blue. So I like to attribute the fire and ice thing more to their personalities than anything else. 
>> ARTICLE
That's amazing, I never looked into Himuro's name in characters before and how they parallel with Kagami's. Thanks for that!
>> ARTICLE
No problem! There's also the Tiger and Dragon parallel with their first names (Taiga and Tatsuya) if you weren't aware of that one either :)
>> ARTICLE
The hair doesn't match Himuro's name because he's not GoM calibre. As Aomine and Kise said, Kagami took a different path from the rest of the miracles; his name partly reflects that.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose that's true. But seriously, I really don't like Kagami being red. It should be orange goddammit. Fits the tiger motif, fits the fire motif. It'd be so much better!
>> ARTICLE
[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/ZHZSi36.jpg)

I miss baby Kuroko from the previous ED but this end card made it all better.

I haven't read the manga yet so I am unsure if something got skipped but it somehow feels like things are missing (though not sure exactly what). Also, I keep having this feeling everything will fall apart all the time and it still hasn't happened. It's driving me crazy.

Really looking forward to seeing what happens next episode. Noticed Akashi going all evil overlord on the preview so curious what that is about.
>> ARTICLE
Teiko arc is like watching a shakespearean tragedy, you know it's going to end in tears before it even starts.

I can't remember whether they touched on it in the manga, but I wish we got to see a little bit of Ogiwara's game.
>> ARTICLE
> you know it's going to end in tears before it even starts.

This is the perfect way to describe it. The titles of the episodes are ominous enough. I mean come on... it started with "a day with blue skies" then, "...sorry" and now, "we're no longer..." And that ending song for this arc gets sadder every time.
>> ARTICLE
They don't talk about Ogiwara's semi-final game. But Teiko's next opponents are the ones Ogiwara lost to.  Meaning we can see the players Ogiwara lost to. Maybe they'll even flashback a bit to Ogiwara's game during the final, I don't remember that much though.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really enjoying these flashback episodes, interesting to see how their characters formed. [Fights!](https://imgur.com/xf1Lzjt)

>> ARTICLE
I kinda wished they'd gave Kuroko's friend a bit more story, I mean, he's kinda the entire reason Kuroko picked up basketball (other than he saw it on TV) and he tried so hard because of his promise, then in an entire episode we meet him and lose him again? o.o
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko and his friend are currently 2nd years.

Incredibly minor spoiler [but](/s "They meet next year")
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh [so..](/s "they meet again in the present?")
>> ARTICLE
 No. Before then.
>> ARTICLE
uhh...

Currently in the flashback the Generation of Miracles are all in their 2nd year at **TEIKO** middle school. At this point Teiko are in the finals, and Ogiwara's (Kuroko's friend) team just lost. Meaning that they won't play each other **this year**.

Next year, the Generation of Miracles are in their 3rd year of Teiko middle school. [Teiko] (/s "get into the finals against Ogiwara's team. That is when Kuroko plays against his friend") (Same thing from last spoiler, literally not even a spoiler)

>> ARTICLE
[unnecessarily detailed spoiler](/s "Kuroko doesn't play against his friend tho, he gets injured in the semifinal, then the GoM toy with his friends team by getting the score to be only 1s, ending on a 111-11 score. That of course hurts his friend and Kuroko himself because he told his teammates to take his friends team seriously ")

Ahh thank you for clearing that up :p

Man... Why is everything so fucking depressing this episode...

True! I wish they devoted 6 episodes to this arc.

I really wanted to see Nijimura after middleschool, but he actually never makes an appearance. 

They gave him some attention and he was quite skilled, I honestly expected him to be a returning character. 

I was actually upset that he wasn't part of the series before/after the flashback.

Aomine is such a great character. I'm glad we're getting to see more of his past.

Indeed. He could be the main character of an anime. Hell, this could be called Aomine no Basket. ^^

That moment when Kuroko goes for the fist-bump, and then Aomine sullenly jogs past him. "The only one who can beat me, is me." 

Aomine yyyyy u heff 2 do dis? ;~;

"you avert your eyes when you're lying to me."

Aomine WHYYYYYYY
>> ARTICLE
Does this seem like it's progressing at light speed to anyone else...? I think I'm going to read the manga chapters for the flashback as well so I don't miss anything. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I heard from manga readers that some scenes are being omitted. 
>> ARTICLE
The OVAs (two of which are about the Teiko arc) have most of their material glossed over in these episodes.  If they didn't already use the Teiko material for OVAs, the progression would be a bit better.
>> ARTICLE
When should I watch the OVAs if I want to watch them in chronological order with this story arc?
>> ARTICLE
In the middle of this episode, when they first mention Kise and Kuroko meets him, watch the Kise OVA (Tip Off!, AKA 22.5).  It fits in rather nicely.

The Aomine OVA (41.5) is a bit trickier, since its more or less interspersed with the last and this episode since it covers Aomine meeting Kuroko and then his main plot within the Teiko arc. I'd say  you can just watch it after this episode since it just expands on what happens.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah honestly, it's become more of a summary of the past, rather than an actual story about the past.

It's completely understandable and I don't mind it in the least, because it's the only way they can finish the show this season.
>> ARTICLE
That end card is adorable.
>> ARTICLE
The ending song just came up at the right time.  Poor Aomine.  He had so much passion for the sport.

Ugh, the Daisuki video player always freezes during the first couple minutes.

All these baby faces, I might die.

also: wtf is with the downvotes on this episode thread.

I guess people don't like Kuroko? :/

No, it's not that. I see it in other shows as well.

Nah, many discussion threads are being downvoted. I don't know why people even care to do it.
>> ARTICLE
Last season and the one before it was the same, but in a week or two things should go back to normal... unless it's a very, very famous show.
>> ARTICLE
So what part of the story is it at right now?
>> ARTICLE
If you mean the manga, I believe this episode started at chapter 210.
>> ARTICLE
I meant more like events happening right now but chapter works too. Just curious how far it has gotten so far.
>> ARTICLE
Starts at Kise's entrance into the first string, ends with the semi final of the Nationals in the second year.
>> ARTICLE
Good stuff. It's nice to see in an anime that being "a genius" isn't always all roses. 

Curious to see what's up with multipersonality captain. 
>> ARTICLE
Aomine's change through this episode is so sad to watch...  
.  
Actually all of the characters are so much darker and closer to their future selves when they're first introduced now.  The contrast seems so wierd
>> ARTICLE
Guessing a big theme in the next episode will be Kuroko and his decision to go against them, just going by the preview.
>> ARTICLE
What a sad episode. You can see everyone changing. ;__;
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know why crunchyroll is behind by 2 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
I'm also curious about this.

Daisuki got a two-week exclusive on Kuroko's Basketball season 3, which is why Crunchy was able to get the show, but on a two-week delay. [Source: Crunchyroll mod.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-887173/kuroko-no-basket-3-being-delayed#49165101)
>> ARTICLE
I see thank you! I was reading through some of the posts on this thread and had no idea what was going on ahah, because I was following Crunchyroll's time. I didn't get spoiled though so I'm good.
>> ARTICLE
Really liked the Aomine back story. You can truly feel his depression of being the best. In just 2 episodes his character has changed drastically. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is always the heart of his team.  He's sooooo awesome
>> ARTICLE
Even though I read the corresponding chapters to this episode a while back, I was NOT emotionally prepared for this episode. That shot of Aomine all shaken up sitting at the poolside at the end, accompanied by that melancholy ending theme... AUGH.
>> ARTICLE
The GoM don't really have fantastic chemistry *with* each other... but that stands to reason, seeing as they were written more to have chemistry *against* each other, which they certainly do. I would much rather watch Yosen vs Shutoku than Murasakibara and Midorima play on the same team.
>> ARTICLE
Adding to what u/godblow said... Even if not on the court, they definitely were what you could call "friends" off the court and got into the typical middle schooler shenanigans together.... which is what kind of makes it even more sad that they're all enemies now. The anime definitely is focusing more on the basketball action aspect though, which is understandable since it is first and foremost a sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
It really provides an explanation as to why the Generation split up after in the middle school in the first place. I'm sure they were fed up with each other, winning games way too easily, and the oppressive team atmosphere of Teiko.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, having two GOM on the same team would be boring because they'd win everytime.
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga. It shows better chemistry between the players during the Teikou arc. A lot of the bonding elements were cut due to the contrained episode schedule for this season -- they're cramming everything into this final season.
>> ARTICLE
>  final season

Is this the final season??

Yeah. The manga finished last year.

I never really paid mind to Shuutoku because I prefer some of the other GoM's teams. But damn, that scene with Takao and Midorima as they were walking out after the match was tragic. Especially since the ever-joking Takao was the one to break first. 
>> ARTICLE
Am I going crazy or was the subs I was reading saying "Iduki" not "Izuki"
>> ARTICLE
They were probably trying to be consistent with [official sources](http://i.imgur.com/WaL8j8G.jpg). Also, a [screencap](http://i.imgur.com/cOstEoI.jpg) from episode 50. 
>> ARTICLE
It said Iduki. In other forms of media his name gets both styled as Izuki AND Iduki. Both pronouncd as i-zu-ki of course.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of like Light/Raito I suppose?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for further clarification on WHY it might be stylized as both... It's probably because there's two ways to "spell" the "zu" sound in Japanese. It would either beor  (though the latter character is technically pronounced "dzu" ... subtle difference). Izuki's name just happens to use the dzu () character. And if you're typing with an English-standard keyboard that can also type Japanese characters, the way you'd get the dzu () character to show up on your screen is by typing the letters "du," while typing "zu" would get you the zu () character. So all the official merchandise and whatnot says "Iduki." While most fansubs and manga scanlations use "Izuki," so you're not confused as to how it's pronounced. Unfortunate and weird circumstances.

shits intense right from the start.

Just want to point out the link to Daisuki is for episode 6/56, not the newest one.

[This week's end end card.](http://i.imgur.com/yIU7Oms.jpg)

Takao and Midorima crying was something I didn't expect. Now Midorima looks even more human (not that he didn't, especially compared to Akashi these last few episodes).

Kise is too OP but he is too cool doing it, so I wouldn't request a nerf. We need that OPness in this series.

Looking forward to what happens in this match. I kept grinning the whole time when it started, considering how hyped they all were.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is like DBZ. With every new enemy they power up to the point of crazyness. So Good!
>> ARTICLE
If I were Kise, I'd be shooting only threes while in PC mode. Mix and match the following: 

* Emperor Eye
* Aomine's streetball crossover moves
* Aomine's change of pace
* Hyuga's  barrier jumper 

and finish off with one of the following depending on the situation:

* Midorima's unlimited range high projectile 3
* Sakurai quick release shot
* Mirage shot

With the EE, he can even try for a 4 point play.
>> ARTICLE
~~He still can't copy Kuroko though right?~~ Edit: Mirage  Phantom nvm
>> ARTICLE
His body can't handle Aomoine change of pace . Seeing as he messed up his foot
>> ARTICLE
Was Kise's fake a travelling? I saw him returning from the jump and heard the sound of his shoes twice.
>> ARTICLE
Wondering that too. In the manga (c185) it's ambiguous as to whether or not he was already in the air when receiving the pass, but in this episode he clearly takes a step, jumps, lands, then dribbles. Looks like travelling to me. 

Edit: I scoured some other forums and other people think it's traveling too. The only benefit of the doubt it's getting is that it's possible Kise [never lifted his right foot from the ground](http://i.imgur.com/iPaDOYu.gif) after the fake. However, if you listen, it sounds like two feet hit the ground, which could be an honest mistake from the sound design team. All in all, it's a really messy sequence. 
>> ARTICLE
i mean the sound of his heel hitting the floor could make a sound too
>> ARTICLE
he simply perfectly copied the noise of landing with vocal sound effects
>> ARTICLE
Was expectng Kuroko to make an awkward forced laugh there at the end

Even though I read the manga I got nervous and scared when Kuroko said [Spoiler?](/s "I give up")

Don't need a spoiler for discussing the series up to this point ;)

I wonder how its gonna turn out :O
>> ARTICLE
They're really condensing it so they can finish the final in 8 eps... 
>> ARTICLE
They already adapted a decent chunk of the material in the OVAs, so I doubt those parts will be touched on again.
>> ARTICLE
I also assume they'll be releasing another OVA relating to the arc.
>> ARTICLE
I like this arc because it shows us what made the GOM such arrogant assholes when we first are introduced to them and it's great to see their interactions and how they played.
>> ARTICLE
Was weird seeing Aomine defend Kuroko that hard to give him another shot.
>> ARTICLE
They're skipping a lot of stuff that builds up to that point.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure some of it is in the ovas. But yeah, the arc in the manga was heartbreaking. Rushing it isn't really doing it justice. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'm kinda ok with how they handled this episode, I don't think they will skip the best/important parts. After all, this is one of the best adaptations I've seen (on another note, I'm mad at what happened with Tokyo Ghoul, but that isn't relevant here)
>> ARTICLE
A number of those scenes were skipped for a good reason. They were conversations that Kuroko wasn't privy to. 

Like these scenes for example:

I just want to hug them all.
>> ARTICLE
The music was so good when Kuroko got going. Holy shit I got goosebumps. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally I loved this episode! Easily my favourite of the season :)
>> ARTICLE
Same here. It's a welcome change to get some character development into this season that has been mostly non-stop games :)
>> ARTICLE
An Opening not sung by Granrodeo? My OCD senses are tingling.
>> ARTICLE
its sung by Kuroko's va who did season 2's second ending
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers, could you maybe tell me what chapter I should start from so that I can read the cut out material? I don't want to miss anything.
>> ARTICLE
Starts chapter 204 I believe
>> ARTICLE
I dislike that they're making Teiko arc only 4 episodes and dedicating the rest of the season to the final game because the final match in the manga drags on way too long, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Some of what was originally in the Teiko arc was already touched on in the ovas though. It would be a waste of time to elaborate on it. 

But yeah, the last goddamn match. It took up like what, 60+ chapters? I know I was reading that shit for at least a year. How the hell do you drag a match on for 8 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know it would be redundant to retread what's already been shown in the OVA. I would just rather extend Teiko a bit more because it's such an essential part of the story that anime viewers might not fully appreciate (or understand) the effect Teiko had on the characters and not letting viewers experience it is doing them a disservice. Or just pare the final game because it draaaags, put in a filler beach episode or that one where Kuroko and Momoi go on a date, anything! 

I don't have an exact number, but I know that one match was stretched over 10 months, for sure. If the episodes are anything like the manga, one episode will span, like, 10 seconds of game time.  20, if we're lucky. I'm exaggerating, but I think it'll be drawn out.
>> ARTICLE
It started at chapter 232, ended at chapter 275, so that's 43 chapters. Slam Dunk's last match in comparison was 53 chapters.
>> ARTICLE
One episode per 5 minutes of game time actually isn't that far off of normal.  Most games just only cover chunks of the game.  I imagine (haven't read) that this game doesn't do that.
>> ARTICLE
They're all so adorable being a little younger, Aomine espcially! :D

>> ARTICLE
Wow, it's nice to see the backstory of the GoM, and how it started from scratch. I think placing this arc before Seirin vs. Rakuzan is an amazing choice, considering Akashi was the one who first recognized Kuroko's unconventional potential. It's going to be a great game.

I've read on the thread that the arc feels rushed, that this one episode covered 5 chapters, and that the whole arc is going to be 3 more episodes. As an anime-only watcher, I'll only say that I didn't see anything wrong with the pacing. Anyway, I'll just read the arc in the manga 3 weeks from now to get the things that were cut.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so they cut a ton of material.
>> ARTICLE
The Final game will probably take 5 or 6 Episodes so they have 8 Episodes for the Teiko arc. It should be enough but  it really felt rushed. They shouldnt have cut out that much 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the final match should be bout 8 but the pacing felt incredibly rushed. It probably should have ended at kuroko's "welcome to the first string"
>> ARTICLE
damn I have to stop watching it weekly when the seirin vs rakuzan match begins the wait will kill me 
>> ARTICLE
They don't seem to be cutting things I consider important (mostly montage-y stuff, some Haizaki stuff; scenes I recall being in the OVAs), except for, like, a scene with the coaches, which I find incredibly important. ._. (Remember: the Aomine stuff is covered in the second Touou/Seirin game in the manga, which is, in turn, covered in one of the OVAs)
>> ARTICLE
Well seeing kuroko's being outclassed I consider important to showing how far he came. Right now he feels like kise and he just got magically good rather than the hard work you see in manga
>> ARTICLE
I also thought thats totally weird. Espicially after they made a recap episode and dragged that Haizaki-Kise match on for so long. 
>> ARTICLE
It seems weird that they basically used two episodes of Teiko arc material for OVA's, I think it would have made more sense to tell the whole story in this arc
>> ARTICLE
wait so should I watch the ovas?
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't hurt. They were also pretty good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
For anyone wondering, this episode covers chapters 204-209. It seems a bit too rushed imo, and made the events look less significant than what they were supposed to be. As someone who really enjoyed this arc (made me like my favorite character even more), I'd recommend reading it as well. Edit: on another note, the opening looked really nice, especially the part where Kuroko passes.
>> ARTICLE
If I was to read up to the end of this arc, would it spoil anything really major for the final?
>> ARTICLE
The only real thing it spoils is what they mean when they say there are two Akashis, which is important to the final game.
>> ARTICLE
Since the flashback arc is before the final in the manga, I don't see a way it would spoil it for you. You will just see what happens in the next episodes beforehand, in further detail.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I already sort of ruined one detail when I was looking at the wiki so I'm paranoid about not learning any more lol.
>> ARTICLE
Whoosh!
>> ARTICLE
I thoroughly enjoyed this episode. I like the Teiko arc it is very interesting to see the characters develop together and how the dynamic changed between then and now.

Tbh I was getting kind of bored with the last couple episodes and this has resparked the passion.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think I'd grow to like Akashi so much in one episode.    
Wonderful to see the friendship between Kuroko and Aomine in their middle school days. Weird seeing him so friendly though.:P
>> ARTICLE
I really like how the flashback arc helps you sympathize with him a bit more. He isn't batshit crazy and he's actually a very nice person. Makes you wonder what led him to become who he is now.
>> ARTICLE
So I'm in love with this show. What's the best way for me to support it? A crunchy roll pass or something like that?
>> ARTICLE
Well the manga is over, so this will be the last season of it.

There's a sequel going at the moment, but you only get a chapter every two months so its going to take forever to get anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers is it better to just read the Manga for this part or did the anime not cut out a lot? 
>> ARTICLE
It felt really rushed to me to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
The stuff they cut is mostly small scenes that are just there for mood setting. I feel like they're mostly just extending normal scenes to do that mood setting instead. There's also like two scenes that are cut because they were in one of the release-only episodes/OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Which ova episodes were that cause i didnt watch them
>> ARTICLE
"Episode 41.5" covers Aomine meeting Kuroko for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
i can't seem to find it anywhere do you remember where you watched it?
>> ARTICLE
It's probably not available on any legal streaming site, if that's what you're wondering. You can definitely find it through other means if you google enough.
>> ARTICLE
There's also Tip off. http://myanimelist.net/anime/16916/Kuroko_no_Basket:_Tip_Off
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed reading the manga, but they did cut a bit.
>> ARTICLE
So is this the last episode of the season? 
>> ARTICLE
Nope. There'll be 26 eps.
>> ARTICLE
I should have phrased this better.. is this a two-cour where the 2nd half is in like summer or fall or something, or will this continue into the Spring season? 
>> ARTICLE
It will continue into the spring. 
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic! Thanks to both of you. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't even care that this show is corny and the players have superpowers, it just gives that " :3 " feeling and I love it.

It was refreshing to see the GoM as the good guys again, akashi before he was a conceited dick, and aomine before he was jaded.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly they should spend more time on this arc. I disliked how they just went from Kuroko wanting to borrow the gym to him crying for literally 5 seconds and then to his 1st string test, it felt like he progressed too quickly, even though that wasn't the case in the manga.

On the other hand, Seirin vs Rakuzan was criminally dragged, each chapter only showed 1 or 2 baskets scored, I'm sure they could cut that down in the anime instead of this amazing arc.
>> ARTICLE
I think they should have used a minute to show a montage of Kuroko's progression into third string.

http://i.imgur.com/W0ETvyE.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/0Cx0Gij.jpg

But the rest of Kuroko's progression closely followed the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I swear this website has the same commercial everytime

>> ARTICLE
I feel like the title of this series would make more sense if it started with Kuroko finally becoming a part of the Teiko basketball team, then becoming unhappy with how the team gradually grows apart, and finally showing how kuroko wanted to prove his basketball philosophy to his old teammates.
>> ARTICLE
Weird how just going a few years back into the past changes the feel from extreme tension to super strong feels and an emotional story about Kuroko finding himself and chasing his dream... Really loving this arc soooo much
>> ARTICLE
Damn I feel really bad for Kuroko when he was talking to Aomine.. he went to help a friend and was told he was unnecesary...

Also , Evil Akashi is frightening as hell.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi is now Kira from Death Note, Kuroko going to be his L?
>> ARTICLE
Watashi wa Kuroko Desu!! <cue dramatic music>
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if his left eye's colour change will ever be explained. :P
>> ARTICLE
It was kind of explained this episode but I'll tag it just in case. [Kuroko no Basket Spoilers](/s "The second eye color is his new persona. He got it when he was about to lose to Murasakibara, that's what the whole negative scene was. It's basically to symbolize that "Emperor Akashi" has taken over and Akashi Seijuro has been lost.")
>> ARTICLE
Is it possible in real life for eyes to change color? 
>> ARTICLE
Eye colour can change naturally in real life.

> Wikipedia: *"Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during puberty, early childhood, pregnancy, and sometimes after serious trauma (like heterochromia) do represent cause for plausible argument to state that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body."*  

[Here is a picture of what heterochromia looks like.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Heterochromia.jpg)  
See anything familiar? O:  

The excess or lack of melanin can apparently cause this disorder.  
... Or that Akashi became pregnant with Kuroko's baby. :P
>> ARTICLE
People'es eye colour can change just because of hormonal stuff like puberty and pregnancy? TIL
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know who i should feel the most sorry for anymore.
 
* Aomine is just a guy that loves B-Ball but he is just so good at it that nobody around him can understand him anymore.
* Midorima was just an above average guy until everybody around him started to change.
* And Kuroko don't even get me started on this poor guy.
 
 
So many feels in a single episode.
>> ARTICLE
I feel bad for Akashi. Apparently he grew up in such a way that created his unhealthy obsession with victory
>> ARTICLE
That's going to make it all the more sweet when he loses and his ideals come crashing down around him. I can't wait to see his reaction to losing.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, even if it's not intentional, the continuing erraticism of the bits and pieces of story really add to the atmosphere of the overall story. Like, the first episode of the arc tells a very cohesive story, but as this arc continues, it begins to break apart and things are glossed over in a way that really makes it feel like the team is falling apart, which feels like a very mature and interesting stylistic decision (whether intentional or not).

It's so interesting to see how each character reacts to this schism, and I'm really curious on what the old head coach would've done had he not been forced to leave. It's pretty clear he understood how Aomine felt and understood what it took to keep the team together, but circumstances basically forced that to stop.

One thing I do miss from the manga though is the obsessive focus Other!Akashi has on the words of Teiko and the coach's explanation of what the words really mean.
>> ARTICLE
I think it wouldn't have mattered. The scene with the new head coach and the principal or whoever that was would have just been repeated. If the old head coach had refused, he'd have been fired until the principal guy had found a lackey who would do his bidding.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I thought Akashi had his Emperor Eye long before the events in this flashback, and that's why everyone obeyed him. I guess he was just really good at basketball, huh.
>> ARTICLE
It's more than that actually, I think it will get revealed later on.

The one on one was one of my favorite manga moments, it spawns evil akashi and he's awesome

[This week's end card...](http://i.imgur.com/w9NWgUe.jpg)

...was probably the calmest thing in this episode. Episode was quite depressing. I am certain I heard something break [here](http://i.imgur.com/AYjTsWw.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/gCJODjw.jpg) (and on quite a few more scenes). Not sure who I should feel bad for since they all seem to have lost something then.

Seeing ~~the monster~~ [the emperor](http://i.imgur.com/vpqniDA.jpg) ~~being born~~ appearing was quite something, too. Never expected Murasakibara to be the cause to have that happen (he wasn't solely the cause, of course, but the immediate one that we saw).

I am liking this arc but I feel so sorry for everyone pretty much :/

Aw that end card is adorable :3

This arc really cements how 'anime' this series is. I mean yeah we have a guy who can shoot full court threes, a guy who can trip you by just looking at you, and a guy who can go invisible but this one is basically anime: the episode (which isn't necessarily bad).

We have the moment of nihilistic realization that transforms the ultimate badass w/ cathedral music in the background. We have the ex-friend thinks you're nothing scene (add to that, in the rain). A lot of eye enlargment/pupil shrinking. The girl and voice of reason tries to reach out and keep everything together. Crazy dramatization over a *middle school* coaching decision as well as a father/leader figure suddenly becoming ill.
>> ARTICLE
Everything you described makes this series great, in my books :D
>> ARTICLE
Essentially, Shirogane the head coach, Nijimura, and a benign Akashi had been barely holding a team full of burgeoning talent together. Once Nijimura retired, Shirogane got hospitalized, and Akashi changed, the team lost their pillars of emotional support and discipline, and started to fall apart.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes it seems our one true emperor has finally awoken 
>> ARTICLE
So apparently, to save time, they completely cut out characters from the Final game they just played. It's possible we'll still see the *Twins*, but I don't think we will.

------------------------

I made an album comparing Manga to Anime. Nothing too different this episode (besides the *Twins*), but it's still nice to see the Manga sometimes.

http://imgur.com/a/xrJQZ

Also I have made a previous comparison album. Although in this one, you can see the differences between Manga Akashi and Anime Akashi. (Ie. "**Know your place**" in the manga. "*Lower your head*" in anime. (**EDIT: This is probably just the translation's fault**))

http://imgur.com/a/XBvDb#0 

------------------------

More comparisons! This time Kise.

http://imgur.com/a/XuRM5
>> ARTICLE
Great comparisons, man.

I don't read the manga, but looking at this scene: http://i.imgur.com/iumlt7I.jpg

I feel it was done much better in the manga than the anime.

The manga sort of gives you a towering, almighty figure (the shading really helps portray this as well) as opposed to the "Hey, I just popped out of nowhere" image that I felt when I saw it in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I would have loved if that line had been there. The impact it would've had would have been amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think they have to include the twins somehow since they are a prime motivator for what happens in the final match. They let to the chat which is eluded to in the preview.
>> ARTICLE
That translation is not at fault. As someone who is learning Japanese and I have asked my Japanese friend for confirmation. Lower your head is actually the more accurate translation. She said it goes back to the Shogun days when the head dude would walk around and his subservients would bow down to him and if their head was too high he would say "zu ga takai."  "Know your place" was the manga scanlators taking liberties with their interpretation. 
>> ARTICLE
Fascinating.

If that's the case, then I'd have to applaud the translators who did "Know your place". 

The phrase just has so much power to it, and really does emphasize Akashi's character. 

Odd how the contrast between "Lower your head" and "Know your place" is so drastic. Maybe the fact that the former has 4 syllables, while the latter has 3, makes the execution of the phrase so much stronger in English. 

I will continue associating "Know your place" with Akashi though. To me it's a staple of his character. But it's good to know about that translation, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I actually like like "lower your head" as apposed to "know your place" and i'll explain why. 

I just saw the play "The king and I" where the rule was that no-one were to ever hold their head higher then the kings under any circumstances. It had a comical effect in the play where the king would deliberately lower his head further and further so his subjects would have to lower their heads even lower, It was pretty funny and the king is one of my favourite characters ever so hearing it said by akashi when he was dominating shutoku  had the opposite effect from the play and really made me see this guy as a king or, in this case, an emperor.
>> ARTICLE
> "Know your place" in the manga. "Lower your head" in anime

I've seen you bring this point up before, but I don't think it's worth obsessing over. Now, I don't speak Japanese, but I would think that Akashi says the same thing here in the manga and the anime, and the difference is only in the translation. I don't know whether it was the anime translator who underestimated or the manga translator who overestimated the threat level in Akashi's line here, but my point is that you shouldn't blame the anime for this change and blame the translators instead.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I knew I was forgetting something.

I didn't mean to say it was the anime's fault for Akashi's line. I figured it was a translation error at the time too, completely forgot about it now though.
>> ARTICLE
damn excellent episode throughout.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone ever wondered what would have happened if Kagami started on Teiko? 
>> ARTICLE
Kagami was in america that time, i believe. When Kuroko joined in the present team. Years later?
>> ARTICLE
He did say "wondered".  
>> ARTICLE
how long will this arc last ?
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's supposed to be 4 episodes ([source](https://twitter.com/kurobasanime/status/583489739258363904)) so the next one should be the last in this arc.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this episode was really good, it not only showed how everything started to fall apart, but it also shows us why they see themselves as gods compared to everyone else. As Aomine was giving up, i couldn't help but get flashbacks from when Kuroko and Kagami went up against him (the second time) and how he was finally able to go up against someone who hadn't given up because they were losing, it gives that match much more feeling. Also the coach killed the head coach.."as long as he is around-" "head coach falls"....
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Just like with the zone (electricity), ignite pass kai (wind) and Thor's hammer (wind), which are just as exaggerated in the manga, the glowing eye is a stylistic/symbolic effect that isn't meant to be taken literally. 
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it:

The anime over-exaggerates legit basketball moves/plays and character abilites/traits so anime watchers with a gap in their basketball knowledge can understand just how good those players are and it makes it a lot more exciting and interesting for them. 

It also draws people in to doing sports which is always phenomenal because almost every sport is a healthy hobbie and I wish more people would regularly participate in one and become part of a (mostly) awesome community.
>> ARTICLE
Even then, only about half of the top tier characters are really exaggerated(Kuroko/Midorima/Akashi), other than the fact that it's set in high school.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Akashi is essentially a god, so it's only natural for him to have a choir.

Saying Akashi is a Chuuni is just silly. He doesn't do any Chuuni-esque things besides coming across as a lil' edgy. Just because he's special doesn't mean he's a chuunibyou.
>> ARTICLE
wow you need to call out nearly every shounen/LN protagonist from the last 5 years for being a chunni if you call out Akashi

Example: Kirito, Tatsuya
>> ARTICLE
Is this it no more episodes of Kuroko? :( pls tell me im wrong or something 
Sorry if thats a stupid question:O

[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/3IB9cvC.jpg)  

About the end card, I like how Mayuzumi casts a shadow, implying he is not a real shadow, while Kuroko doesn't have one.

I knew better specs wouldn't hold Kuroko back for long, I mean who cares about a v2 when v1 is Kuroko!?!

Now the question is, what will happen with OP Akashi...so tempted to check these spoilers about next episode but I will persevere!
>> ARTICLE
I like how it says "see you next week" while the end card features the two you aren't suppose to see.
>> ARTICLE
Another thing the endcard illustrates is the Overwriting; Kuroko is now in Mayuzumi's shadow.
>> ARTICLE
I've noticed this for a long time, but it is still funny to see that everyone knows someone's "special move name" when someone in the audience points it out
>> ARTICLE
Or someone in the audience talking and the players on the court responding on it. Do they have superhearing or what?
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure the comptition heads put it in the game guidebooks so thay the crowd wouldn't feel left out. Names make eveything cooler 
>> ARTICLE
Found it hilarious that the other other team members were annoyed at the the one guy shouting his special moves *every time*.
>> ARTICLE
I got goosebumps seeing Kagami get back in the zone. I love this anime and it makes me sad to think it's almost over. 
>> ARTICLE
I like how Kensho Ono's ZERO was played when Kuroko was making his comeback on the court. Really suits the situation since it can be considered Kuroko's own Character Song.
>> ARTICLE
Still the best anime that's running right now in my opinion, holy shit. These episodes just get better and better.
>> ARTICLE
...? This is just like Fairy Tail, but instead of fighting it is basketball.

Friendship > Skills 
>> ARTICLE
If you look at Kuroko like that, anime, or normal series in general, must not be very fun for you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I usually don't like series like Naruto, Kuroko no Basket, Fairy Tail--, but I like some scenes though, just not the friendship crap.

Weird that I enjoy One Piece a lot though, but One Piece is more about willpower instead of friendship.
>> ARTICLE
My point was that, while Kuroko contains friendship aspects, it is at an acceptale level that only enhances team play, and team spirit. It doesn't suddenly make them more skilled, or better, it just makes them do their best. This is something we also see in a lot of other shows, especially shows about sports, and I think it's a good part about them.
>> ARTICLE
though it's not even in my top 3 of currently running anime, it's still really, REALLY good. I might have numbed a bit since I read the manga and know most of what's going to happen, but it's still great. (I just think JoJo, Ore Monogatari and Shokugeki are better)
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, what are your top 3 currently running animes?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not the guy you asked but my top 3 currently airing are F/SN: UBW, Oregairu, and DanMachi.  Honorable mentions of Kuroko, Baby Steps, and Kekkai Sensen.
>> ARTICLE
Is DanMachi actually good? I dismissed it after watching 2 or 3 episodes as a generic adventure show that people liked because it was generic. Is that true or should I actually consider picking the show back up?
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching it, it feels like what Sword Art Online would have been like if the show went full harem and if Kirito wasn't overpowered at all stages. The only difference from average generic harem MCs is that he seems more shy/flustered than oblivious so far.
>> ARTICLE
it's not perfect. I like it for the adventure and world parts, but could do without the harem and simplistic romance triangles
>> ARTICLE
i dropped it after a couple episodes as well it just seems fairly average and my one friend is still watching it but he says its nothing special.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I thought it was nothing much until the recent episode (ep7). It got REALLY good episode 7, I'd say SAO season 1 good at episode 7.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 8 actually. Danmachi suddenly rivaled SAO S1 and Fate UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I have to be honest, this changes from week to week, but I'd have to say:

1. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders Part 2
2. Ore Monogatari
3. Kekkai Sensen or Shokugeki no Soma
>> ARTICLE
Kekkai Sensen is actually really good, too. But I just prefer the lightheartedness Kuroko no Basket presents me with. I read the manga chapters that corresponded to this week's episode, and it definitely lessened my enjoyment, so even though I'm tempted to, I won't read any more of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Staying up till 2 in the morning for this payed off!
>> ARTICLE
Not too much happening yet, but this is just the setup for the brawl to come, I am sure of that.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing much is happening but all I'm seeing is Akashi becoming crazier and crazier... I'm afraid of if/once he snaps.
>> ARTICLE
I know right. I can't wait for that epic final brawl to come. I don't even care who wins anymore as long as I get to see an epic showdown.
>> ARTICLE
Oh gods seeing Seirin lose momentum is still as soul crushing as in the manga. Hang in there guys!!

Loved the Zero in the soundtrack there.

Also: [Next episode spoilers](/s "Next episode will give more Koga and Izuki action. Oh boy.")

Oh yeah, true :(

How does the crowd know the second Kagami enters the zone? Do red sparks start appearing beside his eyes?

You just have to go with it.  Just like how does the crowd hear the conversation between players on the court.

Does anybody else experience playback issues on Daisuki?
For me, the video just stops every 2 minutes or so and resumes after about 10 seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Same which is why I ended up watching crunchyroll's even though they are 2 weeks late (and thats why im commenting so late haha)
>> ARTICLE
I get that all the time too, not sure why though. I thought it might have something to do with Adblock. 

What browser are you using?
>> ARTICLE
Chrome. And I'm using uBlock in place of Adblock.
>> ARTICLE
I use Firefox and Adblock Edge (?), I have a feeling it just has to do with the ads on Daisuki. I only say this because I disabled my Adblocker for Daisuki a while ago, and I feel like there hasn't been any pausing since.

I'd recommend at least trying it *(disable blocker)*, and seeing how it goes. If that doesn't help, then I have no idea. :(

The problem persists, even with safari. Maybe I'll try out Firefox.

I sometimes have the player skip back and then catch up.

I felt like Aomine was foreshadowing something with his talk about Kagami going "deeper in the Zone" but I don't know if that's just how it got translated. Pretty hyped to see if there is another level though, Kuroko isn't turning this on his own.

Also Koga better get as much screen time as the preview implied.

Let's just say that Kuroko's pretty good with locks.
>> ARTICLE
That technical foul that Hyuga got hurt to watch. But it was great from a story perspective, we haven't seen any of those before in the series I'm pretty sure. It's totally understandable to want to argue a call in that situation though. I'd have done the same.

Wow in that scene where Kagami goes into the Zone and backs away he looks like a scary wild beast.

Just Wow

Teiko Arc's OP
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much!
>> ARTICLE
Mayuzumi failed at misdirection basics when he held on to the ball (which is the most attention-grabbing object on the court) for more than a couple of seconds on each play. However, Akashi has to take part of the blame for passing him the ball when his presence was already rising.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love this show! I marathoned 52 episodes in 3 days just because its that good. Can't believe its almost done...
OH! And am I the only person who genuinely DOES NOT LIKE AKASHI?
>> ARTICLE
Has it already been said whether or not Kuroko is able to enter the zone? (haven't read the manga so no spoilers please ;)

>> ARTICLE
I believe it's been hinted at that he **CANNOT**.

You have to be **good** and love basketball to enter the zone. Kuroko does not meet all the requirements. 

But hey, you never know! :\^)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, in my opinion Kuroko is "good" and LOVES basketball, but maybe not the good that the 'cruel' zone will accept.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's great at his set of skills, but not even comparable to the likes of the other GoM.
>> ARTICLE
He loves basketball 100%.

But he just isn't anywhere close to the same level as Aomine, Kagami, or Murasakibara... He's got some situational talent, but his base stats/fundamentals just aren't good enough for zone.

His trade-off for not being good is that he has no presence, which allows for his special skillset. And even though his skillset makes him good, it's completely different than the fundamentals.

But hey, this is anime, and anything could happen!  
>> ARTICLE
I would argue that Kuroko's always within the zone. Sure, in this universe the zone works differently, but in our reality it's really just a boost in concentration, and anyone that ever tried to control other people's lines of sight knows how hard it is.
>> ARTICLE
yeah but they arent talking about rl "being in the zone" they are talking about this anime's "zone" :p
>> ARTICLE
The animation was spot on this episode, you could really feel Hyuga's pain.
>> ARTICLE
Akashi, you are one of stone-cold son of a bitch. Mayuzumi is gonna quit the basketball team after this game, I'm sure.

Hyuuga's breakdown hurt a lot. He lost it. But I was glad to see Kuroko going back to the court, and even better, pushing Mayuzumi into the light and himself retreating into the shadows once more.

Pure build-up episode seeing as we're entering the latter half of the 3rd quarter, which is definitely gonna be another critical point in the game.
>> ARTICLE
Probably not,just wait and watch until the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Mayuzumi would quit after this anyway as he will graduate.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, didn't know he was a third year.

It bothers me how easily the refs can be controlled, normal refs definitely wouldn't call every penalty or faked penalty that happens out there. It's just not possible for them.

One of the biggest stories that is currently going on in the NBA finals is the flopping of Harden and Paul. [They even got parodied in the latest Game of Zones](https://youtu.be/Ho4ETotsrrE?t=150).

The fact that the manga has ended and that this is the last match; that's what says there isnt a 4th season :p

Never mind then, they'll win.

Haha yeah :p I mean, i would be quite the twist if they lost... but I doubt it

I've watched enough shonen anime to KNOW They'll win.Kuroko seems like he's thinking something over.I'd say we're in for a H U G E suprise.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to call it. Kuroko will use the ZONE. During his zone, his misdirection will return and his phantom shoot will have 100% accuracy.
>> ARTICLE
Phantom Shot is no use if he can't get past Akashi. Imo,either the team gets morale back up in order to win or taiga and the captain will do all the work.

It's because they've lost once I'd be surprised if they would lose again.

3 episodes for the first half. We have 6/7 more episodes for the rest of the game.

The actual frames of this episode looked a bit poor, but there were moments of amazing *animation*. The directing has been great, though; you can feel the pressure ramping up.

[Kuroko is 168](http://kurokonobasuke.wikia.com/wiki/Tetsuya_Kuroko)
>> ARTICLE
I'm the same height. I wonder if I can dunk too. I can jump pretty high but I just never tried it.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately it's never that easy.

My mate is 177 and he can dunk a tennis ball. He also trains his legs, like A LOT. 

What I'm trying to say is, it takes a lot of training. Akashi is top tier at everything, that includes physical prowess. 

Also, an alley-oop dunk is a lot easier because you don't have to bring the ball up yourself.

I'm 175 and I can slap the rim on a good jump, it's possible you could have the same result.
>> ARTICLE
If I do it I'll take a video and post it in one of these threads. 
>> ARTICLE
Im not sure what makes alley oops easier? With a normal dunk i have control of the ball the entire way up, whereas on an oop, i have to focus some on catching the ball in such a way i have enough control for it to not slap the rim and fly out.

Not sure why i wrote so much on this small thing, but yea
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I meant that alley-oop dunks are easier for shorter people. Just because how *hard* it is for them to bring up the ball themselves for the dunk.

Akashi really only gets his fingers on the ball for the dunk, and his fingers only touch the rim afterwards as well. 

If Akashi were to self dunk, he'd just slam the ball of the rim. It's just impossible for a short player to hold the ball in a proper position to dunk. Mostly due to the orientation of their hand to the ball, and how they physically can't get their wrist about the rim.

It's weird to picture, but I hope I could get my point across.
>> ARTICLE
176 here! We make out 175 176 177!
>> ARTICLE
Someone please explain how Mayuzumi can use misdirection *and* handle the ball and shoot like a normal player, while Kuroko can't.  


I distinctly remember the anime saying that Kuroko's misdirection is a learned skill that is enhanced by his lack of presence. Even if he lost his lack of presence, he should still have misdirection (even if a bit less effective).
>> ARTICLE
Mayuzumi has just enough skill to be good enough to make **basic** shots, while also being able to maintain misdirection.

I'll try to make it somewhat visual.

----

Kuroko stats are.

  3/10 - Physical Ability

  5/10 - Technique

  5/10 - Stamina

Mayuzumi's stats are.

6/10 - Physical Ability

6/10 - Technique

6/10 - Stamina

Lets say that anything equal to **6 and under** makes you able to be trained to use Misdirection. So they both qualify for misdirection, except Mayuzumi has a better stat-line. 

Probably the biggest thing is that Kuroko has a fuckton of flashy moves now, which made him get noticed. While Mayuzumi doesn't have any Shounen shots (at least we haven't seen), therefor he is able to make basic shots while maintaining Misdirection. Of course if Mayuzumi started making a ton of shots, he'd lose his misdirection, theoretically. 

So what I'm trying to say is Mayuzumi is a Basic bitch who is just average enough to learn misdirection. While Kuroko is worse fundamentally.

>> ARTICLE
>6/10 Stamina

>6/10 Stamina

>6/10 Stamina

Whoops.
>> ARTICLE
lag :\^)
>> ARTICLE
You also have to take into account the monsters that Mayuzumi has as teammates. It's impossible to stand out in a team like that unless you are incredibly good. 
>> ARTICLE
Mibuchi told Akashi to stop passing to him after his battle with Hyuga had a clear winner. Now why would Rakuzan stop attacking through a position it was clearly dominating? When I think about it, it became clear to me that it was Rakuzan's (probably Akashi's) nefarious plan to destroy Seirin at every position, to sink them into a state of total helplessness and despair. Just scoring more points wasn't enough, they wanted to completely demoralize the entire team. It's probably no coincidence they picked Hyuga first, since he's the captain.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what zone ability Kuroko would have
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT IMAGINE A FULL-COURT PHANTOM SHOT!

They'd probably call it IGNITE PHANTOM-SHOT KAI!
>> ARTICLE
No way. It'll be like Zone Overflow or something, and his ENTIRE TEAM will disappear....

OR

Everyone on the court except that person disappears, so everyone is in like a little isolation bubble where they can see anyone else.
>> ARTICLE
[Love the end card this week.](http://i.imgur.com/0tGpy9z.jpg)

Everything looks so grim for Seirin, yet I really enjoyed the episode (especially when Furihata joined the game). I am really hoping for a come back from Seirin though I have no idea if a miracle will happen or not >.<

Edit : Forgot to mention but I really like how all others that are watching the game keep commenting on it (opponents or allies). Some great reactions there.
>> ARTICLE
Rekt
>> ARTICLE
Seirin looks doomed at this point. Although they'll still make a come back. No idea how but they'll do it. 
>> ARTICLE
Well that was depressing.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part about this episode is that they're literally using all the members on the team for this game. I really liked that the three first years got development at the very end with this and Kaijo. While it might not have been needed, it wss a really nice touch and I appreciate it 
>> ARTICLE
I love that Kuroko is a love letter to Slam Dunk.

>> ARTICLE
How so? I tried to get into Slam Dunk but I just couldn't quite get into the old animations lol. Plus I actually like how ridiculous KnB is.
>> ARTICLE
I was talking about the manga and specially the last game, lot of similarities with this one.
The anime is great, extremely funny.

Kuroko use the same color of hair for the mc(red), the same colour shirt(red), has a chapter searching for shoes, and a lot of other touches. And here the rival creates a wide margin in points and all the players are better versions of the main team.





>> ARTICLE
That visual of breaking each part of the body of Seirin's team was so crazy. Akashi you evil bastard I love you. 6 episodes left for the second half, I'm so excited for the next few weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I don't get how Kuroko does it. It's always so obvious they're going to win in the end, but it's always so tense getting there; it really does feel like they could lose right up to the very end.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. So far this game has been disappointing to me as a manga reader. They're apparently adapting roughly 6-7 chapters per episode. In the previous games they were adapting around 3-5 chapters an episode. I suppose this is expected giving how much material left and few episode slots to fill. The third season was off to such a great start too. I feel that since this is the final game, each episode should be animated well. But so far the animation these past couple episodes are at the very least "Acceptable" in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the animation had been really ramped up since the Teiko plot ended. I actually thought that the first couple of matches were lower than usual, reusing a couple of scenes and such. Maybe just cause I thought Seirin vs. Touhou/Yosen were so well done.
>> ARTICLE
Well they reused a specific scene a couple times during the Kise Haizaki match which I feel is sorta justified. Kasamatsu's well animated scene then they reused the same animation when Haizaki stole from him.

In regards to the Shuutoku Rakuzan game, holy shit. That game was amazing in the anime. Every aspect about Akashis ability debut. The music and the animation. Hopefully the animation picks up as I'm well aware that each game has some very well animated EPs and some not well animated.

I just hope Five Fingers is good.
>> ARTICLE
Midorima's block after Akashi's ankle break in that game was almost my favourite moment this season. And yeah, pretty excited to see five fingers.

Sheesh... I'm only on episode 67.  Crunchyroll needs to catch up I guess.

Crunchyroll is streaming the episodes 2 weeks after the air date. You can watch the most current episodes on daisuki.net if you can put up with ads, because unless you disable adblock the videos won't play.

So many cool parts this episode. Been wanting to see all the 1st years get a game for age, pretty cool they get it in the final. Nebuya is hilarious. His match-up with Kiyoshi is great. And I like hearing all the other teams opinions through the match.

And Imayoshi's laugh at about 7:45 might be the funniest sound from this entire show

That was a very intelligent episode.  Love how Akashi planned breaking down each of their players individually one by one

Akashi is sooooo OP...... *^^^^^for ^^^^^now? ^^^^^I ^^^^^hope*

This episode really pissed me off, for some reason. Rakuzan is full of annoying, unlikeable characters. I suppose the episode did its job in making me want to see Rakuzan get crushed. I want to see them crumble. Let me see them wallowing in despair. I want to see Akashi tormented by defeat. That moment will be like ecstasy. LET ME SEE HIM SUFFER.

Only if there was a legal streaming site that had it available at the time of it's online release!

Oh wait, there is, and it's in the description. 

---------

Edit: I understand **now** that he's unable to view Daisuki. But from the original comment I understood it as "*It isn't available on this illegal streaming site*". Which seemed unnecessary because there was an option available right here. Thus why I was sassy in my response. 

He then presents more information about his **inability** to watch Daisuki, which he hadn't stated in the previous comment. **Obviously changing the whole context of the comment.**

I **now** understand why he made the comment, but that doesn't excuse the fact that he's advertising an illegal streaming website. 

And somewhere between all this I somehow come across as insensitive and get the downvote brigade.
>> ARTICLE
~~And also available internationally!~~

In some countries other than US!
>> ARTICLE
You're right. But my point still stands, he's talking about an illegal alternative, and his comment is unnecessary. 

^^Also, ^^I'm ^^from ^^Canada ^^and ^^I ^^can ^^watch ^^Daisuki. :\^)

I believe there are add-ons to bypass region lock as well.
>> ARTICLE
besides the fact that his comment is indeed unnecessary, it's kind of annoying how a large part of this sub doesn't give a crap about the fact that most streaming sites are very limited in some European countries.And using addons to bypass those region blocks kind of defeats the point right?

Anyway, great episode again, they're really doing the manga justice with this part (the Teiko part felt a bit rushed for me).
>> ARTICLE
When I first saw Gemmeke's comment, I thought he was implying illegal use, for no obvious reason. The thought of the unavailability never crossed my mind until he said it in a comment later. 

I don't think it's fair to say that we don't care about Europe's limited streaming, it's just not something that is on our minds. Nothing I can do to change the licensing. 

OP understood the comment in the same way I did. 

1. Gemmeke made an unnecessary comment
2. OP acted on it
3. Gemmeke supports his comment
4. OP then gets downvoted for trying to uphold sidebar rules. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, the downvoting isn't really needed. I just think that for a lot of people the availibility of legal anime streaming is kind of a sore issue. I check up on Cruncyroll sometimes because I kind of like supporting shows, but it's just not possible, and that can be a pain in the ass. And there've been threads before where people were just ""MURICA, deal with it" so I can kind of understand why people get annoyed and start downvoting quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry OP, I get what you're saying. I'd just like to know why you keep calling Daisuki "Daisuke"? Or are you *just herp-derping*?

Welp, this is embarrassing.

I'm talking about the sidebar rules (**RULE 4**), not moral ones.

You know, when the anime first mentioned how Akashi told Kuroko not to practice anything besides passing, I thought he was being manipulative and selfish. However, it turns out that was to prevent Kuroko from losing his amazing ninja powers.


Good guy Akashi, I never expected that.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
But that was the whole point. Not being able to shoot and dribble properly, people won't invest the energy to blocking you thus giving you more space to move to where you can strategically pass to others. Kuroko being useful in other skills made it so all 5 of the opponents would at least glance and keep track of him now.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, this is anime.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair that's just Akashi being manipulative, not being kind to Kuroko or something. If it was for kindness Akashi would have told Kuroko about the outcomes beforehand.

I love the possible implication that the entire show is made up of just shots random people are taking on their video cameras.

Edit: Also, Mayuzumi still hasn't spoken once. It was baffling when it took them ages to even announce a voice actor.

I think it's hilarious. I thought the flashy stuff like the ball disappearing was in the players mind but here they show that it actually happens. Combined with the fact that they stop on the court for 20 secs just to talk, this is some next level basketball.

I'm a manga reader but I watch it with an anime only guy and he realised very early on in the Shutoku - Rakuzan match. They made it very obvious. When I read the manga it was actually a surprise because I didn't even notice him or pay any attention to him before that. I thought he didn't even play in the semi-final until I saw the anime. Maybe I'm just dense.
>> ARTICLE
>  very early on in the Shutoku - Rakuzan match.

How so when they just said that they didnt even use it in the match vs shutoku.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't use the misdirection, he was there the whole time but the fact that he wasn't doing anything and they only showed his eyes once was emphasising his lack of presence.
>> ARTICLE
The first give away for me was when they shadowed his face out on the commercial cut card during the rakuzan - shutoku game, I thought "hmmmm he might be similar to kuroko if there going to those lengths to show him not playing or even his face for that matter."
>> ARTICLE
They actually basically blocked him out of panels in the manga, with text boxes or framing; the anime basically couldn't/didn't do that, so it was obvious he was similar to Kuroko.
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe hes just that good at it
>> ARTICLE
I didn't have a clue :(

I feel like the people being laughed at in UBW discussion threads
>> ARTICLE
It's his overall appearance in addition to his quiet and reserved presence. In the previous episode one of the Seirin 1st years said something like, "He has a unique aura... similar to someone i know?" It might not have been blatantly obvious but I thought of kuroko after that one line.
>> ARTICLE
He even look like a taller Koroko haha
>> ARTICLE
True. The same pale hair <3
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry man, the reverse kuroko blew my mind today too. I just thought that he was mostly ignored because there were only 3 uncrowned kings left and the writer wanted to focus on Akashi and them. I guess Akashi got my ass on a meta level

A bit off topic, but [here's what Ankle Break is like in real life](http://gfycat.com/PortlyUnconsciousGoldenretriever)
>> ARTICLE
Akashi looks so silly because he barely even moves when doing it. Juking someone that hard to 'break ankles' is more a measure of agility than anything else. Its why people like Allen Iverson and Muggsy Bogues was known for it rather than someone like Larry Bird.

I just wish they showed him more in motion rather than just activating some sharingan.

This is such a great development. Literally the worst thing possible happened to Seirin: they lost their phantom sixth man while the opponent gained a phantom sixth man. It was obvious that Rakuzan no. 5 was gonna be a Kuroko clone, but it was really well done.

This last stretch is going to be torture. Every episode has been so good, but it's so hard waiting for them.

I know right?! It's crazy hard not to just dive in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
As expected, Rakuzan's #5 is Akashi's new Kuroko. I like the fact that Kuroko's acquisition of new offensive moves has taken him out of the shadows and into the light, and that it was used as a plot device. With #5's entrance and Kuroko benched, it'll be interesting to see Seirin try to keep up with Rakuzan.

What will Kuroko do now? Well, he always comes through one way or another. I think these are the perfect conditions for Kuroko to grow and evolve into a better and improved player. What will be the result? This is, honestly, what hypes me the most of this show.

[This week's end card](http://i.imgur.com/3hZZa6a.jpg)

Even Mitobe had less presence than Kuroko this episode D:  
Kuroko v2 seems to be a threat but I doubt he will be a threat for long if he doesn't have his own "weapons", too. Can't wait for Kuroko to recover (I'm sure he will!).

Akashi is still too OP.

Misdirection overflow works by having Kuroko suddenly reappear on court by timing out misdirection. Suddenly all players go... Holy shit it's like there's this extra guy running around. This means Kuroko can force everyone to look at him because they now all notice him. 

So it won't work in this case because they lose the "Holy shit" another guy is on court, because they already noticed him.
>> ARTICLE
Damn...And here I was like , Phantom and Beast going all in so should be easy win against Akashi...Fucking Wrong,was I....^really^wish^they'd^win^doesntseemlikeitthough
>> ARTICLE
God damn these past couple episodes have been fantastic 
>> ARTICLE
I knew Kuroko 2.0 was coming since I found it very suspicious how the Akashi's 5th player was never even mentioned and the fact Akashi was who helped create Kuroko. I think the anime did the best it could though in trying to make us foegot about him.

On the flip side though, I didn't expect Kuroko to lose his powers at all. That was amazing plot twist. Can't wait to see how Kuroko and Seiren get out of this one
>> ARTICLE
So if everyone can see kuroko now, will he be able to use his backwards-misdirection and combine it with going into the zone?? Or is the zone only for physically big and trained players?
>> ARTICLE
Zone is using 100% of your physical ability, so I'd guess Kuroko can't enter the zone. But he might be able to hide when Kagami re-enters the zone. I remember Kuroko using Kagami presence to diminish his.
>> ARTICLE
LOL

All I'll say is that the light was shining so brightly that finally they forgot about the shadow...
>> ARTICLE
Are you a manga reader giving me a hint?

Because it might be the 4th thing I guess...
>> ARTICLE
lol When they forgot about the shadow, the light shined even much more brighter than ever before, "blinding" them. Hence what happened in the first opening of the season...LOL
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuuck. Only 7 more weeks and then I can binge-watch the whole season. I can't believe I've abstained this long already.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Kuroko will go into the zone to overcome this stump??
>> ARTICLE
Before Akashi stated that Kuroko is shining too much to maintain his status as shadow I thought Akashi had developed Emperor Eye Overflow
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys, brace yourselves.  We need to prepare for the onslaught of jokes saying "Isn't this episode the best?"
>> ARTICLE
In all fairness, it was pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
No arguments here.  I quite enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
i love it!
>> ARTICLE
Red haired Zone Eye User vs Red haired Emperor Eye User

And for all those people who want to see who will win in an Akashi vs Aomine showdown, youd be better watching this episode instead.
>> ARTICLE
This episode really started in the Zone! 
>> ARTICLE
Seems even Zone level balance can develop cracks against emperor eye
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko was the old model for the sixth man this whole time.   


>> ARTICLE
That was so harsh when Akashi dropped that line lol
>> ARTICLE
Haven't heard a nice thing out of Akashi since the start of the Teiko arc
>> ARTICLE
Akashi Emperor Eye'd Kagami's Zone up and found it wanting
>> ARTICLE
I think Seirin just got NTR'd
>> ARTICLE
Waiting for more comments here - I thought the anime made the #5 twist too obvious, but I wasn't sure if that's because I have the benefit of already knowing the manga, or because it was actually made too obvious.

Regardless, I enjoyed the hell out of this episode. 

[Manga Spoilers!](/s "I just wish the latter half of this match didn't suck")


>> ARTICLE
I feel that the only way for Seirin to win is to have a big ass ass-pull. Akashi is OP.
>> ARTICLE
uh oh, Aomine realising he's apart of an anime
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the part where furihata got to play because I know I would have been the exact same. I got really happy when he scored. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty cool they actually showed how shit-scary it would be going from benchwarming to playing for that big a crowd.
>> ARTICLE
ayyyy, 1st year bench finally gets to play. 
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't even remember what he sounded like.
>> ARTICLE
furihata is me, in a nutshell. when the game is done, and i actually managed to score, the team praises my 2pts like it was more impressive than our best player's 20 pts. I'll gladly warm the bench for ages for that one lay-up.haha
>> ARTICLE
[They don't get it](http://i.imgur.com/orLs2Wm.jpg), they just have to change their hair color.

Furihata's entrance reminded me of Yamaguchi there :)

[I thought so too, the reaction was so similar!](http://i.imgur.com/t7wTzxG.png)
>> ARTICLE
Can someone remind me why Kise's ankle hurts? Was it because his "generation of miracles" talents are too much for his body to handle or something like that? Or did he actually get injured?

I'm not sure where I got this idea from but I'm thinking about it now and I'm asking myself why the other players don't feel such limitations.
>> ARTICLE
Previous season when he played against aomine
>> ARTICLE
Also Haizaki stepped on his foot on purpose in the last match. 
>> ARTICLE
And Perfect Copy puts a lot of strain on his body
>> ARTICLE
And he overtrains in spite of his existing ankle problem.

God damn it Kise.
>> ARTICLE
The last two minutes of this game is going to be intense!
>> ARTICLE
Pretty fun episode. Gave some secondary characters a chance to shine. I fist pumped when Furihata got his basket.

>> ARTICLE
What do you mean by "production values", because there has been a very clear drop in animation quality for season 3 compared to season 2. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I agree with /u/scythavatar, but only on the OP - season 2's OP was animated so much better than season 3's OP. I've never had an OP give me the quakes of excitement for every single episode in the season. I know that the drop in OP quality made me expect less out of season 3's episodes, but they seem to be pretty solid so far animation-wise.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, considering how much new (and well animated) stuff they added to the Fukuda match, I'm slightly disappointed that they didn't extend the first 3 mins of Kise's Perfect Copy a little more. I was hoping they would  show us every point scored with reactions from the crowd and Seirin.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest the reactions would have just been mouths wide open everytime.
>> ARTICLE
[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/jGfytKv.jpg)

I like how most player skills (or passives?) so far have some cool name and Furihata's skill is "very good at supporting his teammates" xD
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was waiting for him to have an ironically cool skill name but calling it "very good at supporting his teammates" does the trick too 
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else feel like the pacing has been just a little off these last few episodes? Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying them for all the plot and characters ([like the adorable Furihata!!](http://i.imgur.com/1kcLvC0.png)), but the pacing seems a bit weird to me.
>> ARTICLE
This episode all the characters were moving like snails. 
>> ARTICLE
It feels like it slowed down a lot because this is the first game this season we are seeing Seirin play. They're the main team so many of the episodes will be more about their games rather than two other teams facing each other.
>> ARTICLE
I feel it is a nice 'change of pace'. As someone said, this episode is about focusing on secondary characters like Furihata and Iduki (had to do it). The perspective of the bench players is long overdue. It's also more tactics-focused than the average KnB episode. From the exploiting of position mismatches (centers for Seirin and point guards for Kaijou) to explaining Katsamatsu's dilemma to using Furihata to control the pace, it was a refreshing change from the usual relentless action.

As for last episode, the first half was character focused. It also needed to deal with the transition from one match to another (which can't exactly be rushed). The 2nd half was epic though.
>> ARTICLE
It might be because I'm watching the show week-to-week for the first time, whereas with the first two seasons I just binge watched them. Doing that has had a major change of pacing on me, so that's why I feel the slow pace much more drastically this season, even though I know it's warranted.
>> ARTICLE
That definitely is a factor in enjoyment, even with reading the manga. At least for me anyway. I found that I enjoyed (and appreciated) the Kaijou match a lot more when I re-read the match in one sitting than when I was waiting for a new chapter every week, even though I already knew what was going to happen.
>> ARTICLE
I did the same and yeah, I agree.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I feel like they've been going up the stairs with their "flashiness" so to speak, with the introduction of "the zone" in season 2 and so on, and Kise vs Kagami is something many of us have been waiting for. Because they highlighted Furihata this episode, I personally felt the pace got slower, but I did like the fact they highlighted him a lot. I just think it might've been better if they had done that in earlier episodes rather than in the 3rd season. Seems rather late to me now, when the stakes are higher.
>> ARTICLE
Hey! It's a given that the pace slowed down; that was the whole point of putting Furihata in! 

I mean, if you start with Kise's Perfect Copy, things are bound to spiral out of control. Rather than continuing the insane escalation and immediately forcing Kagami into the zone, now the game can build up to a huge confrontation at the end of the match. Best to ride it out slowly. This game is going to take, like, the entire season /s.   
>> ARTICLE
Legit, I whenever I watch an episode my reaction is always "There is no show that is better than this". Obviously this is not true, but god damn me if I don't say this every time something awesome happens, they are soooooooo good at making you excited in this show.


Also as a side note, I love the Akashi OST theme they have, its so brutal.
>> ARTICLE
Behold the [imperfect copy](http://streamable.com/c06y). And Furihata in the title card is a nice touch.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking more like 3 more for this game, 5 for the flashback and 10 for the final (44 chapters). For comparison, the Yosen, Touou, Kaijou matches and flashback arc were all around 20-25 chapters long.
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader I expected it to be better.
>> ARTICLE
So many cliffhangers.   I really liked how furihata got to play.  Each episode is so intense.  I liked the talk about destiny.  I can't wait to see the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
wow did Kasamatsu really copy Ryoma's line? 
>> ARTICLE
mada mada dane!!!
>> ARTICLE
I KNOW RIGHT
>> ARTICLE
hahaha yah. I'm a really big Prince of Tennis fan. man :P
>> ARTICLE
Good episode. It's getting more and more obvious that Seirin is strong and that Kise's team is the underdog here. 

I'm rooting for an awkward-angle, half-court, four-point play at the end of the game from Kise. A combination of Midorima and Aomine's skills. :3
>> ARTICLE
Imo , Kuroko's team finally gona lose! :p
>> ARTICLE
But at the end of the match when the game gets rough wouldn't Kagami just get into the zone and counter Kise completely with raw physical ability?
>> ARTICLE
nope...kise 2 stronk..he'd just copy aomine and musakibara at same time and #win
>> ARTICLE
he will just use perfect copy and go into the zone at the same time
>> ARTICLE
I've watched enough shounens to know that isn't happening

This is a shonen. Main characters don't lose

RAWR is not a legal streaming site. Sorry mate, it's against the rules.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really bored of the show and am considering dropping it, anyone minds pming me the spoilers from the manga? 

A summary of everything from here up until the current episode would be awesome, would really help me decide whether to keep watching it or not. 
>> ARTICLE
How could you not get hyped during Akashi's match? That was 10x better than this one. At least finish for Akashi.
>> ARTICLE
Cause while at first it was semi fun, now its just downright stupid, seems like each episode has more kids with more ridiculous super powers and the show is no longer about baseball but instead about their super powers. Its downright dumb, and I can't enjoy it anymore.

If the show at least takes an interesting turn it might be worth keeping up with.
>> ARTICLE
There's some ridiculous shit, but how'd you end up thinking this after Furihata's episode lol?
>> ARTICLE
I've been thinking it all along, but lately it just reached the point where i don't even care about the show anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
>the show is no longer about baseball

the show was never about baseball
>> ARTICLE
Auto correct, but honestly it's not really about basketball either, unless real basketball includes dbz super powers 
>> ARTICLE
It's not meant to be realistic lol. . .
>> ARTICLE
No shit? I never said it needs to be realistic, but from early impressions you would think the show is about basketball which it is totally not, it's merely a plot device. 
>> ARTICLE
it is about basketball, it's just not realistic... there are lots of basketball things like akashi wrong footing people.
>> ARTICLE
which is downright stupid. you could apply all of that crap to any other sport and it would work out the same way, which just goes to show how the Basketball part is nothing more than a plot device.
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched the previous two seasons?
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
Then after 50 episodes you should know whether or not you like the series. Shutoko/Rakuzan and Seirin/Kaijo are pretty slow matches for the most part, but they lead into what I think is the best part of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
That's just stupid, i don't know whether or not the series will take an interesting turn, and what was enough to keep me going might not be enough anymore exactly because it's been 50 episodes already. 
>> ARTICLE
People keep saying the same thing in the discussion threads. Getting so hyped.
>> ARTICLE
Always wondered why Kuroko didn't like Akashi so much. Holy shit what a dick thing to do-manipulating the score.

Also, of all the miracles Midori actually came across rather well. He didn't fuck around in games or demean his opponents. What a lovely guy.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely a dick thing for them to do when they manipulated the score, and it sorta reminds me of what my friends did when we played LoL together.

We would be extremely bored, so we intentionally fed the opposing team to establish a handicap for us. Looking back on it now, it was pretty damn nasty.
>> ARTICLE
He wasn't necessarily a decent person though. Midorima may not have belittled his opponents, but he saw what was happening and didn't do anything about it. 

I'll give a rough translation of an excerpt from an interview with Fujimaki (the mangaka) in Kurofes, the interviewer states that Midorima was the only one who was consistent while the rest of the GoM were changing for the worse during Teikou arc. To which Fujimaki responded, "*Though his values didn't change, he wasn't an exception. Frankly, he was like one of those kids who stand by and watch or ignore bullying. So, he wasnt necessarily a good person. He didn't take any action for improvement. As for Teikou, everyone made mistakes or I should say there was no good person, basically.* 

Sure, you could personally interpret it as him coming across rather well relative to the actions of the others, but he is not without fault. His actions could be construed as just as bad as the rest of them, making it in vain to compare them to each other because none of them were decent, and they weren't intended to be.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he had to have participated in the last "game" they played on some level because his kind of play could totally screw up that if he didn't. Peer pressure!
>> ARTICLE
Or they could just not pass it to him after the point threshold gets close.  Its not like they need him to be able to manipulate the score at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
Score: 111-11

Kurokos Seirin jersey number: 11

Coincidence? I think not.
>> ARTICLE
Wow even in the manga I didnt notice that haha
>> ARTICLE
Midorima has always been the best miracle
>> ARTICLE
Kise was the second least douchy which I was happy about.

Murasakibara though...
>> ARTICLE
It's really sad seeing Teiko like this... It's like watching an empire crumble *sobs*

Meh it's in the past now, can't wait for **SEIRIN VS RAKUZAN HYYYPE**
>> ARTICLE
Man, was that painful to watch. This explains why Kuroko chose Seirin. I thought it was a random decision on his part.

That comedy was the perfect ending to this depressing episode.
>> ARTICLE
basketball anime,

scenery scene = godlike animation

'actually playing basketball' scene = suck animation

???
>> ARTICLE
I feel ya. I'm a bit disappointed it feels like almost all of the basketball scenes are just stills?? Or just really weirdly animated making it look kinda bad. Still like the anime as a whole though.
>> ARTICLE
The animation dial gets turned up three or four times a season for the big face offs, but yeah, you're not wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Every episode, I wonder how the cream of the crop of high school basketball players from Japan would do against those from Argentina, France, Spain, Canada, and even the United States.

I hope [the "Extra Game" manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/83807/Kuroko_no_Basket:_Extra_Game) will be adapted in the future so I can see just how well the Generation of Miracles stacks up to an American street basketball team.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe in a few years after it finishes.

Those are loooong waits in between chapters.
>> ARTICLE
I bet that Extra game will be develop into a OVA.
>> ARTICLE
maybe even a movie?
>> ARTICLE
>Aimone: Tetsu, you're the one who said it's not good to cut corners. That's why we're doing this for amusement. So we get some motivation against weak opponents. Right Midorima? 


>Midorima: Watch your mouth. I don't ever recall joining this "amusement". 


HAHAHAHAH MIDORIMA IS SUCH A BADASS!! XD!!

And mad respect on him for not disrespecting his opponents by holding back. Honestly my fav GOM player. 
>> ARTICLE
Midorima is just such a cool guy like seriously, everything he does is cool. The constant pushing up of his glasses, or the way he disrespects the other GoMs when they play. Just a badass guy.
>> ARTICLE
It's because he always checks his horoscopes and carries around is lucky items. He's immune to being a bad character.
>> ARTICLE
As an anime only watcher, I loved this flahback arc. It might of skipped parts, but for me, everything felt fine and I loved the devolpment this background gave for everyone. Super excited for the next and I'm guessing final game 
>> ARTICLE
Well then, they managed to rush through that arc pretty quick. They chopped many things from the manga, while maintaining a coherent story line.

In the manga, there are these *twins* that are actually responsible for knocking Kuroko out. The Twins are introduced during Teiko's **Second Year**, and are actually in the finals vs. Teiko. The twins are floppers, that's pretty much it. In Teiko's **Third Year**, they actually play the twins again in the Semi-finals, where one of the twins knocks out Kuroko.

-----------------------------------------------

Approximately 46 chapters left to adapt. And potentially 9 episodes as well. I'm almost certain we'll be able to finish it all this season. 

**SEIRIN VS RAKUZAN HYYYYYYYYYPE**
>> ARTICLE
Only watch the show, but it definitely didnt *feel* like much was missing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in all honesty, it was perfectly fine.

They just chopped some build-up and unnecessary dialog, which was crucial to fitting the arc in.

Who else thought of this [Nichijou scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeBm1NuLkks) when Hyuga hit Kagami?

Really liked this arc, it was quite different than the games we were used to and it explained what happened, but I've missed Seirin, so glad we'll see them again now. Can't wait for next one!

Great episode, but I am bummed they cut Kuroko and Kagami's first meeting out of the arc, it's a nice little moment
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty intense to watch. I like the new focus we have on Kuroko's wristband and they even brought in the title of the anime into the last scene, I love stuff like that.

Akashi's voice is just sexy. No wonder I get turned on by Levi from AoT!

I was thinking the same thing his voice is AWESOME

Time to put this on hold til it finishes and then binge the last game

Really liked this flashback. I think it was paced really well, and it was nice to see how everyone were so friendly at the beginning. It also made me like Midorima more hahaha

Now to the final game! Unfortunately i've come across A LOT of spoilers, but knowing this anime, the cliffhangers will be torture regardless.
>> ARTICLE
This show is great, hyuga chopping kagami into bits was great

This was a really sad episode...
This arc was really interesting, seeing how the team functioned and why most of connections were broken. Really interesting in my opinion.  

**Seirin Vs. Razukan next!**  

Momoiiiiiiii, why you so cute?

Geez they dialed up the animation for the first few minutes this episode.

I thought I was watching an OVA or movie for a second.

Probably my favorite arc so far in KnB.

This is still better than waiting for the manga. This match took almost 7 months.

Still better than the last match. 

*More than a fucking year. It took 52+ chapters to finish the last goddamn match.*

Extra Game (30 pages every 2 months) is going to be even more painful when it comes to waiting for new chapters.

Is Extra Game a new Spinoff manga or a new story?

&nbsp;

 Never heard of it before.

Spinoff/Sequel. It's just one match, I believe, but GoM+Kagami and unknown bench players (probably Uncrowned Kings) are in their 2nd year, and are coming together for a match against an American team.

I hope it's a sequel but 6 chapters per year..Damn, that's gonna take forever to finish.

It's like... usually, I would be really mad at the cliffhangers and all of the bad things that happened in the episode, but seeing this face pop up right as I'm about to fast forward to the next episode preview just eases all of the anger and anxiety and forces me to watch the rest of the ED sequence, which just makes me happy again.

I'm telling you, all this sports anime is not good for the heart.

Noooooo Kise! Well it was expected, but still sucks. Funny how everyone and their grandma knows that Kise has 2 mins left on his hammertime even if his foot is in shambles.

Kasamatsu confirms he is best senpai - "so what if you are a miracle, go fuck yourself and don't talk back to your senpai." Maybe he should just hold a speech after every goal they concede, seems to kill the time just fine.

Hoping for Kagami to zone smash some people next episode.
>> ARTICLE
[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/ZttuUep.jpg)

Great episode. Felt much more packed compared to last week's and made me like Kasamatsu even more. Quite liked [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/RDfuoIP.jpg) of Kaijo, no wonder they named the episode after it.

Also, whenever I listened to Kaijo's coach speaking, I kept getting reminded of [Zunda-sama](http://myanimelist.net/character/117775/Zunda) due to the same VA. I think I'll have trouble taking the characters he voices seriously from now on...
>> ARTICLE
Kasamatsu is a beast - CONFIRMED! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really glad that Kise got put out. Kasamatsu is my favorite player in the whole show, so I really like to see the focus on him, and it's great that the team can hold up without their GoM. That said, I think we've definitely reached a point where Seirin is no longer the underdog, so their win is going to be bittersweet.
>> ARTICLE
True but Seirin still have to deal with Kise's perfect form.
>> ARTICLE
And Akashi after that. Haven't even seen what half of Rakuzan can do yet. It ain't over by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
You mean his final copy?
>> ARTICLE
Kagami hasn't entered his zone yet.

>> ARTICLE
Such a good episode.  All these cliffhangers are too much.  I feel like there still is two more episodes before this game ends.  I wonder if Kuroko does have something else up his sleeve.
>> ARTICLE
im still waiting for kagami's zone thing vs kise's ultimate weapon
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Personal Copy is his version of "the zone"
>> ARTICLE
Perfect Copy is his own personal zone.
>> ARTICLE
I'm expecting it to be Perfect Copy vs Overflow and Zone.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they'll go with Overflow, though. I think it was foreshadowed that Kuroko has another ace up his sleeve, what with Kagami asking him if he had another weapon and him saying that he didn't know, but he had to do something about it. The Overflow is something that is decided by the team and not by Kuroko himself, considering its  in-the-long-run, borderline-lethal side effect.

I could see them using Overflow in the inevitable match against Akashi and Rakuzan (come on, we all know who's winning Seirin vs. Kaijo, right?), and I'll double down on that: it won't have any effect, because I bet Akashi has trained his team to be invulnerable to Kuroko's misdirection.

But hey, maybe I'm wrong and I'm just seeing things where there aren't any.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Kuroko. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I couldn't help but root for Kaijo at the end! There are no brakes on the Seirin train though...
>> ARTICLE
Kise's foot > Kise. This makes me so sad. Kise would smoke anyone if he was allowed to. :(

I love Nakamura's character design, He looks so hipster and cool.

Thanks for posting, sorry for being late :)
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think this was a really well done episode. The animation feels a lot tighter and the shift of focus onto Kaijo is something I really enjoyed. It's also visually more impressive than most of the episodes so far, despite not focusing much on special moves. Honestly, since the beginning of the match I've thought about how I don't want either team to lose.

Cause there are no ancient rivalries or overly stuck up guys on these teams. It's just straight up bball, which is refreshing at this stage. I feel like I won't celebrate the same if/when Kaijo lose. And I agree the animation felt better too.
>> ARTICLE
So, what's kuroko's new trump card?  Can't wait until next week :(
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad i decided to watch it now instead of wait


I love this show way too much

>> ARTICLE
Haha. Me too. Waiting a week per episode is more bearable than waiting 6 months till the 3rd season's over. 
>> ARTICLE
It annoyed me at first cause I marathoned both first seasons but the build-up of waiting each week is actually making it more fun now lol.
>> ARTICLE
More fun and more frustrating! lol. The wait is killing me. I'm tempted to read the manga but I know the anime won't be as exciting if I do. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I hear you, I read up to Shutoku/Rakuzan but I stopped there, I prefer the anime lol.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck this shit feet, just wanted to see taiga vs kise :(
>> ARTICLE
Soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I like it far better when they focus on someone that is NOT in the GoM. Not that they have a chance anyway though.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer it like that too, even if Kise and Taiga carry their teams about 90% of the time, it's still great to get some character development on the rest of the teams.   
>> ARTICLE
Kise got nerf'ed badly. Now i'm just looking forward to the last two minutes. :(

He was able to score 10+ points in the first three minutes. Let's see how much he can do in the last two.
>> ARTICLE
You know Aomine going to Kaijo instead of Kise would have been really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
How so? Just curious. 
>> ARTICLE
Just the contrast between Aomine's give be no shits attitude to kasamatsu's take no shit attitude compared to aomines current team/captain that let's him walk all over them.
>> ARTICLE
Granrodeo aren't gonna do the opening for the teikou arc... Wished they did seeing as they did the others...
>> ARTICLE
kinda tired of these power forwards moving around like russell westbrook lol... i'm hoping it's the generation of miracles/kagami, cuz they're not supposed to be that fast wtf. 

kinda feels like the author didn't properly research basketball, and just made power forwards op, cuz it says power in the position title.


>> ARTICLE
In high school, plenty of top nation ranked players like Oscar Frayer, Skal Labissiere, and Aaron Gordon a couple years ago play Center and Power Forward for their high school teams, but play more like really good wings. Remember this is in high school, so pretty much anyone over 6'4" is automatically a big man no matter what. And well... this is an anime dude.

I seriously wonder how they're gonna top that game with this one, that's still the best group of episodes in the series for me.
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and sorry to disappoint but there's nothing as good as this in the rest of the Akashi match. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the opposite
>> ARTICLE
I mean besides the epic moment of [Kuroko manga spoiler] (/s "Kuroko stealing the ball from le mighty Akashi. This match lacked something essential in the Kurokoverse which is Zone to Zone battles which is also why Kise's match was lackluster.")

[Kuroko manga spoiler] (/s "I'm still looking forward to the team zone. Crazy good scene if they don't mess it up. Akashi's personality switches are going to be great as well.")

I need this show to keep going... College would be fucking amazing, change up the team rosters so that you genuinely wouldn't know who would win a game, putting different combinations of players together would be really cool. Stuff like Himuro + Kuroko.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Based off of what? The only manga left is Extra game, and there's only 4 chapters of it so far.
>> ARTICLE
that would be interesting but I think it would only work for the players that have a certain bit of chemistry. However it does give a chance to add some of the other lesser known players to the mix that are not part of the GoM or uncrowned kings and give them a better chance to shine



>> ARTICLE
The current manga is going really slow, but if they ever adapt it: The GoM+Kagami+Kuroko are all asked to join the nationals team... prepare your anus
>> ARTICLE
I would be fine if they didn't continue it tbh. Would be pretty hard to top what we already have.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought the manga ended after rakuzan?
>> ARTICLE
It's now called something like Kuroko no Basket: Extra Game. At least I think that's it. It's a monthly release though and it hasn't got a lot of chapters. Plus it's more fan service than actual story. 
>> ARTICLE
Bimonthly actually. It's gonna take so fucking long to finish it. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I can
>> ARTICLE
They form a new team "Vorpal Swords" to play an American street ball team "Jabberwock" nothing to do with nationals or the like

Every time I listen to Koga's voice, I'm amazed that the same [VA](http://myanimelist.net/people/7695/Takuya_Eguchi) also voices 8man (from OreGairu) and Takeo (Ore Monogatari). 

Anyway, there were so many [kitties](http://imgur.com/We2wZdg) this episode ( )
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I thought that their voices sounded similar because you can sort of hear their throats more when they talk? Like it sounds different, but I didn't expect that they were actually the same! Same with Aomine and Archer for F/SN, although that one was pretty ez to guess
>> ARTICLE
lol wow as soon as you pointed out the Aomine/Archer VA I immediately put them together in my head. Them sultry deep voices though mmph
>> ARTICLE
Wow takeo... That guy has a crazy voice ill tell you hwat.
>> ARTICLE
I could tell 8man was Koganei but I had no idea about Takeo...woah

Also, Ryouma from Love Stage O_O
>> ARTICLE
[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/e579LNK.jpg)

So hyped for Hyouga next episode, especially since Reo-neesan seems to be quite mad at what Koganei pulled off. Quite the lack of Akashi and Kagami but I assume they are leaving those for later. I enjoyed how they focused more on Izuki and Koganei, though, and how they seem to focus on almost everyone in this match.

Also, I kinda feel bad for Kuroko v2 there :/


>> ARTICLE
Hyuga is getting so fired up. Can't wait for the battle of the 3's next episode.
>> ARTICLE
For me Rakuzan are the most fun team in the entire series and Akashi is easily best boy. I wish we'd had more of them instead of just this game and a little bit of Rakuzan vs Shutoku. I think they're actually the only team where I find every member memorable and interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's part of the hype for the final game. Make every player on the court distinct and memorable to heighten the suspense. It does make it hard to judge the other teams though since it seems like Rakuzan is leagues better due to all their players having a certain skill they excel at.
>> ARTICLE
I think Rakuzan actually just *are* leagues better in terms of skill. They consistently win the Winter Cup every year, after all.

However, it's as characters and personalities that I mean I think they're the best team. You could argue it's because every member of the team gets some focus and time to shine but that's also true of Seirin and I find Seirin extremely dull.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I see that. I always get the bench warmers all mixed up, I feel like they shouldn't have had as many but you can't really control that since sports anime are bound to have a lot of characters.
>> ARTICLE
They're having to leave things out of the anime in order to fit it all into this season. Which is completely understandable, but the *flow* feels like it's getting a little messed up.

I haven't watched the episode yet but did they fuck up Five Fingers? This is important.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, they did a pretty good job with the first time he used it. I mean, it could've been so much better, but they got the angles on the dribble correct, but the overall impact of the move seemed lackluster. They also didn't do any narration like in the manga panel (*""Even though his body is entering a drive. The ball isn't moving?!""*), but I'm sure it'll be addressed later. 
>> ARTICLE
What are your opinions of the final game thus far in the anime? As a manga reader,  I've been largely disappointed with it to the point where I couldn't even finish last week's episode. I felt like Reo's and the other Uncrowned King's ability and title drop were huge in the manga yet in the anime it just felt lack luster. The animation hasn't been that great of from what of the final game I've seen. Ultimately I had to stop watching cause I've reached the point to where unless the episodes from now on are crazy animated and everything else is on point, then I won't be satisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
I sympathize 100% with you. I'm incredibly disappointed with the direction of the show. Pacing has been terrible due to them trying to fit it all in this season. I had just kept saying/hoping that they were saving money/animation for the final game, but that doesn't seem to be the case. It's just seems so **underwhelming**.

Unless the animation and overall quality of the show picks up in the last few episodes, I'm going to be left with a terrible taste in my mouth for what is one of my favourite series (Manga reader too). 

At this point I don't think it's possible for Season 3 to be better than Season 2. I just want to say I absolutely love the manga, and unfortunately, they aren't able to do it justice with this 3rd season. 

Edit: To put it in perspective. I gave Season 2 a rating of 10, a pretty generous rating to most people. It's looking like this season is more of a 9-8 score. Don't let my negativity fool you, I'm still enjoying the show plenty.
>> ARTICLE
The truly well-animated scenes are actually quite rare, even in season 2. I know, because while I was making a [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSbTf_YDD7I) that was meant to showcase the best animated scenes in the series, I found that I didn't really have much base material to work with.

There are some good scenes I didn't include, but at most the video could be expanded to 5-6 minutes. The reason why people think season 2 was so well animated could be explained by the [Peak-End theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule) which states that people judge experiences largely based on how they were at their peak and at their end, rather than based on the sum/average of every moment. 

When reflecting on season 2, zone vs zone, meteor jam, ignite pass kai, and Himuro's triple fake (etc.) come easily to mind, but it's not like the entire season was filled with those moments. Season 2 had its fair share of still frames as well, although this season they were a little more obvious.

With that in mind, you should judge this season more fairly. And this season isn't short on great moments too (with directing and BGM making a scene stellar even if the animation wasn't):

Kasamatu's dribble and most of episode 51. Akashi ankle-breaking 2 players, elbow pass, and most of episode 55. The entirety of Shutoku's ultimately futile comeback against Rakuzan, including that Midorima badass speech. Hayama's lightning dribble and double-clutch layup at the end of the match vs Shutoku. Kuroko's vanishing drive against Kaijio. Kise's first 2 minutes of PC against Seirin. Kagami wrecking Kaijo at the end of the first half. Kise destroying Seirin in episode 61. Seirin's run and gun at the start of epi 62. Nijimura's dribble. Kuroko successfully using misdirection for the first time at Teiko. Murasakibara's Thor's Hammer at Teiko. The entire 'birth of the Emperor Eye' sequence with Akashi's theme. The overall feels of Teiko arc. Kagami's 2nd meteor jam. Rakuzan's methodical breaking of Seirin. The entire Kuroko overwriting Mayuzumi sequence with ZERO playing in the background.

The animation this episode isn't too bad. The animators made the most out of what budget they had. Most of the frames were well drawn and there aren't any awkward still frames. A lot of what could be perceived as bad animation are actually either slow-motion scenes (Koga trying to block the void shot, the Kagami alley oop) or scenes that are intermittently frozen in time (Izuki stopping Hayama) as required from a narrative standpoint (it's a scene that required a lot of narration while it is happening). 
>> ARTICLE
>And this season isn't short on great moments too (with editing and bgm making a scene stellar even if the animation wasn't):

BGM-wise season 3 is a whole lot more enjoyable and fitting with the court action, compared to season 2. Maybe because I'm a Prince of Tennis fan and I love the mixture of guitar riffs and beats complimenting the action.
>> ARTICLE
I think the pacing has been better in the anime than the manga because they really dragged out the final game in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving the adaption of this game so far, but I'm a bit mad at them cutting down Koga's backstory because I recall *loving* that part.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Koga's backstory is one of my favorite pieces of this entire fight. His determination is key to the character as he finally found the one place he is willing to fight for success

First for Hyuga hype :^)

The some other stuff isn't happening. There'll be a short 5 minute scene after the end of the match, and then the series ends.

Edit: Actually, how cool would it be if the anime flash-forwards and ends with the [reunification scene](http://i.imgur.com/Cqgt8C7.jpg) from Extra Game?

Man I wanted to Koga to block the Void so much. 
>> ARTICLE
Compared to the superb quaility and detail in season 2, the animation seems really lacking this season. Its mainly still frames and janky movements. I really only watch the anime for the animation quality cause i've already read the manga but this is quite disappointing..
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes from season 2 were truly great, animation-wise? 4? 5? 6? We already have at least 4 outstanding episodes (if you are talking about just animation) this season and the remaining 5 episodes we have this season are going to be better than what we've seen so far in this match. Case in point: compare the last 2 episodes of S1 to the rest of the season. People need to stop sugar-coating season 2. It's awesome, but Zone vs zone is the very rare exception, not the norm in S2. The Shutoku match in S2 was terribly animated with an entire sequence being composed of reused animation (and vanishing drive looked horrible back then). Touou match wasn't much better outside of the zone scenes. Overall, animation-wise, S2 is currently better, but there are 5 more episodes to go, covering some of the most epic moments in the entire series. Still plenty of time for S3 to catch up.

And in defense of S3, sure, the still frames were a little more obvious this season. But that is a direct result of the episodes covering too many chapters. If an episode covers, say, 7 chapters, it's going to be non-stop action from start to finish, and since the animation budget can't realistically account for that amount of fluid action, they understandably took some animation shortcuts. Unfortunately, just like how amazing animation sticks in our minds, instances of bad animation do likewise. I'm pretty nit-picky about animation myself, but I think for this match at least, the animation has been ok overall so far and is about to get much better.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly, they seem to be dedicating good, fluid animation in this season to scenes that don't really need it, like bits with normal passes (there was a great bit of animation of Izuki catching a ball and throwing it in a previous episode, but no one has commented on it mostly because it's not that important of a sequence) and such. I appreciate those, and, really, I think the animation has been much better this season.

Also, to be fair, Aomine Zone vs Kagami Zone was only 5-ish minutes of a single episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there have been instances of great animation where I didn't expect (like Kagami running the show against Kaijo when Kise went off and Seirin's run and gun at the start of epi 62) and instances when the animation was average when I expected it to be great (Kise's PC against Haizaki and the adaptation of the only fully colored chapter in the manga). Then there are scenes where the animation was passable, but the directing and the BGM/OST made the sequence really great to watch (sequences from the last 2 episodes that were accompanied by Akashi's theme and ZERO). There are episodes where the animators tried a new style of animation or added a move/trick that wasn't in the manga (elbow pass, one-man alley-oop) to great effect. Then there are instances when exposition was taken away or a scene was rushed to the detriment of the show. 

I guess my point is that we have to take the good with the bad. I'm with you when I say that we have to appreciate when the show does something good. It pisses me off when people focus only on the negatives. Like epi 61 was so epic but people had to dwell on that one scene where Kagami was comically floating in the air with Kise. I felt the same when an entire episode was jam packed with action and well directed, but people had to complain about it being slow-paced because only 5 minutes of actual game time was covered. We can have 30 points scored onscreen, but if only 5 minutes passed, the episode is "slow". 'Great' logic.^(I suppose I have to follow my own advice and not focus on only the negative remarks.)

Around the 4m15s mark of episode 65, there were still frames that look absolutely sweet. That scene proved to me that still frames can look great and fit well into an episode. If one were to redraw all the still frames of the entire season so far in that style, I'd definitely agree that the animation this season on the whole is much better than the last, even without considering the last 5 episodes. That's all it'd take. 
>> ARTICLE
The Zone vs Zone fight is, at least to me, such a memorable fight, though. I mean, it's basically what I define season 2 by, and some of the best animation I've ever seen. It was the first time a show actually got adrenaline pumping through me, and if I hadn't been hooked before, I certainly got hooked by that fight.
>> ARTICLE
It was amazing sure, but the other guy is right, it wasn't the norm for that season by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying it was the norm, just that it was a defining moment for me. But yeah, he is right.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah my mistake, thought you were /u/Somnuscrubs. It was definitely a highlight for me too, especially when Kagami finally passes Aomine.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I've found the animation to improve a lot this season, especially in this final game (though this episode was a bit meh in terms of animation).

The amount of ridiculous moves has been the same from day 1 and this has never been a realistic basketball anime.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously all this is not possible in the real world, it's anime. HOWEVER, almost all of their "skills" are based on the best players, and then going way over the top with them.

I mean, Aomine being a "street-kid" with his weird moves, shots & selfish plays is textbook. The only one truly impossible is Kuroko.

I've seen people be upset over ankle break, wow really? I've never watched an entirie basketball game but even I know there's a trick to it, it just cant be used with such precision & it doesnt happen more than like 4 times per season, lol.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kuroko's wasn't impossible since all it really takes is to push throw the ball really fast or throw the ball in people's blind spots. 
>> ARTICLE
The entire show is just a battle shonen taking place in the battlefield of basketball. Every one of these abilities is just ordinary basketball techniques taken to a ridiculous extreme and I love every second of it.
>> ARTICLE
I know from the get go that it would be almost impossible for Rakuzan to beat Seirin. Glad to see they're hanging in there. :)

In my opinion, i feel that this is the weakest episode of the match so far. Still entertaining, though.

Damn, this episode felt like it was just 10 minutes. I was surprised when the ED came on.

Edit: Oops, nevermind, there's a part after the ED. That was embarrassing!

Speaking of ED, I think we'll be getting a new OP and ED next week.

This season is supposed to be 26 episodes though, so I would assume the new OP and ED happens the week after. But this felt like a cour finale so... idk.

Edit: Whoops, I just saw the information about the three openings. Excited!

Yeah, from what I heard: 

2nd OP/ED - Teiko arc

3rd OP/ED - Rakuzan match

=)
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, the first 12 minutes felt like 39 seconds to me, too.

On a serious note, they really made the most out of the final moments of the game, but I'm furious they didn't show us Kuroko's relaxed face. Imagining something like [this](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/e659d8ffc38624a702d5a3f2a98d309b1407267505_full.png).

>> ARTICLE
That was great. Didn't quite have the "epic" feeling of the other games, probably due to lack of ace cards (Overflow, Zone, etc.), but I really liked the rivalry between Kaijo and Seirin, and having a bit more of a perspective on Kaijo in a game compared to Seirin's other opponents.

Rakuzan game hype.
>> ARTICLE
Felt the same way about the "epicness" but i think it's a good break cause we're sure to see some amazingly cool stuff again Rakuzan

>> ARTICLE
If anyone else has any doubts left as to whether the final match will be covered, [this](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-26/kensho-ono-screen-mode-perform-kuroko-basketball-teiko-arc-anime-themes/.85407) should dissipate them.

 *Slightly paraphrased*:
>There are 3 openings for this season.  Kensho Ono will perform the **second** opening theme "ZERO" for the Teiko arc. Then, GRANRODEO will return to perform the **third** opening for **Seirin High vs. Rakuzan High** match.

And that was February news. Just like how it was old news that the [Teiko arc would start in April](http://poptaku.com/blogs/blogtaku/18967139-the-second-part-of-kuroko-no-basuke-season-3-announced-for-april-the-teiko-school-arc) (meaning the Kaijo match was always going to end this episode).

>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, by the time it comes out, they'll be able to allude to an adaptation of Extra Game, since they'd have about 10 chapters out at that point.
>> ARTICLE
I'm now concerned about how they'll finish the season.

The Kaijo vs. Seirin game that just finished went from really late episode 57, to pretty late episode 62. Being generous, we can say that the game was **5** episodes long.

In the manga, the game took from chapter 184 - chapter 202, so **18** chapters.

So for the Kaijo vs. Seirin game. It was 18 chapters for 5 episodes. Or **1 episode is 3.6 chapters** (18/5). We can try to understand how many more episodes there will be, using this rough-generalized formula.

The flashback arc is 204-227 (23 chapters). 23/3.6 = **6.4 episodes**

The final game is from 231-274 (43 chapters). 43/3.6 = **11.9 episodes**

There is also 4 chapters between the 2 arcs, which is just more time!

That means, by assuming that every episode is 3.6 chapters, there are more than **18 episodes left...** which isn't possible! They'll have their work cutout for them trying to fit this all in.


>> ARTICLE
I can see the flashback arc being done in 3 episodes, honestly. They'll most likely shorten some stuff [Kuroko Flashback Arc](/s "like the game against the twins and focus more on the characters.")
>> ARTICLE
And I heard that the flashback arc alone will have 8 episodes. =/
>> ARTICLE
Calling it now, flashback arc, 3rd place game, filler, BAM season 3 ends with cliffhanger... Then the entirety of season 4 is a single cour covering the final game.

In all seriousness though (I mean, I definitely hope we don't get a S4 in the form of a single game), the chapter-to-episode ratio is a slippery thing. I doubt the flashback will take 6+ episodes, nor will the final game take nearly-12 episodes. I think 3 episodes for the flashback and 7 for the game is already generous, and that would fit within a 25 episode season just fine. Plus brief coverage of the 3rd place match and additional filler (or canon near-filler).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think (and hope) they would make a s4, especially since the manga is finished which is usually a reason for prolonging the series. But yeah with 12 episodes left (i'm guessing 7/8 episodes for finals. dunno if 4/5 would be enough for the flashback arc and such). But yea making s4 just for the final game would be meh, but even if they do I think it'll be released in a month or two.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know there's been nothing to confirm that this show is capped at 2-cour. It's very reasonable to assume that it could spill over to finish it, and it's personally my guess that this will happen. Actually, IIRC, there was never any indication that this show would be 2-cour at all, we've just been assuming it because the other seasons were. 

Of course I could be wrong, and I don't know enough about it's time slot to say that something isn't already scheduled to fill it's spot in Summer. I just scoured the internet looking for answers and all I could find was one blog claiming the season would be 26 episodes, and basing it off of a scanned manga page that, as far as I can tell, says nothing about 26 episodes.

Edit: Well, Amazon lists 9 discs. Disc 1 had 2 episodes, and Disc 2 had 3, so if the rest have 3, that's 26 episodes. Seems like it really is 26. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I kinda thought they would show the 3rd place game, too, in between the flashbacks and the final game but considering what you just described there is no such thing (or even if there was, it would just make this even harder to fit in the schedule).

Also, woah...didn't expect the flashbacks to be 23 chapters...that's more than the Kaijo vs Seirin game.
>> ARTICLE
Oh you're right, I had forgotten about the 3rd place match. Though mentioning the match is a very small spoiler, in that it's really short.

I was considering spoiler-tagging what I just wrote, but I decided it wasn't necessary.

The reason why it is so short is because [Kise](/s "doesn't play because of his foot")  (Not even a real spoiler, already known information, I'm just being cautious :)  )

What does the spoiler say? I can't view it on mobile.

>> ARTICLE
oh yeah you dont have to spoiler that since this thread already has a spoiler tag. basically everything up to this point in the anime/manga is free game.
>> ARTICLE
I just assumed they would show the third place match due to Midorima mentioning he already knew the outcome (so they would confirm/deny his assumptions by showing it or at least part of it) so I don't think it's really a spoiler. Was just curious since I didn't see it mentioned, but makes sense since you put it like that.

Also, assumed that was why he said he knew the outcome. Thank you for the info on the chapters, by the way! Not sure how I've managed to not start reading between the seasons so far.
>> ARTICLE
You are forgetting a couple of things. Although 3.5 may be the **average** number of chapters covered per episode throughout the series (76 episodes, 267 chapters), the Yosen and Touou matches both went at **5 chapters** per episode. The pace kind of slowed down for the Kaijo match but I bet it will go back to 5 chapters/episode for the final.

Also, a few scenes in the flashback (Kuroko and Aomine, Kise's induction, Kuroko persuading Haizaki not to quit) were already covered in existing OVAs so they can make it even shorter.

[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/NEwfA5x.jpg)

Almost had a heart attack when ED started playing, but got relieved when there was more after it.

I assume the next episode will be completely dedicated to the past, but I wonder, will it be more than one episode? Considering there are so many episodes left and just two matches (I assume they will show the game for third place before Rakuzan vs Seirin), I am unsure about it. (Edit : Just got my answer after checking the comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/30ml57/spoilers_kuroko_no_basket_3rd_season_episode_12/cpty8h7), it seems the flashbacks last 23 chapters in the manga, that is more than the Kaijo vs Seirin game).

Really looking forward to the next episodes. I am really curious about what made Kuroko change so much (except the height, doesn't seem like he got much taller from that flash back).

Also, I really want to see [what face Tetsuya was making](http://i.imgur.com/pYAO3IZ.jpg) after the game!

This was a really great episode. The whole playing the OP during the opening scene was really cool :)

Nice, I've really wanted to know how it was at Teiko. Glad were going to see all of them together.

Flashback arc is gonna be pretty cool, but I'm way more hyped for the final, so if the chapters/episodes don't add up like people have said, I hope they spend more time on the final.

To be fair, the very very end was totally unplanned. Otherwise it would've been a boring conclusion.

So another 20 episodes of the final!!

I'm way too hyped for this flashback!

The way this show hand-holds you through all the mindgames and mental jousting is just so completely absurd and corny and I absolutely adore every bit of it.

Poor Kise =((( I wish he could win something, he deserves it.

I think I'll let the next episodes accumulate before watching them. I can't take any more cliffhangers, and I'm sure there will be a lot from now on hahaha
>> ARTICLE
Weeeee it's the Teiko arc lol
>> ARTICLE
This game was amazing. It had me at the edge of my seat (did I word that right? Oh well lol). I'm happy about the outcome but sad for my baby kise. 

I can't wait to find out about the GoM's past. When midorima said there was two of Akashi I was like "well that explains the different colored eyes." 
But tbh I am curious about how they were as middle schoolers. I'd love to know more about them.

Counting down the days hehe (:
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen this ep yet but judging by responses here there will be no zone for Taiga which is really disappointing. Does anyone know if there is a legitimate reason as to why that is? Vs Aomine it was said that he hated losing, and getting his ass kicked was motivation for him kicking it up a notch (unless I'm misremembering).      

But here vs Kise he's getting his ass kicked even harder, in previous episodes he hasn't been able to do a single thing to stop Kise.. yet he just chills and doesn't really care at all? Other than making that one comment about it being their drama I haven't seen anything of note from him for the entire game, and it isn't as if him in the zone would suddenly be better than Kise, but I feel like it would be a more entertaining way to make the match actually close.      

  This game has really disappointed me since Kise in = Seirin is useless. Kise out = Seirin gets large lead. Where's the tension? Where's the suspense?   Anyone else thinking similarly or am I just being overly critical?
>> ARTICLE
You just cant enter zone on purpose, thats the whole point of it. You cant force it 
>> ARTICLE
what did anything I say have to do with that? they used him getting his ass beat to smithereens by Aomine as his motivation to enter it, but now here we are and he's getting his ass kicked ~even harder~ and there's no sort of I NEED TO GET BETTER mentality from Taiga even though in the series to this point his motivation has been all about vsing ppl better than him and needing to overcome them. just doesn't really make sense to me
>> ARTICLE
The activation factor of The Zone isn't a type of motivation, it's more of a "x-condition-must-be-met" kind of thing. In the Kaijo game Kagami's condition was never met. 
>> ARTICLE
And even then it's not like a guarantee. The Zone is something that happens infrequently at best. If it were written to happen frequently, people would then complain that only two players ever matter in a match -- the ones in the Zone.
>> ARTICLE
>Where's the suspense?

There was never any suspense to begin with since Seirin vs Rakuzan was inevitable. The match was written to make it a refreshing change from the usual Seirin match in the WC, in that:

1) Seirin is now the dominant team and Kaijo the underdog.

2) Seirin has to face the pressure of protecting a lead rather than chasing it.

3) Kaijo became the team the readers were supposed to root for instead of Seirin.

4) Seirin weren't able to stop Kise even at the end. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why Kagami didn't use Zone in this game, but I can throw out some ideas.

Since they had already beat them (Kaijo) once, the drive to win is not the same. I remember they mentioned something like this before the game actually started. They said basically that Kaijo has already lost, and has the drive to win even more than Seirin. This could also be applied to Kagami vs. Aomine, where Seirin had lost to Touou, and so Kagami's desire to win was greater, thus entering the zone. Kagami just didn't have the same drive he did in past games, like when he vs. his "brother", it was personal, or revenge against Touou.

I also had a very small feeling that Kaijo vs. Seirin was supposed to be the calm before the storm... maybe. It had a lot of focus on non-generation-of-miracle players, some examples would be when Seirin subbed in the first year kid to slow down the pace, or Izumi's Eagle Spear, or just Kasamatsu being a badass. Overall it seemed like one of the "least-OP" games of the series, the only one ahead of it being the first time Seirin and Kaijo played (First game of the entire series). The only real super standout in this game was Kise, and with perfect copy he actually supplied enough overpowered-ness for the whole entire game.

I'm going to be honest, this and the Shutoku vs Rakuzan game before it, I personally feel were better in the Manga, or at least I remember enjoying them much more than I am now.

Overall it was a really weird game, in that the entire outcome was based around Kise being in or out. He is Kaijo's ace, and so when your best player is out, they should lose, and when he's in, they should win because he's unstoppable. And the downside to being SO good is fatigue, and so he got subbed. But yeah, it was an awkward game because it was the first time a Generation-of-miracles player was subbed out for most of the game, this probably was why the game felt so lackluster in terms of action/suspense. 

Edit: Seirin, not Seiren 
>> ARTICLE
I've also got the feeling that I enjoyed this match in the manga much more than the anime although I didn't remember much. Maybe it was slow pacing and cheaper animation used during the half point that just sucked the life out of it. Shutoku vs Rakuzan was great, the only thing I don't like is how they animated Akashi's ankle breaker move, it just looks silly. There's not enough shown as to why they're falling down so it just looks like they're falling for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome game.

I think that if you would take the whole game, cut out all the footage of the players talking, discussing, thinking, everything that kills the momentum, you could get something very cool out of it.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap I'm so excited for the flashback arc. I'm wondering how they'll fit the final game and flashback arc in 12 episodes. Maybe six for each arc? 
>> ARTICLE
So uhhh, I feel like that comeback couldn't have happened in 3.8 seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of disappointed with the overall game. (Kise being injured, then Kagami kind of on the sidelines of the game, never truly beating Kise at all) Not sure if I'll enjoy a flashback arc or not, depends how long it will be (6 episodes for flashback, 6 for last game?)

Can't wait to hear about the player Kuroko was talking about though.
>> ARTICLE
There's no way the last game will be anything other than 12-24 episodes. I'm guessing season 4.
>> ARTICLE
They should just extend this season and not do season 4 by pulling off a Slam Dunk and make the final game twenty episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Wow
>> ARTICLE
...There won't be 12 or 24 episodes worth of one game lol. You have 12 episodes left, there's a flashback arc and the final game, and maybe a final episode epilogue/celebration thing.
>> ARTICLE
They could turn it into a "HxH Palace raid" sorta deal, and stretch out 3 minutes of action into, what, 10 episodes? Jump from player to player to player dedicating a few minutes to every single one of their thoughts, throw in some heart wrenching flashbacks, take all 4 quarters into account and bam, 12-24 episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Both the flashback and final game are ridiculously long, it has been speculated ever since the flashback arc ended in the manga that it would be too long to fit both in this season. Paired with the fact that Kise's game was *this* long, it's completely reasonable to predict that there's gonna be a season 4 for the Akashi game.
>> ARTICLE
I think 4 and 8 are pretty reasonable.

It would be really odd if they created another season. Lets say the flashback is 6 episodes (hyperbole), there aren't enough episodes remaining for the final game, so what will the do? Cut the final game at half time and do an OVA? I'm genuinely curious to see how they handle this.

In my honest opinion though, I think it'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
The flashback and the final game in the manga took SO long. I mean the detail in the final game surpasses anything else they did in the manga, and the flashback was about as long as this game was. So I really don't know how they'd condense it to 12 episodes without omitting a TON of detail and information.
>> ARTICLE
This made me want to crunch some numbers, and you're completely right. There is too many chapters to fit in this season, but not enough to for it to have it's own season.

[Here's what I just posted. It's concerning...](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/30ml57/spoilers_kuroko_no_basket_3rd_season_episode_12/cpty8h7)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, to be honest I'd have liked to see Kise stomping everything in his path a bit more. It seems he's currently the most OP of the GoM, though of course Akashi has to show him up somehow (and the Kuroko+Kagami combo have to somehow win against Akashi via friendship power).

In a one-on-one vs any of the other players of the GoM (plus Kagami), it seems Kise is pretty much guaranteed to win. In a team setting it'd be different, but even then, all else being equal, Kise seems to come out on top. At least if he continues to improve and increase his time "limit." (I say that because other than as a shoddy plot device, exact time limits seem ridiculous. Plus he went up to seven minutes in this game alone, and he was injured.)

[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/4qgmgOL.jpg)

Got fooled by the 15 point lead myself and forgot how OP Kise is. I know Ignite Pass Kai isn't that hard to copy for him (since he is already copying everyone from the generation of miracles and that doesn't involve having as little presence as possible), but still didn't expect him to copy any move of Kuroko's. 

Damn it, I can't wait till next week but I don't want to pick up the manga now, I've already managed to hold out till now!
>> ARTICLE
I think we're going to get the whole winter cup this season at least so ruining the surprise would be no fun.
>> ARTICLE
What I didn't care for with the Ignite Pass copy was how when Kuroko first used it they explained that the reason he could pull off a move like that was that Kagami was one of the very few people who could catch a move like that. Then the other random dude gets it super easy because "perfect copy". Not a big deal, just a little cheesy.
>> ARTICLE
The end card: of course Kuroko (with his low presence and misdirection), Kiyoshi (right of postponement), and Izuki (eagle eye) would do well in a paintball game. And the rest of the survivors are Riko (no one dares to shoot at her), Mitobe (uses a silencer), and Hyuga (long range accuracy) .


Kise's Ignite pass kai: anyone else notice that it [took out a few strands of Kuroko's hair](http://i.imgur.com/lFof1qn.jpg)? It was a close shave.

I'm not getting any videos from Daisuki, any solutions?

>> ARTICLE
Damn they butchered the shot of kise saying he loves his team and kuroko's line about nothing being more dangerous than a cornered miracle. Still, damn if they didn't nail the seriousness of Kise's eyes when kagami saw him. Next week all out hype y'all 
>> ARTICLE
Kise did say that.

>> ARTICLE
He's not saying that Kise didn't say that, just that the line wasn't executed with the same quality as the manga. And Kuroko's line was entirely different as well.

-----------------------------------------------

I find comparisons interesting because there are some pretty amazing things they miss out on. An example would be Hayama's dribble (the guy that dribbles loud), or just the overall intensity of Akashi. For example "Lower your head" in the anime, and **"Know your place"** in the manga. 

Here are some previous comparisons..

http://imgur.com/a/XBvDb

>> ARTICLE
Saw this for the first time just now and allow me to say that this manga might be worth reading after watching the anime just because of how the art style is "butchered", but I guess that's entirely the studio's fault the fact that manga is drawn in that "unique manga style" (literally have no better way of reffering to this hopefully whoever reads this gets what I'm trying to say) emphasizes the moments a lot more than an animation ever could, unless it was one of those mega-imba-high-budget studios (e.g.: Madhouse, *~ufo-tan~*) those guys might get closer but still not sure if it would be enough.
>> ARTICLE

I do enjoy the manga's art a lot, but the manga can't compete with Season 2 Aomine vs. Kagami zone. 

The show is actually made by Production I.G... one of the highest quality producers out there (Attack on Titan, Psycho Pass, Haikyuu, GHOST IN THE SHELL). Production I.G is held in very high regard (similar to MADhouse), and whenever they produce an anime, it's **usually** amazing. 

I came into the 3rd season expecting more of Season 2's animation, but it's over all been pretty underwhelming. I am almost **100%** certain that the animation will go absolutely nuts later in this game, and ESPECIALLY in the final game. And I can only hope that's where the budget is going, I'm not alone with this thought either, many people are expecting some more Aomine/Kagami zone stuff before the end of the season.

**Edit** : I just realized what I wrote looks pretty circle-jerky. I am enjoying this season to the max, despite what my writing says. The underwhelming part isn't nearly (or at all) as dramatic as I make it sound, sorry for any confusion.

------------------------------------------------

I'll take this time to express that I am not nearly as hype as I was during last season, but that could be because the Manga itself ended September last year.

Also, **FUCK** whoever messed up Akashi's "Know your place". That shit was fucking GODTIER and I'm so FUCKING **SALTY**
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea it was Production I.G. haha... I'm confused right now considering I was gonna write "maybe if it were the same studio as who did **Haikyuu**" and especially as you said comparing it to Season 2, being the same studio I feel that Kise's game isn't being half as much fun as Murosakibara's, which to be fair had Kagami's "brother" (sorry I'm usually good with names, but I never really liked the guy), but all in all I was really expecting more from the Kaijou v Seirin.

I'm just sort of hoping that Kise and Kagami go like, Full Copy vs Zone so this gets better, the jumping around that they started doing at the ending of the episode already looked cool so looking forward to more action.

Also something I guess is worth mentioning about this season is that they are doing a lot of the "normal guys can fight the super powers too", in Midorima v Akashi's game, Midorima's teammates struggled a lot and we have been seeing the guys from Kaijou also fighting Kagami and Kuroko with everything they've got, and this episode we got some of that from Seirin's side... So the plot might have not reached a point where great animation is needed, but I'm looking forward to it in the future (keep in mind I haven't read the manga so all this is speculation I don't know how much better the games will get).

Last but not least, I gotta agree that in the manga the "Know your place" was a lot more badass, and I feel like what fucked it all up was the lighting in the scene, it needed to look a lot darker overall or who knows actually transition to black and white, they seem to be confortable doing it when Kise used The King's Eye on Kagami just this episode so there was room for improovment on their part definitly.

Let's hope they learn from their mistakes wouldn't be the first time a studio improoved after a couple of missed attempts in the first episodes, Fairy Tail second season's first episodes were an eye-opener for me... especially when I saw in the ending credits **A-1 Pictures**, I was outright flabergasted when I read that, but as the episodes continued they got better (not watching it right now because fillers but they did get better while I still watched I guarentee it), so...

 **Believe in the animation studio who believes in itself ?!**
>> ARTICLE
I am so hyped for the last game... I hope you're right about the animation quality in that match. wan't to watch Akashi wrecking shit :D
>> ARTICLE
I actually think that S3's animation is better than S2's. The Haizaki game and the Shuutoku Rakuzan game has some pretty nice animation.

[Kaijou vs Fukuda Academy example](http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/12823/animated-keiichi_ishida-kuroko_no_basuke-presumed-)

I don't have a Shuu vs Rakuzan webm on hand but the series of three's that Midorima and Takao do were pretty amazing.

Edit: I just saw your link. Oh well.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I had complete forgot how well animated some of the early episodes were. I think I'm just so influenced by Zone animation that anything that isn't zone honestly skipped my mind. 

I remember loving the Vanishing Drive this season over last seasons (Where they literally removed the character from the screen in a blink). And Kasamatsu's drive was fucking DIRTY.

I know that I liked Midorima and Takao's combo more in the manga than the anime. Honestly, I just enjoyed that game so much more in the Manga, I think it might be because I like Manga Akashi more than anime Akashi. Oh yeah, also the crownless generals are a lot better depicted in the Manga too (Mibuchi's flamboyance and Hayama hype have been missing).

When Kagami was going ham vs. Kaijo last episode, I thought the animation was great there too.

Now that I think about it, no one has really used too much of their "super powers" this season yet. We've gotten our Perfect Copy (great) and some awkward Emperor Eye, as well as some nice drives, but still no Zone or super intense last minutes of play. 

I just realized how much more hype I am for the rest of the season!
>> ARTICLE
>I know that I liked Midorima and Takao's combo more in the manga than the anime. Honestly, I just enjoyed that game so much more in the Manga, I think it might be because I like Manga Akashi more than anime Akashi.

I'm like that with the Kaijo Seirin rematch right now. In my opinion, it is THE best game in the entire series. So much hype reading it in the manga. But here in the anime? Ehh.. I don't know I'm not really feeling it. Of course we will have to see the finale of the game cause that I feel is what cemented it as my favorite game in the series. I hope they do this right.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2's animation seems to be defined by zone vs zone and season 1's animation seems to be defined by the last 2 episodes. People forget that those were way above the average animation quality of the rest of those seasons. For example, the animation quality of episode 39 (when Kuroko first used the ignite pass kai) is on par with this episode's. Even including this episode, the overall animation quality of S3 is (so far) better than the average quality of  S2's. Though to be honest, I'm rather disappointed that the only fully colored (and superbly drawn) chapter of the manga got the worst animation we've seen this season. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the emotion in Kise's eyes in the manga is what did it for me, and the language of kuroko's in the manga really heightens the threat of kise personally 
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'm gonna read the manga once this ends. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that Kise's part was butchered, but I do prefer Kuroko's version in the manga, now that I've seen it. 
>> ARTICLE
Kiss is officially now the entire GOM since he can now copy kuroko so stopping him is pretty much impossible.
>> ARTICLE
Well I assume he can't copy misdirection. Given that he's literally the entire GoM, his presence is probably way too much for misdirection.
>> ARTICLE
He should be able to do the copy of overflow though, casting so much light that his team can't be seen type thing
>> ARTICLE
Why does Kise's perfect copy always get the short shrift in the animation department? Haizaki, Akashi, Kasamatsu's drive, Midorima and Takao combination, Kuroko's vanishing drive and Kagami last episode all got better animation than Kise this season so far, even though the chapters depicting PC are some of the most epic in the series. Even if the next episode is godlike, their bias is already showing.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they end this game next episode and dont stretch it for too long I mean there is only 3:35 left !!!!!!!!!

Damn Kise is going to be tough to beat. I'm guessing that he'll be able to surpass his 2 minute limit.
>> ARTICLE
Oh for fuck's sake I can't wait another week... Can someone point which chapter this episode was?
>> ARTICLE
Noooo!! The anime won't be as exciting if you read the manga. =(
>> ARTICLE
I did this during season 2 Seirin vs Teiko (?) game and I still really enjoyed the last 1-2 episodes of the match even after the reading the manga. It's just these kinds of matches that take several episodes really annoy me. I appreciate your advice though
>> ARTICLE
Edit: I'd recommend finishing the anime before reading!

This episode goes up to the end of 195. 

I'd recommend reading 195 then continuing on, it's a great chapter and the anime doesn't quite do it justice. 

Hell, I'd recommend ready all of this season, I honestly feel the atmospheres are different in the Manga than the anime. Don't worry about last season though, the anime outshined it by a decent bit. This season starts in the middle of chapter 169, if you do decide to read it.

>> ARTICLE
Haven't read past this point in the manga so my hype is in overdrive, I wanna see *kuroko* in the zone. Like to beat Akashi if both Kagami and Kuroko got there at the same time and took over.

Yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that Hyuga flashback-ception.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, damn. Why did they have to end it like that? haha. Probably the harshest cliffhanger i've experienced.

Sorry Kuroko fans but I want Kise to win. And I think a Kise v Akashi match would be more interesting. :)
>> ARTICLE
Why do you have to finisht every fucking episode with a cliffhanger like that. Can we just have a full game to enjoy??? Damn it
>> ARTICLE
So many cliffhangers.  I can't stand it, but I can't stop watching.  It is so intense.  There was a nice break in intensity with Kagami's corny line.  I love the small bits of comedy in the intense action.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Seirin as the bad guys was fucking cool- They're definitely not the underdogs anymore, and Kaijo is easy to root for. I like how they're acknowledging Seirin's ability to finish a game too, it takes a cliche plot device and makes it work in universe- Seirin just has a fantastic endgame, and other teams are having to plan around it.

[Kise right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pik1dRC8dTA).

He or Aomine for sure.
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, Akashi is definitely one of my favourites, but Kise and Aomine are absolutely close seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, only 39 seconds of game, and Kuroko has only watched Kise for a minute. Looks like this game will be decided on the very last few seconds.

I liked how Akashi said that the only way Seirin could win was to have Kuroko induce which GoM player Kise was going to copy next, just as Kuroko explained it to the team. Also, that Aomine noticed what Kuroko was doing as the game went on. It really shows that the GoM still recognizes Kuroko as one of them, or at least an important figure to them.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best thing about how all the GoM recognize each other is that it makes me imagine that they all can become even greater (or even already are) than Kagami and Kuroko despite losing to them since it was just one game.

[This week's end card.](http://i.imgur.com/vrdEJV0.jpg)

I kinda like how the game and the cheering have an impact on each other. The teams get affected by the cheering (or lack of cheering) and the spectators just cheer for either team depending on the flow of the game. The spectators changing sides seemed a bit strange at first (since I thought they were one of the two teams' supporters) but considering that this is a tournament, they can easily be there to watch various games even if the team they are mainly supporting isn't playing. Their cheering for both teams made more sense after considering that.

Also, last week's episode ended at about 03:30 left on the game and this episode ended at 00:39 left on the game. No wonder these episodes feel like they are 3 minutes each!

Wow, it was a really cool idea to show how who the crowd cheers for can make a big impact on play. As a sports-averse guy, I love how this show makes me feel like I actually know a lot about basketball (I went to a game IRL once. It was boring and there were too many adverts. Supootsu is better in the loving hands of anime)

I knew what it was before clicking. That shot was way too long and way too funny.
>> ARTICLE
I find this match so easy to watch, cause I like both teams so much. I'm not pulling my hair like in almost every match prior to this one hahaha Kaijo could win this and I wouldn't mind.

Also, I really hope Kise will be able to fully recover after this game. He is definitely my favorite GoM.
>> ARTICLE
I'm the opposite lol; I'm sure Seirin will win, but this is the first match I'll be genuinely gutted for the other team to lose. It's like the most stressful yet.
>> ARTICLE
I am right there with you, i love Kaijo!
>> ARTICLE
This is the best episode of the match so far imo. The basketball bits were intense from start to finish. The in between bits about sports psychology (nice that Riko narrated it instead of 'the narrator'), tactics (Kuroko's observation and Akashi's explanation) and humor (Kagami being corny) were all incredibly spot on. They even added stuff that weren't in the manga (one man alley oop, the Midorima fake). The animation reminded me of the first Seirin vs Kaijo match in season 1; not perfect, but still very smooth and fast. This is what a well animated (apart from a couple of awkward scenes if you want to nitpick) and well balanced episode looks like, as opposed to 90% of the episode's budget going into a single brilliantly animated scene. 

I also love how Kagami was portrayed this episode. Usually when one player is dominating, the other player being dominated would be made to look utterly useless. But here, they manage to make Kagami look like the elite player he is even though PC Kise is much better. 

Lol, the animators are making fun of the fact that Murasakibara's VA wasn't available for the last 3 episodes by making him eat his chips all episode long while poor Himuro continued to talk to himself. At least he's doing something (another thing I liked about this episode) other than staring into space.
>> ARTICLE
What happened to the va?
>> ARTICLE
No idea. Maybe Murasakibara really had no lines in the manga during those moments in the match. Weirdly, in a past episode, when he supposedly had nothing to say, the anime allowed him to have one of Kise's lines, the one about [ankle break](http://i.imgur.com/cOhkKnM.jpg). That was probably the wrong decision though, since it was really strange to have Murasakibara explain the ankle break to Himuro, who was American born and played streetball since he was a kid.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha thanks.
>> ARTICLE
It's only very short clips, but it looks like next episode is one of those ones where they pull out all the stops for the animation.
>> ARTICLE
I would hope so.  The last 39 seconds of the semifinals of the tournament is kinda big.  Especially with all the build up they've done.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit disappointed since I wanted to see how Kagami in the zone fairs against Kise Perfect copy. Nevertheless, this match is a great match and Kise is a BAMF and best GoM.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that if Kuroko fails Kagami goes zone and blocks the last shot

>> ARTICLE
Kagami seems more suited to horror than drama. I've lost count of the number of times he suddenly appeared out of nowhere while screaming. Most of the *jump* scares in this anime are provided by him. :)
>> ARTICLE
Will be really disappointed if Seirin ends up losing, which I don't think will happen though. Since I doubt Kise will be able to recover enough for the finals to be able to play. Just because of that fact I think and hope that Seirin wins.
>> ARTICLE
Man i started reading the manga after like episode 3. I don't know how you could have this self control.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is the same thing though if you've caught up. You still have to wait a week to read the next chapter. I might start reading the manga after this season is done, but I doubt it. I'm quite happy with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
There is no next season. The manga has been over for months.
>> ARTICLE
Then I see no reason to pick up the manga :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh I wasn't saying you should at THIS point in time. Just remarking at how you still haven't.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's KnB: Extra Game... waiting for that to release bimonthly is even worse though :(
>> ARTICLE
I've been thinking of starting to read it, what chapter is the anime up to so far?
>> ARTICLE
At this point its not worth it. Manga's been over for months.
>> ARTICLE
So, does anyone know how many episodes are left in this season? Do we even have enough episodes left for the final? D:

In my opinion, this match is kinda overstaying it's welcome. Yes there's cool parts in them, but to spend 5 episodes on this match is a bit too much for me. On the other hand, it does keep me on the edge of my seat.
>> ARTICLE
If it does keep you on the edge of your seat, then why are 5 episodes too much? The Touou and Yosen matches both took more than 5 episodes to cover. A semi-final match shouldn't be of less importance than those 2. There are 15 episodes left and only the final is left after this one. There is a Teiko arc sandwiched by the 2 matches and will last anywhere around 4 to 6 episodes. The final match is expected to last between 8 to 10 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
But wasn't the final match like 40+ chapters in the manga? 8-10 episodes is not enough to cover this whole game.
>> ARTICLE
I think 10 episodes would be barely enough, but they may choose to rush it even more to stretch the Teiko arc out. They will have to trim out a lot of material (flashbacks for the minor characters, overly long exposition, long winded explanations, etc) for it to go under 10 episodes, but I think it can be done.

Actually for the Teiko arc, several scenes have already been covered in existing OVAs (Kuroko and Aomine, Kise's induction) and episodes (Kuroko and Haizaki). So 4 episodes would be more than enough. However, I have a sneaking suspicion (based on how the arc has its own opening and how Production I.G. have been [hyping the arc up](http://i.imgur.com/YsqjV3Q.jpg)) that the arc may be stretched beyond 4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was a pretty episode.
>> ARTICLE
Can anybody tell me why the f_ck can't Kagami enter "the zone" like before... It's inconsistent from what we've seen before.
>> ARTICLE
Kagami went into the zone the game before against Yosen. I guess there is a cooldown or something. 
>> ARTICLE
[Minor Spoilers - just in case.](/s "Later in the series, it will be revealed that everyone has a different "trigger" for entering the privileged state of the Zone. However, just knowing your personal trigger won't make entering the Zone easy. Only Aomine is special in that sense that he can force his way into the zone.")
>> ARTICLE
I've not read the manga and I do not intend to. But I already got that (I don't really see how it's a spoiler or anything) but I would've guessed it is something like "beeing up against a formidable foe" for Kagami since it was the stated reason the last two times... Anyway it seems I was wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the trigger is something else.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. It just drives me nuts that not a single word about that was adressed...
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko better get his "The Zone" form next episode
>> ARTICLE
Kise's eye-light(?) was fading at the end. I thought for sure Kise's legs were gonna give up when Kagami stopped like a ferrari. On the other hand, I feel like at the end Kuroko was like "I got you figured out, bitch". :-D
>> ARTICLE
I went full fanboy when Akashi gave commentary. 
>> ARTICLE
I lost interest in this show awhile ago but keep on watching it every week, It's not horrible but it's definitely gotten stale and the way they show and talk about each characters strengths like they're "super powers" kind of ruins any realism that the first season had. I've been sticking with it for this long though so I'll definitely finish it.

Average year this sub started watching anime; **2009**. Let that sink in for a minute. If a show came out prior to Summer Wars, r/anime could very well be unaware it even exists.

>> ARTICLE
I was really confused by your comment because I thought you were talking about your age. Now I'm really disappointed because I thought we'd have a over 90 year old fart here.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to disappoint, I've just been watching for a long time :P As I grew up, early on I was watching things like Miyazaki movies, Sailor Moon, etc. Then anime started becoming more popular in the late 90's with shows like Pokmon, which started airing in '98 to put it in perspective. By the early 2000's Adult Swim was airing shows like Evangelion, Inuyasha, Case Closed, Lupin the Third, as well as the internet beginning to not suck as much, so anime became more mainstream and had increased access. So to me 2009 seems like a decade or so too late for most people to have gotten into anime xD

This shit is unsettling...

I like how you used *Summer Wars* as your reference point. I think I'll go rewatch that next week. It's basically the *Digimon Movie* with an alt skin.

16 years old here and I don't even know what Summer Wars *is*.

I feel like I missed out by only beginning to watch anime recently. I'm very new, and it kind of sucks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching it, as it was a pretty significant movie in the evolution of how anime looks, imo. Very visually pleasing and stylized in a way that not many anime were before, but several were after. The plot was interesting, if unoriginal, as it basically was a remake of the *Digimon Movie* just without actual digimon. But I guess that's ok, as it was the same director.

Im actually fucking surprised that Danmachi was more watched than Oregairu and UBW . 

The Oregairu and Fate/stay Night episode threads are always so active with many users (like 1000+ comments for UBW alone)  never expected Danmachi to be this popular . 


Also Prison School is so underrated not even in the top 10 for summer most popular and surprise hits .So far this is my AOTS of this summer.
>> ARTICLE
I found it easier to watch Danmachi week to week.
I felt like I was forgetting subtle things while waiting each week for the next episode of Oregairu. I'm picking it back up now that it's finished.
>> ARTICLE
really easy to watch danmachi because it's story is really not that special i go to /r/anime to see what i'm missing or discuss something great to that episode, but danmachi doesn't have much to discuss and danmachi has 10%+ dropped watchers so yeah that's why oregairu and ubw is much more pack in discussions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of lurkers that's why, plus it a show that isn't a sequel unlike Oregairu and UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
true was just surprised even though I know it was one of the most popular along with UBW and Oregairu . 
>> ARTICLE
I also find it surprising that almost all of the top 10 are 50% watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I ran out of space, so I'll continue here:

I'd like to thank mostly /u/higi1024 but also /u/Jiecut for helping me out and giving me feedback, and /u/KousakaReina for translating this to Japanese.

One thing I want to address in a future survey is the *length of the survey*. This survey was/felt too long, it got only ~2500 responses, whereas previous seasonal surveys got ~3000 responses. The length could also be a reason for the little amount of responses from /r/japan_anime, so cutting down the amount of questions is something I definitely need to do.

Another thing is that I didn't include shorts. I'm definitely going to add shorts in the next survey. I didn't include them at first since there are a lot of them, of which many are *really* obscure. I thought they'd clutter up the answers. What I didn't think of is giving them their own sections/questions, so that's what I'm going to do.

I also only included anime that *started* and/or *ended* in the spring/summer season, since I didn't want to have the same anime in more than two surveys. If I include shows that have more than two cours, that'd mean also including a couple of the long running shows (One Piece, Naruto, Doraemon, etc.). I excluded these for the same reason I excluded shorts. I can add those shows, as long as I can make the survey look shorter/less intimidating.

The final thing is that all shows only had their *romanized Japanese* names, and not also their *English* names. Frankly, this survey was really something I decided to do last-minute, since no one else did it. Since I had to do both Japanese and English surveys, adding a third name for every show would've been more work than I wanted it to be, and I wanted to focus on setting up the survey. Since everything is now set up and since I don't have university stuff to do this summer, adding the English names won't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Having the questions spread out over many pages makes the survey feel longer. I don't know if this is possible with Google Forms, but maybe you could have a table of all the season's anime that combines many questions into one, e.g. a dropdown next to each with the choices "Completed/Dropped/Still Watching" and checkboxes for whether it had the best first episode, best last episode, best music, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it certainly felt long because of the multiple pages. Previous surveys usually only had one page. You also tried to fit in summer stuff also in the survey. While you got more data it also increased the length.

I haven't seen this implemented but what about a grid? That would make it look a lot shorter. I'm not exactly sure if you'll be able to output the data the same way in quick summary. I don't have experience with it. But a grid would make it a lot shorter.

Also no need to sweat getting only 2500 responses. Advenna had a summer survey with 2k responses and Hemoglobin had a big demographic one with only 2k also. 2500 is a respectable number for a survey.

Yeah you got good experience running a survey for future stuff.

How's your progress with the results?

I have some projects that I've been thinking of doing. The meta survey analysis. I also want to do some big query analysis for subreddit cliques (what other subreddits reddit /r/anime users use) and vice versa. I think I can also use the bigquery data for comment face popularity, that'd be cool.
>> ARTICLE
lol I thought this was from Free Talk Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean a grid like this?

 |Watching|Finished|Dropped|Picked up
-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
F/SN: UBW|x|||x
Danmachi||x
Denpa Kyoushi|||x|

That actually looks better than four lists of checkboxes, heh. higi1024 also came with the idea to split up the post-season (spring) and pre-season (summer) surveys, making it look like two shorter surveys, both of which are optional.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, please make a grid!

I never understood (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) what "Picked up" means.

* If you are "Watching" a show, you picked it up.
* If you have "Finished" a show, you picked it up.
* If you "Dropped" a show, you picked it up at least for one episode.

So what's the point behind "Picked up"?
>> ARTICLE
My understanding of it is picking up a show after it's started airing, rather than from the first episode. It helps with certain metrics because then you're able to see how first impressions of viewers may have affected people's decisions to pick up a show they weren't considering before.

Hmmm... Let's see here... I'll go with "anime seldom mentioned except by myself", instead. Because if there's one thing I love to do, it's talk about the uncommon anime I love. I've even been accused of being an anime hipster for some reason...

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is the only one of my top-10 that doesn't get a lot of traffic on this subreddit. Some, yes. But that's mostly me and two or three other people that just can't stop talking about it. This is not an anime for everybody, but it should be.  
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) is a criminally underwatched title. Which is kinda understanding, given the relative age of this subreddit. But it's a great choice to put your feet up, crack a beverage open, and relax for a while.  
* [Kimikiss Pure Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2927/Kimikiss_Pure_Rouge) is getting a bit more attention these days, but not enough for my taste. A seinen romance drama, this one has a Best Girl that can beat the crap out of most of the wannabe Best Girls out there.
* I think I'm the only person that puts [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) forward. And I love my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show. I find it just as relaxing as Aiura.  
* [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise) is a movie from Toei that doesn't get a lot of traffic these days, yet I enjoyed it almost as much as Summer Wars.  
* Everyone will mention Sakura Trick when talking about the Year of the Yuri celebration, but few people will dare broach the topic of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san). I actually enjoyed this a lot more than Sakura Trick.
* [Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1562/Yamato_Nadeshiko_Shichihenge%E2%99%A5) is a shoujo faux-reverse harem by the same guy that brought us Excel Saga. That's right. Nabeshin did a shoujo. And it is awesomely weird.  
* [Kiniro no Corda: Primo Passo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1579/Kiniro_no_Corda:_Primo_Passo) is another shoujo reverse harem, and it is the capstone of my Music Appreciation Through Anime series.  
* [Blue Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop:_Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku) is one of more curious shoujo-ai titles around. It's like a lot more tame version of Utena crossed with Noir, and was rather unfairly panned on by most of the critics because of it.  
* [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi) is my favorite cheesy generic harem, and has one of the best confession scenes I've ever watched.
* Speaking of favorite cheesy generic harems, [Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) very efficiently lampshades all of the little sister routes by making the MC specifically try to avoid the secret sister in the harem.  
* And finally, because I've been typing for half an hour and want to go get something to eat, [Mouse](http://myanimelist.net/anime/624/Mouse) is one of my guilty pleasure anime. It's awful, but it's the greatest *because* it is so awful.

Weird as in not being able to easily comprehend what's happening? [Tenshi no Tamago.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago) Weird but still really liking it?

I've seen a lot of weird anime, so I kinda need to keep it categorized.

> I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

I guess, yeah. 

Categorizing them seems good. In-between seasons when I'm bored I watch some unpopular or terribly rated animes to rate it myself. Some were okay-ish, others are a taste thing I'd say, but most of the time I just facepalm and laugh. Last time it was Kenzen Robo Daimidaler.

Just wondering, is your name a pokemon reference. If it is, who's your favourite evolved form of Eevee?

Yes, yes it is. My favorite is Espeon :)

Disgusting.

I'm gonna bet that the questions from us that end up being translated will be similarly adorable to them.

Having a bit of trouble navigating this on my phone, what where their questions for us?
>> ARTICLE
Do you like ecchi anime?

Do you like (characters with) glasses? 

Why don't you watch children's anime like Pripara (and a bunch of other anime i can't remember the names of) that are liked by children and adults alike in Japan?

 That's all I could remember off the top of my head, let me go see if I can check again

EDIT: Forgot "Why do you like anime?" and "Why do people hate CG anime?"
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the reply, I really like the questions about ecchi and glasses because they are funny, and I find the why do you like anime and why don't you watch kids anime really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
haha yep. It was like they were asking about all of the stereotypes they've heard about us. Almost surprised they didn't ask if we had blonde hair :P
>> ARTICLE
Well, judging off the facts that:

 - MonSume is giving a lot of us ^^^me ^^^included monster girl fetishes,

 - Almost nobody here talks of children's anime,

 - We love us some megane,


 - We hate us some shitty CGI,

 ... they're not entirely wrong

I love(d) it. Really enjoyable. I also don't mind the episodic nature as in my mind the characters and universe carry'd the show.

In other words, based on /r/anime_japan answers, **Hibike! Euphonium** was pretty popular in japan?

This gives more hope for season 2.

Of course euphonium was going to rank top for the best soundtrack! Its a music anime and the OST is very high-quality, even for anime standards.
>> ARTICLE
It's selling quite well.
>> ARTICLE
It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani.
The pretty realistic depiction of the human relations in the school club really hit home for a lot of viewers in japan I think.
>> ARTICLE
> It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani. 

Its not that i don't believe you, but have a source?

Just so i can use a link when someone says *"Hibike! Euphonium is just a moe show of cute girls doing cute things like K-on"*.
>> ARTICLE
If think it was on the second 'Hibike Euphonium' special episode of the [sokoani](http://sokoani.com/archives/9398.html) podcast that the hosts were the most praising.


There have been regular highlights in newtype/animage etc very positive about the anime, but as it's more commercial the tone is more flat and void. 

What has been intersting is that the soundtrack is currently #49 in the global amazon ranking, #5 in the soundtrack ranking, with the BD/DVD are also around #50 globally, #16 in the anime ranking.

Looking only at the numbers K-on was huge as well, but in the reviews you hear a lot of adults watching with their kids, musicians, and overall pretty mature people. Having these numbers on such a wide base is pretty unprecedented for Kyoani I think.

> No where to be found

Well I think I know what the true sleeper hit is going to be this season (Seriously, Overlord and Gangsta are sleepers?)...or at least I hope...At least it's nice to see Akagami top that list, deserves the attention. But summer overall is pretty promising and can't wait to keep watching!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't select it at the time, but I probably would now. The more Sore ga Seiyuu I watch, the more I like it.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about everyone else but I simply took a chance on Overlord knowing nothing about it except that it has what looked like a best girl on it's front cover. Long story short, I absolutely adore the series. Like, I've never felt this way about any series ever. And I've seen Steins;Gate, FMA:B, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not a sleeper hit by any means...just look how many comments/upvotes the last thread got. 
>> ARTICLE
i mean the same could have been said for etotama the past season, some threads only got like 40 comments IIRC.

About Sore ga Seiyuu!

I actually had zero expectations at the time of this survey. I only saw the moe character designs and that it was made by Gonzo with a no-name director. Though I'm glad I ended up picking it up.

Best unhyped show of the season. Pretty impressive to see how well CGI in anime can work these days.

Holy crap, less than 33% of /r/anime is watching NNB: Repeat? Whaaaaaat.
>> ARTICLE
I would say 33% is quite significant.

I said less than, since it's not actually on the list. I don't know what the actual viewership is other than less than 10th place, or 33%.

Got it. It's actually 25.7%

Damn.  This hurts for some reason.

A lot of the summer shows had low %.

And only 22.3% for Working!!!

Granted, it's the 3rd season of the show, so there's a bit of an entry barrier for new watchers, but still.

I watched the entire first episode of Working!!! as my first taste of the series and only afterwards did I realize that it was the third season. Was kind of wondering about the lack of exposition...

I'm super bored at this moment and have nothing to do from now until this Sunday. Because of this comment I'm watching 'Working!!!'. I'll reply to your comment again once I've finished the first season if you would like to know my thoughts at all.

Knights of Sidonia guys, get on it. It's a great show and the second season was just as good as the first or even better. A really well done sci-fi 3D anime that could not have been done in any other way in my opinion after seeing the production values.

Using the 3D to display the 3D space and mechs along with the sound effects have never made it more satisfying for its intense space battles.
>> ARTICLE
This is really interesting. I wish we got more responses from the Japanese, but it was still fun to get a little glimpse.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize there was an r/japan_anime subreddit...

Given that there seem to be a lot less subscribers around 30ish responses was probably the most we could get? Still really cool that they answered, and thanks a lot for making the effort to do this!
>> ARTICLE
Glad Yuki-Chan wasn't in Most Disappointing. 

Didn't see too many surprises but /r/japan_anime has gr8 taste m8. I think the most eye opening thing was how much longer /r/japan_anime has been watching and how much more they watch. 

I guess we're all just filthy casuals.
>> ARTICLE
We're not *all* filthy casuals... we just average out as such.
>> ARTICLE
Well, everyone else may be but my taste is superb
>> ARTICLE
Okay onto the results.

Age distribution chart looks really cool. While /r/anime looks really young the average age is actually 20 and median age is around 19.5. Yeah that's still young but the majority aren't in high school, not that there's anything wrong with HS.

Interesting to note that not everyone lives in North America.

Dungeon in the lead with 75% is quite significant. That's a big lead and really significant chunk of people. I think the hype worked. For comparison 65% to 70% watched SAO II.

Slightly sad that Arslan isn't that popular but 33% is decent. Another interesting thing to note is that most of the top 10 are above 50% watched.

But while a lot of people watched Dungeon, only 33% of them rated it in their top 5.

I was going to say something about the vocal crowd of prison school but it's not actually on the list. % on summer shows are a bit lower but we'll see if people picked up more shows for week 3. Still the Top 5 plan to watch are solid. (we'll see if people are going to be disappointed by God Eater)

Combining age and year started watching anime would be interesting.

For shows watched per season, this can be quite a difficult question. It's interesting how you can see people like to guestimate at round numbers.

50-200 full length shows is cool. 

For some of these questions median might be a more suitable stat.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that this proves that watching more anime doesn't mean you have better taste

Watching more anime almost always means watching worse anime... at least once you start getting into like 300/400+ shows finished.

I started Oregairu with season 1, read all the light novels and eagerly awaited it to be adapted into an anime. Oregairu S1 wasn't very popular so it was awesome watching it grow to what it is now when S2 came out and ended. I'm glad everyone could experience one of my favorite animes and FEEL did an excellent job adapting it.

Edit:FEEL not Shaft

It wasn't shaft, Studio FEEL did season 2.

Are you kidding me Dungeon no Deai is like SAO with more oppai.

(I feel like I'm going to get a fair amount of downvotes :P)

Is like SAO, but with better animation and far less pretentiousness.

DanMachi is better than SAO because it's more like Accel World.
>> ARTICLE
But not as good as Accel World. Accel World had some unique and interesting elements to it, Danmachi is still just 100% cookie-cutter. It wasn't necessarily *bad*, I still watched it and enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly new and fresh in literally any way. You're still right, though, because SAO was nauseatingly generic.

Accel World season 2 when?

>The top 3 most beautiful and/or most visually impressing show

How does UBW not get into the top 3 of this category, let alone win it? I was really disappointed with the story but that doesn't stop me acknowledging that it's visually stunning. 
>> ARTICLE
Only the fight scenes are well done, and generally they were a step down from season 1.
>> ARTICLE
I say the background art is fantastic (not a big fan of their  character designs). Im a big jojo fan and there is no way its more visually impressive than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you could mount an argument that JoJo's is far more visually interesting than UBW: the aggressively stylised designs, the unusual colour choices, the use of text, the 3DCG OPs, the inventive EDs. Ufotable's work on UBW, meanwhile, is often about sweeping artistic flair under the rug in the interests of consistency and a polished sheen.  The storyboarding in UBW is often kind of dull too -- unlike JoJo's, or indeed Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium. In that sense, UBW's sometimes closer to the more anodyne kind of US animation.

I don't know whether I'd say JoJo's was the third most visually impressive title of the season either, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going crazy I swear it was on the top 3 last time I looked at it but now it's JoJo .
>> ARTICLE
Oh fucking damnit, I accidentally switched it with Kekkai Sensen >.>

It's fixed now, but kinda too late

Hah, ah well. I have my answer at least!

Heh it's slightly amusing that my age, the amount I've watched and the year I started watching is far more accurately represented by the approximate results from the Japs.

>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.

I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.

It also has a great beach episode!

KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.

I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?

For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.

KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.

Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.

Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-

Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.

5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.

Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.

recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

Why do we need this thread posted every week?

I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

Here's what's streaming where:

**Crunchyroll:**

*Absolute Duo* (Not in US)

*Aldnoah Zero S2*

*Durarara!! x2*

*Kamisama Hajimemashita* (Not in US)

*Kantai Collection: KanColle*

*Magic Kaito 1412* - This is a carry-over from fall 2014, so it is not in the main post. However, Crunchyroll included it so I am too.

*Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata*

*Yuri Kuma Arashi* (Not in US)

**Daisuki:**

And since Crunchyroll waits to the last minute to mention their simulcasts, here's what they already have that's getting sequels this season. I assume they will be getting these, but they are **NOT CONFIRMED YET!!** 


Dog Days S3

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders S2

Kuroko no Basket S3

Shounen Hollywood S2

Tsukimonogatari

DRRRRRRR!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
I need to catch up on Monogatari, and I haven't seen Durarara yet, but Jojo is going to be awesome! I'm stoked!
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't seen Durarararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararara yet, you really should.  It's one of my favorite anime, and it's really enjoyable despite a slightly slow start.
>> ARTICLE
It's been in my backlog for a while. Maybe I'll try to marathon it before the second season starts :)
>> ARTICLE
Do it! If you haven't seen Baccano, do that first; you'll catch a few little nods to Baccano in DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.
>> ARTICLE
I did watch Baccano  a while back, I might have to rewatch since I don't remember it that well.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing really specific. For example, in the first episode, on a big screen on a building face, there's a clip from Baccano. Things like that and spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Durarararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararara and Oraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraora...ORA happening in the same season is enough to get me pumped

Awesome, thanks. Can you reply to my comment instead? 
>> ARTICLE
Yep!
>> ARTICLE
Tsuki, Tokyo Ghoul, Aldnoah, Dog Days, Durararara.  Sounds like fun.  Dog Days is my favorite guilty pleasure ;o
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually watching Dog Days season 1 right now and it's fun but it's really out there. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm really looking forward to Tokyo Ghoul, Aldnoah Zero, and Jojo's. Those are my top 3 right now.
>> ARTICLE
Dog Days is very out there.  It's not exactly Hamlet, but it is fun as hell to watch.  And I love me some Eclair and Noir.
>> ARTICLE
I think I will rewatch season 2 to refresh my memories
>> ARTICLE
Dog Days is the tits. Never had I seen a show pander to their viewership so shamelessly, yet I can't help but smile with the widest grin while I watch it.

HanaKana as a NekoMimi, fucking gold; all the overtly sexual petting, oh jeez. This show is the ultimate guilty pleasure.
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite is Brioche so far. Kind of a toss up, since I'm kind of a sucker for lolis.
>> ARTICLE
Casual watcher here. Thanks, that was pretty useful. I'll be watching JoJo and Durarara, and see how they handle Death Parade (Death Billiards was good).

Is Aldnoah.Zero season 1 something worth watching? Internet "Word of mouth" makes it seem pretty bland and clich, is it a character driven anime or plot-driven? (I've been spoiled of a major event from the last episode) 

I'd like to ask the same thing about Tokyo Ghoul season 1 (didn't watch because of the horrendous censorship, heard the blu-rays removes it) is it worth watching? (don't answer with just a "yes" or "no" and avoid spoilers)
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah Zero is one of the most entertaining shows out this year. The show itself suffers from weak characters, bad writing, bad pacing, and a formulaic "enemy of the episode" plotline. With all of that, its hard to say that I didn't enjoy Aldnoah. On a pure enjoyment level, I'm sure I'd put it around a 7/10 for the super well executed fights (most of them anyway). The music is for the most part very good.

Tokyo Ghoul

The censoring is at its worst in the first few episodes. It gets WAY better in the later half and one of the scenes even worked *better* with the censoring. The reason is mostly because Pierrot decided to edit out/change the really fuckn gory scenes in the manga which they should've done from the start. I'd definitely watch it; the op is quite possibly my GOAT of all time, pretty and vivid color scheme, and its nigh impossible to butcher the manga to mediocrity. The anime suffered from pacing issues and writing issues like Aldnoah, but enjoyment was pretty high as well. 
>> ARTICLE
No problem! 

Keep in mind as you read this post that I'm really easy to please when it comes to anime. 

> Is Aldnoah.Zero season 1 something worth watching? Internet "Word of mouth" makes it seem pretty bland and clich, is it a character driven anime or plot-driven? (I've been spoiled of a major event from the last episode)

I liked Aldnoah Zero. It was plot-driven. It wasn't the best, there were some times that I didn't really like something that happened. But the ending of season 1 was awesome and I'm excited to see where they take it.

>I'd like to ask the same thing about Tokyo Ghoul season 1 (didn't watch because of the horrendous censorship, heard the blu-rays removes it) is it worth watching? (don't answer with just a "yes" or "no" and avoid spoilers)

Tokyo Ghoul was pretty cool. A great concept that was done ok, but could have been done much better. Again, the last episode made it good enough for me to want to watch the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll try watching an episode or two of both and decide whether to continue or not.
>> ARTICLE
No problem! Also, I just watched Death Billiards and it was awesome. I'm excited for Death Parade now.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I watched it, but yeah... I didn't even know Death Parade was a thing, but now I'm excited too.

Thanks for the list!

I'm glad Crunchyroll has both Durarara!! x2 as well as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata. But I hope they'll end up with Absolute Duo and a few others I want ted try out too. I'll be getting my Tokyo Ghoul and Death Parade elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
I could see Death Parade being popular enough to get both Funimation and CR. 

But yeah, I'm sure CR will get a lot of these as they always do.

[This piques my interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tq2vyuUGOs), I've heard about it but know nothing, do I need to watch/read something beforehand?
>> ARTICLE
Every time I see it I think it's supposed to be Gundam SEED.
>> ARTICLE
I believe the two series either have the same character designer or the same mech designer.
>> ARTICLE
Character designer, definitely.
>> ARTICLE
It's a sequel to Soukyuu no Fafner, it's a *very* story and plot driven anime, so I definitely will suggest watching season 1 and the movie first. You won't be disappointed, it may *look* like Gundam Seed, but the story, character development and plot are leagues better. Most people here probably haven't seen it because it's quite old, but at the time of release ten years ago it has quite a huge fanbase among mecha fans.
>> ARTICLE
I've only heard bad things about Gundam SEED but I think that only the character designer is the same, who also did Majestic Prince I believe.

I did check it and am considering catching up so I can watch this season since I have plenty of free time this next week.
>> ARTICLE
I actually have no idea, but there are a bunch of 'prequels' listed on MAL. 

I usually watch things in the order they came out unless there's something that's overwhelmingly better another way. For Fafner, the first thing in this series anime-wise appears to be [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/75/Soukyuu_no_Fafner:_Dead_Aggressor)
>> ARTICLE
Any chance you could add genres from MAL to each anime in the list? While they aren't always that accurate, they can be useful when taking a quick look through the list.

Anyway, thanks for making this.
>> ARTICLE
I would, but it would put me over the character count I think. Maybe I can fit it in somewhere.

Added genres!

Thank you :)

It's the only day I don't have anything to watch. I'm normally really picky about what I watch (watched 3 anime series fall 2014 but put 1 of them to the on hold list) but I have about 10 anime I plan on watching this season.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I didn't notice that until right now, only one show. 
>> ARTICLE
>I'm actually not sure this is coming out in this season. 

It's February 1, as the current running one ends a week before. It makes sense you wouldn't exactly have the exact date though, unless you follow Precure at all. 

The only trailers for it usually, are the ones following episodes of the current run(From about the late 30's I think.) 
>> ARTICLE
It's weird because the website I got these from didn't have the date. I'll update when I get to a computer, thanks.

No worries, it happens. Great list by the way!

I'm not sure when they're starting their announcements :3

well in theory yes, it's sci-fi with samurais. but it's much more. It's the comedy that makes the show, so the setting doesn't matter all too much  (it's still very well used). So you see loads of aliens showing up in feudal japan with spaceships. Just see for yourself, it's tough to describe.

The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.
>> ARTICLE
And Crispin Freeman as Alucard.  It's why I watched it dubbed

I'm glad to see Major getting some love, I really recommend watching the first(maybe second) episode.  It does a great job of drawing people's attention

You would still ask for more after season 2? That was almost as bad as E7 AO.

I definitely thought there'd be more shows with 50 minute episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
One Piece never fails.
>> ARTICLE
Touch, Cross Game, Kemono no Souja Erin, and Rose of Versailles are all in my top 15. I'm definitely gonna try Major now.

I haven't seen Romeo's Blue Skies either but really liked the other World Masterpiece Theater stuff that I've seen (Akage no Anne, Heidi, Marco). 


>> ARTICLE
Man Romeo's Blue Skies is amazing, although I guess I can see why people wouldn't like it. My parents got me into classic literature at an early age, so I'm a sucker for stories like this.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Sorry for not being really that helpful.

i've currently resorted to going down to things ranked over 1k for new shows to watch. there's some good, bad, and definitely 90's stuff back there. 
>> ARTICLE
Death note getting put on hold and dropped this much....I guess this is what happens when people over hype the shit out of a good show.
>> ARTICLE
Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit. Also the whole profecy thing kind of makes all the depth and conflicts of all the characters in the whole story kind of pointless which really really sucks. Im Happy guy sensei had a really cool fight tho.")

>> ARTICLE
Really impressed with Parasyte popularity rise .  surpise no Bahamut in there .  
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Parasyte
1. Psycho-Pass 2
1. Log Horizon 2
1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
1. Trinity Seven
1. InoBato
1. Grisaia no Kajitsu
1. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me that doesn't ever favorite tag anything MAL since giving something a 9 or a 10 is considered in my opinion a favorite tbh I think its a meaningless function 
>> ARTICLE
The lack of Slam dunk :/
>> ARTICLE
Hellsing: Ultimate in the put on hold top 10 when it only consists of 10 OVAs. No surprise, though. That series is insufferable. 

Pokemon in the most dropped top 10, aka, we dropped it because we grew up. Period.

>> ARTICLE
It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I meant compared to the other anime of this season.

>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece isn't a comparative word. A masterpiece is a masterpiece regardless of context. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably the only show that will make me fall in love with a middle schooler...
>> ARTICLE
I never get which school system the translation's based on: the Japanese one or the American. Either way, I won't understand shit if it's not called elementary, secondary and university.
>> ARTICLE
It's absurd to compare two shows that have nothing in common.

I meant that a lot of people talk about it compared to Your Lie in April. Sorry, I should've made that clearer.

Katanagatari is not 50 hours long. It's 10.

I must've missed the title inbetween that and the category above.

I can't believe that Fairy Tail is more popular than Parasyte. You can't even compare those 2 shows, parasyte is so much better.

And theeere's the person finding any reason they can to bitch about Fairy Tail.

You can't really compare the two since one of them has been airing since 2009 while the other one has barely started this season.

Sorry, that premiered in 2014 so it's not eligible. 
>> ARTICLE
The poster deleted it, but if the suggestion was Yona, then I think there might a problem here: the OP2 for Yona did not air until 2015, so it was never a candidate for the 2014 poll (or was it, after just a few weeks?).  I thought Yona's OP2 was fantastic and should be top ~4.  If it was available for the 2014 poll then w/e.  Otherwise I think the rules need to be tweaked.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it was Yona, because I have no idea when that aired and I would only say something like that if I was confident about it.

Maybe Parasyte's OP.
>> ARTICLE
My bad, thought it would have been considered because it carried over
>> ARTICLE
No worries. Feel free to submit any more as long as they fit the 2015 bubble :)
>> ARTICLE
What is that, Arslan?

Edit: Oh, must be Yona.  Wait, the OP2 for Yona didn't air until 2015.  The parameters for this poll need tweaking I think.
>> ARTICLE
No, it was Parasyte. I remember for sure now. That only had the one OP from beginning to end, and since it started in 2014, it's not eligible even if airing episodes used it in 2015.

Well, all of them on /r/animethemes are shortened links I think, which I know are banned just for being shortened links in places. Idk. 
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite of the season.  nano.RIPE is great
>> ARTICLE
"OP" is music + video as part of the show, so:

1. Kekkai Sensen.  This OP is fantastic in every way, IMO.  One of the few OPs I've ever watched more than a handful of times.  The music matches the mood of the show perfectly, spins up hype, and the visuals are fantastic and set up the show so well.
2. FSN UBW2.  Great music, great visuals.  It really sets the bar for top tier.
3. There are many other good OPs I thought were just about as good as each other for different reasons.  I didn't see a clear winner out of any of them, so I'll throw them all in here: Death Parade (overall), Noragami Aragoto (overall), Gundam IBO (music), Gangsta (unique styles and composition), Monmusu (uncommonly unique integration with the show / VAs).  Oh, also OPM for its pure hype.
>> ARTICLE
> spins up hype

Looking at the OP I can confirm that this is literally true
>> ARTICLE
Bump of Chicken for the win
>> ARTICLE
PIN PON!!!
>> ARTICLE
JoJo quite literally has the best OP of all time for me. The ammount of details put into it are insane.  And the song itself is hype incarnate. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuchizuke Diamond for me, Yamada-kun's OP
>> ARTICLE
Although there were a lot of fantastic OPs this years have to give it to Gakkou Gurashi. That OP was not only catchy, but it exemplified the use of foreshadowing and changed along with the show.
>> ARTICLE
One of my vote has to go to Decent Black, I had this song on repeat and we only got to hear it in one episode. I still think it was epic and helped a lot in establishing Ougi as an important character.
>> ARTICLE
i think ougi was stablished as an important character since her introduction in shinobu time even if she did nothing on that arc.

its one of the most powerful character introductions i have seen and she only talked a little about something trivial
>> ARTICLE
Are there no Gintama OPs or am I missing something? :(
>> ARTICLE
besides the current one (which is 2016 so out of question), only DAYxDAY was good enough to be OP of the year material imo
>> ARTICLE
[Kuchizuke Diamond](https://d.maxfile.ro/ifsjfqqzon.webm) from [Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/28677) is my choice but hell there were a **TON** of good OPs. 

It isn't as flashy as most of these OPs but I feel like Yamada-kun's OP does it's job of emulating the tone of the anime while being simple yet managing to tell the viewers the personality of every single character shown.
>> ARTICLE
Speed to Masatsu is probably the actual answer to best OP last year, but Subete ga F ni Naru or JoJo winning wouldn't be a travesty either.

>> ARTICLE
Kyoran hey kids, Flyers, Hero, Insight, and Day you laugh (I know Durarara isn't nominated but it should have been)

Subete ga F ni naru wasn't the best show, but I'll be damned if it wasn't one of the best OPs I have ever seen. I actually went back to the beginning and watched it twice before every episode.

Wild Card

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards. For this one it is 10. The top 10 upvoted anime will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th.
TL;DR, if you want anime added, comment them here.
>> ARTICLE
[Kekkai Sensen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24439/Kekkai_Sensen)
>> ARTICLE
Any anime that are upvoted less than this comment will NOT get into the competition with the wild card.
Just for extra clarity: if this gets the same amount of points as an anime, the anime is allowed in still. If the anime comment has more or the same amount of points but is still 'under' this comment, they're still allowed in.

I love the fact someone can have a top 10 list for this year that doesn't contain a single anime in my top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yuuki Yuuna is a 2014 show.
>> ARTICLE
my bad i remembered it wrong, i thought it aired on winter
>> ARTICLE
I chose to ignore shows that started in 2014 the other day when I was taking a look at how 2015 stacked up in my eyes, so here's the top ten of that:

- Etotama  
- Shokugeki no Souma  
- Shimoneta  
- Koufuku Graffiti  
- Jojo  
- The Rolling Girls  
- Joukamachi no Dandelion
- Baby Steps
- Yuri Kuma Arashi
- Working!!!

If I let the fall 2014 leftovers in then Shirobako would take the top spot, but otherwise the list would probably stay the same.
>> ARTICLE
I'm extremely happy to see someone mention Dandelion since while it wasn't in my top 10, it was a hidden gem not many talked about during its airing and is something I really enjoyed
>> ARTICLE
Some of my favorites have been Rokka no Yuusha, Overlord, Gakkou Gurashi, Utawarerumono(airing), Dungeon ni something or other, and Kekkai sensen.   
  Edit: Parasyte ended in 2015 so add that to the list.
>> ARTICLE
After much deliberation:

1. Parasyte
2. One Punch Man
3. Shokugeki No Souma
4. Prison School
5. Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in A Dungeon (Danmachi)

7. Prison School

8. The Seven Deadly Sins

9. Overlord

10. Knights of Sidonia: Battle for Planet 9

Haven't watched that much outside this season, (also considering I only started 4 months ago) but anyway here are my top 5:

1. Non Non Biyori Repeat

2. Owarimonogatari

3. Oregairu Zoku

4. Yuru Yuri SanHai!

5. One Punch Man

4. Shirobako
3. Gakkou Gurashi
2. Maria the Virgin Witch
1. Rokka no Yuusha

Only listing 5 since I've only seen maybe 15-20 shows from this year.

1. SNAFU Season 2  
2. Noragami Aragoto  
3. Death Parade  
4. Yona of the Dawn  
5. Rokka no Yuusha

The Perfect Insider has a small chance of taking the #5 spot.  As of now I wouldn't put it there (obviously), but if the last two episodes are good enough I could see them pushing the show just high enough to pass Rokka.
>> ARTICLE
Two clear favorites are Shirobako and Working!!! Other than that, in no particular order:

* Akagami no Shirayuki-hime

* Classroom Crisis

* Hibike! Euphonium

* Non Non Biyori: Repeat

* Etotama

* GochiUsa S2/KinMosa S2

3. Owarimonogatari
4. Yuru Yuri San Hai

Didn't include any left overs from 2014 as there were a couple of good ones I could have considered.
>> ARTICLE
[A nice overview](http://i.imgur.com/AEmks8J.png)
>> ARTICLE
This is my first year ever watching seasonal anime (I started the day that Death Parade first aired); so, there are no sequels on this list aside from spinoffs that have minimal connection with their original source material. 

1. Hibike Euphonium 

2. Iron Blooded Orphans (so far, if it stays this good. I'm way too invested in this show's writing, and I've never even watched anything Gundam related before.) 

3. One Punch Man

4. Death Parade

5. Kekkai Sensen 

6. Yuri Kuma Arashi

7.  Osomatsu-San (again, so far. I could watch this show even if it went on forever, like Gintama. Also, this doesn't affect my ranking at all, but it's the only show this year besides Death Parade that has made me cry. It's truly a testiment to how this show juggles heart and comedy with such ease. Jyushimatsu...)

8. Gakkou Gurashi

9. Shimoneta 

10. Junketsu No Maria

>NGE BD at the top

I don't know what else I was expecting
>> ARTICLE
Well I was expecting more than just 22k that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Answers for this in a post i made below.
>> ARTICLE
Not really you just mention that the series as a whole has sold well, that's common knowledge and doesn't really address the fact that these really are rather disappointing sales overall for an Evangelion BD boxset.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just guessing but there could be a range of factors involved, BD's being too expensive or all of them sold out and have to wait to get new stocks. We'll have to see how it performs next week.
>> ARTICLE
They were pretty cheap as far as Boxsets usually go really, though I think they did go out of stock on amazon for a time.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if 38,000 yen is cheap.
>> ARTICLE
38,000 yen for the entire 26 episode TV series + EoE + Death and Rebirth in comparison to let's say the first BD box for Unlimited Blade Works which was somewhere around 39,000 yen for only 13 episodes...Yeah I'd say it's pretty cheap.
>> ARTICLE
in other news; its expensive... but by japanese standards, which are insane, prices for that bd are arguably okayish.
>> ARTICLE
Also note that Shimoneta V1 has been released which means it sold less than 2,211 BDs and 763 DvDs.

Hopefully those numbers rise ^^like ^^Okuma's ^^banana

**Final Volume Anime BD Sales and Other Data**

Shirobako Vol 8, sells 13,016 BD's. Series average: 15,262. Should end at 15.4-15.5k.

Kancolle Vol 6, sells 10908 BD's. Series average: 17,493, should end around 17.9k.

Gundam: G no Reconguista  v9, sells 6,300 BDs,. Series average: 8,545, should end around 8.6-8.7k.

Dog Days Season 3 Vol 6, sells 3491, total 4,429. Series average: 5,215. Should end around 5.3k. Down from 8.2k Season 1 and 8.3k Season 2.

Shinmai Maou no Testament Vol 6, sells 3101, total 3,935. Series average: 5,061, Should end around 5.1-5.2k.

**Box Sets**



The Evangelion Box Set sells 22,775 BD's. Although this is lower than what people have been predicting, it's still a lot . Given MSRP on the BD's, it places #5 nyen. It has a shot of becming the third to hit 1 Billion sales after Haruhi and all of Gintama. Gundam Seed around there too with 997 Million. Evangelion has also sold around 60K in re-releases before this one.

Including recent sales, this puts the reported franchise total at 197,453, it might pass 200K in the end. Evangelion is a class on its own, the only other anime to pass 100k is Bakemonogatari and its still lagging behind at 112K, Third would be SEED Destiny at 93K, could pass 100K if given a re release. However all this is reported sales, if real data is available, both SEED seasons could, Madoka Magica, Haruhi and Code Geass could've also passed 100K.
>> ARTICLE

holy fuck

I'm pretty sure that's not strictly true. The World of Golden Eggs had breached 100k by a wide margin last I looked.
>> ARTICLE
Well this list is mostly talking about BD sales, it passed 100k in DVD sales though.
>> ARTICLE
Except the part of your post he's originally quoting has nothing to do with BD sales but just sales in general, Evangelion hasn't sold over 100k BDs after all.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, sorry wrong info. I don't know why it isn't included then.
>> ARTICLE
I've found it's not included on several sales charts that I've come across from time to time, I partly want to believe that's because nobody wants to admit such a thing is one of the most highest selling anime of,  well....ever

Oregiaru Vol 3 sold 8,908 copies, I guess that's a good number. Let's hope they will invest in a short OVA series or a Movie in the future.

Nice seeing Tesagure getting some love. 

Great numbers for Kinmoza and Show by Rock. 

I'm surprised that Kancolle has sold that much despite how harshly it was received in Japan, judging from some of the comments it got after S1's  finale. 
>> ARTICLE
**Well shit almost every new volume was overestimated.**

Charlotte: was 33-39% over estimated, the only summer show to go unscathed.

Overlord: This is a huge upset, 52-63% overestimated. People were projecting this to hit 10k.

To Love Ru Darkness: This was also overestimated 59-63%.

Gangsta: 28-37% overestimated .

Gakkou Gurashi: 47-50% overestimated,the manga had done really well.

This week is an absolute battlefield, its getting ridiculous now, usually this much is rare but this week is filled with them.
>> ARTICLE
It pisses me off that Charlotte of all things is the only one doing well.

Basically all 25/09 sales become "overesitmated".

**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**  

A: I am very curious about **["Kantai Collection"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21511/Kantai_Collection:_KanColle)**, mostly because I know very little about it and its massive popularity. Also, from the few pieces of information I do have about the show, the premise seems extremely ludicrous, which is only piquing my curiousity. 
>> ARTICLE
**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

A: As I'm quite the fan of the last two seasons I'm quite hyped for [Kuroko's Basketball](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24415/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season) airing it's 3rd season, after watching the 2nd season I couldn't wait anymore and read the manga so I know what happens but I'm still very interested in seeing it animated, Honorable mentions to Tsukimonogatari and Durararax2.
>> ARTICLE
**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

A: There are a lot of sequels I'm looking forward to this season. Durarara!!x2 is probably the one I'm most excited about, though JoJo's is a close second. 
>> ARTICLE
> Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?

Durarara x2. This is probably the safest pick for me, I don't drop shows so I generally stick to sequels until 3-4 weeks in where I pick up some newer anime.
>> ARTICLE
>**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

Kantai Collection. I mean, it's based on a game where girls are battleships. Let's see how they'll make an anime adaption out of that.  
Aldnoah.Zero season 2 is another one I'm looking forward to. I liked the first season and I'm curious about how they'll explain and continue with [spoilers for season TWO](/s "Saazbaum, Asseylum and Inaho still alive. Asseylum probably is in a wheelchair and Inaho probably has some major aftereffect(s) and character development of being shot by Slaine. I don't know about Saazbaum though.")
>> ARTICLE
Between the [ecchi fest](http://youtu.be/oVYzfGDK_Uk) and the **10 goddamn sequels** we'll be getting.

I'm looking forward to [Yuri Bear Storm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26165/) and [Junketsu no Maria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26441/) carried by the director's names.

Yuri Bear Storm is by Ikuhara, the auteur mind behind Utena and Penguindrum, you owe yourself to follow the production of his work.

Junketsu, despite being an adult ecchi comedy fantasy(which is still better than an LN btw!), it by Goro Taniguchi, the director behind Planetes(and one of /r/anime's darlings as well).

So yeah, *look into those*, without much hype and anticipation.

Tsukimonogatari also get my attention, since I'm a Monogatari fan.

###[And how could I forget JOJO!](http://youtu.be/AJu5mATNUZs)
>> ARTICLE
> which is still better than an LN btw!

Why the hell do people have such a large problem with LN's?

**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

Hmm, I don't really know if it's coming this season or the next but I'm quite psyched for your Digimon 2015, due to nostalgia. Also psyched for Durarara season 2.

Nothing new looks all that interesting. Nice to have Reconguista continuing  I guess. Also Fafner's sequel might be interesting but I haven't seen the first season of it yet.

A: Motherfucking DRRR S2 and Aldnoah S2

Aldnoah/Zero Season Two and Koufuku Graffiti. 
>> ARTICLE
**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

A: Assassination Classroom, because the premise sounds freaking bizarre, and it should be a fun watch.  
Yuri Kuma Arashi, because of the names attached, and also yuri.  
Also maybe Aldnoah.Zero S2, because I really liked the first part. I am kinda worried how they'll continue without some massive asspull though.
>> ARTICLE
**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

Durarara Season 2

>> ARTICLE
Can't say there's much hope for that man's legal career if he can't even read the evidence, smh
>> ARTICLE
As DeForrest Kelly would say: "Dammit Jim, I'm an Engineer, not a Defense Attorney!"

Although I *did* do Mock Trial back in high school. Fun times, but I was always frustrated by the lack of evidence to use. The NYS Bar was never as thorough as I wanted them to be with the cases. I mean, the current high-school level case isn't even an actual trial, it's a criminal hearing. And apparently the person from the Bar who co-ordinates the Mock Trial tournament wasn't even aware of that until I brought it to her attention.
>> ARTICLE
Ho man, thanks for reminding me of my high school trial

Shit was tight on my end. I feel like the limited evidence kinda made things a bit more realistic and made you have to focus more on inferences. 
>> ARTICLE
The focus on inferences thing can kind of backfire if the cases aren't constructed well, though. I remember one case we won the trial decision on where my summation basically did Phoenix's thing of using implication from the evidence to put the blame on one of the other side's witnesses. We won by points too on that trial, which was nice.

Still, my favorite moments were the ones where a witness makes a small error that invalidates their entire testimony. I still remember the trial where one of the prosecution witnesses, for a case where the crime was set in Queens, testified that she witnessed everything happen in Brooklyn. The next words out of my mouth after she finished her statement were "No further questions, Your Honor."

Guess what I brought up in summation for that trial?
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, fucking witnesses. One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name. I hope we won that trial...

I remember in another mock trial I was the shop teacher witness and I straight up looked up how to work some of the machinery mentioned (even though it was barely relevant to the case) just in case. The prosecution tried to ask me how to work it just to throw me off and I threw it right back in their face. It was beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
> One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name.

You think that's bad? My first year, our top attorney couldn't remember the names of *any* of the witnesses. And apparently he had been doing that for the whole time he'd been with the team. Still won rounds though since apart from that he was a damn good attorney. And seeing witnesses turn the tables back on cross examiners is always tons of fun.

since u answered on a comment where someone mentioned magi i have a question. 

u wrote in Spring 2016 "Magi: Adventure of Sinbad (prequel/season 3)". isnt it just a sequel of Magi: Adventure of Sinbad / Sinbad no Bouken? 
in short: why did u write prequel/season 3?

I wonder what they will do with Sapphire?  
Her VA, Matsuki Miyu died recently.

That's terrible!

How'd she die?
>> ARTICLE
That dreaded Japanese cold if I remember right. Anime don't mess around when they say "but you'll catch a cold!" Apparently the cold virus variant in Japan is much deadlier than it is elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm wondering what they will do too. She was perfect for the role too
>> ARTICLE
She sure was.

Likewise, I wonder how they will deal with the fact that Matsuki voiced Lailah in Tales of Zestiria, which is getting a anime next year.

She died too young, with no one to replace her. :(
>> ARTICLE
I may have to stop playing it in English now, even if Lailah is Rom from Neptunia, Mami from Madoka, and Satsuki from Kill la Kill.

She's definitely missed :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh, she's Rom in the English dub.  
Neptunia is one of the few games I like to hear in English.  
IMO, Neptune's English VA kicks ass, and might be better than the JP VA. Compa too.  
Iris Heart though, JP all the way!

I wish Matsuki had a protog to take over her roles like Lupin the third's first VA, Yamada Yasuo had.  
He stated that he wanted Kurita Kanichi to take over the role if he died, and Kurita did.  
Kurita really sounds like Yamada did, so Lupins voice didn't really change much, which is good.

I have big hopes for [Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W) as I am quite fond of the manga
>> ARTICLE
Why do you have Schwarzesmarken as a Total Eclipse spin-off?  
It's a spin-off from the original Muv-Luv VNs, just like TE is.

I'm saying this mostly because I want people to try it, since it's more like the OG VNs, and not like TE(or more like TEs first 2 episodes).

Rewrite is hopefully gonna be amazing.  
We have Tanaka Romeo onboard, so I have moderate hopes for it.
>> ARTICLE
> Why do you have Schwarzesmarken as a Total Eclipse spin-off?

MAL had it labelled that way. Fixed it

> Rewrite

They were making some pretty ballsy statements. I remember reading a TL that went something like "the anime will be the ultimate play-through of the game"
>> ARTICLE
Lol what?

So, either it will be amazing or it will fail so hard it will be the next Tsukihime.  
I hope they know what they are talking about.  
Some staff are quite good, but 8-bit itself worries me, Comet Lucifer wasn't good, though Grisaia no Rakuen was quite nice.

Yeah, MAL ain't a super reliable source, I don't know why many believe it is(not directing this at you).
>> ARTICLE
yeah I left a lot of their "information" out, that one just slipped thru because I know pretty much nothing about the Muv-Luv franchise. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fine.

If you like mecha or sci-fi and don't have a problem with lots and lots of reading, then I suggest you try the VNs when they come out.  
I honestly think they are one of the best stories in fiction.  
A wild ride indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I'm planning on playing them when they come out. I started on Katawa Shoujo and Grisaia a couple months ago, and went ahead and bought a bunch of others like Saya no Uta and the new Clannad release. 

Now I just gotta play all of them...
>> ARTICLE
Saya no uta is really fast, about 10 hours and it's pretty good but super nsfw, praise urobutcher
>> ARTICLE
> praise urobutcher

back when he was actually 3edgy5me in the 2000s, hitting his peak with the total grimdark fest that was Fate/Zero. Dude started to mellow out around 2010 or so.
>> ARTICLE
Oh nice. I hope you like 'em.

To add to your list, you should try Ourai no Gahkthun, an amazing Steampunk VN.  
The writing and TL quality is amazing in that one.  
And if you liked Yumiko from from Grisiaia, then you might enjoy listening to Neon from Gahkthun, they share VA. 

Btw, do you use VNDB? It has a lot of info in VNs.  
Here's the page for [Gahkthun](https://vndb.org/v11033).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah VNDB has some pretty good info. Saved me a bit of grief regarding 18+ titles on Steam.

Yeah Yumiko's route was fun, its always nice to watch the ice queens melt. Amane and Sachi's routes were probably my favorites though. I've been taking it easy on VNs lately though.. bad endings are some of the most disturbing things I've ever experienced, I get shaken up just thinking about them
>> ARTICLE
Have you started Saya yet?  
That one requires being "okay" with really fucked up things.  
I totally recommend it though.

Amane's route was my favorite. Yumiko's was probably my least liked one, but Yumiko as a character was great.  
Grisaia was/is very good, I liked it enough to spend 500 USD on the kickstarter, so, yeah. I like it.

I mean, I know its Urobuchi so I know what I'm getting myself into at least.

Visual novel is fucking amazing, much better than Chaos; Head or horrible anime adaptation of C;H. I really hope they don't screw up this one. In my opinion ;C even better then Stains; Gate.

[Tenkyou no Alderamin ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki:_Tenkyou_no_Alderamin) is also adaptation that I'm looking forward to, because it's one of my favorite light novel, and it's cool as fuck.

No, with exception of some references here and there they are pretty stand alone.  And C;H anime is kinda bad, don't watch it.
>> ARTICLE
**"Fairy Tail Zero" will be a next arc of Fairy Tail (2014), starting Jan. 9, at episode 91 (or 266).** So this will actually be an "arc" in the 2014 anime? Not its own standalone thing? Do i have to catch up to the 2014 version now or what?
>> ARTICLE
I think zero can stand on its own pretty well. Just if you haven't seen any fairy tail at all (at least some of the first anime) you won't know why some of the characters are important.
>> ARTICLE
Zero will be about the first master of fairy tail. Watch at least some of fairy tail to get what it feels like
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes will it be? 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it, it's a prequel manga so if you've seen a good portion of the anime, youre probably fine. The current arc ends right before the start of Zero, and I saw someone post saying it's the perfect spot to put the adaption in as a flashback arc.

Should mean that the anime will have plenty of manga chapters to work with too, by the time Zero is done
>> ARTICLE
After the last episode for the preview for the next episode they had zero instead of the main story so definitely part of the normal anime and not seperate.

Bullying is a ultra rare theme in anime i think, even rarer they try to spin a positive story with it as the theme.  Even rare KyoAni is behind it. I don't know how to feel about it honestly. could be bad or good 

>Teekyuu 7 

TIL there exists an anime that has survived to the 7th season. Is Teekyuu the gunsmoke of anime? (In duration of the series at least, you get it)
>> ARTICLE
Well Teekyuu is like the definition of chaos and insanity complete with references to everything, and who doesn't like a weekly 2 minutes of chaos and insanity (still including references)?

It also has ridiculously low production costs, if I am correct it is all drawn by one person.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know KyoAni was behind Koe no Katachi. Was already interested but hearing KyoAni just skyrocketed it. Seeing how well KyoAni have done the last few years, it's safe to say they'll do pretty well with the material. 
>> ARTICLE
the animation itself might be pretty good but the material might flop. 

I don't know if KyoAni doesn't like it they will just butcher it to be more appealing as they do with most series. 

Honestly its either gonna be great or its gonna be shit. I dont think there will be a middle ground
>> ARTICLE
the source material is my favorite manga. i'm very interested in seeing how kyoani will compress 64 chapters into a movie. 

i get the feeling that the movie *will* turn out well, but people who enjoyed the source material will inevitably complain. They will have to cut out a significant amount of content simply because of time constraints.

I'm pretty sure the movie will do great, they can definitely cut some stuff from the manga if I recall correctly it was somewhat slow sometimes

It's high-profile only because of all the backers who have lost faith in the project after all the shady shenanigans that went on with the production companies and the ~~hostile~~ takeover of Kinema Citrus over it while kicking Creative Intelligence Arts to the curb.

I still remember that huge-ass post on this sub by someone allegedly close to Creative Intelligence Arts bitching out Jiro Ishii and fingering him as the source of all the problems with Under the Dog.
>> ARTICLE
It's a significant show because it was crowdfunded. A show with basically no prior knowledge or fanbase was crowdfunded by people in the West. [The director ](http://myanimelist.net/people/6518/Ando_Masahiro) is also pretty significant and has worked on a bunch of other high profile stuff.

Sword Art Online Season 3 should be on here too, release date unconfirmed but likely 2016.
>> ARTICLE
That isn't necessarily true.  By this time of year before Season 2 they already had Extra Edition announced and ready and it aired at the end of December if I remember correctly.  SAO: Ex then had the S2 announcement on it which followed in July of the following year.  First Season was announced in October the year before the Summer airing date.

So if they follow the same trend and announce SAO S3 at the end of the upcoming movie, you might end up waiting another 6 months afterward at least to get Season 3.  So unless the movie comes out real soon, there is a very high probability that the show gets pushed to either the end of 2016 (Fall season) or ends up in the 2017 Winter Season.

I would guess Winter 2017 is when SAO Season 3 is going to land.

It's good.

* MC is not the typical *"will and friendship always wins over logic"* shounen MC, but a more logical one that doesn't underestimate his opponents. But, at the same time, he is not a flawless character.

* The author goes against tropes, makes characters interesting and unlike other shounen manga, he is not afraid to make the story progress.

* Things you would think would happen in the distant future (40+ chapters), end happening way sooner.

* Morally ambiguous characters and an interesting world add more flavor to the story.

Waiting for this to go to /r/all and the shitstorm that follows
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I came here from /r/all and I have a question for the people here. Don't you find it kind of creepy that most of your animes **hypersexualize underage girls**? Doesn't the fact that underage girls are considered fanservice indicate that perhaps most of the anime you guys watch are for **teenage boys**? I mean that's why it's called a **Shonen** right? So I guess my question is, assuming most of you are over 18 and I don't mean any offense: **aren't most of you too old for the animes you guys are watching?** 

Edit: Also, I'm not generalizing all anime or looking down on anime at all. I used to watch alot of anime in the past as well. Outlaw star and Honey and Clover series were my favorites. But I only ask this because when I look at the anime today, they seem alot more pornographic than I remember.

Edit2: to clarify, I don't think anime is weird. I just think that the people in their 20's and 30s watching shonen, anime targeted towards teenage boys, are weird. 
>> ARTICLE
I, myself am 20 years old. I just started watching anime last year, actually. Watch something like Corpse Party and tell me it's for kids.
>> ARTICLE
Well that depends, is Corpse Party a Shonen?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, didn't see the Shounen statement. Watch Hunter x Hunter. Since you probably don't care too much about watching the show start at the yorknew arc. I think it starts around episode 50.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're overestimating the average age of people in this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you are asking an honest question, so I will give you an honest answer. Do keep in mind that I am answering solely for myself and do not claim this to be the answer for all of /r/anime/.

Yes, most anime are aimed at teenaged boys, and those are called shonenen, they compose a large amount of anime released now a days.

Second of all, although most fanservice in anime is underage, it is highschool. Those girls are all fully mature and developed, and other than names, they do not display any of the characteristics of teenage girls (typically speaking of course, there are exceptions), because, and you might have guessed it, they are't real boys and girls.

Now, allow me to point out that although some anime have never ending fanservice (highschool of the dead comes to mind), in most of them it is moderated and used for humorous effects. Although this may ruin the moment if thrown in at the wrong time, from time to time it is fun. Not gonna complain for the occasional fanservice.

As for too old for anime. Aren't most people on /r/gaming/ or any similar subreddits too old to play video games? Yet they still do (and me!). Why? Because they enjoy it. Because it is fun. Because it takes my mind off the long day of work I have. I enjoy doing it.

Lastly I will bring up the point that shounen, action, and fanservice are not in my favorite anime. Unlike what most non-anime viewers I have met think **Anime is not just mindless action and loli fanservice**. There is so much more to it. Believe it or not, you can do much more with animation they you can do with live actors. It is great seeing all the forms of art. I view anime kind of like I view books, as a way to see what I will never happen in real life. Weather it be magic, dragons, super-powers, or the occasional fan service.

My favorite anime of all time doesn't even include any action scenes, fanservice, or aimed at teenaged boys. That anime is called [Charcoal Feather Federation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), and it is beautiful, philosophical, and just overall amazing. It is also a great entrance anime for people who aren't into the action fanserviece kind of stuff. (not that I'm advertising it or anything *cough cough*)

One last note is that when people here discuss fanserviece, incest, lolis, or the recent bath thread that got into /r/all/, they typically aren't taking it seriously and more doing it as a joke on everyone, including yourself and me.

Hope that clears up all your qualms, if you have any more questions or arguments feel free to respond to me.

Some of the people here might be a little bit offensive, but that's because nobody likes it when other people insult their favorite activity, so please don't feel insulted by it :)
>> ARTICLE
Well I never said all anime were for teenage boys, I enjoyed Honey and Cover when I was 18 and loved it. I can definitely appreciate it as an art form and I think that it can be for all ages just like videogames. But I think it's kind of creepy when people in their 20s or even 30s are watching **shonen's**, which is targeted towards teenage boys with their endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls. 
>> ARTICLE
First: not all of the anime featured in the OP are shonen. Many are notable seinen and ecchi titles with clear R+ ratings. Also, not all shonen has "endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls" and just because a show has a *target* demographic doesn't mean people outside that demographic are forbidden from enjoying it.  This behavior isn't even exclusive to anime; American cartoons like Adventure Time, Sponge Bob, and Steven Universe have a ton of adult fans.

Second: just as with books and movies, anime is a medium with many different genres.  Yes, shonen is one such genre, based on an age demographic.  You, apparently, prefer josei titles like Honey and Clover.  There's nothing wrong with either preference.  

To be honest, I'm not into fan service, but you won't see me giving people shit about enjoying all their love for ecchi and harem anime.  *It doesn't hurt me for them to like it, and it doesn't hurt you either*.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually with you on that. The amount of never-ending fanservice in anime is really annoying, especially when it spills over to shows I actually like.

However after a long hard day of work, I can sometimes appreciate some mindless action and teenage girls. That is all I have in defense of fanservice.

Wild Card test

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Edit: forgot to add, I will include up to 5 for *each category*. So 5 girls and 5 guys.

Edit 2: someone just posted a girl for abs, so 5 girls (man boobs will not be counted, sorry :p) and 5 uh... sets of abs?

Edit 3: Forgot to put 2014 anywhere in this thread, only characters from 2014 are valid.

? NGNL does a legitimately good job of making the protagonists win in exciting and creative ways. They don't just magically power up but always win without feeling like it's just bullshit plot armor. I don't see the problem with liking a show that does that, even if the fanservice is way too heavy.     
Haven't watched AgK, no comment.
>> ARTICLE
Exciting and creative asspulls do not a good show make.  "Oh no, I'm losing this chess match.  Better seduce the opposing player's queen.  Because that's a thing I can do, apparently."

Not to mention the characters are written poorly.

The only interesting part of NGNL's characters are Sora's and Shiro's debilitating social anxiety when separated.  Yet they never play on it for more than a joke.

[](/somad "Seriously, the show isn't good.")
>> ARTICLE
>the characters are written poorly.              

In what way are the characters poorly made? It seems more like you just don't like it on some principle and enjoy feeling superior to people who do like it.
>> ARTICLE
They have no depth to them.  They're paper thin.  I don't see how it isn't obvious how poorly written they are.  They are literally *just* tropes given shape.
>> ARTICLE
A show being good is completely subjective. You may consider it bad writing and as such think its bad, but thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced. Therefore it is only an opinion. You can only attempt critical evaluation and objectivity, but its completely impossible to actually achieve it. That is because whilst you may have some logical criteria that you use to rate a score, how highly you weight each criteria and score each component is 100% subjective. For example you might consider OP characters like Sora, Lelouch and Light as bad characters because they are tropes to you and it creates no intensity or tension in the plot. However some might consider it good writing because to come up with logical asspulls requires linear like thinking that has to make coherent sense throughout the show. For example Sora against Jibril, took an entire episode for his asspull to play out. Also some people might see depth in the tropes. I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree. Read an essay called ["The Author Is Dead"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkQsRVrWM6c) or just watch the youtube link. Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the original authors intent is pointless and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything. Just because you think its bad, doesn't mean its bad to people like me and /u/Pozsich, and honestly if you think you can be objective when discussing things like this. You're more mentally challenged than myself.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the old "all opinions are equal so let people think what they want" argument.  There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how your going to act.

Just got to point out though:

>I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree.

Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.  That's like saying "I considered Frankenstein a comedy" and telling everyone the author's intent for the book was comedy.  It's clearly not.  Speaking of which.

>Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the **original authors intent is pointless** and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything.

That is straight up bullshit.  The authors intent is *everything* when it comes to a story.  One clear and *huge* hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare.  What was his intent when he used the words he *created?*  Is it up to us to *interpret* these wholly original combinations and words?  No.  It's the author's duty to tell us his intent.  Saying that an author's work is borrowed from his experiences is only half the truth.  It's up to the author to organize those experiences into something *injected* with his intent.  To guide his reader/viewer along a preordained path *he* set up.  Different interpretations come from readers/viewers straying from that path and finding themselves at the end.  Sure, they made it to the end, but not the way the author intended them to.  If people had no intent towards their creations, we wouldn't create them.  The author's whole purpose when writing a story, or taking a picture, or painting a landscape, is to deliver a message.

In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions.  It looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
AH, the old "you are so incredibly misinformed that I pity you" argument. There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how you're going to act.

>Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.

Authors never explicitly state the purpose of a show. With Date A Live it is under the impression of Poe's Law which states that unless the author purposely states that it is satire, it is both satire and not satire. It is up for the individual to decide. 

>One clear and huge hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare. What was his intent when he used the words he created? Is it up to us to interpret these wholly original combinations and words? No. It's the author's duty to tell us his intent. 

Did you even study English, holy fuck man. Do you even understand why Hamlet is so famous? Its famous because there are so many different interpretations of what his words mean because it resonates a different aspect for different viewers. William Hazlett stated "it is we who are Hamlet", meaning that how we perceive Hamlet and his intentions is correct, because we see ourselves in his character. Source (http://shakespearean.org.uk/ham1-haz.htm):

>Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain. What then, are they not real? They are as real as our own thoughts. Their reality is in the reader's mind. It is we who are Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is above that of history. Whoever has become thoughtful and melancholy through his own mishaps or those of others; whoever has borne about with him the clouded brow of reflection, and thought himself "too much i' th' sun;" whoever has seen the golden lamp of day dimmed by envious mists rising in his own breast, and could find in the world before him only a dull blank with nothing left remarkable in it; whoever has known "the pangs of despised love, the insolence of office, or the spurns which patient merit of the unworthy takes;" he who has felt his mind sink within him, and sadness cling to his heart like a malady, who has had his hopes blighted and his youth staggered by the apparitions of strange things; who cannot well be at ease, while he sees evil hovering near him like a spectre; whose powers of action have been eaten up by thought, he to whom the universe seems infinite, and himself nothing; whose bitterness [75] of soul makes him careless of consequences, and who goes to a play as his best resource is to shove off, to a second remove, the evils of life by a mock representation of them - this is the true Hamlet.

Your entire point there is complete and utter bullshit. Texts are famous for having so many different interpretations, none of them are correct and none of them are wrong and none of them are correct. As long as it is correct to the individual that is all that matters. Different viewpoints from different things it what makes a text controversial and famous, however none of these viewpoints are correct. If people could reach an objective truth, then there would be no disagreement on anything. This discussion forum wouldn't even exist as there would be no discussion, just people agreeing with each other.

>In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions. It looks incredibly silly of you.

You realize you're doing the exact same thing right? Whilst there is no official name for what you are doing, its the exact same as mine but with the opposite meaning. You have come up with a theory and belief that the authors intent is law, and have argued as such. I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead" and argued that point.

Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
> Did you even study English, holy fuck man.

Heh, it's been about 4 or more years since I studied English.  We didn't cover Hamlet for very long either.  In fact, I believe we only watched the Mel Gibson movie.  We did read Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, and Taming of the Shrew.

I actually just found you and Pazzu's discussion a couple days ago about *the exact same damn thing* as we're doing now.

After reading through that and giving your position some more thought, I can see it's merits.  I will say that, when given, an author's intent trumps personal revelation every time.  Take Bradbury for instance.  His intent in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to illustrate mass media's (specifically television's) affect on people and how it makes them less able to digest complex forms of media, like books.  You probably know the story of the college lecture.  One interesting thing is that this certain debacle was possible thanks to personal interpretations.

I *would* like to probe your mind some more on this theory and hear some more of it's counter arguments on some ideas I've come up with in regard to measuring objectivity.  For instance, you mention this:

>thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced.

When comparing opinions does one defer to the other when they have more experience?  That would seem logical, as with any field, you defer to those who have more experience (as I'm doing right now).  And how does this work with art?  Some artists are considered better than others, but if left up to the opinions of the masses, wouldn't it not matter?  I might have more to think on this, but I'll wait for your response.

Now this is in regards character writing specifically.  Say you and I have different opinions on Sora as a character.  I say he's well written, and you say he's poorly written (I think we likely have the opposite of these opinions).  What would happen if we took a character we *both* agreed was well written, and compared him to Sora?  Wouldn't we be able to quantify the characteristics that are well and poorly written between the two?  For instance, backstory, motivations, etc.

Two last things.

>I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead"

[](/pointandlaugh)

Come now, we both know your name isn't Roland Barthes.

>Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.

Shit, that *was* condescending of me.  Sorry.  That happens when I get into heated discussions. :(
>> ARTICLE
Besides that all this is true, he's not even trying to be unbiased anyways. He says the characters are written poorly because they're thin tropes, but what's the line? Most anime characters are tropes or slight variations on tropes, few have the time to go deeper into the characterization than what is necessary for story progression. I don't see how holding a flaw that is extremely prevalent in anime versus a single one makes it outstandingly bad. Is it a good trait? No, I would agree not. Is it a bad one? No, it's a normal one.                         
Also to your points; we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well like the video said every character is based on the authors own experiences and other mediums hes seen. Everything that is ever written is borrowing different components of different shows because nothing is a completely original idea, and has been taken from elsewhere. I agree with you here.

>we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.

That is where I disagree with you. Its not that you can approach it, but you can attempt it. You will never get near a point of being objective, but you can attempt some form of a logical criteria. However what you use to deduce that a show is "good" is different from another person. I could say the only shows that are good are the ones that are entertaining. Others could say what makes a show "good" is it has to be pretty. Someone else could say it has to combine those two elements. There is no set standard for "good", its completely subjective. You can only sort out your own subjectiveness and explain your personal criteria for it, but it doesn't mean its any more objective. It is still utterly 100% subjective.

Okey dokey o u o Lol, you really hate big boobs.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so. I would hope not. Because even if I'm not attracted to large breasted women, and don't want to be large breasted. It would just be another kind of body shaming and body policing. 

Women can be large chested and still have wonderful, attractive, wonderful personalities. And being attractive isn't everything.

But I'm not attracted to breasts. And I'm tired of being expected to. 

I'm also tired of people treating large breasts like they're better.
>> ARTICLE
I was just making a joke based around my preferences, man. It seems like you're taking this really seriously..

As for people treating them like they're better - that's just their preference? Like subjectively they are *better* to certain people. 

But there are plenty of people who think flat chests are better... in my experience, more people who think DFC is better exist than people who think bigger boobs are better.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I was taking people too seriously.

And sadly, there are people who seem to act like larger breasts are *objectively* better. And try to make arguments from nature as to why. 

The whole flat chest thing is a bit like the fat acceptance movement. There's a pressure for women to be skinny, yet curvy. Not so much flat chested, or plus sized. So maybe some of us, including me, get a bit overzealous about that. Sorry.

A lot of us get loud and proud, because we don't want everyone thinking that "bigger is better". Maybe a bit too loud and proud.
>> ARTICLE
S'okay~

Lol, well, I wouldn't do that, it's silly. Nothing is objectively better, appearance wise anyway. 

I kinda get what you mean... um, I think? If you're skinny but flat chested people tell you to be curvier, and if you're fat but apple-shaped or whatever (aka not curvy), people tell you to be curvier, too. So really only hourglass shapes are being accepted on either end of the spectrum of weight.

I'm confused as to how Rin won best female character over Chiyo, but then lost best female main character to Chiyo. They're both main characters. Obviously I'd have liked Rin to win both because she's my one true love, but I'd also prefer Chiyo win both to what we got. This isn't really a complaint with the structure of the poll or the votes really... but it is odd, which you said to mention.
>> ARTICLE
They posted like 20 threads. People probably paid attention less in one of those threads.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on perspective, atleast for me.. example: I like Rin more as a character, she's more interesting and has a deeper story to her.

But being a main character has different criterias and I find Sakura to fill the main character role a lot better than Rin does.

That's my two cents on the matter atleast.
>> ARTICLE
I like One Week Friends as much as the next guy, but how did it end up over Ping Pong or NGNL (I didn't even like this, but I figured it was a shoe in)?

Edit:
>Best Scifi: Mahouka

Haha, god damn it
>> ARTICLE
Just a smaller sample in votes, NGNL won anime of the year in the bigger poll, so I don't think it would lose in its own season.
>> ARTICLE
> Haha, god damn it

I mean when you have Parasyte(not even sci-fi in my book but whatever) and SAO competing for sci-fi Mahouka(a great sci-fi LN series with good worldbuilding in my book) is amazing by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is a much better show than Mahouka, and it is science fiction. That's enough reason for it to win right there. And like many said, Space Dandy as well. 

I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything, and I don't even think silver spoon s2 was a nominee! A shame, as they are both in my top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
>Parasyte is sci-fi

It's more paranormal than sci-fi. There is no real "science" involved in the story so I don't think it really counts for sci-fi. I personally enjoyed Mahouka more than Parasyte(seeing how the former wore out its welcome around the half-way point) but that's just my own view on both shows.

>I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything

I didn't expect it to take anything besides best girl/boobs. The animation is lacking in comparison to KyoAni and Ufotable and the story is overshadowed by much better shows this year. The comedy wasn't even that good compared to other shows like Barakamon and Gekkan Shojo. At least in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content? Wonder what kind of science is involved in "drowned world" by J.G.Ballard or Delaney's "Dhalgren".... You don't get to define genres as you see fit, by ignoring works that already influenced and shaped its history.

It is utterly implausible with the contortions the parasyte body can pull, without even acknowledging this needing any explanation, but still it chooses to frame its story in rather tropish SF way of an alien invasion by superiorly capable biological organisms (even the manner of doing so is rather reminiscent of old SF classics like Heinlein's "puppet masters" - with slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, attaching themselves to peoples backs, taking control of their victims nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  -  or ofc of "Body Snatchers"), as opposed to phantasmal incursion, demonic possession or any other explicit invocation of the unnatural.
>> ARTICLE
I bet next things we should add to the sci-fi genre are ghost, the ring, vampire, zombie and other unreal shit.


Because "You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content?"
>> ARTICLE
You are utterly ridiculous if you believe sf can only mean hard sf or be anything at all and nothing in particular, despite the glaringly obvious fact that it has continued to be a well defined genre filled with as you put it "unreal shit" for as long as it has existed at all. Consider say Bradbury's works like the martian chronicles, pretty much any part of new wave of science fiction you care to name etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, do tell me your criteria to qualify a work as "sci-fi".

And don't tell me that "those are fucking magic and shit. Only things that are recently brought up can be considered Sci-fi. Those shits have existed a long time already. Magic and science are not mixed well because Index said so."
>> ARTICLE
my criteria? why would I bother making up my criteria -- winners of Hugo and/or Nebula awards are "my" criteria. literature courses on science fiction are "my" criteria. For I've pretty much only named commonly accepted staples and staple writers of the genre. Like any genre its defined by institutions, reference body of literature, conventions, publishers, editors, magazines etc. 

Point is parasyte is simply far too derivative of certain acknowledged classics not to be in the same genre as them.

I can't even parse your second paragraph. 
>> ARTICLE
So, you just superficially compare them and say "yep, sci-fi"?

If you take away "alien invasion" setting? will it still be sci-fi?
Because this looks more like "Ushio and Tora" than a sci-fi work.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte being the better show is merely your opinion and other people might think otherwise (but yeah I agree that parasyte anime is better than the Mahouka anime). 

In terms of science fiction genre though Mahouka has a far greater detail, world building and interesting stuff than Parasyte. Parasyte just has Parasytes whilst Mahouka has technomagic, super advanced weapons, a 'society of the future' etc... the poll was best science fiction anime so I consider the win legit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was also competing against Space Dandy and Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
Granted KoS was a pretty good sci-fi show as well(I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you) but loses to Mahouka greatly in terms of detail, worldbuilding, and characters.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I doubt the voting leaned towards Mahouka because of anything you just said, I'd bet more on the fact that its very popular, and gets a huge boost from the /r/OneTrueTatsuya crowd, but I dropped it very quickly so I won't press it.
>> ARTICLE
True, the popularity of it had a big deal to due with, and only a small minority liked the worldbuilding, but I think one of the main attractions of it *was* the world(and by extension the magic system and the OPness of Tats)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you

It certainly is more of a comedy, but there are definitely sci-fi elements in it. Also shows can be more than one genre.
>> ARTICLE
I think the implication was that it's "main" genre was sci-fi, just like how SAO's "main" genre is sci-fi when its a more adventure-style story.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh SAO's main genre isn't sci-fi but more like action, adventure, harem and romance
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't it say its harem/romance(although it *is* a major element of it) but more so adventure and action.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong was one of the best shows I've seen in my life. The animation, story, art, pacing, and everything about it is just so perfect.

So little votes....probably because the voting system was confusing (it would be nice if a link in the first body took you directly to a poll/bracket rather than another thread that then links to a poll). I can't say this is a good representation of r/anime. Maybe try again another time in the format that u/Jordy56 does with his best Girl/Guy contests. I really liked that format, and I think most people here would agree.
>> ARTICLE

> Isshuukan Friends

Ping Pong is last. That's all I see.

As much as I liked Isshuukan Friends, I voted for Ping Pong in the best Spring Anime category...it being the only anime I've ever rated 10/10 while it was airing. 

Mahouka won best Sci-Fi? I guess the only real competition out of the final 5 was Parasyte, although I personally liked Sidonia better it didn't make the cut...I suppose the SciFi aspects of it were good enough. This, however:

>Best Male Character of 2014
>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

Someone please help me understand this. I don't get it at all. And with nearly 1/3 of the vote, no less.

Kind of surprised to see Zankyou no Terror win best Original Anime after it bombed (get it? bombed? hahahaha I'm so funny) in the last few episodes. Surprised it won thriller too, expected the Madoka movie to fare slightly better (not win, of course, but top 3). AND it won summer too, over Barakamon and Nozaki-kun? ...I may have underestimated how much /r/anime liked ZnT...oh well. 

Overall, was nice. And dont worry /u/UgotMAL, I am *perfectly fine* voting Ping Pong the best of 2014 three times. Even though its (probably) not going to win.
>> ARTICLE
/r/OneTrueTatsuya thats why
>> ARTICLE
There must have been a mistake... surely that was the vote for worst character?
>> ARTICLE
All this time I thought /r/OneTrueTatsuya was satire. I mean, I'm pretty sure it was originally. But to think that you... *people*... genuinely like Tatsuya just fills me with rage. People give Kirito shit all the time on this subreddit, but Tatsuya is way worse and yet he wins the best fucking male character of 2014? Are you fucking kidding me /r/anime? You people disgust me. 
>> ARTICLE
You should know that most of the anime audiences nowadays are very young. So it's hard for them to appreciate any "artistic" anime they watched or will see in the future.

It's just how the industry works. Almost everything now aims at young age and show like Ping Pong is hard to find a place among the kids.
>> ARTICLE
You speak the honest truth. I think the people downvoting you are probably just kids who are butthurt over that first comment.
>> ARTICLE
said the guys who commented because they are butt-hurt by the result.

I believe it's called salt for us.

[](#suave)
>> ARTICLE
You are being dwonvoted but i have to agree.
>> ARTICLE
The Stu was just too strong with this one, /r/anime couldn't fight it.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsuya is not worse than Kirito. He's a different MC. Kind of an anti-hero but not really. He doesn't fight for 'justice,' he doesn't do the right thing all the time. People think he's OP as fuck(which is true), but he trained to get that way. Plus he's not all bitchy/emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, honestly, in any other anime I wouldn't necessarily dislike Tatsuya that much. What made me dislike him so much in Mahouka, and ended up making me drop the show despite really liking the action scenes, is the fact that half the goddamn show is just people fucking worshiping Tatsuya. And other various ridiculous shit, like Tatsuya telling the paramedics how to do their goddamn jobs. He's a shitty chuunibyou-pandering character who's only supposed flaws aren't even actually flaws. 
>> ARTICLE
u know, with his powers he could know immediately what damage did someone take for faster treatment, but probably u didnt know this since u dropped the series
>> ARTICLE
We stand united in the question of "How the fuck did Shiba Tatsuya pull that victory off?" in that category.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong won nothing, not even sports?  I guess people just don't like good anime.

Just look at all the votes. Almost nobody voted, it does not represent anything. (that voting system is a bit confusing, so no wonder).

Of course. Chuunibyou population in Japan increased. :P

Whoa whoa. The Mahouka LNs are good. The anime adaptation is poor at best.
>> ARTICLE
Transformers is also one of the highest selling movie franchises of all time, using sales metrics is a poor way to talk about quality, but from what I understand the LN is much better than the show anyways.
>> ARTICLE
I mean it *is* a very good series with amazing worldbuilding and attention to detail. But you're right, sales isn't the best way to say something is good. But in this case, it is good. And yes the anime butchered a lot of the worldbuilding descriptions as well as the plot of the Seven Schools Tournament as well as the Yokohama Arc.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka is a really good example of Sci-fi done well, I'm not saying the show is good because it's not, but the Sci-fi aspects of the show are good.
>> ARTICLE
Calling Mahouka good science fiction is like saying Pupa was a good example of the horror genre. It's just not.
>> ARTICLE
It has a great world with an intriguing futuristic setting and sci-fi/fantasy elements. I believe it's a great example of a sci-fi.
>> ARTICLE
Time of Eve is a great example of science fiction. Shinsekai Yori is a great example of science fiction. Mahouka is a great example of schlock.

Fuck this gay earth

Fucking why

At least Gekkan Shojo and Barakamon got 1st and 2nd respectively. That was a though choice.

Damn right.

Inou battle and nisekoi are about the same in terms of quality

>literally the same in terms of quality

>Nisekoi is animated and produced by SHAFT

>Inou Battle made by TRIGGER

Now that's bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Just because a certain studio makes it doesnt mean it better then other anime.
>> ARTICLE
You said quality. The animation quality, background design, and overall clarity/prettiness of Nisekoi trumps Inou in almost every way. Say what you will about its plot, but *is* a pretty beautiful show that is well animated and designed to be visually appealing.
>> ARTICLE
I voted Inou battle for its uniqueness over Nisekoi's generic-ness.  Agree that they are about on par for core "harem-dom".

How come the winners of Winter 2014 and Spring 2014 aren't even a voting option for best of the year?
>> ARTICLE
Because they were knocked out I suppose, I suppose the people who voted Nagi no Asukara and Isshuukan Friends voted something else on that thread.

Fck yes!!! Nagi no Asukara :))

_One Week Friends._ won?  Sweet!

I've been looking for a good Romance to get into.  Looks like I'll have to check out this Nagi no Asukara after White Album 2
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara and One Week Friends were not what I would've called as the best of their respective seasons... They weren't *that* good. But to be fair to NnA Winter 2014 wasn't a very good season so it didn't have much competition.

>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

Total shocker.

It feels good to see Nozaki-kun everywhere. s2when?
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Tokyo Ghoul so high up for best first and last episode is great, but also disappointing since the whole series could've easily been that quality... That said, they did a pretty good job of season 1 with the limited episode number they had.

Nagi no asukara has romance?

NagiAsu wins twice, I am relieved, however SAOs ED3 came third place, weird...

Salty about Ping Pong not getting Spring AotS even though it's easily AotY.

I don't think Ping Pong deserves even a top three finish in Spring AotS but hey.. that's me.

wow   i couldn't be less salty, pretty much everything i voted for came first or in the top 3, it feels strange being happy with a contest here
>> ARTICLE
I suppose the difference between best ed song and best ed is the first being only music and the other being animation included?

I still don't get how Zankyou no Terror won that one. Yes, it fit well in the soundtrack. But a lot of other stuff in the list was better animation wise and/or music wise. It's probably  something about most people having watched the show and only voting on it because they remember the great soundtrack and immediately think the ED should win because of that as well... 

Whatever, as long as I can think well enough for myself humanity can survive..

One Week Friends beat out Knights of Sidonia and Ping Pong for best of Spring. Just wow. And Mahouka winning best science fiction over Sidonia? Both One Week Friends and Mahouka are the epitome of mediocrity. That they won anything is laughable. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't get it either.  I am not a fan of Sidonia, but Mahouka definately was mediocre.  Every other episode it seemed was bad.  And the main character was such a gary sue, it was terrible.  
>> ARTICLE
Personally I find Mahouka to be mediocre, but out of what we had to pick from I believe it pulled of the Sci-Fi aspects the best out of the crop, that being the reason I voted for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka did a pretty good job with the sci-fi. I've heard that it's a lot more obvious in the LN's, but it seemed pretty clear to me during my watch that the anime had an actual world built around it with hints of explanations ('magic' as a form of energy, wave patterns, sequences and the use of technology, etc.), but I watch for that stuff much more closely than most on here, so you probably just missed it.

It's not just more obvious, there's entire pages dedicated to worldbuilding in the Mahouka LN.

**Best anime of Winter 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 76 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 71 votes!

>Log Horizon - 64 votes!

I can live with this... not bad at all in fact.

**Best anime of Spring 2014**

>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

>No Game No Life - 70 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 64 votes!

WOAH! That was unexpected, still I'd rather this than have Ping Pong win.

**Best anime of Summer 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 72 votes!

>Barakamon - 53 votes!

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - 51 votes!

Kind of expected considering most people who voted for the well written laid-back series Nozaki-kun and Barakamon split their votes between the two, Zankyou no Terror was still a worthy winner IMO though.

**Best anime of Fall 2014**

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 128 votes!

>Shirobako - 66 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 52 votes!

A near perfect result, I'm surprised that Shirobako made it that high though but glad it did.

**Best animation of 2014**

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 320 votes!

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 62 votes!

>ME!ME!ME! - 57 votes!

That overwhelming victory.. still my runner-up finished second so cheers for that.

**Best OP of 2014**

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 117 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your lie in April OP 1) - 79 votes!

>Trigger (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 66 votes!

I find This Game to be the best OP when you include animation but if you wouldn't include it even though that is further down my favourites would be #1 #2 and #4 so I suppose /r/anime doesn't have quite that poor music taste after all.

**Best ED of 2014**

>Dareka Umiwo (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 103 votes!

>aLIEz (Aldnoah.Zero) - 84 votes!

>Shirushi (Sword Art Online ED 3) - 63 votes!

Mind if I retract my last statement?

**Best Comedy of 2014**

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 148 votes!

>Barakamon - 109 votes!

>No Game No Life - 64 votes!

Well voted, the two most deserving got spot 1 and 2.

**Best Slice-of-Life of 2014**

>Barakamon - 140 votes!
 
>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 99 votes!

>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken (I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying) - 84 votes!

So far all my picks has placed first for these... let's just hope they remain in the top 3.

**Best Harem of 2014**

>Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace) - 130 votes!

>Nisekoi - 111 votes!

>Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari - 90 votes!

Hooh? Inou-Battle was that popular huh? well Nisekoi still made 2nd.

**Best Thriller of 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 152 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 131 votes!

>Psycho-Pass 2 - 76 votes!

While I do believe that Kiseijuu is the best of the animes we got to pick from Zankyou no Terror definitely pulled of the Thriller aspect the best and hence is the worthy winner here.

**Best Romance of 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 125 votes!

>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) - 87 votes!

>Golden Time - 83 votes!

Clearly not enough people appreciate the purity of Golden Time and it's amazingness, you should be ashamed! well I suppose it's understandable since Nagi no Asukara is quite the anime as well. I do believe it's a stretch calling Your Lie in April a good romance anime thus far however, it's good drama but the romance in the series is very undeveloped thus far... has potential though.

**Best Sports of 2014**

>Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season (Kuroko's Basketball Season 2) - 141 votes!

>Free!: Eternal Summer - 120 votes!

>Haikyuu!! - 107 votes!

Kuroko won?... and Ping Pong finished last?... HAHHAHAHA SUCK ON THAT PING PONG FANBOYS!! WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW?!! FUCK YEAH!! (no but for real though I find Kuroko amazing and I love it so, so much but I did not think for a second it'd win the category... this makes me kind of happy.)

**Best Science-Fiction of 2014**

>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular at Magic High School) - 203 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim- - 150 votes!

>Sword Art Online II - 93 votes!

I did vote for Mahouka, it does the Sci-fi genre the best out of these series, albeit it's probably the worst anime out of the bunch IMO.

**Best Action/Shounen of 2014**

>Hunter x Hunter (2011) - 197 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) - 137 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 75 votes!

This is a surprise... I did vote for HxH but I thought it'd be a close standoff with Bahamut... clearly not enough people appreciated that series.

**Best Male character of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 111 votes!

>Yato (Noragami) and Wenge Kong (Ping Pong the Animation) (tie) - 69 votes!

What? for fucking real? I mean I'm glad Inaho didn't win this crap but I can only give this one to the circlejerk on someone cheating the poll... how is Tatsuya the best Male character? he's not even close to the depth or development to the others, in fact the only one I find him better than is Tomoda and Inaho out of all the contestants... just how?

**Best Female character of 2014**

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) - 118 votes!

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 74 votes!

>Asuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online II) - 61 votes!

Meh, all the mainstream ones got the votes, though I suppose Sakura and Rin at the very least are worth the votes they recieved, you guys don't have enough love for Hatoko though.^TensaiBeatNibutani!^Woohoo!

**Best Character Development of 2014**

>Seishuu Handa (Barakamon) - 67 votes!

>Shinichi Izumi (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim-) - 54 votes!

Wasn't aware people thought Meruem had such good character development, I mean it was good but I think Handa Seishuu (my vote), Izumi Shinichi and Kong Wenge all had greater development.

**Best Male Protagonist of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 141 votes!

Come the fuck on guys... Araragi was barely even in Hanamonogatari and fucking Tatsuya again?... well atleast Handa finished 5th.

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 85 votes!

>Shiro (No Game No Life) - 54 votes!

Hmm.. I think I might've voted Akane here for how great of an MC I find her to be but Sakura was my 2nd choice so not salty about it.

You guys lack Suou Amane in your life, go play the Grisaia VN you guys! though I suppose the choices were understandable albeit subpar to the great fluffyness of big sister Amane.

>Tokyo Ghoul - 69 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 66 votes!

I don't know... despite how much I feel like Ping Pong is overrated and doesn't deserve half of the praise it's getting around here it should have won this one because that last ep was amazing, Tokyo Ghoul could've also won this with no complaints but I'm not sure I can agree to Barakamon.

**Best Artstyle of 2014**

>No Game No Life - 126 votes!

>Space Dandy - 52 votes!

Yeah, I really enjoyed the art of NGNL albeit I enjoyed the excellent use of switches between artstyles in Nisekoi even more, on a sidenote I'm glad Glasslip made it as far as it did, I nominated it in the wild card because I find the art in Glasslip to be it's only redeeming quality and it seems people agree with me.

>Meruem (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 75 votes!

I don't know, there was no character in Akame ga Kill I found to be very good, Slaine on the other hand was well written and is interesting to watch, Meruem was also a very well made antagonist.

WOOOOOOOW!! Really? I personally believe Aldnoah.Zero to be vastly superior to any of the other entries in this category, I mean sure KLK had good OST and so did ZnT but they don't even come close to what Sawano Hiroyuki pulled off in A.Z.. and it only got 34 votes?

Thank you! I appreciate it!

I liked tatsuya shiba for best male charachter. For awhile now anime studios doing shonen have been spewing out super flawed main charachters so that it's easy to give them charachter development. And then they just keep beating you over the head with their flaws and foibles. You just correct some of the hyper-unrealistic idiosyncrasies, and suddenly charachter growth. It feels very pandering, and is really annoying to watch. 

Tatsuya Shibas charachter is a big fuck you to all that.
>> ARTICLE
But at the same time he's so bland... he literally has 0 development and everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much...
>> ARTICLE
> everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much

Thats just a side effect of him being op as fuck whilst not being flashy/ keeping things secretive. Also the anime adaptation being pretty mediocre and not explaining anything.

I too was getting pretty fed up with main characters who was clearly inferior to the antagonist but just 'barely' winning by power of friendship/ justice/ willpower right, training for x time or, my personal hate, plot armour (fuck you Kirito). Tatsuya being op as fuck from the beginning, who just completely shat all over the antagonists (amusingly to the level thats a lot like how the main antagonists in shonens shit all over the good guys when they first see him) was a nice change. 

If it makes you feel any better I can only see the Divine Tatsuya worship dropping off in the future. No season 2 (atleast as far as we can tell) and season 1 has enough hate I think to dissuade people from watching it (atleast on this subreddit). There will always be a core crowd (people who read the books cos they are good imo) who will continue the worship but you get that with almost any anime. 
>> ARTICLE
True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality and the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Well being salty won't change the result.
>> ARTICLE
Both points are seen that way due to poor adaptation imo.

> True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality

This is in more detail in the books but basically Tatsuya is incapable of feeling strong emotions except being over protective of his sister due to magic lobotomy. Hence why he seems so bland in the anime. He shows a lot of his personality by thinking (since he generally doesn't speak much because its not worth the effort) but this isn't shown in the anime. Tatsuya has no problems with being bored. 

> the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Side characters also has a lot of relevance in the books but the anime didnt show it. There were prob too much to animate and not enough time. They cut out an entire volume which focused almost entirely on side characters only. Lots of the scenes involving side characters were just cut out (along with the pretty detailed technomagic babble at magic works). 

Personally drowning in too much salt from /u/jordy56's polls to care about this one.

So reading all that and then looking at this chart, can I just assume that there's a ton of rage over Robotic;Notes' adaptation or was it never that popular to begin with?

And was there a definite correlation between censorship and increased BD sales like for To-Love-Ru Darkness?
>> ARTICLE
Read the text under **slight change**. Robotics;Notes has low points because it's a recent addition to the stalker chart. It still has a decent average rank, so expect it to move up in points at a decent rate

I see what you mean; that's what I get for skimming.  So looking at both can give a fair idea of what to expect.

> TLR: Darkness #1

Obviously they're not actually watching the show, but buying the BDs so that they can get it uncensored.

> LB! selling well

Not surprised, but it will not even match Kanon, much less AIR or Clannad, in sales. I hope that quality/sales don't drive off a cliff when we reach the dramatic parts.

> JoJo ahead of Chuunibyou

HELL YES. This is awesome.

> Hidamari's very strong showing

This makes me all kinds of happy.

> Busou Shinki edging out Psycho-Pass

This is what you get for "no moe": you get beaten by a terrible fanservice show about dolls doing cute things (of course there is actual moe in Psycho-Pass, but nevermind).

> SSY and Tempest getting really low ranks

They must be waiting to see if it'll pan out. Still a bit disappointing from Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Busou Shinki already has an established fanbase thanks to the toys/games, so that's probably why it's doing better so far. I know I've bought the OP/ED singles and preordered the character singles even though I don't have high expectations for the show now. After episode 3 I'm only watching it because I'm an established fan and other entries in the series have had decent plots.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised LB made it that high. I'm not watching it, but I haven't really heard much good about the adaptation.

Kind of interesting looking at sales in terms of the ratio of BD:DVD. Girls unf Panzer has 11:1, while Magi is at like 1:1.3.
>> ARTICLE
the anime is absolute garbage so far
>> ARTICLE
I figured that DVDs were bought only by "casuals" (josei-watching women, people watching shounens like the big 3, Magi, Gintama, etc.) because those shows always have a disproportionate number of DVD sales compared to "otaku pandering" shows, a category into which Girls und Panzer would definitely fall.

Well I think the hype and popularity is the reason the sales are high. The adaption is decent so far.

Seitokai S2 hasn't even had a single episode out so far right?

Would explain the low ranking.

Could you confirm that? I heard it was a real TV series, with a LQ "episode 0"/preview on the web?

[Official website](http://seitokai-no-ichizon.com/onair/). It's being produced by the same company that did Ebiten so I expect it to air on TV next season.

(As for the site, normally they'd list the stations on which the show would air i.e. TBS)

It is NicoNico, they are stuck in the olden days of 480P streaming.
