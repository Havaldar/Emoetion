Glad to see a WT for Hajime no Ippo, imo one of the most underwatched anime out there. Really stands out as a story that highlights the importance of characterization and what it can do for relatively simple plot setups. Add in the raw manliness and motivation that the show provides and you've got a summary for why it's one of my favourite anime. 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Animation for fight scenes in this show are extremely advanced for the time IMO, Madhouse pullin through back then too.
>> ARTICLE
Shit is so manly 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's great and has some really memorable moments [like this NSFW shower scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_FlQMrkZ2Q) Perfect sound effects.
>> ARTICLE
Lol the elephant sound! 
>> ARTICLE
. . . Did. . . Did that thing trumpet?
>> ARTICLE
Dempsey Roll!!!

For those that haven't seen it, don't let the art style turn you away. This anime is pure hype, and the payoff is massive.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny though, i love the art style of season 1, it's still amazing for me.
>> ARTICLE
> This is where Hajime no Ippo really shines. If I had to pick the defining element of Hajime no Ippo, it would be its character development and interactions.

Immediately knew I'd agree with everything after I read this. Ippo could hold up solely on its characters without any boxing matches in it simply because of how amazing and hilarious their interactions are. 
>> ARTICLE
/a/ recommend God-tier anime.... Need I really say more? Go watch it!
>> ARTICLE
What I like about the show (Well, manga and series.) is that everyone (even [his rivals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duM3apskeHA)) has had at least one good fight, sometimes more. Takamura consistently [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75Mof5AAd8) great [fights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUrQ9c6y2SQ). Even the trainer [Kamogawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggK1a5EEE4) had a good one. Heck, there was an entire OVA dedicated to one of the more *comedic* characters Kimura and his fight with a former rival of Ippo's, and it was fandamntastic.

One of the weakspots of the manga is that when a fight is shitty, it's *really* shitty. Ippo vs. Wally and Miyata vs. Randy Boy Jr. are both good examples of just that. Both were fights that dragged on, had less than compelling endings, and in Miyata's case, ran counter to how he's been developed.
>> ARTICLE
You forgot to mention the music.
When ippo starts weaving and the guitar comes on I was literally getting chills.
Also Weight of my Pride.
>> ARTICLE
Man this is one of my favorite anime because it did everything right. The comedy, the story, the pacing, and especially those fucking fights. They always got you hyped before the fight and they were all so tense and unpredictable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, thanks to this anime I'll randomly throw punches when I'm bored or tense
>> ARTICLE
Yes yes and more yes!!

If *THAT* wasn't enough to make you want to watch this, then maybe [***THIS***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKx46j7qfiM) will help you!

The sounds, the tension, the fucking "Yes! No! NO! YES!! Fucking take that! YES!!!" moments during the fights makes me clench my ass so hard, that i could make diamonds if someone put a piece of coal up my ass!
>> ARTICLE
That's kinda a huge spoiler...
>> ARTICLE
I personally enjoyed this one [more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yEJkWkcIok)
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for the anime, but I've read the manga until chapter 500-something before dropping it. Hajime no Ippo is incredible, as it has so many characters that the mangaka is willing to develop. The fights are always exciting and fun to read/watch, and from the few clips I've seen the animation in the anime is excellent. 

The only thing I sort of didn't like about it was that Ippo always had to struggle/work hard to win a fight, even if the opponent was one he clearly should have been able to demolish.

I still highly recommend it for people who want to see the MC training hard to accomplish his dream. 
>> ARTICLE
> Ippo always had to struggle/work hard to win a fight

Just like in real life? Or have you never had to struggle to accomplish something? In the first season he is still learning to box and is going against people that either A have been boxing for a while or B is a completely different style than himself. After that he is going against people who are all good enough to beat him at any given moment. Remember the world is a big place. I think Ricardo proved that to everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally I've read the manga three times, every new chapter is still very well written and gets me excited. Seeing the art style change over 20 years is quite something too.
>> ARTICLE
There are fights that he handles easily, especially later in the manga. You feel tension build up and when the fight comes its just a shock to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, Ippo wrecked [spoilers](/s "a challenger for the belt in his opening match before Takamura fought Hawk. He also managed to destroy a couple of his later challengers (post-anime) relatively easily, and even knocked out his last title defense challenger in one punch").
>> ARTICLE
I only remembered the first one. I've dropped the manga so maybe  I haven't gotten to the others yet.
>> ARTICLE
>Ippo always had to struggle/work hard to win a fight

I think this is because of how he fights. Effectively speaking, he's that guy that *only* ever plays Rock in RPS, since it's the only thing he knows how to do. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it just felt a bit unrealistic to me. It didn't affect my enjoyment much though.
>> ARTICLE
He fights like a more agile Tyson. Tyson practically killed people.
>> ARTICLE
in the anime it never really got to that point.  The only time I can think of was when he was fighting his junior, but that was a mental block that caused problems
>> ARTICLE
> fighting his junior

is that a euphemism for masterbating?
>> ARTICLE
no, his *junior* is an elephant that he has no chance of beating.

I was literally talking about his junior before, like a person who he trained
>> ARTICLE
I imagine it'd be difficult with the gloves on. 

Unless he went bare knuckle....
>> ARTICLE
i know:) i was just jerking you arround :p
>> ARTICLE
Ah, well hands off Takamura. It's weird
>> ARTICLE
allrigth ill beat it...
>> ARTICLE
Don't get so dickpressed
>> ARTICLE
you wank to try and take me on?
>> ARTICLE
Ippo is best MC, almost too likeable
>> ARTICLE
Hajime No Ippo is what got me to watch other sports anime too.           
I didnt actually like boxing before i watched HnI and i came out of it loving it.
>> ARTICLE
I rated the first season a 10 but the next 2 seasons weren't as enjoyable. I get that the other characters such as Takamura and Miyata need their story's shown but I don't like that ippo sat back for 2 whole seasons without venturing out of Japan. [Spoiler](/s "He found the dempsey roll but relied on it too much due to him having no actual skill, then the only bit of improvement he did was evolve it which was also dangerous for his own body. Then you look at Miyata, Sendo, even barfmichi who are actually trying to improve whereas ippo acts like he's trying but doesn't get anywhere.")
>> ARTICLE
I actually like the 2 seasons after the first more, because it was faster paced and I liked learning more about the other characters.  Different preferences I guess
>> ARTICLE
It's not only a "Boxing" anime, it's an anime about life in general

I cant wait for the next season <3
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I just started watching this. I'm on episode 10 right now and I think I'm hooked.
>> ARTICLE
Paging /u/freakdota
>> ARTICLE
IPPOOOOOOO
>> ARTICLE
My main issue with Ippo is that I much prefer the background behind his opponents instead of his own. I always root for the other guy and that makes me not a big fan
>> ARTICLE
that's true, Ippo is just fighting because he likes it/wants to become stronger.  For fights like the one against Wolf, I really wanted the opponent to win.  I think that's one of the strengths though.  Just because he's the mc doesn't mean that he has the better reason to fight.  It's just like real life, even though we fight for a job or something, there may be someone who needs it more or even deserves it more.
>> ARTICLE
I think the one that did it the most for me was against Ozumo towards the very beginning. I REALLY wanted Ippo to lose that one
>> ARTICLE
I've never once wanted Ippo to lose. I find his story believable. Kids dad dies he is a loser then he becomes a beast and it is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy Haikyuu, you should 100% definitely watch Hajime. There's no question.
>> ARTICLE
Comedy might be a weakness too because the puns don't translate into English and I'm tired Ippo's big dick jokes. Ippo is still one of my favorites despite that and there are really good laughs in the show. 
>> ARTICLE
The fact that they straight up grab each other's dicks didn't appeal to me. It was only funny the first time. 
>> ARTICLE
There's so much more to the comedy than that though.
>> ARTICLE
At least we get a few great, hilarious moments like Aoki's ultimate move. 
>> ARTICLE
Aoki's fight was by far the most entertaining fight. One of my personal favorites. Unorthodox/Trickster > Textbook Fighting 
>> ARTICLE
One of my all time favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
This series is awesome. It also inspired me to take my workouts to the next level. Now I have a punching bag and I train on it when I get the chance. 

Also, other than Ippo, Sendo is one of my favorite characters.
>> ARTICLE
This was my favourite sports anime of all time by far. Cant wait for another season, Rising was amazing 
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is a series that effortless goes from genre to genre. It has some of the funniest moments in anime, intense action, great slice of life and has made me cry on more than one occasion. Definitely recommend to those that haven't watched it to look beyond the animation style and the fact that it revolves around boxing. 
>> ARTICLE
I like how the funniest anime I have seen is a sports anime. Just shows how good this is.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime No Ippo is famous among filipino anime fans. Its good that it gets the limelight for other countries
>> ARTICLE
As a huge fan of punch out (both the old school NES version and the remake), I have had this series in my sights for quite some time, however the length is somewhat intimidating. How long is a typical arc? Also how often are fights?
>> ARTICLE
As I said before, it starts pretty slowly and I don't think the first pro fight is until the 10th episode. However he has his first boxing fight starting episode 2 as a training fight.  Usually each fight is an arc(some exceptions obviously).  I'd say it's 2-3 episodes setting up the fight and then 2-3 episodes of the fight itself with some additional stuff(beach, practice match, other people's matches) thrown in as well most of the time.  

So I'd say it's probably a fight every 5 episodes with some deviations.  After you get to the debut match, it becomes very nicely paced.


>> ARTICLE
Sounds just like what I'm looking for with an episode count that high, my biggest concern is the pacing. Sounds great!
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching this a few days ago and absolutely loved it. One thing I would add is the fact that all the OPs are absolutely amazing. They got me pumped for the show at hand and each OP was appropriate for the circumstances (since they gradually became more intense after each switch, similar to the anime). Definitely a must watch for any anime fan.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite action anime and it actually got me interested in real boxing.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty awesome series, I generally recommend this to people who haven't seen it but want to watch something different than the usual stuff.

I'd be more willing if it weren't 75 episodes.

My favorite!

MILD SPOILERS IN COMMENT IM NOT GOING TO SPOILER TAG THE ENTIRE GOD DAMNED COMMENT.

I'm on episode 60, and it's absolutely fantastic.  The only critique I would have concerns episodes 13-40, where the formula goes:

1. Scout opponent and find out that he has a move that Ippo can't beat.
2. Devise a counter-move or do some other training that will neutralize the move.
3. Begin fight
4. Ippo gets in big trouble
5. Ippo gets comeback KO win
6. Sappy scene where opponent sees silver lining in loss.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of watching it now i have a reason, count me in.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat, I almost started last week but now I'm totally in. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher too
>> ARTICLE
I *love* Hajime no Ippo! Been some years since I watched it, and would probably join for a rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
Those of you that are thinking of watching it for the first time;

This show is great in practically every aspect, also, if you haven't watched any sports anime and have watched some shounen, this series really will appeal to you.

I personally think that the best part about Hajime no ippo is the time spent characterising Ippos opponents, to the point it will leave you wondering who you are meant to root for in some cases. Don't feel like you shouldn't pick it up, the original series ranks 19th on MAL with a score of 8.86 and is the highest rated sports anime. Obviously there is some bias with these scores, but I hope that could give you some perspective on this show.

Original or newer one. First time watcher and I'm not sure of its a continuation or remake. Either way I'm in

Original one. I'm a first time watcher too

The newer episodes lead on from the end on of the original series of 75 episodes, so we have 126 episodes in total with 2 movies and an OVA episode I think.

Sounds good to me

Let's do it

Never seen it but it's been on my ptw for a while so I'm down.

I'm halfway through the third season so I am about ready to watch it a second time. I am loving my first time through and am fairly certain that the second time will hold up.

Dempsey Roll is love, Dempsey Roll is life.

The seasons go like this:  
Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting! (76 episodes)  
Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting! - New Challenger (26 episodes)  
Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting! - Rising (25 episodes)

I haven't watched the OVA or the movies yet - but from what I heard those seem to be side stories anyways.

Edit: Seems like the movies are not side stories. This means I know what I will be watching between finishing my current watch and starting ther rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
Both movies are part of the plot, mostly champion road but it isn't as good. Mashiba vs Kimura is a must watch though, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
neither movies are side stories

Both movies aren't sidestories, especially not champion road.

Yes!

I could do 5 episodes per 3 days. I've always meant to watch it...

i would like to join in as well, believe i first saw it back in 2012, still haven't found something that could top it

I really want to. It's my favorite sport anime. But I am really bad at keeping up with stuff like this. I always take things at my own pace and won't be able to keep up. That or I'll just binge it.

Yes! I need a push to start!

>> ARTICLE
Would love to but Crunchyroll only has the first 25 episodes and I can't find the dvds at a reasonable price anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
I think 5 episodes every 3 days might be a little too much, imo. Although, it definitely is better than 1 episode a day (because then it would last forever.)
>> ARTICLE
i think 5 is reasonable because of hype u cant stop after just 1 episode

This show is so damn good.

Oh that'd be fun. I haven't seen the original in forever. Speaking of, I just realized I also need to finish the third season...gotta get to that...

Great show, id rewatch. Already have several times.

With how much I'm loving the haikyuu rewatch, I think I would be down. Also for the schedule I would like to recommend the way the haikyuu schedule of one episode per day during the week, and two episodes per day on friday, saturday, and sunday.

Yes i would be interested, i haven't seen hajime no ippo and this would be the perfect chance for me to watch it. I've been getting into sports anime recently and haven been planning to watch ippo for some time now. 5 episodes per 3 days sounds fine to me

Everyone should be watching this.

Watched it thrice still love it to death though.

Been meaning to rewatch it myself, I'm in.

I would be interested but only if the rewatch is at a pace around 1 episode a day, much faster and i wouldnt have the time to keep up.

Probably gonna binge the whole series in 3 days but I mean sure why not, but to be fair this was going to happen anyway now I have a just cause.

nah

Holy shit, what a fucking body blow.

Guess I'll see everyone again in 5 years for the next season
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I can wait another 5 years, off to the manga it is. And btw why does it take so long for the anime to come, Kaiji took a similarly long time for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
If they don't rush the anime they can keep making more seasons consistently instead of doing one Fall 2013, Fall 2014 and then Fall 2019. If they keep it to 2013/14 - 2016/17 - 2019/20 they keep a consistent pacing for new seasons to come out and ultimately keep higher viewing scores.
>> ARTICLE
The ending caption was chocked full of emotion after this arc. With the dedication of this show to the original VA of Kamogawa and the VA of Nekota who just recently passed away. This arc was very fitting.

And now we can wait another 5 years for the next season! (hopefully shorter than that...)
>> ARTICLE
"You're so open, I can see your organs!"

I really don't think I've ever seen a show, movie or anime that has inspired me as much as this series has. I've seen Gurren Lagann, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Hokuto no Ken and many others but nothing else compares to seeing a character rise off that mat again with that green sparkle in their eyes.

Fuckin onions man. It's memories of this show that helps me get up in the morning.

The sheer determination these characters have is absolutely amazing. So inspiring.

It's this show, along with D-frag, Kill la Kill and Uchuu Kyoudai that I'll miss the most that has ended this year. Here's hoping we'll get another season with a smaller time gap than the one between this and New Challenger.

Even though it isn't a fighting anime, Bakuman had the same inspiration for me.  The work your damnedest until you achieve what you set out for/want.  Stunning.  I too can't wait for more!

Pick up the manga, you will have ippo for some time... until you catchup and then... well... then you wait.

If you're looking for anything similar you might want to try Slam Dunk, got a similar vibe to Ippo, great characters and story, only problem is the awful pacing or Great Teacher Onizuka, not about sports but the comedy is pretty similar to Ippo's and it's just as inspiring.

Also Aoki and Onizuka have the same seiyuu.

That fight gave me the chills. Amazing arc from the beginning to the end.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea how this did in Japan? Seems really dead on here but I'm hoping it was popular enough to keep going.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, the first BD/DVD volume did not chart. I don't think the series was made for the sake of selling those though but rather to advertise the series itself, in hopes of getting more sales of the manga volumes. It will very likely be a while before the next season rolls around, unfortunately.
>> ARTICLE
Would be great to know the viewership rankings and see where its at. Most likely some super moe shit will be in the top 10. Im sad to see this season end. I hope for another in the next year or two.

Viewership rankings for what in particular? Most watched anime currently? Most watched anime for its airing time?
>> ARTICLE
That earth-shattering punch, god damn. I'm convinced that Kamogawa could have gone toe-to-toe with a Gundam and won.

I'm really going to miss this series. These last few episodes and both title fights have been some of the best anime I've ever seen. Just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone tell me where the anime leaves off in the manga, I know the actual current arc ended at episode 21 so can anyone tell me what chapter that would be?

But, the chapter where Takamoura wins over Eagle is 557.

Wow, It is really sad how the voice actor of Nekota and Kamogawa both died recently (consdiering how they are old friends in the anime). I geuss they're both going to see Yuki-san now. It ain't gonna be the same when the anime comes back and they have a new voice actor both of them.

i was clenching both of my fist watching this episode! amazing episode, animation and the voice actor the whole thing was just so captivating. saturday will get boring without this anime:(

Damn that [BODY BLOW](http://i.imgur.com/fzqdUat.jpg)! So glad to see this finally animated!

Sad to see the season end again and we have to wait a few more years for the next one. I thought this would be a low season ender but it was actually a great ending to the series. if ever the anime doesn't continue, this ending fitted it well.

:D
>> ARTICLE
Those 2 body blows... Holy FUCK!!! They animated it just like in the manga. I can die happy now.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, what must have his fists looked like after that fight? Crazy body blows, Kamogawa has sledgehammers for arms.
>> ARTICLE
Well as the opposing coach guessed, they were already badly damaged from him punching that log into the river embankment. But his bones shattered and tore up his hands.

That's why he moved into coaching and the physical science behind boxing, because that fight did so much damage to his hands he could never fight again.

o well, was a good run ;)

And here i was thinking there would be like 5 more episodes, i really wanted to see [](/s "Ippo getting mad") 

Oh well, hopes for next season!

I wanted to see the fight where Ippo [](/s "Gets a one punch KO")

Oh but thats a lot of chapters. Its the last (ippo) fight before the current one in the manga

Those body blows made me wince over and the whole episode had my fully attention with emotions raging. Amazing season and my still holds the seat as my favourite anime series, combining great story telling with comedy, great animation, fantastic sound track and I could go on it was near perfect IMO, without faulting it.

Am I the only one that wants to start boxing now? Too bad no one in my area specializes in boxing. Everyone cares too much about MMA nowadays. I just dont see honor in putting a man on his back and hammer fisting his face.

Welcome to "Working Hard - The Anime: Fighting Spirit will take you far!" - the rewatch.

If you are here for the fights, don't be scared; there will be fights, lots of them.  
But first we have to train a bit, establish the characters and show - not tell - just how determined Ippo really is.

Even later in the series we see Ippo train quite a lot but these first episodes truely show him working hard with an intense schedule. And I love the anime for that.  
In so many shows is a character that rambles on about "doing anything to achieve his goal" but this usually boils down to gritting his (mostly his, only rarely her) teeth and work through some pain to luckily land the super serious unbelievable hidden technique Mk. II.  
But Ippo shows where it's at - continious hard work is needed to get some results. Not motivation but discipline, not a burst of power but a steady flow of strength.

I got into the habit of working out while watching anime and Hajime no Ippo certainly helped me to keep at it.

It probably also helped that Ippo is so relatable. Not the biggest loser ever but definitely struggling. Unable to handle social situations well and never truely sure what to say and how to react. Seemingly always overthinking and simplifying the wrong things.  
I think many anime watchers - and people in general - can relate to that.

So let's embark on this journey and see where it will take us, shall we?

Also I just need to mention that Ippo's mother is a freaking great mother, probably one of the best in all of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well goddamn I guess it's time to board the hype train! pretty good show so far, elephant scene had me rolling and from what I've heard it's only gonna get better from here on out! 

okay so at least for now this post has no upvotes and no comments so if it doesn't get any more this will pretty much be the reddit equivalent of being the only one to show up for a fan club meeting. 

I hope this does get upvoted I want to talk about this show. I want to talk about a lot of shows actually but I don't have any friends who watch anime so I have to call my brother who lives somewhere else to talk about shit and he never wants to hear it. 
I don't have any friends actually. maybe it's because I spend so much time watching anime and playing lol. huh, fuck me I would go outside and get some fresh air but I'm iving in australia so it's past midnight. I don't actually remember the last time I went to sleep before midnight. 

I should go to sleep now. goodbye world.

hey dude if you want a buddy to watch with, there is a youtuber that has almost all of hajime no ippo in his channel, he is still watching the 3rd season, it may not be much but you will kinda have someone to share the experience with https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmVTrPNAONGKEe5i1IJhvmYRiqOfcNwgV

careful his list is a bit of a mess, it isnt in order, so try just to read the number of the episodes cause the title of the video may have some spoilers, have fun

Edit: almost forgot he doesnt have some episodes i think cause his camera died or copyright but he still has 95% of the anime, be ready for the hype with him :D

            {
            System.out.println("I should go to sleep now. goodbye world.");
            }
        else
            {
            playOP1(true);
            }
        }
    }

I started learning to program in Java last week, and now any greetings or farewells to the world result in looping statements in my head.

Also, calling playOP1(true); of course starts [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daqdbn2ok5E), hypothetically. I haven't gotten far enough to know how to program a method that would do that, but my coding skills will eventually be so advanced that I'll be able to automate my anime intake...err, somehow. That'll be the day.
>> ARTICLE
    if (episodesWatched = 5)    

This line will result in an error. It needs a double equals:

    if (episodesWatched == 5)
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, true, I use the assignment operator instead of the equivalence operator. To make it worse, I actually know that, I just wasn't thinking. It's hard to reprogram your brain to associate "=" with assignment.
>> ARTICLE
Your indentation needs some work...
>> ARTICLE
That wouldn't surprise me, considering I've been programming an entire 8 days.

Having said that, for the moment I find it readable. I just focus on keeping all the corresponding braces aligned. Everything else is somewhat minor.

Also, "Your indentation needs some work..." doesn't really tell me what you think I'm doing wrong. Help me fix it! I'm always willing to learn.
>> ARTICLE
So you would deprive yourself of the joy that is the rest of the series? Since you will never hit that else block
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, you're right. I'll need a looping statement, then, and a method that sets it to wait 24 hours before executing the next loop cycle. I can't do that yet. =P

I've watched the entire series and the sequels already, anyway. =O
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is amazing, and honestly the first 5-6 episodes are the slowest of the series; once it finds it's pacing, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. You're really gonna love it!

You should really sleep more, it will help...everything.
>> ARTICLE
I left it at episode 12 last year sometime, I definitely was getting hyped over it. I really should get back into it soon and do the rewatch with everyone 
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't you include the word REWATCH, I got so excited. 
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy your first time watching greatness guys,expect a lot of hype,great music,op and ed,and comedy :D(sometimes feels too)
>> ARTICLE
each op is ducking great 
>> ARTICLE
and a lot of endings(hekireki being my favorite ;D)
>> ARTICLE
That Inner Light though....

>> ARTICLE
I love sports anime so it was about time I watched the one that many say is the best. These first 5 episodes have already managed to make me hyped a few of times.

Also, I instantly fell in love with the ending song. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wcxvl378nI) is the full version for your convenience.
>> ARTICLE
imo that is the best ending song of all anime i have watched, the feels i get from this song...
>> ARTICLE
yeah man, I kind of like the opening song too because it sounds like he's saying "I want to die lost mind"
>> ARTICLE
Is that not what he's saying? 
>> ARTICLE
My subs had him saying "I want to dive lost mind" I think my version sounds better though.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh. When I watched it way back when I'm almost positive the subs said "I want to die" always thought it was kinda funny 
>> ARTICLE
Is this like a rewatch or something?
>> ARTICLE
yes. Forgot to include that in the title
>> ARTICLE
My body is not ready for all that nostalgy feels
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching it with my daughter (we started before this thread) and we both train MMA irl; it's a damn fun show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series last year, one of the most likable characters I've seen. Overall the story was really good.
>> ARTICLE
Is this a rewatch thread or did they release something new?
>> ARTICLE
Its a rewatch. You're too hopeful
>> ARTICLE
I assume a rewatch thread, especially since it is  5 episodes every 3 days. 

But god damn did I get excited for a minute there
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.  OP doesn't know to include [Rewatch] in the title.
>> ARTICLE
ahhh this takes me back. The start of a legend
>> ARTICLE
Is this re watch going to continue after the first season? I've never seen this show so I'd like to watch it all. 
>> ARTICLE
We'll decide near the end. If I'm not able to, I'm sure someone would be willing to pick up the later seasons
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, just to be sure, do I watch the episodes before the day mentioned or watch them after ? Sorry it's my first time. 
>> ARTICLE
You watch them at your own leisure. The days listed are just they day the thread to discuss those episodes will go up. As long as you watch those episodes before looking at the rewatch discussion thread, and don't spoil any episodes that are after those up to and including those of that rewatch discussion thread, you're fine.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Huh look at that there is actually a rewatch goint on just when I started to watch the series
>> ARTICLE
Damn this started? Wish i can join you guys, but I'll just lurk in the discussions. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow! One of my favorite animes ever rewatch! Gotta get in on this!

But really, Ippo is so good and the character building is excellent. It shows all the hard work, trials and growth of everyone, making each fight all the more hype, all the wins so satisfying and the losses so heartbreaking. It's just some gritty MC shouting and yelling and suddenly gains some bullshit powers. Ippo works for it! Everyone works and struggles for all their strength.

I wish they'd make new seasons, manga is so far ahead already.
>> ARTICLE
So I want to watch this, but Crunchy only has the 3rd season available. Do any other legit streaming sites have it? Or am I regrettably resigned to sailing the seven seas?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm a sailor, so I don't know much about streaming sites
>> ARTICLE
Here I come joining the re-watch of one of my most favourite anime of all times.

The music.. oh lord. Reminds me of the days of my training. Waking up early and going for a run listening to Rocky and Ippo soundtracks. 

Awesomeness awaits for those watching it for the first time. Enjoy guys!
>> ARTICLE
Ha ha wow I started this show about a week ago unknowing about this rewatch! I'm on ep 8 now. 1-5 were definitely slow but necessary for Ippo's training. 
>> ARTICLE
im going to do my ROADWORK 
>> ARTICLE
Only reached episode 3 so far, the third episode was pretty hype, so much action in there, looked really well animated.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher of Hajime no Ippo. It had never been on my PTW list, but I always see it talked about and put in a positive light, so I figured "eh, what the heck, I'll watch a few episodes". The highlight so far for me has definitely been the background music; it has a lot of variety and always feels in place. I don't usually like sports anime, but boxing isn't your typical sport. I definitely think I'm going to enjoy taking part in this rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
Jack Dempsey was a real boxer. The Dempsey Roll is already a real life boxing technique.
>> ARTICLE
I've never scene this anime or heard of Jack Dempsey, i thought this was coming from /r/marvelheroes because Luke cage has a skill called Dempsey roll were he just has super dodge and throws massive punches
>> ARTICLE
Jack Dempsey was known for his bob and weave style, but there is no such thing as a "Dempsey Roll".
>> ARTICLE
Not just that, but other boxers mentioned in the show too.

Mashiba's style ? Based on [this dude.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxgE_fMjP2w)


>> ARTICLE
Thomas Hearns!

>> ARTICLE
It's kind of funny and sad that if you search for "dempsey roll" in youtube, Hajime no Ippo clips are above real boxing videos.
>> ARTICLE
Search for Jack Dempsey instead.  Little guy like Ippo, crazy strong and fast.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually yet to find a real Dempsey Roll video thanks to that. 
>> ARTICLE
[Here's a video of him doing it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3BTycNuY44#t=194); not quite as dramatic as in the anime but if you watch the whole fight you can tell it completely broke his opponent in a matter of a couple seconds.  He crushed the heavyweight champion in a single round with 7 downs, but the champ held on for three more rounds until he was bloodied, ribs broken, teeth knocked out, skull fractured, etc.  Poor guy never got in a good punch the whole time.

Dempsey went on to go 10 years without being KO'd.
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow, Jack Dempsey is a beast.
>> ARTICLE
The Dempsey Roll is just the weaving, actually. When you weave into a punch like Ippo does, you're combining the Dempsey Roll with Floyd Patterson Gazelle Punching, which was a deadly combo.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for telling us. I was wondering for the longest time if it was just anime over-hype/mumbo jumbo or actually real.
>> ARTICLE
I think, looking it up, everything in the Anime is actually real. They're obviously stylized and given odd names some times, but they're real techniques. If I remember correctly the creator was an amateur boxer and turned his knowledge and love boxing into Hajime no Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
Sure that's true, but the author sometimes takes some liberties for the sake of story and whatnot. But I rarely trust anime to be true, but when I was watching hajime no ippo it was one of the ones that I thought could be plausible, except for the massive beating the characters take and the fighting while unconscious thing.
>> ARTICLE
Fighting unconscious is, again, a stylized thing. However, it happens in fights. There are plenty of times where a fighter gets absolutely rocked and is just going on instincts for a few seconds, I think the wording is a bit off but every fighter has had a moment where they've basically blacked out in a fight and gone by what they've trained in.
>> ARTICLE
i'm sure the look-away was revolutionary.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think Aoki is one of the dumbest characters in the show, so I won't argue with you there. Tis a shame he's also brought Kimura down with him.
>> ARTICLE
**Makunouchi wins!**
>> ARTICLE
Weaving/gaining momentum through it. So a bit more than just weaving.

But at it's core, yeah, just weaving.
>> ARTICLE
Well gaining momentum is the product/intent of the action rather than the action itself, so the guy had it right.
>> ARTICLE
A couple weeks ago (Episode 13) might just be my favorite Dempsey Roll in the series yet. 
>> ARTICLE
You mean the *anti-anti-anti-anti*-dempsey?
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, haha. Takamura's thoughts are generally hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
It's just that it is always the same. Ippo or someone has a match, Takamura, Aoki and Kimura are watching. The duo does not know exactly what happens in the ring. They usually get excited when Ippo lands a jab, then Takamura is like: "yeah, but Ippo is exhausted and his opponent is stronger" or "his opponent wanted Ippo to punch him and that's why he didn't avoid his punch". He has always perfect *hindsight* :D

>> ARTICLE
He does seem to understand what's going on in the ring though, and in other parts in the series (like the boxing advice he gives) he shows knowledge of things that are not obvious to many people, even boxers. This shows that while his body is beastly, he also fights very well in terms of skill and understands what he's doing.

Edit: what I mean to say is that he seems stupid in most cases, and he is, but when it comes to boxing he knows his shit and doesn't win through sheer brute force.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah, he is a professional boxer with [](/s "2 world") titles.
>> ARTICLE
Why do I read spoilers?   :(
>> ARTICLE
For the adventure!
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime by far.

 Hilarious and exciting to watch especially for the first 76 episodes + movies. I still remember chilling on #infusion IRC channel waiting for the newest release. Good times.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. It's the only anime I've seen more than twice and actually read every manga chapter (I think its 1000+ now). I love the humor Takamura and the others bring, along with Ippo. :)
>> ARTICLE
Takamura is the MAN!! I'm anime only and when he gets to the bear, I was dying. Such a great character, full of surprises.

Log Horizon often has some minions doing the roll in the intermissions.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I forgot about those. Those little fishmen are funny.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't this referring to EXILE's Choo Choo Train?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it definitely is. I think the only thing OP wanted to say is that it looks similar to the "Dempsey Roll." 
>> ARTICLE
What I meant is that if Ippo was real and did a Dempsey Roll then it would look something like this. (You know... the motion blur and stuff...)
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love Hajime no Ippo.  I just started watching it on a whim because I caught up to Kuroko's basketball.  I've watched the entire first two seasons (76+26) in about a week.  
>> ARTICLE
The best part is the hype connection between epic events and the music will now never go away.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you didn't forget to watch the 2 OVAs. 
Those are hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Hilarious? Kimura vs Mashiba was heartbreaking.
>> ARTICLE
It still had it's funny parts, but the (almost) result of that match was heartbreaking.  I don't know how I would have felt if it turned out the way he originally wanted.

Is this just the new thing out of Japan? I've been seeing it a lot lately.

It was made famous (I think) by a pop group called EXILE in Japan. They used to always do this, and comedians, anime, and everyone else copied them. Recently, even Log Horizon does it during their eyecatch.

Level-headed...? Are we watching the same show? She goes full-on chaos mode when the kid next to her plays a board game.

Still would be fun though, provided she doesn't get distracted when running away.

**Toaru Kagaku No Railgun**

I think I'm pretty safe with Misaka and her level 5 Esper power.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, this is probably one of the best ones you could get. Her electricity powers work WONDERS for everything, like lighting, cooking with it, turning on all electronics including cars, etc. She can sense people coming towards you with her electromagnetic radar type thing, and just wreck all the zombies with her powers. Hell, the show doesn't do a good job at portraying this, but the level 5 espers have the power to literally destroy entire armies, so the zombies would be of no real problem, nor would normal people.

The best part too, alongside all of her useful powers, she's a VERY loyal friend, to the point of consistently putting her life in grave danger to save friends, and others, along with being a really nice friend to talk to and keep you company when there aren't many humans around. So unlike some other powerful options, you never have to worry about Misaka backstabbing you unless you give her a reason to by backstabbing her. I mean someone like Hellsing would keep you safe from the zombies, but I would NOT feel safe at all with that guy around me, and he wouldn't really be the best person to talk to.

So in my opinon, Misaka is probably one of the best options out there.
>> ARTICLE
uh huh.. just don't try being witty or romantic around her cause her tsundere side will shock you good.

Now I want to watch that show.

Hikari from Nagi No Asukara...

Well, I'm finishing up Gurren Lagann so if that counts I'd say I have a slim chance of surviving unless giant mecha are available. It also depends on Kamina being around or not considering Simon needs inspiration to be of any use.

Just finished the first [Kara no Kyoukai] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei) movie, so I'd feel pretty safe with [Shiki] (http://myanimelist.net/character/3105/Shiki_Ryougi) covering my back. It would appear she has a power that shows her the most efficient way to kill things, and shes looks to be almost superhuman in combat. So I'd probably be okay in an apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
Heheheh... You have no idea how fitting this is. Your trust is justified. 

>> ARTICLE
Ha, me too; we're both saved. Keep watching them and you'll realize just how saved you'd be from zombies if you had Shiki with you; killing zombies would be almost like her specialty.

Just finished the second one. Colour me confused, I'm even more lost than I was after the first one.

The first 4 movies jumps around in the timeline. The actual order of movies chronologically is 2 4 3 1 5 6 7. There is also a time skip between 2 and 4 of several years which is probably why things seems so confusing between the first two movies.

>> ARTICLE
Yokoi Rumi... this is gonna be the *shortest* and most **ADORABLE** apocalypse ever.
>> ARTICLE
D-Frag... I'm so fucked. At best I could play the silly man while Kazuma shouts at my silly antics.
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail's Natsu.I'm safe as long as there's no vehicles involved.
>> ARTICLE
Konata Izumi from LuckyStar, maybe her knowledge of video games/manga may aid in my survival and she's pretty athletic when she wants to be.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter, I think I'll be perfectly fine with Gon around.
>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon. Hmm, I think i'll make it.

>> ARTICLE
Luckily my partner is both a zombie AND a magiclad girl
>> ARTICLE
Buddy Complex

Great, Watase Aoba. If he comes with the Valiancer, I'll survive. If there's a zombie that looks vaguely like Hina, I'm fucked. 
>> ARTICLE
Geez a bit earlier and I'd have Nice from Hamatora but now I'm stuck with Kanda Sorata from Sakurasou.

Well could've been worse I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I have Dark Flame Master (Yuta) with me. Fortunate... I guess?
>> ARTICLE
Joseph Joestar. I think I've won this round.
>> ARTICLE
Watched up to like episode 7 of Attack on Titan. Umm... I think I might make it...
>> ARTICLE
...Trapped in a city with several large, unclimbable walls. Outside the walls, giant pretty-much-zombies waiting to eat you. Very dense living conditions and a limited food supply with little arable land inside. 

But I'm sure you'll do great! 
>> ARTICLE
GJ-bu was my last watched, so I think I'd be pretty safe having Kirara around, maybe.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Ore man. 


>> ARTICLE
I have Aladdin, Alibaba or Morgiana from Magi so I think I'm pretty fortunate.
>> ARTICLE
[Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke) as long as we can determine their Form, Truth and Regret we should be alright.
>> ARTICLE
Outlaw Star...I think i'm gonna be just fine.
>> ARTICLE
Raku Ichijou, so I guess we'll be fine considering his entire Yakuza family will back him up.
>> ARTICLE
Strike the Blood, looks like I am going to be perfectly fine.
>> ARTICLE
Yo, Samurai flamenco back to back fighting. 
>> ARTICLE
YuYu Hakusho

Yusuke Urameshi will save me for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi Suzumiya!
I WIN! As long as she believes she can kill them that is.....
>> ARTICLE
I'm going by the last 3 shows I finished.

Berserk: I'll probably be fine.  
Kill la Kill: I'll definitely be fine.  
Sakura Trick: I'm fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Correction. With Berserk you are absolutely golden. Won't get much conversation, but you will never have to worry about zombies.

Just so long as it's just zombies. If demons start getting involved you're fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm good. Matoi to the rescue!
>> ARTICLE
Claus Valca from Last Exile. If it comes with a vanship, flying away from the zombie apocalypse will be easy. If it comes with the Silvana, we could carve out a safe zone quite easily. 
>> ARTICLE
Yadomi Jinta from Anohana. Maybe the both of us can survive this apocalypse with some feels
>> ARTICLE
The last anime I watched was Tonari no Seki-kun so I don't think my survival prospects are to high, I mean Seki-kun probably wouldn't pay any attention to the zombies and be playing around insted.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched Rebellion so Homura I guess? I'm pretty ok with this.

The last show I watched was Zeta Gundam, therefore Char Aznable. This seems almost unfair, his plot armour is impregnable.  

It seems I'm set for an intense apocalypse either way.
>> ARTICLE
Alibaba,morgiana and alladin. Seems like I would survive it :D
>> ARTICLE
Nono from Diebuster?
I think I'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Joseph Joestar. Fuck YES.
>> ARTICLE
ryuko. So I'm in good hands.

But if this was included manga... Well I just read Sankarea so this would be interesting since Chihiro would be in paradise and Rea... well she would be part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
Tonari no seki-kun

atleast i will be able to play some games before the zombies fuckin' eat me alive ( ._.)
>> ARTICLE
So I am stuck with Hikigaya Hachiman.  This apocalypse would at least be entertaining, albeit very short. 
>> ARTICLE
well, im with Hana Kana, so i think the zombies might be star struck for a while so ill have a few seconds to escape...
>> ARTICLE
Why would you even think of escaping and leaving KanaHana behind?? The morally correct choice in that situation would obviously be to sacrifice yourself for her.
>> ARTICLE
Monkey D Luffy. Emperor's Will to knock out all zombies in the vicinity. Then I take a knife or rock and decapitate every zombie I see that hasn't already been decapitated. Food will be a bitch though, but with Luffy's rubber body a zombie can never kill him by biting.
>> ARTICLE
Rumi Yokoi.

Yeah, I'm screwed.
>> ARTICLE
Tonari no Zombie-san.
>> ARTICLE
I have the gurren lagann. I think I'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
I got the Railgun, Misaka, on my side. I'll take it. 
>> ARTICLE
Ryuji from toradora... Scare the zombies away?
>> ARTICLE
Um... Who's supposed to be the main character of Baccano?  If it's Isaac or Miria, I'm pretty much fucked.
>> ARTICLE
I think you get the whole cast.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Wizard Barristers... So if I can keep myself from killing her or myself I should be okay.
>> ARTICLE
Ichijou, Raku

Meh, heir to the Yakuza, could have been way worse
>> ARTICLE
Oda Nobunaga, survival is INEVITABLE. 
>> ARTICLE
Just watched Rebellion, pretty fucking safe.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop.   
Spike should keep me alive for a while.    

Though technically the last animation i watched was Archer....DANGER ZONE!
>> ARTICLE
hime from yozakura quartet hana no uta..... i think i'm safe
>> ARTICLE
[Peace Maker Kurogane](http://myanimelist.net/anime/161/Peace_Maker_Kurogane)  

Which means that Tetsunosuke Ichimaru is my ally... I think that while not being the worst option (That'd 100% be either Shinji [Evangelion] or Yuki [Mirai Niki]) I probably still won't survive.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Mirai Nikki, I am not sure who I want less, Yuno or Yukki. Can I be Yuno's center of attention?
>> ARTICLE
Yuuko Aioi....shit.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if I lived in Space Dandy world...

I guess I would die, but then be back alive by next week.

...best of both worlds?
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy, so probably best possible scenario, since I can then cash out on life insurance, then go racing in a week or so.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Berserk

As long as none of the other stuff from that fucked up world transfers over, I am ridiculously lucky.  The only issue might be if Guts tries to take them all on at once.  I imagine there'd be far more than a few hundred.

>> ARTICLE
Ginko... well i'm not sure how useful he is when it comes to zombie apocalypses, but he could probably mess with some mushi in some way to hopefully fuck the zombies over
>> ARTICLE
Makunouchi Ippo

Dempsey Roll is damn good against zombies
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you mean by last watched.

If it's the last series I completed, it was **Kill La Kill**, in which case I think I'm pretty damn set for life.

If it's the last episode of anime I watched, it was an episode of **Love Lab**, in which case I can just pretend to be a life-like body pillow or something and I will be protected and loved with fury.
>> ARTICLE
Well i think i got it going for me with Simon from Gurren Langann if im able to ride the lower half
>> ARTICLE
Akari from Aria. So Fucked. 
>> ARTICLE
Nichibros... WELP atleast I will have some fun :D
>> ARTICLE
The last anime episode I finished this evening was from Pupa. Depending on how the MC is defined for the show, I get either a handy battle-brother, or a volatile team member who would be no better than the horde of the unliving.
>> ARTICLE
Ginko from Mushishi, he'd probably chalk it up to Mushi infecting bodies and save the world.
>> ARTICLE
I've been rewatching Jojo Part 1 and 2, so lucky for me the main characters are actually specialized in zombie slaying.
>> ARTICLE
Aladdin from Magi.

>> ARTICLE
I've got Ginko from Mushishi, I'm pretty much fine.
>> ARTICLE
Full metal alchemist, so I should be fine. Alchemy does seem useful in a zombie apocalypse.

>> ARTICLE
I got "Master-Strategist" Shiroe from Log Horizon...so I'm good.
>> ARTICLE
**Shiroe** from Log Horizon. Strategically surviving the zombie apocalypse? Magic for back up? I think I'm set.
>> ARTICLE
cool i get to survive with a mecha pilot who came from the past.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Samurai Champloo

aw ye
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners)... this means I get Shiki with me; I think it's safe to say that the zombies are totally screwed.
>> ARTICLE
uh... the little girl from tokyo magnitude 8.

guess we're both fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Yuno Gasai... Yup, fun, fun times ahead.

P.S: *Yes*, I am willing to stick my dick into crazy, figuratively and literally.

Nope, your MC is Yukki. Deal with it

Erufu will finish them all off before my coffee gets cold

Amaro from gundam 0079. Gundam aside he's pretty smart, I think I'd be solid. 
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YES ALUCARD 
>> ARTICLE
I'm stuck with Revy from Black Lagoon, I'll have no trouble at all. 
>> ARTICLE
Major Motoko Kusanagi.

I'm gonna make it, boys.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill heheh
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Flamenco wrecks the zombies in the name of justice
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Future Diary. I'm sure Yuno Gasai will keep me safe...and then maybe kill me
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to inform you that the MC is Yukki. Have fun with that.
>> ARTICLE
Psh, technicalities 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished marathoning Love Live, great, if all else fails we can choreograph a dance before we die.


OR maybe we will turn the zombies away through the power of music! yea! 
>> ARTICLE
Chocolat. Welp if it's a bunch of guy zombies looks like she'll just watch as they ~~ream my ass~~ eat me.
>> ARTICLE
Ryuko Matoi..I think I'll survive this one.
>> ARTICLE
Last thing I watched was Magi... Aladdin is gonna kick some zombie ass.

Last one I checked out was Super GALs.  I'm in trouble

[Joseph Joestar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3obnB7oThs)

Katanagatari

With Yasuri Shichika, should be easy enough.
>> ARTICLE
Polar Bear from Shirokuma Cafe. 

..at least the coffee will be good. 
>> ARTICLE
Momozono Nanami from Kami-sama Hajimemashita -- Yah!  I've got a god on my side!

Unless you consider Tomoe the main character, then it's just a overwhelmingly powerful fox demon...

>> ARTICLE
Uh, Tsunayoshi from Hitman Reborn... this could either go horribly or go very well.
>> ARTICLE
Matoi!! Thank GOD!! 
>> ARTICLE
Shiroe from Log Horizon. Could be a good thing, but everything he does is in the game. Therefore, all we have is good plan making if it's not in Elder Tales.
>> ARTICLE
Shiroe! not sure, but the villain in glasses will protect me... 
>> ARTICLE
Panty and Stocking Anarchy. I think I'll be OK, they've already proven they can almost single-handedly stop a zombie apocalypse with nothing but dildoes.
>> ARTICLE
Really hope I get Natsu rather than Lucy to help me out..
>> ARTICLE
[Take the X Train](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1973/X_Densha_de_Ikou) : Not only would I be running from zombies, but I'd be running from a ghost train?  
  
[FLAG](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1299/Flag) : Some girl would be taking pictures of me being chased by zombies instead of helping.  
Someone's writing down your mistakes  
Someone's documenting your downfall  
-KMFDM "Dogma"
>> ARTICLE
Ryuko Matoi... I have a feeling I'll be just fine.
>> ARTICLE
The last anime I watched was Squid Girl, but before that was Kite.  

I fucked up.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko. dicks. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, unless the zombie want to challenge us to a rousing game of Cardfight!! Vanguard,...
>> ARTICLE
I believe Mahjong skills won't save my ass, and even worse (for me), she is probably lesbian.
>> ARTICLE
Matoi ryuko... I'm OK with this...
>> ARTICLE
Hazama Masayoshi from Samurai Flamenco...I'm either really screwed or the zombies are really screwed.
>> ARTICLE
Rock Lee, from "Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals", so I'm screwed unless the zombies fear bad punchlines or somehow I can convince Lee to be serious.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, last anime I watched was Puchimas 2 so I'm either set for life if I'm with the chibi idols or lunch if I'm with Producer-san.
>> ARTICLE
Eh. I think Nobunagun can take a few zombies.

I just have to blast enough death metal in the background.
>> ARTICLE
Last one I finished was a rewatch of **Full Metal Panic**. I don't think survival will be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Well Kate from Sekai Sefuku could be good, I guess. If she brings her crew at least.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop. Sensei Spike, teach me please.
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujin, could be worse =/ He could talk to all the Youkai inhabitants for advice and stuff. Not a complete idiot, not forced to use a hover-round due to immense weight
>> ARTICLE
Ichijo Raku or Kirisaki Chitoge.
Assuming I have their families to back me up, I should be relatively safe.
>> ARTICLE
Mirrai Nikki, it depends. Yuno? FUCK YEAH! Yukki, eh maybe a week?
>> ARTICLE
Nano from Nichijou. At least ill be able to eat a sweet roll before i die.
>> ARTICLE
I'm fucking set yukiteru from mirai nikki turned into a god
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter
>> ARTICLE
Does corpse party even count as having an MC? Either way I doubt any of them would be any good.
>> ARTICLE
Eureka Seven, I think I will be good for a while :)
>> ARTICLE
I just watched kill la kill, I'm in good hands.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Mirai Nikki.

If i get Yuno awesome.
If I get Yuki....

Less awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Dandy - Space Dandy.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou. I think I'd bring the Principal with me so he could suplex all the zombies.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Watamote earlier today... I honestly don't know what Tomoko would do in a zombie apocalypse. Either she'd be completely unable to speak to this random American kid she's stuck with, or her rage against society would finally be released and she'd kill everything. Maybe a little of both.
>> ARTICLE
Alucard from Hellsing Ultimate...He is probably the one who caused the zombie Apocalypse in the first place so I am pretty boned.
>> ARTICLE
Matoi Ryuuko...... fuck yeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
>> ARTICLE
Psycho-pass for me. As long as we can have dominators I think things will go quite well. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero. 

Saber Artura? Gilgamesh? It's so hard to choose!
>> ARTICLE
I get soul eater should be fun.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part III: Rebellion and it looks like the main character here is Homura. Maybe I'm lucky 'coz she have lots of weapons at her disposal and she became the devil.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi's Ginko...I don't know if I'd survive, but you can bet he'll find and fix the cause of the apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
Chihaya Ayase? Well at least she's quick.... 
>> ARTICLE
Black butler... I think I'm good :)
>> ARTICLE
Karl la Hire from The Pilot's Love Song.

Well, maybe if there's an airplane somewhere he'll know how to fly it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck yes, I get Lelouch Vi Britannia! Christ I'm lucky!
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. I'm really fucking scared yo.

Edit: Last finished anime would be Madoka Magica. So is pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Rewatching Attack on Titan. I'm good.
>> ARTICLE
I am screwed. Just watched the first episode of the new Puchimas show.
>> ARTICLE
Maou Sadou..Looks like i win.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you just finished a harem anime then you're definitely fucked.
>> ARTICLE
I think i I'll do just fine with Kenshi Masaki from Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari watching my back.
>> ARTICLE
Sakata Gintoki.
Doesn't look too good for me since he let everyone die in a zombie invasion once, but at least I can laugh before I die.
>> ARTICLE
I got Magi: Kingdom of magic, I guess i'm alright as Magi or Titus!
>> ARTICLE
Nobunaga the Fool. Brings into question who'd win in a fight between a horde of zombies and a giant mech...
>> ARTICLE
Alibaba Saluja. (Or rather Aladdin?)

Eh... do zombies burn well?
>> ARTICLE
Yup Kuroko i'm very screwed 
>> ARTICLE
Hime from Yozakura Quartet Hana no Uta, I think I should be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Sakura Trick

Do I get Yuu or Haruka? Both?

Either way we are screwed and they won't even be interested in me!
>> ARTICLE
Shu Ouma, so I guess survivable all depends on the badass level of my void.
>> ARTICLE
Belldandy or Keiichi; I'm pretty fortunate. Either a First Class Goddess or a kind, pretty resourceful dude.
>> ARTICLE
Alladin. I'm safe
>> ARTICLE
I got Soul Eater. Soooooo I should be ok... I think.
>> ARTICLE
Mikakunin...I might be in good hands seeing as Benio will destroy anything that touches Mashiro or Kobeni. On the other hand if there is a loli zombie I might be screwed.
>> ARTICLE
Gon Freecs - Just my luck! Gon has amazing senses, fitness and raw strength. I think he'd do everything in his power to protect me and the remaining humans :3 he's just that kind of guy.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching Robot Girls Z. Z-chan's rocket punch and other various mecha girl weapons should keep us safe.
>> ARTICLE
I have recently watched Medaka Box, so I would be there with Medaka... I am ok with this.
>> ARTICLE
I'm perfectly fine just rewatched FMA Brotherhood i just let ed do some alchemy i be fine
>> ARTICLE
"Assistant! you are a zombie aren't you? Try communicating with them."
>> ARTICLE
If the zombies are males, I should be fine, and since the zombies aren't cute, I should be fine. 

I could use Takanashi as my shield since his tough as nails and Inami as my fists since she's a fckin juggernaut. I think I should be set.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished rewatching Angelic Layer.

I'm pretty screwed.
>> ARTICLE
Worst/Best time to watch Love Live. I'd die pretty quickly but at least I'd die with cute girls.

Guts, from Berserk.

Well if I was able to play the zombies in a Card Fight Vanguard game I'd be good to go but unfortunately they don't play games so I'm pretty screwed. If only Kai had any powers... T-T doesn't even have powers like Aichi...

Kenichi Shirahama. So I guess he could punch one zombie in the face while I ran away and his whole "durable fighter" aspect gets him killed.
>> ARTICLE
The main character Kyu from Tantei Gakuen Q. I will at least find out who died from eating a rotten apple...
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki, I guess me and Yuno can manage.

Yu Narukami from Persona 4 the animation

Well if I have access to the tv world im pretty safe but on the outside we are gonna be pretty fucked....unless someone finds an evoker from persona 3

Ryuko Matoi. I'm probably gonna be fine
>> ARTICLE
Same here
>> ARTICLE
Amakusa Shino. At least I'll die listening to sex jokes.
>> ARTICLE
Well if OVA's count, then I got Biribiri from Toaru Railgun, I'd get a waifu and a nearly unlimited supply of electricity. If not, then I got Watase Aoba from Buddy Complex. Either of which would be great, assuming Aoba comes with his mecha. 
>> ARTICLE
What if it's a show I'm currently watching and I have no idea how useful the main character will end up being?

Toaru Majutsu no Index (15 episodes in): Does zombie count as a mind based power that can be cancelled with Imagine Breaker? If not, I'm fucked.

Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple (21 episodes in): He could kick some zombie ass even if they are huge, but he'd probably shit his pants and run first. I'm fucked.

In the words of Ippo YATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  
  
Hajime no Ippo is my favourite series. After finishing New Challenger and going through all 900 chapters of the manga in a week I am pumped for this! I must have watched the anime at least 10 times over now.  
  
I wonder if it's still going to be done by MADHOUSE.
  
Also, my reaction: http://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mourinho-celebrates-again.gif  
  
I also wonder who will voice the Coach as Kenji Utsumi has passed away.
>> ARTICLE
> Kenji Utsumi

Words cannot describe how sad this just made me. Everyone was so perfectly casted, I even hated the new Kumi voice of New Challenger. D:

>> ARTICLE
900? 900!?!??!!? Are you sure you read them all because there are over 1000.......... OVER 1000!!!!! And I have read it 2-3 times already.

At the time of finishing New Challenger there was only 900. I read those in a week or so and then began following it weekly.

This is my exact reaction as well :)
>> ARTICLE
Not only do I get to watch Kuroko no Basuke S2, but now I get to watch Hajime no Ippo! Fall 2013 is going to be the best!
>> ARTICLE
Adding Kill la Kill and Magi S2. I don't know about Pupa but it seems interesting to me. This season went from awesome to godlike.

>> ARTICLE
Magi has barely any hype for how good it is. The changes to the finale of S1 from the manga are a little weird, but I guess I see why they did them (and the end results are the same). Pretty much the most interesting and varied shounen since FMA ended.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget valverape!
>> ARTICLE
That blonde dude is David Eagle, right? In that case I can't fucking wait for Takamura's fight
>> ARTICLE
Blude dude is def David Eagle, one of my fav fights in the manga. Been waiting 4 years for this!
>> ARTICLE
FUCK, IM UP TOP UPDATED ON THE MANGA BUT I STILL WANNA FUCKING SEE THIS SO FUCKING HARD, FUCK YEAH GO IPPO-KUN!!!!
>> ARTICLE
After I read the fight against the 'Wolf' and the 2nd fight against Rocky I knew I had to watch it in action.  And the artists and directors freaken DELIVERED.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm pumped to see Sawamura, but so sad to see will have to watch the Imae fight.

I hope this goes more than just one season, such a damn good show.
>> ARTICLE
Great news, it's just going to be weird hearing coach kamogawa with a new voice...
>> ARTICLE
I hated Kumi's new voice acter in New Challenger, I really hope they make a better choice for Coach Kamogawa.
>> ARTICLE
That is going to take some getting used to :(  

I miss coach's raspy manly voice.  
>> ARTICLE
wh- what?!? I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.


FUCK NOT COACH KAMOGAWA'S VOICE, IT WAS AWESOME AND HILARIOUS!!!


The way he said "bakayarou" will always echo in my dreams.
>> ARTICLE
YESSSSSSSSS!!! Has to be one of my favorite shows and maybe it'll get people to watch it again. So many people have never seen it and it's so damn good
>> ARTICLE
To watch the third season would require clearing the 101 episodes of the first two seasons...that's a pretty large time investment don't you think?
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched season 1 and 2 in about a week just a few days ago.  It's really addicting, I start off by just watching my favorite scenes (ex: the birth of the Dempsey Roll) and end up just watching the whole series again.
>> ARTICLE
Worth it
>> ARTICLE
But it's not one of those shows where you have to just get through the crap to get to the good stuff, those episodes are all good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's great that the show has pretty much no filler at all. Every episode was just as exciting as the last.
>> ARTICLE
For sure.  I'd say even the vacation ones have meaning to them and add to the character development. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Takamura vs the bear was just as epic as everything else.
>> ARTICLE
And it really worked with the whole Eagle vs Bear fight.  Having a bear slash scar on your chest just increases manliness a million fold. 
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. Not much manlier than massive scars.
>> ARTICLE
From a deadly animal, that you killed, with your bare hands, and ate afterwards.  

But I shed a tear when I found out it was a mom ;_;
>> ARTICLE
> But I shed a tear when I found out it was a mom ;_;

Yeah I'm glad Takamura spared it. I then laughed hard when I found out the Nekota killed it. Poor Takamura eating with eyes full of tears.
>> ARTICLE
So very true.
>> ARTICLE
does this continue on from champion road? only watched anime up to this, unsure whether theres been more since
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo First Season > Champion Road Movie > New Challenger (2nd season) > Now this.
>> ARTICLE
Kimura VS Mashiba goes in between Championship Road and New Challenger, and is well worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
This might help understand where you are at in the anime and manga:

- The First Series - Episodes 1 - 76 - Ends around round volume 30.

- Movie - Championship Road - Ippo vs Sanada - Takes place in manga volumes 33 to 35

- Movie Ova - Kimura vs Mashiba - Takes place in manga volumes 31 to 33.

- The 2nd Series, New Challenger - Episodes 1 - 26 - Takes place from volume 36 to volume 46, or early 47 (like Round 416), anime ignored the Kamogawa flashback arc with Anderson.

So that gives you an idea, on where you are in relation with everything.  The next season will probably start at volume 47 with Ippo vs Shimabukuro fight, and chances are it end at volume 60 with Takamura's fight.       

As for how much manga is still left to be animated, the current chapter in raw form is Round 1024.  (Scanlated wise is like 1016.)
>> ARTICLE
This...is a complete shock.  Considering the group that did Hajime no Ippo was supposedly dissolved and all the rumors about the author.  But I am totally happy!  Hajime no Ippo is one of my top 3 anime series and I always want more!
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YOU FAKE-FAN-SAN HAJIME NO IPPO NUMBRO 1 IN MY BOOK

The second I read this title, "Inner Light" (the theme to the 2nd Season of the original series) started playing in my head!

MOTHERFUCKING DEMPSEY ROLL!!!

FINALLY!

>> ARTICLE
Oh god it's been 4 years since the last season?! Can't wait! 
>> ARTICLE
THE JOY IN MY HEART! OMFG YES!
>> ARTICLE
GET IN!
>> ARTICLE
I've always wanted to watch Ippo but I kept putting it off because it's so long. This gives me the perfect motivation to start it. 
>> ARTICLE
You should totally watch it.  Its freaken motivational, inspiring, hilarious, and heart warming all at the same time.   
>> ARTICLE
No way. Was not expecting this. I loved the first two seasons so much. Autumn is looking better and better.
>> ARTICLE
Now to hope someone picks this up stateside again...

I actually lucked into picking up all of the original Geneon release for $80 at Suncoast when it was still around...

EDIT: Geneon was breaking up, so Suncoast had a 2-for-1 sale for all of their releases.  The entire series was collected in two volumes for $80 a piece, so I got the whole series!
>> ARTICLE
I just let a very girly sound. *No shame*

Conveniently listening to the ost at the moment too. 

I just finished the first series the other day and watched the movie/tv special yesterday. Today I'll probably watch the ova then start on New Challenger. Can't wait for this. Gonna be so awesome.

I was surprised though went I saw the first anime came out in 2000. It looks so much older than that to me especially since the manga stared in 89.
>> ARTICLE
The OST is so sick man! It was on my gym playlist for a while. I prefer the original OST but the New Challenger has some good ones.
  
These have to be my favourite from it!

Haha I remember seeing your comments on some of the videos. Cool to see that your an Ippo Fan Pyrao. The ost is awesome. Right up there with the songs from the Rocky movies for me. This stuff as always get me pumped up.

I really liked the new intro for New Challenger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baFzdQiv6Gs

>> ARTICLE
Itta-GAKKI-massu!

Although I'm a bit concerned --- after this season, and eighty more seasons, it'll be just a hundred more seasons until it catches up to the manga and they need to do fillers.

And it will probably happen right in the middle of a key arc where Ippo is training to fight Ricardo Martinez's chauffeur.
>> ARTICLE
such a great  news! one of my all time favorites!
hope they do as least 50 episodes this time. i need more Takamura in my life! :))

OMG, yes! This is one of the best announcements for Fall season! After New Challenger ended and so many years passing by I was starting to think Ippo season 3 was never going to happen. But now my fears are put to rest! Thank you, based anime gods.
>> ARTICLE
One word.

"Sawamura"

How come there is no hype for one of the greatest and toughest fights(for Ippo) in the series?  It is still to this day the first glimpse of Dempsey Roll 2.0 we have seen.  Sawamura is a devil monster, real evil.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I like the dempsey roll 2.0, I prefer Coach's Depsey Roll Evo he made Ippo use in the fight against Jimmy.
>> ARTICLE
OH mang. This fall is gonna be epic for anime fans. 

I still get chills when Ippo asks his coach, "What does it mean to be strong?" and coach tell him to go out and face Date to get his answer. 
>> ARTICLE
the only thing that was a let down in the challenger was the music during fights, i really hope they use the old ones or make new great tunes.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCK, AS SOMEONE WHO DID NOT SEE THIS COMING AND HAS BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS, YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. 

On a side note I hope they keep the thick muscly art direction instead of the skinny stuff the manga has turned into recently.
>> ARTICLE
oh sweet 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yeah!
>> ARTICLE
YEEEESS...
>> ARTICLE
I'm really excited but does anyone else agree that the Shimabukuro fight is the worst one in the series? It just drags on forever with nothing interesting happening. Maybe they can improve the pacing in the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, Gedo the Magician has to be the worst fight for me. Just... ugh. Awful boring gimmicks. 

Then again, he fought nothing *but* gimmick fighters for years in a row, until the Woli fight. Thankfully the manga's back on track now (and full speed ahead!), but that stretch was a real bore.
>> ARTICLE
NO FUCKING WAY!!!!! I've rewatched S1 and S2 probably about 10 times and I still get chills at the last episode of New Challenger.  Please let this be as long as season 1.  This is the best news I've heard in a long time.

AWESOMELY MAYBE??!??!

Hajime no Ippo is one of my favourite anime/manga series, so when I saw these on eBay a few weeks ago I had to snap them up. They are animation cells that were sold off by MADHOUSE after the release of the original series of Hajime no Ippo 13 years ago. They are quite rare nowadays with the anime being as old as it is. I had a few more that were not in the picture with Sendo and other characters. As far as I am aware there is still a few on eBay (one guy decided to sell his entire lot and he had loads of them) so if you're interesting in getting some go check it out!

Any news of a new season yet?

Wowzas, thanks for the heads up! Darnit though, there's no Miyata cels. I guess Volg's pretty cool too though.

And if you're really the seller, I approve of this guerrilla marketing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so jealous!!! i LOVE Hajime No Ippo one of the best series ever and hope they make more seasons of it!

AWESOME.  It's easily one of my favorite series as well.  I am definitely going to take a look at those cells for myself!
>> ARTICLE
Still hoping for a third series but I don't think it is coming anytime soon with the state of MADHOUSE financially. Sad, as I thought Ippo was one of MADHOUSE's better works. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait, what? Is MADHOUSE in financial trouble? When did that happen?
>> ARTICLE
They had to cancel production work temporarily on Satoshi Kon's last work "The Dreaming Machine" last year. Check this: http://jfilmpowwow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/madhouse-shuts-down-production-on.html
>> ARTICLE
It's such an excellent series. I was a bit skeptical about it when a friend who recommended it to me said it was about boxing. After watching I think it's more accurate to say it's about boxers. I fell in love with all the characters.
>> ARTICLE
They really are the best part of the series. The fact that you have perhaps five episodes inbetween fights, most of which spend some time developing the character, and they all get some helps keep things moving.

Takamura really is the best part about the series though.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I just really needed to own one. I love the series.
>> ARTICLE
I was a bit sad the day the anime industry went from traditional hand painted cels to a digital format.  I've collected quite a few from my favorite shows (DNA^2, Bastard, The Vision of Escaflowne, Bubblegum Crash and Tenchi Muyo are my favorite ones)

I also got a couple Dragon Ball Z cels,  One from the 2nd movie and another of Videl from the tournament right at the beginning of the majin buu arc.

Nowadays you get those lithograph mass reproduction cels that companies use for merchandizing, they're not the same since the ones we got are one of a kind.
>> ARTICLE
dude i freakin LOVE bubblegum crash! im so jealous of you right now.

Thanks, I also managed to get quite a few signatures from people who worked on it, including Kenichi Sonoda's.

Hajime no Ippo may be the GOAT
>> ARTICLE
checking reddit on my phone while watching Hajime no Ippo. Perfect timing. Love this show, recommended by a friend, 15 rounds in so far and i'm hooked!
>> ARTICLE
I found a little store in Nakano's Broadway Arcade in Tokyo that had a wall of shelves full of binders full of cells of different shows. There were at least three full of Ippo. Weren't expensive at all, depending on the scene, about 5-30 a piece.

They also sold mystery envelopes for about 10 that had an assortmend of random cells.
>> ARTICLE
Would anyone happen to know if they're gonna make any more of this series? 
I remember watching every episode early last year and I gotta say I was very addicted to this show. I loved every bit of it and I hope there would be more to come.
>> ARTICLE
The voice actor of Takamura said that after the 2nd series they were working on a 3rd. This was back in 2009. Since then, no word. It was also reported later than year at a convention that the director of the first series was working on an OVA for the series but yet again, no word since then. It sucks, one of the best sports anime imo!
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for 3rd :(
>> ARTICLE
I consider myself blessed and insanely lucky when I checked out Suncoast's (remember them?) Going Out Of Business Sale and picked up **the entire series for $80.**

That's the entire series plus the movie where Ippo fights that doctor-boxer.

Bad.  ASS.  

And, I think not only do they have the original Japanese and English dubs, but a Spanish dub too!

I wish the 2^nd series would get picked up in the US...

Now if only season 3 would arrive...
>> ARTICLE
So either, everyone secretly loves Hajime no ippo and hides it for some reason or, the 30 something people on this thread are the only ones that love hajime no ippo on /r/anime, cuase it's fucking rare to see a comment about it and much more a thread. :I

And I'd have been awesome if you had gotten one of Takamura's epic trolls faces.
>> ARTICLE
why would you want that?
>> ARTICLE
Two giant dick jokes in one episode, really Takamura? I think you need some training from the pun-master...

But on to the main thing of episode 11: Damn, that was a fast match. And as someone that has seen the rest of the series it also was surprisingly clumsy. I did not notice it on my first watch but after I have seen how good Ippo will once be he really looked like a rookie in this one.  
Which is a damn fine job on the part of the writer and animators.

Ippo's second fight as a pro is over even faster than the first one  but that's not what this episode was about. It was about Umezawa and the start of one of the most amazing character developments I have ever seen a side character go through.  
Also Ippo finally has someone that calls him "friend"  or at least "pal". The fan-girling delinquents were just amazing.

The first match of the rookie championship! And it's against someone really strong... But as always Ippo trains dutifully and with barely any rest. Even outside of the gym he continues on.  
And if I'm not mistaken this should be the first move towards him developing his signiture move. But it will be quite some time until we see that one in action.

Finally we get the first fight that's longer than an episode.  
Compared to his first fight as a pro you can clearly see how much better Ippo has gotten  but Ozuma is still above him. The coach goes to the only tactic he sees fit: Punch it out and win with your guts and fighting spirit.  
And Ippo won  by piling up the damage and because of his crazy intense training. He was prepared especially for Ozuma's hooks and this made the difference in the end.

But for us as the viewers it's a bitter sweet victory because we know what Ozuma was fighting for... Still, I'm happy for Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching, but it's such a good show. I'm at ep 17, and I'm already in love with it. I like how they give back stories to ippos opponents, it almost makes you feel bad when he beats them. 
>> ARTICLE
such a good show! definately in top 20 all time! currently at episode 58 :P
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really up for a rewatch but oh man, Hajime no Ippo is one the most inspiring series I've seen with the fact that it's really well written. Even in the manga, 1100+ chapters and it still hasn't got boring. Definitely one of the greatest shows you can watch! The manga is great too, still hoping for another season, Madhouse pls

No he moves to America at the beginning of Battle Tendency. He's British.

[From the 1st chapter of Battle Tendency](http://img.bato.to/comics/2015/04/26/j/read553ca12f3c645/img000004.png): Look at the top right panel on the left page.

But on that same wiki Joseph's nationality is [listed as English-American](http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Joseph_Joestar) which directly links to a Wikipedia article describing Americas of full or partial English decent.  
In the opening you can see the [stars and stripes](https://youtu.be/ox5wWOgYTzs?t=5m32s) of the American Flag behind JoJo.  
I think you are entirely right that he lived in England for a number of years so I would say he is partially British. However the fact that he lives in America for more of the series then he doesn't (aka he lives in America the whole series after moving in during part two) means he has American Citizenship and is American.

Bonus that he hates Japan.

Having read the books, I'd like say it took place largely within 50 miles of the North coast of Europe sometime during or nearing the existence of the Hanseatic league, before total eradication of paganism in the continent with place names switched around for fantasy.

Wait a second, wouldn't all One Piece characters be non-Japanese, because it is not set in our world?

The only reference to nationality I can think of is Oda answering a question in the SBS section of the manga, where he was asked what the nationalities of the Strawhats would be. [Here is an article on the topic.](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/10/01/one-piece-characters-nationalities-revealed-but-fans-have-mixed-opinions/)

For example, Luffy is Brazilian, Sanji is French, Robin is Russian, Nami is Swedish and Zoro is... Japanese.

I am confused. 

[](#takeowut)

*Edit: Had to phrase my confusion better.*
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I figured since the setting of One Piece is complete fantasy they wouldn't have nationalities relatable to our world.

Well if Zoro doesn't count next up would be Morgiana.
>> ARTICLE
Those answers were simply a hypothetical of "If OP character were in the real world".

Clearly Japan doesnt exist in the world of OP, so no one can be Japanese nationality.

For one piece, people tend to represent what Sea they were born in. So Canon wise his ethnicity would be East Blue.

Although when it comes to Nationality specifically it pretty murky. There isnt many actual Nations in OP world. Can you even have nations when everyone is ruled by a World Government ?
>> ARTICLE
Sure you can, people still formed cultures in their respective areas over thousands of years.  It's just the last 800 that the World Government has been in place.  And we still see relative autonomy of nations.  Alabasta, Drum Island, and Dressrosa all had monarchs.  It's kind of like an advanced form of the EU.
>> ARTICLE
Of course that going on assumption that there is that kind of classification system in OP World in the first place. But you are right, the nations that do exist are autonomous and have the control to set their own classification. Although culture in itself has zero to do with nationality. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say zero.  A nationality (maybe ethnicity would be a better term) is a (usually) large group of people sharing ancestry due to some type separation from other ethnicities.  Because these people tend to live together they form cultures distinct from the ethnicities around them.  When mixing of ethnicities occurs cultures mix as well, but culture can also flow between ethnicities without genes mixing.
>> ARTICLE
Ethnicity and Nationally are very different things though :x They cant be used interchangeably. I would agree that OP is rich with ethnicity. There may be some form of Nationality but it really never went into. OP not much for politics.

Keep in mind concept of Ethnicity can change and combine even without procreation. Often Ethnicity doesnt even have anything to do with bloodline although most of the time thats what people tend to choose to identify with.

I would think that Death Parade and Steins;Gate are considered heavy-weights in the fields of feels, fellow internet stranger, or at least to me they are

I agree! They were unexpected but extreme feels.

For me it's [FMA:B](/s "When Ed goes to the gate once again, and he sees there's another gate behind him, and then sees that Alphonse's body is in fact there, but before being able to do anything remotely coherent, the door takes him back as he struggles against the black hands, and it closes... then suddenly BOOM the door bursts open again from Ed's push and Ed looks at Al's body and tells him to wait for him, that he'll come back for him, and then lets himself be shoved back into the door as he looks decidedly at Alphonse and the ending music starts playing.")

it's legit man. I used to have some very bad depression but I had recovered, a long time later I watched hunter x hunter and the end of the chimera ant arc nearly killed me. I became so depressed that I couldn't finish the rest of the series, more depressed than ever before and had to rewatch nichijou in order to balance out the sadness which in some ways made me more depressed because the characters in nichijou had it so much better than the people in the end of the chimera ant arc. It's been over a year since then and I still can't push myself to watch the rest of hunter x hunter because of how sad of an ending that arc had for just about everyone.

To be honest I think most anime aim to prompt strong emotion, often at times sadness, it's just that we particularly associate that with highly personal anime about some things, often sad romantic things, happening to individual characters with dramatic inner lives.

Anyone who has seen Legend of the Galactic Heroes will know which part I'm talking about if I say that the [toast to democracy](http://i.imgur.com/RcE6c0g.jpg) broke me. Or, similarly, [this](http://imgur.com/a/YKjDr) after the [Zambot 3 ending spoiler](/s "heroically sacrificial death of most of the cast") in Zambot 3 was pretty crushing. I could go on with similar examples.

In general I think I respond emotionally more to stories with an external focus more of a group aspect than the kind of dramatic stuff in your Clannads, Anohanas &c.

Oh, don't get me wrong, I love Nagato as a character, I just don't like the whole moe-blob theme in her spin-off. Not my kind if show.

I think it has to do with the disappearance movie. The story gave insight to her that we hadn't seen in the series. It was kind of a shock to the system because we were so used to seeing her as this staunch, unemotional character. The movie made us realize that she had wants  and needs just like anyone else, but was unable to show them because her job was to not let emotion dictate her actions.

you might want to mark this as possible spoilers..

It's not considered canon most likely.    
   
The death parade one is a easter egg

ok so I guess it's fine. As someone who hasn't watched death parade yet it sounded like a spoiler.

It's a easter egg more then anything by the animating studio.    
Also go watch some death parade. Easily one of the best shows of this season.

for sure I will! Just waiting for it to finish so I can marathon it.

my body is ready. Since most of the anime I followed this season is about to end aswell I have enough space for Death Parade. Also this season was kind of a letdown so my relatively low expectations should make the experience even better.

I want to see AoT but Eren died in the start and Mikasa just goes batshit insane and Armin trains to be the badass in the anime.

So you see Eren living the best part? Because otherwise, it hardly makes sense in this thread.
>> ARTICLE
I know that they're meant to be pretty shitty, but what if there was a whole series dedicated to the Military Police? That guy from the second last episode was pretty cool. Just imagine them chasing after thieves and bandits, with badass rifles and 3D maneuver/just badass climbing and running parkour, and then all of a sudden BOOM TITAN and none of them are trained. That'd be such a badass anime. 

edit: used the word "badass" three different times, sorry for the terrible proofreading

That sounds pretty darn awesome!

This so much.

[Spoiler](/s "Even though I'm pretty sure everyone knew Eren wasn't really dead after ep 5 that would have been such a cool twist. The classic avenger MC just gets eaten by the first titan he fights, they could even do the Marco/Jean thing with him just with Mikasa and Armin.")

That's how it should've been and not [](/s "meat mechs")

I totally agree. I was really caught off guard and applauded but it felt cheap as fuck the next episode.

Definitely.

That show had so much potential, they could have gone anyone of a dozen better plots but they chose [](/s "meat mechs and a hundred Mustang 33s").

Elfen Lied. It doesn't go all cutesy-poo. It just keeps getting darker and darker. A lot more heads explode. The protagonist also keeps getting more and more naked (if that's even possible).

It's best aspect is being cutesy? I definitely thought it was the darkness / shock factor. In which case Lucy is just a foreign exchange student who gets concussed and the entire show is just a love triangle with ridiculous ecchi and incestuous elements.

I swear to god that I'm the only one I've ever seen on reddit that think Asia is best girl. Akeno would still probably get their first though  ;)
>> ARTICLE
Serious question... is someone else here who always roots for the main girl regardless of their character development, just because they are the girls who give the name to the anime or are always around the MC or ye being just the main love interest... Not saying i don't like the other girls but i somehow always find myself rooting for the 'main' girl... DxD would be Rias because she is his main 'target' or Nisekoi would still be Chitoge above Onodera because she is the one who is closest to Raku.. :/
>> ARTICLE
I don't always root for best girl, but I'm a passenger of the S.S. Chitoge, so I don't know if I qualify as what you've said. But I don't root for her because she's main. It's just everything that makes her best girl (and she still has a better Engrish than Five). Weirdly enough, every single harem/love triangle anime, I usually root for the tsundere on the first watch, then more for the other girls on the second.

>> ARTICLE
Rurouni Kenshin, but Kenshin already threw away his sword and ditched Kaoru during the fake Battousai incident, likely dooming her to a violent death...god damn. 
>> ARTICLE
This would have way more repercussions than just Kaoru dying. This could potentially put the stability of almost the entire world at stake.

If Makoto wasn't stopped by Kenshin, then the Purgatory would've made its way to Tokyo unopposed, and would've sparked a rebellion against the Imperialists. With Makoto being a tactical genius and a charismatic leader, he probably would've won too.

So ultimately, Japan would become a military state ruled by a sociopathic zealot who while an extreme traditionalist, still isn't bound by the arbitrary shackles of honor and isn't below adopting new technology to further his cause.

Japan would then very likely become the forefront in weapons technology since America would still be in the middle of reconstruction after the Civil War, and would likely run unopposed since anyone who tried to lead an attack on Japan would be absolutely decimated.

By the time the 1900s roll around, Japan would've likely conquered or at least been in the process of conquering Korea and the Philippine Islands. However, I doubt they would make an attempt to conquer China so long as Shishio was still in power.

By the time WWII comes around, Japan's military would be among the strongest in the world, and their navy would be unmatched. This would've likely made the battle of Midway a Japanese victory, meaning that American forces would've been routed back and become unable to reach the Japanese mainland.

Though the Allied Forces would still "win" WWII with the defeat of Germany, Japan would still remain unopposed because nobody in their right mind would want to go to war with them. Even if they defeated Japan, the loses wouldn't account for justification to instigate a war with them.

After that, well... They likely would've ended up siding with America during the Cold War because Communism would've gone against Japan's ideas of extreme militarism. Also their general hatred towards China would've been a major factor as well.

This would likely ended with the very militant Japan tossing a nuke at China, with no idea how terrible the repercussions would be because America would've never gotten close enough to drop the atomic bomb on them in WWII.

Then the entire world would go into nuclear war.

TL;DR: Kenshin prevented WWIII

I'm assuming "back from the dead" means "re-aired". In that case,  Girls und Luftwaffe is no longer about cute girls doing tank things,  but is now considerably darker because inexperienced cute girls doing airplane things, especially on an aircraft carrier, can lead to the last thing though many girls' minds bring the tail assembly. Same general structure as the original show, except this time around the vehicles of choice are the various aircraft of WWII. The fights aren't all fun and games anymore - the cockpits may be designed to keep anyone from getting shot, but survival is not necessarily guaranteed if someone gets a wing shot off. Not to mention that a crash is almost guaranteed to kill a pilot.

I hope so, it's one of my favorite animes. 

Wikipedia says:

"Rikiya Koyama, the voice actor of the Mamoru Takamura character in the Hajime no Ippo boxing anime franchise, has revealed in his blog that a sequel to the Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger television series is being planned. Koyama was posting about the end of dialogue recording for the series, since the cast just finished work on the 26th and final episode. (The final episode, "New Challenger," aired in Japan on June 30.) At the end of his Friday blog entry, he wrote, "Of course, a sequel is also being planned!!"
>> ARTICLE
This is also one of my favourite anime series.

I remember when my friend gave it to me he told me "*It's an anime about boxing*" which actually turned me off because I hate watching live-action boxing. I watched it anyway and thoroughly enjoyed it. What he should have said was that it's an anime about the boxers, which is quite different to what he had said.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I used to shun sports titles. Then my freind convinced me to watch this title (by showing me a clip of the Dempsey Roll). Thanks to that I've gone on to watch and enjoy Eyeshield 21 and Slam Dunk. Still working up the courage to tackle the massive amount of Prince of Tennis episodes, especially since the new series is comning out.
>> ARTICLE
i had trouble with slam dunk although i loves hippo and eyeshield, does it get better ? i watched like 5 episodes..
>> ARTICLE
It gets better later on. Of course it has it's moment when he finally gets serious about the game. But admittedly, its just Naruto with basketball. Sakuragi is Naruto, Rukawa is Sasuke, and Haruko is Sakura.

One thing I've noticed with sports titles is that it usually takes a while for the main character to shine, so I would definitely give the show more than 5 episodes to grab your attention.
>> ARTICLE
well that just turned me off even more lol I hate naruto with the stupid fillers, maybe ill try prince of tennis a try
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I dropped Naruto for the same reason, but was able to finish Slam Dunk no problem.

maybe ill give it a try again
>> ARTICLE
It was reported at Otakon 2009 that the director of the first series is working on a new movie. Since then, I've not really heard anything. I agree. HNI is my favourite anime too. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmn, the calm before a storm I hope. The anime is too good to be left off, I'm up to date with the manga, it gets MUCH better. And yes, it's something of a favorite of mine too.
>> ARTICLE
I'm also awaiting any new Ippo, i'm fairly new to animes, watched a few but this is easily my favourite at the moment. I was doing some digging at work and there is a new film planned for 2013. I'll try and find where i saw that information and post the link back here. EDIT: It was on the wiki page

On another note, what other animes does anyone recommend watching.
So far finished off Death Note and Hajime No Ippo. I've got netflix and there are a few on there but i'm not sure which one to try next.
>> ARTICLE
I could name a million, but regarding sports anime, Prince of Tennis is really great. There's like 197 episodes or something like that, so itll keep you engaged for a while. a few other favorites of mine are, Angel Beats is another, its on Netflix, not a sports anime, its pretty deep though. A Vision of Escaflowne, giant robots and sword fighting, although, not like gundam. Samurai Champloo, Meiji Era samurai. Kenichi- the mightiest disciple(watch in japanese, dubbed version is seriously distracting and "immature" in comparison), weak high schooler learned martial arts from crazy masters, outlaw star - space pirates. xxxHolic - young man works off a debt to a witch in return for a wish.

For some reason, I really like the idea of Russians liking GTO. Onizuka kind of has that "Fuck it, were Russian" sort of vibe. Never thought about it before, but yeah, it works.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough. Also this list has considerable amount of shoujo/josei anime (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Skip Beat!) that you don't see in other lists.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me happy to know that Russians apparently really like shoujo/josei. I'm not sure why, probably just the disconnect between how the internet commonly depicts Russia and something like Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, mandatory 'people /= government' comment. By the way, Usagi Drop is my favorite slice of life anime.

>> ARTICLE
That's...that's a lot of R2 love.
>> ARTICLE
HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of it as R2 having such a beloved ending, that it left a strong, good taste in everyone's mouth after the loveable trainwreck the actual season was. 
>> ARTICLE
The only part I didn't get was why he kept sneaking back into the school once he was long gone... It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.
>> ARTICLE

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?

Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site

It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.

Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny.

That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

Also great characters, soundtrack and animation.

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.

That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't.

Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.

Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first.

>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

Hummingbird masterrace!
>> ARTICLE
Hummingbird lost any respect I might of had for it when it listed Avatar as an anime unironically 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how you define Anime.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.
>> ARTICLE
That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares? 
>> ARTICLE
If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Does the "Redline" from Redline count, if so my vote is on Redline.

Well, it included guns, missiles, tripwires, lasers, explosions, orbital supercannons, and biological superweapons.

I'd say it qualifies.

A lot of the fights in Fate/Zero are awesome, especially Saber v Berserker.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the swordplay is amazing. Every fight scene had such great detail, not just blobs and speed lines.
>> ARTICLE
I think the very first Saber v. Lancer fight was the best fight in the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, that one was very good also.
>> ARTICLE
That was probably the only battle in Fate/Zero that was fought "honorably". No dirty tricks, no going easy, no compromise, no hesitations or any goal other than a pure match of technique, power, and wits between top class knights. The two were also pretty damn neck and neck, though Lancer seemed to have the upper hand. Though I have to say it wasn't the most significant fight, as it was too early on in the series to be decisive. Quite a few of Fate/Zero's fights were amazing to watch, whether they were between Servants, Masters, 1 on 1, tag team, on land, air, or water.

man, i was just poking through my collection the other night, thinking to myself "what do i want to watch?"  and i settled on rurouni kenshin.  i queue'd up ep 29 and watched from the fight between himura and saito through when [kenshin](/s "left kaoru").  many feels were had in the kyoto arc.
>> ARTICLE
Asuka vs the MP Eva's in End of Evangelion has always been a personal favorite.  

Even though the movement doesn't fit in with the way the Eva's move in the rest of the series at all, the I've yet to see a scene that captures the sheer weight and mass of mecha as well as that one. Not to mention the entire segment from the time the 02 rises from the lake until the end is gorgeously animated start to finish.
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean the movement doesn't fit?
>> ARTICLE
In a lot of episodes of the original series the Eva's are shown running and jumping around at high speeds and are seemingly light as a feather, they are shown to have extreme acrobatic ability for the most part. In that scene in EoE they move a lot more like mecha as appose to a biological being, it is a lot more slowed down and the Eva's seem to have a lot of weight to them and seem a lot less agile. I'm not complaining I thought it looked amazing but if you compare that scene to some of the episodes you will see what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
> In that scene in EoE they move a lot more like mecha as appose to a biological being

I'd actually say it's the opposite - in that fight, Unit02 is moving like a boxer, all balance and footwork and quick thinking. The fights in the series were more traditional mecha fights, with simple movements.
>> ARTICLE
NGE may be better remembered for the shortcuts it took to stretch its budget but it always had great fight scenes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was worth them making the whole series just so I can watch this scene repeatedly on youtube. 
>> ARTICLE
So glad someone mentioned this! That scene is phenomenal in so many ways.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, beat me to it. Asuka in prime ass-kicking form, one of my favorite scenes of all time. The movement is likely related to [spoiler](/s "Asuka's epiphany, subsequent improvement in mental state and resulting off-the-chart synchronization rate")

Any time Bradley fights in FMA: Brotherhood, the series is chock full of awesome fights but his fights are always my favorite!

Also any action scene in the Kara no Kyoukai movies, the 4th movie in particular (I think that's the spiral one) had the best. The majority of each movie is pretty slow and filled with dialogue/character development but each time there's this giant buildup to some of the best fight scenes around! (though they are kind of short most of the time)

[Araragi vs. Kanbaru from Bakemonogatari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HOAuiY5XFQ). 

Far and away one of the best choreographed, and most visually appealing fights I've ever seen. 
>> ARTICLE
That is probably the only animated fight with Araragi in it that wasn't a complete slaughter. 
>> ARTICLE
She paints the room with his blood, kicks a hole through him, and swings him around by his intestines. It's probably the most complete slaughter of Araragi in the show.
>> ARTICLE
So many spoilers in this chain...
>> ARTICLE
He gets 2 or 3 hits in, and that's more than any other fight hes had that has been animated. I pretty much consider his regen his defense, so there's that to consider. His fights with an elementary school student don't count. :P
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's contested by the finale of Nise

Yeah Yozuru kicks the shit out of him too. That beating is more prolonged, but I'd say less brutal on a frame by frame basis.

>> ARTICLE
That fight scene was absolutely amazing. I agree with you on this one, also the fight against Zod.
>> ARTICLE
But the fight itself doesn't take half a season, just a couple of episode if I remember correctly, it's just that previous to the fight we get to know a lot about Takamura's past and his diet and training previous to the match.

The Guts fight is pretty sweet but I really haven't checked the movie one. Because the original serie's animation wasnt good.

I'm surprised no one mentioned this - Fate/Kaleid Liner PRISMA Illya, episodes 4.5-6 are basically one non-stop fight. Sure, they fight two opponents one after the other, so if you want just one fight, proper? Episodes 5-6.

It's one fight, it's bloody gorgeous, all the stops are taken out, and though it's such a long fight, it never lets up, there are no pauses for banter, and you never feel bored.

what, the Naruto vs Sasuke fight is beautifully animated, the Pain one as well it's extremely fluid and nicely drawn, it's just the art style that changed a lot in the Pain fight because they had like 6 guest animators do it.

No, I haven't. I have a pretty limited manga repertoire, but I don't think I've really read anything that could be classified as action yet. If there's an anime option, I'll usually go for that first. I'm guessing it's good?
>> ARTICLE
I actually haven't but I'm drawing clare and Priscilla at work and while looking for a good pic of clare I accidentally read some details about it like Raphael's fighting style and a little bit about the seven ghosts after the carnage in the north.

[Revy Two-Hands against Roberta the maid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un8qfa6P8jg)

Love this fight! They`re both such bad asses!

It really bugs me when master sharpshooters empty entire clips at eachother at point blank range and hit nothing, and this anime (especially this fight) is soooooo guilty of this. It's still kinda cool, but I mean really now. It really makes it so I can't take it seriously.
>> ARTICLE
The entire terminator maid arc really bothers me. She clearly was not human, which really broke immersion for me.
>> ARTICLE
I sorta agree. On the one hand, I wasn't against things getting more extreme than really possible. It's what I expected out of the show. I was pretty happy in Roberta's bar scene for example, shielding herself with her special umbrella if I recall and winning a shootout in a manner clearly impossible. It's a demanding suspension of disbelief, but I could manage and it was cool.

But the linked scene... stuff like that is too far, because it actually *looks ridiculous*. You can't ignore logic and enjoy a cool scene if the scene actually looks ridiculous.

I don't watch many action series, so I can't point to any of the real great battle scenes that I'm sure are out there.

Instead, I'm going to point to the fights in Chuunibyou, simply because of how well they show the characters' imaginations and their immersion in their chuuni worlds.

[Rikka vs. Touka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EUuYxXJ6MY)

[Dekomori vs. Nibutani](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUa2z0VXfg)

(In case you're unfamiliar with the series, these characters don't actually have any special powers. These fights are all pretend and imagined).
>> ARTICLE
What is this?
>> ARTICLE
What is what? The anime? I name it in that post, it's [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai).
>> ARTICLE
I mean like, what was really going on.  The fights were cool, but just, what?
>> ARTICLE
Rikka, the girl with the eyepatch, has "eighth grade syndrome" ("Chuunibyou" in Japanese), that thing where kids in their early teens like to pretend they have dark powers and construct their own fantasy worlds. When you see a real battle and powers being thrown around and explosions, you're seeing the scene through the lens of Rikka's imagination. When you see her swinging her umbrella around, that's what's actually going on.

Same is true of Dekomori, the girl with improvised bolas in her ankle-length twin-tails, and in that particular scene, Nibutani, the other girl, is playing along with Deko's imagined battle.

I'm not sure you'd like the show, but I will say it's one of my absolute favorite series. Check it out if you want to, it's a romance, and it's really really good.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to give it a try, because the idea of it sound interesting.

I've steered clear from this series because the voice acting makes my ears bleed. I'm assuming it's still worth it to watch?

I may be a bit biased, and you can tell from my comment history, but I think the voice acting gets better as the series progresses. After episode 8, I believe it gets to be at least what you'd call average for a dub.

Yeah, the animation quality is like that of a 5 year old at most points, but still really good. 
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Unless you are prepared for poorly written winx club with bad voice acting, mediocre writing and 2-3 fights that are choreographed to fit the story that its not as good.(choreographed as in, hey here's some teamwork actions as they bond!)
Oh and random drops in animation quality.

It isn't very long so you could watch it in one sitting easily. However if you have seen a lot of Anime you may be turned off due to their use of every bad anime trope in existence.

I'd say the 2 or 3 fight scenes during the show make it worth the watch. Most episodes are only 5 or so minutes so it's not a huge time sink.

All you needed to do was put two spaces in between (two spaces creates the line break) and then you're set. It's a little confusing.

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Won't be too difficult. Nagato would recognize the true nature of the others, so she'd want to investigate them to collect data for the IDSE. Lain would probably become friends with Rei and Madoka, since they have a fair amount in common; also, programmer's honor would compel her to talk with Nagato. Rei would likely be more comfortable talking with Nagato and Lain, since they're a lot like her, both being partly based on her character, so she'd at least be a bit more sociable than in canon.

Also: Suzumiya. Haruhi. She will drag them out of their rooms if that's what it takes.
>> ARTICLE
you really thought this through! Here's my upvote!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I've actually thought further than that; the goal is, more or less, to initiate a technological singularity sort of scenario, permanently eliminating scarcity and giving all humans the option of immortality. I chose them in large part because I think they have the best chance of success. Those five have more than enough power to carry it out, and they're also intelligent and experienced enough to work out how to do it all in an ethical way without any screw-ups.

Solving physics along the way would be a nice bonus, too, but Nagato might have already done that.
>> ARTICLE
Nice username while talking about Lain by the way.

But the problem is that one of the theories for SEL seems to favor [SEL Spoiler](/s "that lain physically never existed, she was just manipulating memories.")

In hindsight it might not change what your plans are, but I don't know how the other characters would react to that.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched SEL three or four times, but didn't come to this conclusion in that way. Now I must watch it again, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it would change my plans that much. [SEL spoiler](/s "Whether Lain physically existed or not, she's still there as a sort of passive, non-interfering god after the series. Some entity called "Lain" certainly exists in any case, whether she's present in the "real world" or not.") [Madoka Magica spoiler](/s "Along similar lines, Madoka was erased from reality as a consequence of her wish, but the goddess Madoka still exists, even if she's intangible.")

It shouldn't have too much impact on how the others react. Why would [SEL and Madoka spoilers](/s "having been erased from reality") make the situation substantially weirder than it already is?

>Nice username

Hard to choose. Practical combos, entertaining combos, or harem setups. Very difficult question indeed. I'll just list a few I came up with.

**World Conquering Group** 

1. Lelouch Lamperouge from Code Geass

2. Light Yagami from Death Note

3. Hei from Darker than Black

4. Kiritsugu from Fate Zero

5. Not sure who to put here, but possibly Wrath, or Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Suzaku from Code Geass.

**Reasoning:** Light and Lelouch make the plans, and the remaining three would be able to carry them out without issue. Unlike most heros, this collection of characters is not restricted by things like "morals" which would hold them back from, say, killing someone to achieve their goal. The goal here being apartment based world domination.

**Most Overpowered Group:**

1. Yuki Nagato from all that Haruhi Suzumiya stuff

2. Humunculus from from FMA: Brotherhood [Especially](/s " after he absorbs God")

3. The Shinigami from Soul Eater 

4. Icarus from Sora no Otoshimono

5. Can't think of a fifth person again.

**Reasoning:** Between the four of them (or five if you can come up with one more), you should be able to do absolutely anything. Assuming they obey you, which is quite the assumption.

**Possibly most interesting conversations Group:**

1. Lawrence/Horo from Spice and Wolf

2. Kyon/Koizumi from more of that Haruhi stuff

3. Oreki/Satoshi from Hyouka

4. Hugh Anthony Disward from Dantalian no Shoka

5. ~~Aryaryagi-san~~ ~~Shuraragi-san~~ ARARAGI-SAN from Bakemonogatari 

**Reasoning:** Araragi would most likely be able to keep up with the conversation and provide comic relief, while any combination of the other characters would probably produce some quality discussions. All I would have to do is just sit back and watch.

Which is nice and all, but I couldn't fit in this thread without a harem group of some kind, now could I?

**Harem Group:**

1. Chitanda from Hyouka [(Seriously, try to say no to this shit. You can't do it.)](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2x9uughl41qjdbazo1_500.gif)

2. Nadeko Sengoku from Bakemonogatari

3. Shiori Shiomiya/Jun Nagase  from The World God Only Knows

4. Lan Fan/Hawkeye from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

5. Icarus from Sora no Otoshimono

**Reasoning:** First let me address the inevitable question: Why isn't Suzumiya Haruhi, Senjougahara Hitagi, or Gasai Yuno on my list? Because Tsundere/Yandere type characters like them do not appeal to me. Yeah, I guess that means I'm on the wrong subreddit. But many of the characters that are people think are "cute" just bother me. Yuno is a prime example, as she often acts "cute". But she freaks me the fuck out. Never, and I mean *NEVER* would I want to meet her or be involved with her. Not worth it [especially considering](/s " that all of my friends might end up dead and the fact that she herself might end up murdering me. And I don't think that there is really anyone who can beat her in war, so you might as well say goodbye to everything you love"). So would I live with Gasai Yuno? [Absolutely not.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) All and all, these kinds of characters would just take too much energy to manage. And when it comes to conserving energy, a familiar motto comes to mind: "If I don't have to do it, I won't."

Rather than those overly "cute" and often eccentric characters, I would prefer something else. Something more civilized is often preferable. Lan Fan is a great example of this. Dignified, loyal, and a strong character overall. [Awesome.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0ll5yizGLo) Hawkeye is similarly tame [ ](/s "except for that one time when she believes Mustang was killed by lust and she kinda loses control, but thats understandable").

Most of my choices are quite tame. Shiori will probably not speak unless spoken to. Sengoku would probably be willing to speak, but I find it unlikely that she would get out of hand. Icarus would also be unlikely to do much unless commanded to (though I mostly picked her because of the whole being-able-to-distort-reality-as-you-command-her-to thing, which is a nice addition to the harem).

Jun and Chitanda might be a little more enegetic/less tame, but not extremely so. Jun is pretty devoted, but pretty gentle too. Shouldn't be near as stressful as someone like Haruhi. And Chitanda...I just...I can't find anything I don't like about this character (as far as I have seen). Living with her would most likely be easy, pleasant, and fun. Nothing wrong with a little curiosity every here and there. Yes, that most likely means I might have to remove myself from the relatively calm life I seem to establish with my other choices and preferences, but if I encountered this character in real life, there is no way I would be able to turn her down. 

**But regardless of everything above (this is the summary),** I do not have a clear cut list of 5 people that I would chose. Chitanda and Lan Fan are probably my favorite female characters (and characters overall), so regardless of which combination of characters I would choose or whether or not I was trying to make a harem, I would probably include them in my apartment. As for what other characters I would put in with them, I honestly cannot pick. There are so many strong choices. Hugh Anthony Disward and Hawkeye would probably make it onto my final list as well, but they don't have spots reserved for them like the other two do.

**TL;DR** OP, you asked one hard fucking question and I could not come up with a definitive answer. You have defeated me. [Congratulations.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lribm3aoPY1qk8rvb.gif)

Il Palazzo (Excel Saga):  So after he becomes Supreme Ruler, I can curry favour with him as former roommate.

For fun, Harem:

Kurisu Makise (Steins;gate)

Hitagi Senjgahara (Bakemonogatari)

Nia Teppelin (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann)

Sen Yarizui (Ben-to)

Rei Ayanami (Neon Genesis Evangelion)

Now for a serious response:

I enjoy living and being friends with aloof, witty, and arrogant people who share the same interests and ideals as me, but can also connect to others on a personal level, if need be. This list is mostly derived from their relationship with others. 

1) Hitagi Senjogahara (Bakemonogatari) - Cold, aloof, proud, but when you pierce the exterior, you get someone who actually cares about others. Ideal roommate in that she'd probably leave you alone, unless you piss her off somehow (probably not washing the dishes or leaving out the hair dryer or something), but would probably be awesome to have around daily for some witty banter. 

2) Kamina (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) - Someone who's loud but you can look forward to seeing every day. Sure, his bravado would get old, but hell, you're gonna need someone when you're in the dumps of your life, and having Kamina as your roommate would probably be the elixir to cure just that. He's also witty (very important as you can see) and also very caring. 

3) Shiki Ryougi (Kara no Kyoukai) - Odd choice of a roommate, but she's Senjogahara except on steroids on the "aloofness" part and the part where she would be willing to kill you. She'd probably leave you alone and be pretty quiet most of the time, except to go on random night strolls to kill a few people, but when you can really connect to her, she'd probably be damn valuable as a person, roommate and friend. Otherwise, you'd probably be dead pretty soon. 

4) Mikiya Kokuto (Kara no Kyoukai) On the flip side of the coin, you have this odd fellow. Pretty witty, but not arrogant or aloof at all, but he'd probably make a damn good friend, as you can see his running-abouts in the movies were mostly because he wanted to protect them. Nice guy, willing to help everyone; probably would make one of the best roommates ever. 

5) Oshino Meme (Bakemonogatari) Reaching here, but Oshino is a great dude. Chill guy, imparts great knowledge that could probably save lives, and is witty to boot.

Now, would the other characters be able to get along with the person that might kill them?

I don't know what it is with this show. It's not about a sport I really enjoy watching or know. It's not always fast paced. The art style is not super flashy or new. But damn, it is the absolute best sports anime I've ever seen. Hell, it ranks very, very high on my overall list.  

It has everything, laughs, tears, hype, edge of the seat excitement, tenderness, love etc. It is realistic, it shows the hardships these guys go through to get ready for a match. [And most important imo](#s ", every single opponent becomes a real human at some point instead of this evil villain they need to defeat.")
>> ARTICLE
I started boxing because of Ippo. I even try to add some of their training to my routine. 
I realized I love boxing to the core! Muay Thai? Nah. BJJ? Nah. Just of school boxing. I even bought two pairs of boxing shoes! And soon will be competing in amateur competitions!

Time to get an old tire and run with it!

But yeah this series is awesome!
>> ARTICLE
I liked this as well. Sometimes they do get somebody who is genuinely just a total asshole (ie. Sawamura) but they at least explain why they are that wait and don't completely dehumanize them. 
>> ARTICLE
Sawamura had NO redeeming qualities.

 at least Mashiba was just overprotective of his sister.
>> ARTICLE
Sawamura wasn't a good person, no. They did completely explain why he was a piece of shit though.

[Manga Spoilers](#s "After he has his severe bike wreck and can't box anymore, he definitely seems to have calmed down and become a tiiiiiny bit better of a person, though. ")
>> ARTICLE
yeah, they didn't try to humanize him at all.


I like that actually. 

It's like "everyones got a reason for why they are the way they are, but sometimes it's not a very good one"
>> ARTICLE
Yo man Sawamura was just a chef obsessed with finding the highest quality ingredients if you think about it. He was doing all that in order to find that tender piece of steak again.

He was a man who wanted the best cut of meat.

Well, Ippo HAS gotten older. This is a series where the characters actually have aged with the manga to an extent. Ippo's in his later teens at the start, and in the manga currently I'm pretty sure he's like 21 or 22. 
>> ARTICLE
I have not seen this anime yet, but don't real-life boxers reach their peak by their late twenties?  

If so, then Ippo from an outsider's point of view still seems to have a long way to go.

Some boxers don't peak until their 30's.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, sort of. The manga isn't exactly there yet, but the series has an end in sight finally. It may not be for a few years, but we see what the end goal is finally. 
>> ARTICLE
There is one boxer who is about 29 or 30 in Ippo. Everyone (well just Takmura honestly) makes fun of how old he is.

Always loved Hajime no Ippo, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Kuroko no Basket. The methods of story telling are moreorless the same, and the biggest difference between the two being that Ippo has more outlandish characters in general.

And like Kuroko, Ippo is plagued with pacing problems. But hey.

i fucking love this show. its in my top 3! :D

Most of this sub probably broke a sweat and got tired just reading those workouts hehe

Will this teach me how to do the Dempsey Roll?
>> ARTICLE
If you have boxed. Dempsey Roll is extremely hard to master. You have a better chance of nailing Kate Upton than mastering it. Just the bobbing motion while putting your guard up as you are throwing haymakers is a thin line on having your meniscus getting tore or leg injury. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree. The Dempsey Roll is extremely hard on the body and requires a lot of coordination and proper timing to execute. That's why it took Ippo so long to develop the necessary strength to use it. 
>> ARTICLE
Lmao. Don't do it

>> ARTICLE
If you follow the Hajime no Ippo Training Program, then you will have the strength and stamina to eventually do the Dempsey Roll without messing up your knees or hips. I do recommend that you actually train boxing with a coach, for form's sake, though.
>> ARTICLE
Hehe alright. All I have is a punching bag at home and I beat on that for fun. I'm all about working out and staying in shape. Boxing workouts just makes it more fun. And now I got Ippo's workout in front of me? This is awesome! Keep doing what you do man!

I appreciate it! I don't plan on stopping this nerdiness any time soon. Feel free to ask me any questions you like on here, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Youtube, or wherever else you can find me. 
>> ARTICLE
Please, if you want to learn how to box just join a proper boxing gym. You will learn bad habits by yourself.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely agree that you need to go to a boxing gym.  The help of an experienced coach is extremely important. But don't skimp on learning outside of the gym, too.  Observe yourself shadowboxing and work your technique as much as you can. Watch fights and videos about boxing regularly. Keep your strength and conditioning up, too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but most newbies dont even know how to throw a proper punch. You need someone experienced to criticize you.
>> ARTICLE
When I started 10 years ago, I started with jab. Threw 1,000 jab everyday for my first year. You can youtube how to throw a jab. It's the most basic of basics.

Videos and self-training can be enormously effective, but definitely do not forego the use of an experienced trainer who has gone before you with experience. 
>> ARTICLE
Show me a video of your form.

I completely agree. At least you can work on fitness if you don't have access to one, however. 
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that Ippo was in shape **before** he even started doing boxing. Also most of this workout is nothing special.
>> ARTICLE
He was definitely in shape from working on the fishing boat.  There are quite a few workouts for Hajime no Ippo, so many of the early ones may be really easy for someone who is already used to training. 
>> ARTICLE
These are great man! I just started running again recently and I hope to start one of these programs at some point. Anyway that you can maybe create a program from Kuroko's Basketball?
>> ARTICLE
You are not the first person to request that series. I've not watched it, but I definitely need to get to it. I need to do more sports anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey, seems like people here are sort of interested in training. Shout out to /r/fitness. Reading the FAQ there will help you more than anything on that blog. That blog is cool and interesting, but I wouldn't recommend taking it seriously at all.
>> ARTICLE
People should always research and learn more. The blog is used as inspiration and something to encourage people to train.  Eventually, they may decide to move away from it entirely. Until that point, however, it and I will be there to assist. Thanks for looking out for everyone!
>> ARTICLE
I totally get it. It's super fun reading some of the stuff. Apparently anime characters hate back work. :P
I just think some of it's really bad to encourage people to do. Wearing ankle weights as an example, like the rock lee workout, would ruin your joints over a longer period of time.
>> ARTICLE
Wearing ankle weights for certain workouts would be fine as long as you have progressed to that stage of fitness, begin at an extremely light weight, and progress slowly. And wearing them during Rock Lee's Conditioning for jump rope, sprinting, and hand walking isn't like getting someone to wear them while doing full speed shadowboxing or air kicking. And people should always be careful when they are training and if any pain or joint discomfort is felt, the weights can certainly be replaced with a weighted vest or eliminated entirely.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, you should collect these into a downloadable PDF or similar.

There are some really good stuff in here, a lot of the workouts resemble some of the HIIT stuff I did in the military and MMA. I also like how you mentioned in a few of them that when working out twice a day to separate the workouts by 4-6 hours. You absolutely need that long to return to form when working out twice a day.

I can't believe you went through all of this, seriously good stuff, I'm going to be stealing a few of these to add in to my workouts. ::thumbsup::
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!  I appreciate the advice.  I've got the Goku Training Program, which is set up in a similar fashion, available as a PDF or over Google Docs, but that's probably a good idea to put all of the Hajime no Ippo program available as well. 

It took a REALLY long time to go through the series and do as much as I did. I'm letting the manga get a little further along before I do anything else.

I can't wait for the Sawamura fight, it's going to be awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the things that I think is pretty cool about Ippo is that I look forward to the training episodes where he tries to better his game. Like when he was developing the Dempsey Roll in the beginning, using the metal bars to practice the dipping motion, etc, etc. Of course, the matches are the main course, but I find the training that leads up to those are fun to watch too. 
>> ARTICLE
Sawamura makes Hawk look like a sweetheart in comparison.

To OP: I'm expecting some dirty boxing, but there's no way Ippo would lose to someone like that.  If anything, I see him getting angry for once and unleashing all his fury on Sawamura.

I would love to see something like this happen! but it probably wont happen for another 2-3 episodes :/

This fight reminds me of Takamura's first title match. I think it may play out similar. 

So if Takamura ranks up in weight, will he have to start all over again?
>> ARTICLE
> So if Takamura ranks up in weight, will he have to start all over again?

No.  I think chances are when a World Champion moves up a weight classes, they are usually highly ranked (top 5), in order to challenge for a World title fight.  A World Champion vs World Champion fight is a big draw.  So the WBC or Boxing Association will rank him high in order to make that match up possible.

Right now, the toughest part for Takamura when changing weight classes is getting that weight class World Champion to accept his challenge.  They could duck or ignore him.  So Kamogawa got to find ways to entice them to fight, where maybe he offers them more money.  I believe they had to do that with Hawk, where they had to offer him more money in order to fight in Japan and Takamura.

It was more of a stare away.  Funny thing is if he didn't do that, his prediction before the fight would have came true...
>> ARTICLE
Sawamura is pretty fucked.


Gonna be cool to see a fight against a straight up antagonist.
>> ARTICLE
Come to think of it, he and Hawk are the only boxers so far to be straight up "punch me in the face for I have no redeeming qualities" material.
>> ARTICLE
Damn Sawamura is brutal. I personally don't think Ippo will lose but he has indeed only lost once so far so it's a possibility. Either way this'll be his toughest fight so far.
>> ARTICLE
I think in the episode it said he lost twice but both were by DQ

Oh no I meant Ippo has only lost once. I should've specified that.

Nice episode, cant wait for the next one

So much have you all seen? I have seen a solid 34/100.

40/100, not bad
>> ARTICLE
A half-decent 24, plus another ~2 shows' worth of incomplete stuff. I should get around to more of these.
>> ARTICLE
10/100. I haven't been an anime fan for that long, plus I'm busy with college, so I think that's pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Ive completed 27, and if you include shows that I have read the manga instead, or watched but drop / didnt finish because I decided to read the manga, 34. 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 67, and I've still yet to get to Bebop, Beck, and Death Note (although I read the manga once upon a time, so I have no real motivation to go watch Death Note at the moment).  Kyoukai No Kanata movie is on my radar as well, even though I wasn't too impressed by the series itself.  

Its nice to see my favorite (Kino's Journey) make the list though.

39, and working on 3 more.
>> ARTICLE
What was the methodology here?  Highest rank sets the franchise rank?  Or votes  avg = score, sum of show scores is franchise score, sort by franchise score?  Or?
>> ARTICLE
Highest rank sets the franchise rank was this one. I'll probably do another one that is average score later on as well.

If you count partially watched, it's 31/100. If it's only completed ones, probably like 25.

26/100. That's just completed. If you include stuff I've started and put on hold/dropped/just haven't finished, it's more like 35 or 40.

Around 71/100 for me. I know many of the ones i haven't seen are great but just can't bring myself to watch them, waiting for the right mood.

I've seen 75/100, and I'm still missing out on many of the more recent or popular series like Bepop, Death Note, Shokugeki, Noragami, Parasyte, Jojo, FSN and Kuroko.

Pls watch these. Especially Bebop, Death Note and Parasyte. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to get around to watching Death Note. I've just heard so much about the second half ...it's hard not wanting to get invested.

Also, I'm still surprised people like Shigatsu/Your Lie In April so much. I mean I enjoyed it, but wouldn't think of it as #10 (in this list).
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Death Note yesterday actually and I can see why people enjoy the first half more but the second half is still really thrilling! 

Yeah same! I guess people really like their feels anime

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
yes. not watching bebop is a crime
>> ARTICLE
It's a crime Bebop isn't in the top 10 :(
>> ARTICLE
Bebop is too overrated and too overhyped
>> ARTICLE
its just not your taste, but im sure like 80% of people here think differently as you.
>> ARTICLE
My statement may be incorrect. Let's say that i wouldn't recommend it as a first anime to someone.
>> ARTICLE
How come? I'm curious. Especially since you gave it a 9.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Ooo boy, you're missing out.

If Noragami counts as a newest member for its second season airing in Fall 2015, then so does Haikyuu!! at spot #12 for its [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28891/Haikyuu!!_Second_Season). ^(long live Haikyuu!!)
>> ARTICLE
Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

88/100 I think.

Yeah this really shows off myanimelist's recency bias which I honestly think is not as bad as this sub's.

Yeah, I've rated some of the old shows I've watched quite highly, but if they came out today I'd have rated them lower.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe newer shows are better
>> ARTICLE
Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

[Terrible photoshop skills to the rescue!](http://i.imgur.com/WYBue09.png)

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

The original is not in the top 100.

That's a shame, the original gets so much flack even though it has better early character development, a better OST, and the better movie. I also like how [](/s "it takes more than 10 people to make a philosopher stone")

There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Le 8.3 average rating, what a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, why did you rate Death Note a 10 if you dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

http://i.imgur.com/ZAfVGax.gifv

Edit: No this is not about the people who think it isn't top 10. There's a lot of anime out there so odds are there are 10 other shows you enjoyed more.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time.

It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.

Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back.

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.
>> ARTICLE
I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

I would like so much a list of these but only counting TV Series with 12 episodes or more. (Not counting, specials, movies, etc)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???
>> ARTICLE
What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.
>> ARTICLE
from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.

Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off

In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.

i need to watch more high rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.

>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...

How is angel beats a rip off or Haibane renmei? They are completely diffirent and the only thing they have in common is a story being about dead people.

in the end it just comes down to taste :/

"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.

i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.

If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.

True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

Good thing Ippo told us that the girl is cute because this art style is not able to make anything look cute...

But more importantly we get an amazing match. Strength vs. speed, power vs. technique, will vs. will.  
And in the end it was not some nonsense of the rookie completely crushing the seasoned genius but it was decided literally by a hair's breadth. Ippo's training gave him enough strength to endure until a small chance arose and just enough skill to seize this opportunity. And he only barely made it.

It may seem like a pity move of Miyata to leave the gym because of this - but Kamogawa teaches a really aggressive and forward way of boxing which is not really Miyata's strength or style.

There always seems to be someone out to gut Ippo  just as he gets out of reach of the school bully Umezawa the grim faced Mashiba with his flicker jabs turns up.

Aaand we learn something about Ippo's opponent in his debut match.  
Get used to this  one great thing of the series is that the boxers Ippo has to face are not some unknown entities. You truely get to know some of them and sometimes it's hard to decide for which fighter you should cheer...  
This time it's fairly easy though. His opponent lazed off for far too long so I want Ippo to punch him back into shape.

Also we got the first glimpses of Takamura struggling with his diet.  
I really love this rewatch. Knowing who these characters are and what we will experience with them really makes these first episodes even more enjoyable. And it makes me appreciate the (comparitively) slow but steady character development used in the series.
>> ARTICLE
As you said, I want Ippo to win against Oda, and as a result hopefully he can get back some of that fire that he lost. I just hope he doesn't lose his girlfriend after the loss.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not going to be able to stick with this... sorry, this show just gets me way too hype.

I'm going ahead.

haha me too. Its just hard to stop. Sorry OP

I don't think Gintama, LoGH, etc are on there because of cultural differences and a lack of popularity. But most of the ones in the list are well known and good quality. Most of them even have good dubs so that helps with the culture difference.


>> ARTICLE
I didn't even think about dubs but you're right, a lot of those have a pretty good one.
>> ARTICLE
Also LOGH isn't even technically a TV show.
>> ARTICLE
LOGH is 9.0 on IMDB, although, since it doesn't have 5000 ratings it didn't get on this list.
>> ARTICLE
That's similar with Gintama. That is rated 8.7 but only have 1.8k votes. 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually [8.8](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096633/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and yeah it only has 629 ratings, so it won't appear on the list any time soon
>> ARTICLE
Weird, when i checked it yesterday it had 9.0 really weird actually.

Well, Hellsing Ultimate is seemingly also one the list (177), despite being an OVA.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, you're right. I just blame popularity then.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, unfortunately.
>> ARTICLE
And FLCL
>> ARTICLE
I mean, there are shows that are not very long on this list either. FLCL is actually not the shortest on this list.

I'm  pretty sure FLCL has at least aired on TV in America though.

It was, several times back on Toonami.

Hellsing Ultimate comes on Toonami now, I watched it a couple days ago.

A couple days ago? I watch Toonami every week (along with the other lunatics at /r/toonami) and Hellsing Ultimate ended its run back in December. It was awesome that they played it nigh-uncut though.

This is a great way to sell anime to non-anime fans. "Hey IMDB came out with this list and look how high ___ came in."

My dad started watching Bebop after he saw how high it placed on some "Best Sci-Fi TV shows of all time". Lists that incorporate anime with live action shows are definitely a huge help in showing how normal it can be.

Berserk

>IMDb rank 92

>MAL rank 186

Well. 
>> ARTICLE
MAL has to get their shit together
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing IMDb has an older demographic overall on it than MAL, which may explain it at least a little. I personally gave Berserk a 10, so I'm really glad it's on the list.
>> ARTICLE
So it's just a list based on IMDb user ratings, not composed by the staff - that explains the presence of so many anime titles :P
>> ARTICLE
This is quite misleading, in fact, all imdb series rankings are misleading. Only actual fans of a series will bother rank it.
>> ARTICLE
That is also why series have much higher rating than movies on imdb.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, anime with western penetration get a huge boost. It's interesting comparing to the more enthusiast dominated MAL. Death Note, Attack on Titan, and Dragonball are way up there, but no Clannad: After Story or Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Weren't most of these on Netflix, or toonami though? Probably why you arn't seeing /r/anime 's favorites up there. Not enough exposure.
>> ARTICLE
Nah /r/animes taste is shit that's why.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad: After Story would be in the top 250 if it had over 5,000 votes.
>> ARTICLE
Unless those 5,000 votes were lower on average, which they probably would be. 

That's the problem with small sample sizes and the entire reason for the threshold in the first place. Otherwise shows with a single vote of 10.0 would top every leaderboard.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little surprised FMA 2003 made it on. I personally think it's only a little worse than Brotherhood and I'm glad it's on the list, but most people seem to think Brotherhood is *far* better.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't think either series is really better or worse than the other. People say brotherhood is better because it follows the manga, but what they really mean is it that brotherhood is a better adaptation of the manga, not necessarily a better show altogether. FMA and FMAB are two different shows that share the same exposition and characters but go in different directions in with its plot, which both do very well. I just think it's dumb to compare shows that are very different. At most, they're just two sides of the same coin.

Edit: fuck both of these shows, let's just read the manga instead.
>> ARTICLE
Most people say that it's better as an adaption and better overall. 
>> ARTICLE
Before Brotherhood, FMA 2003 was constantly seen as one of the best anime ever and praised everywhere (well deserved)

It also had a great dub and introduced many people in the western countries to anime, hell people who didn't even watch anime liked it 

Thats why its on the list

Then when Brotherhood came along, people began bashing FMA 2003 for various reasons and some even recommend not watching it

I personally like FMA 2003 a lot more than Brotherhood but thats for another thread
>> ARTICLE
I've watched both, and I think people should use them in concert. The slower starting pace of FMA 2003+Brotherhood starting around ep. 11 is fantastic. The Hughes and Tucker build up are done better in the former, as is lab 6. But once they start to seriously diverge, I do prefer Brotherhood.

I don't think it should be either/or.
>> ARTICLE
I think they kinda rushed the parts that people had already seen in 2003 on purpose
>> ARTICLE
I definitely think it has to be an either or for most people, not everybody watches as much anime as we do.

If you're recommending a casual watcher an anime, you're always gonna go with FMA:B, its just too good.

I mean over 10% of the list being anime is good and all, and while there are lots of good shows on there, they all tend to be ones that are more popular in the West anyway. With anime being a relatively niche area of TV in the West, most of the great shows don't cut the 5000 votes needed to make the list, no matter how good. As a lot of you know quality doesn't always hold up against popularity anyway with this sort of thing. Five lots of Dragonball, really? Even so 27/250 is quite an achievement, and it would probably be higher if it weren't for the vote cap.

Could I ask a question? What makes Cowboy Bebop so good? I purchased and watched the entire series, and enjoyed it, but I don't see how everyone puts up as the greatest anime ever?! Very good yes, but I always thought shows like Gurren Lagann, with distinct and powerful messages, were much more enjoyable. I'm not saying Bebop is bad by any means, I just don't understand how people can feel so strongly about an anime that had basically 5 or 6 episodes (of 24) with actual plot. Maybe I missed something? Please understand I'm not trying to start a fight! Just want to understand.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi made the list, and it basically doesn't have a single contiguous plot period.

Episodic does not mean bad.
>> ARTICLE
It's 26 episodes (+ movie :D) and the plot is not as important as other things, most notably characters. It's episodic, which provides a lot of different settings for characters to work with and it lets us see their different sides. It can be very moving at times (when dealing with each character's past) without melodrama, it just creates a great setting through animation and amplifies it through character's dialogues and music. Add in some minor changes to character's physique, posture or look in the scene and it all ends up being quite enjoyable to watch.

From the technical standpoint, it has great dubs in both languages, the animation is excellent for when it was made and it's not subpar by today's standards and many scenes are paced to the background music which comes from an amazing soundtrack with a ridiculous number of songs (around 300, I'm not sure of the exact number). Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did wonders and so many scenes are improved by the music (most people's favorite is the cathedral scene from "The Ballad of the Fallen Angels", it's very artful, quite a beautiful sight overall).

You also have to keep in mind the number of Western influences on the show. You can hear it in the music (jazz, rock, a little bit of country, metal and swing), see it in the animation (Western settings, fairly realistic eyes, at least for the male characters) and there's a lot of other stuff. Draws inspiration from Old West for some things, deals with predominantly Western themes, references some Western literature etc. I suggest this blog: [The Cowboy Bebop Attic](http://bebopattic.weebly.com/) for many interesting reads. I discovered it a few weeks ago and it goes really deep with the analysis, the way teachers expect you to read and analyze a book, by paying attention to even the slightest detail. Writers and animators hardly do anything by accident, they pay attention to what they're doing at the moment of creation of their work.

Anyways, I guess this ended up being a wall of text, but I hope you enjoyed the read.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely! I definitely plan a rewatch after all you and others have said! I guess I just did not pay enough attention to the show the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
I think bebop stands alone more as an amazing conglomeration of artistic viewpoint and musical genious. I mean, HxH 2011 had a greater story and was so in depth and amazing, but for some reason, i was never really attached to the world as I was in Bebop. It puts me right with the crew. The music is to die for as well. So while HxH made me feel for the characters, bebop made me feel with the characters

Is HXH the shows actual show or just an acronym? I've heard it mentioned a lot. Also I really did enjoy the soundtrack to Bebop! It really fit well.

Many people who criticize Bebop point to its lack of overarching plot and episodic nature. To me (and many others) - this doesn't matter. It's not the plot that makes the series appealing, but rather the execution... it's literally perfect (imo of course).

For starters, the artistic direction of the series is simply amazing. The atmosphere is so well established from the first scene in the first episode. The music, fluid animation, character design, and detail (along with its aesthetic) all contribute to this.

I would say Bebop has a much more powerful/distinct message than TTGL. It's more subtlely presented, though it's extremely well crafted. If you pay close attention, you'll actually see there's a ton of recurring parallels, symbols, and motifs that make seemingly unrelated episodes, very related. In this sense, the episodes aren't linked together by plot, but rather the series' overarching themes. Though episodic, Bebop feels more cohesive to me than most story-centric anime out there. 
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is on there too, and has even less of an overarching plot than bebop.

Hmm I guess I'll have to look more closely upon rewatch then
>> ARTICLE
Tons of detail per episode. Each one felt like its own world. I like normal anime more, but the world building and subtle "show, don't tell" of bebop are beautiful in it's own 
>> ARTICLE
For many American fans (myself included), Cowboy Bebop was one of the first late-night anime series they ever watched. It also got a wide exposure thanks to its airing and multiple reruns on Adult Swim. So besides the show's own qualities, there's a lot of nostalgia involved in its high ratings.
>> ARTICLE
Ok I can understand that.
>> ARTICLE
The direction and tone of the series as a whole is very skillful.  It takes itself seriously while being fantastical and manages to juggle it's plot threads together with very adept pacing.  It's the way the lines are delivered, the pacing of the shots, the character's personalities that are constructed as each of them get round-robin spotlit by their various episodes.  The story by itself isn't much on paper, but the way it's told through the gradual unveiling of the characters is really a cut above what many directors are capable of.

Also the soundtrack is sweet (new musical themes every episode to boot).
>> ARTICLE
You talk about how characters say lines so let me ask you: is the English dubb ok to watch or should I watch the Japp. dubb? I watched the English one the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
CB actually has an awesome english dub, so they both hold up equally well.
>> ARTICLE
IMO Cowboy Bebop was character driven as opposed to plot driven, the characters were interesting enough to the point where the plot seemed to be there just to move along the show, it's more about the interactions. Plus ed is awesome, and the episode where they do mushrooms is hilarious
>> ARTICLE
That episode was pretty great, and you gotta love Ed ha ha!
>> ARTICLE
Also the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic
>> ARTICLE
All action. People don't even try for other genres.

There is a wide variety of themes in the list, not sure what else you could be referring to outside of slice of life school shows.

Damn, HxH was in the top twenty on the old IMDB top TV shows list.

Holy crap! I'm so happy that Yu Yu Hakusho made the list! YYH is one of my all time faves but it doesn't get as much love any more in lieu of more modern series

I'm just glad anime got some representation. Hopefully this list will give some people who've been hesitant to watch any anime give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
The 4000 vote rule is kind of dumb, considering Clannad:AS and others would be in the top 60, but they don't have enough votes to their ratings
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is very niche though. Not one romance anime is on the list lol.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love Clannad (it's my #1 anime and I gave it a 10) I like the minimum vote requirement. If they only required 100 votes, or even 1000, then super obscure or even somewhat bad shows could place highly due to trolls or a very small group of vocal fans. At least by having a minimum vote requirement, they are effectively enforcing the idea that a higher amount of people need to rate it highly for it to warrant a place on the list.

I do hope that Clannad takes a place on the list soon though!
>> ARTICLE
So much salt over what made the list and what didn't. People are forgetting that IMDB is trash and its ratings have very little to do with quality and anything remotely niche might as well not exist.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you didn't include *Avatar* in your post. 

So far, IMDb's list is similar to MAL's but like MAL, you should never engage in IMDb's Message Boards.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to think I know enough about anime to know that Avatar isn't one! Yeah, I'm not much of a fan of the IMDb message boards either. I actually prefer MAL's.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to think I know enough about anime to know that it's more than a country of origin, but the mods might find me and kill me.
>> ARTICLE
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't "Japanese" basically in the definition of anime? Made anywhere other than Japan, it's just "animation"? 
>> ARTICLE
Sure, technically and for this sub, though it's mostly just to make it easy on the moderators. 

I've never heard anybody offer _evidence_ to defend the position that anime _must_ be from Japan. Everyone, including mods, has fallen back on the age old, "Well, that's how we define anime," or "Those are the subreddit's rules". Nobody has ever bothered to ask _why_ those rules exist.

I want you to think about why the word "anime" came into being in the first place. 

When anime was becoming an underground hobby that you could fashionably have in the west, something you could really "be into", we needed a moniker that would quickly and accurately say "I enjoy watching cartoons like Akira and Robotech, but I don't really have a passion for The Carebears, Space Ghost or Dexter's Lab. I like the cooler, mostly fantasy, works of narrative animation primarily produced in Japan."

At the time, there wasn't anything like that being produced anywhere else, so the easy definition was just limiting it Japan. Now we have [an Arabic anime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZCAkEccr_g)

But even now, the word "anime" still maintains that nebulous subtext. I tell you I'm into anime and you're not going to start talking to me about Kim Possible or Batman: The Brave and the Bold. But you most certainly could assume I may be into Avatar: The Last Airbender. I am. And that makes it anime.


Avatar captures the exact same distinctive visual appeal that we identify as unique to anime, and it follows a similar narrative-production structure (strong characters, continuous story) to what we understand as anime. Those aspects are much, much, much more integral to the definition of anime than anything involving country of origin.

Literally.

> a style of animation that was created in Japan and that uses colorful images, strong characters, and stories that have a lot of action

RWBY, The Animatrix, My Little Pony, anything listed under Hummingbird's "Anime-influenced" tag. Either those are, for all practical purposes, anime, or anime is dead and this subreddit should instead be /r/postanimecartoons. There's no meaning to the segregation other than providing the ban-happy mods with a concrete metric. But things often aren't so black and white.

Finally, here's [Dai Sato telling things like they are.](http://leseanthomas.tumblr.com/post/68177223257/doug-mcgray-have-you-seen-the-boondocks-aaron)
>> ARTICLE
I mean, the idea that Anime = Japan is pretty widespread. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime

> Outside Japan, the meaning of the word anime can vary slightly; definitions include animation from Japan or, alternatively, a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.[2][3] Arguably, the stylization approach to the meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan.[4][5][6] For simplicity, many Westerners strictly view anime as an animation product from Japan.[3] Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of orientalism.[7]

So you're not wrong, but the definition most people tend to use means from Japan, and not the animation style itself. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think the only thing I've seen that qualifies as outside-Japan anime is A:TLA. For me, I define it as inside Japan plus the one exception.
>> ARTICLE
I'd add Chinese and Korean animation to the "anime" fold - many are even on MAL. Try watching something like this season's [Chu Feng B.E.E.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29876/Chu_Feng:_B.E.E) and tell me that you could pick it apart from Japanese anime in a line-up.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, many people do feel that way. I'm not saying that it's not a popular view.

I'm just saying that national origin is a pass, overly reductive metric that has yet to adapt to the modern anime landscape. There's no real reason to exclude things like Avatar.

>> ARTICLE
I'm not that sure banning that stuff would be that much easier on moderators to be honest. I desided pretty early that we were going to try to allow anime influenced animation (as long as they were in another language than japanese) on /r/AnimeDubs similar to what they do on [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.me/anime/filter?g%5B%5D=anime-influenced) and /r/AnimeSuggest pretty early and and I thought it was going to cause problems, but it never has. Not even once. 


I guess potentially discussions on the topic of what to include and what to exclude will pop up eventually, but to be honest that's probably discussions we should be having anyway so it seems like a more of a positive than a negative. 


/r/AnimeDubs is a pretty small sub so the amont of moderation on any topic isn't really that great anyway, so it's not really that comparable to larger subs like /r/Anime, perhaps more in the vein of /r/Trueanime. Altough it's fun to see exactly how long we can go before it ever becomes a problem.


But I expect that's going to take quite some time. I hang around in /r/AnimeSuggest a lot and I can't speak for moderation there (if some of the mods there randomly sees this perhaps you can shed some insight?), but from a users perspective it's never really been an issue there either as far as I can tell. And I see pretty much every post that ever pops up there. 


>> ARTICLE
Think of it like scotch or bourbon: if it's not made in Scotland or Appalachia (respectively), it's just whisky. Which doesn't necessarily mean it's bad (it might subjectively be better), it's just that they're the originator and have a long-standing tradition. It's an objective way of categorizing, as opposed to whatever subjective ways we might come up with.
>> ARTICLE
Sure. I'm just saying I'd rather go to the whiskey convention and visit /r/whiskey than ignore all this functionally identical content simply because of the circumstances of its author's birth. That's a very segregationist, old line of thinking. Are we really going to keep doing illogical things in the name of "tradition?" That reminds me of the arguments people make to support female circumcision and prejudice. That's just vanity, and I hate it.



Where's the subreddit where I can post about "objective" anime _and_ Avatar? One where, in the words of the mods of /r/whiskey,

So, I guess Dragon Ball is for IMDb what Gintama is for MAL. Not that I'm complaining, since I love both those series.

Just looks like a list of things that are popular among 20-something dudes.

Tons of recency bias, with a little sprinkling of DAE 90s Nostalgia.

That's the feeling I got from this list, too. It's not a terrible list, but there's way too much Dragonball/Z and it's way too high up, for example.

Surprised to see so many Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z ones on there. 

I wouldn't be surprised if SnK rose more because of the massive popularity it has currently in the west.
>> ARTICLE
Dragon Ball Z shouldn't be too surprising considering it's massive popularity in the West. It has a cult following around the world and has become super influential.


It's pretty rare to see someone who's never seen or heard of Goku.

Makes sense. I guess I was surprised because I usually expect to see these types of lists to be influenced by how recent they are.

Why is AOT higher than Berserk and SAC? I mean, I'm glad there's a fair selection of anime there, but that makes me a tad salty. ;_;

Because as far as anime goes, it's better.

That's funny. You're funny.

You're downvoted, but I honestly agree.

fwiw, AoT is higher than Berserk on MAL and most of the other anime-centric sites as well, so the positioning of these two shows on IMDB isn't surprising either.

I'm not surprised about it, I'm just pure, god damn salty.

I never imagined Mushishi to be more popular enough in the west to make it higher than SAC, considering GitS as a franchise is pretty popular in it's own right. 
>> ARTICLE
That should be the push to move it from your PTW list to watching list, just to see why it scored higher ;)
>> ARTICLE
You know, I'm surprised Berserk is even on there. I know that the manga is popular, but I don't hear much praise for the anime.

I'm pretty surprised it's even on there too. But I'm salty that it is, *and* lower than AOT. All the other shows I love that aren't on there don't bother me, I'm just kinda irked that it's been recognized and still is lower than AOT. :P

There be a thing called popularity. Yarr.

We must sail these salty seas with sadness.

Introduced ton of people to anime and quite honestly, way the show paced self (cliffhangers end of each episode) and the animation/music had great production value.

It might seem to pale to a lot of other shows but like a Naruto or a Bleach, still culturally relevant to the point where I'm fine with it on a list like this.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. Yeah.

I wish FLCL was higher, but biases are biases.

Why FLCL isn't higher is baffling. What a brilliant show.

Hmm... I definitely prefer the rankings on anime-based sites like MAL. It's cool that so many anime series made the list, and most of them are good, but would it kill anyone to add a shoujo/josei series? And it's funny how despite how common it is now for anime to have a school setting, I'm having trouble finding a single one on this list. Not a terrible list, but certain biases are painfully obvious.

No GTO?  Why does this show continue to be underrated?
>> ARTICLE
I don't give much respect to IMDb's lists, it doesn't change even when the list has my favorites up on the top. If it had influence in the West, it's high on the list. If it didn't, too bad, and that makes it a pretty bad list. Can't argue that most of these shows are really good and that taste differs, so I won't bitch about this, to each their own, but there's some obvious bias. I guess it's at least a good way to get people to watch my favorite anime.

Wait, wait, wait. I know this isn't anime related but AOT is higher then South park one of the greatest satires of all time. Lol, you forgot Zmajeva kugla (dragon ball in serbian and Croatian)

Wow. As far as an American best of list goes, this is surprisingly fair. Shockingly even! Of course it doesn't have any anime below AA or A status in the West, but all things considered, that's a shit load of anime when most lists might have like, 2 if that. 

As a guy who likes some anime but looooves good television, I'm glad this is getting the attention it deserves. FMA: Brotherhood is my number 1 show of any kind of all time the rest on my top 10 being live action.

My only complaint is there are way too many dragon ball series on this list. It's just an average shounen, I don't care if it is classic or any other thing like that, it's average so it shouldn't be so high on a list like that.

Code Geass R2 does not belong in the top 100 let alone Ranked 11 of all time in MAL. That is why I dont take MAL seriously.  Just goes to show how some epic ending can save you're anime and make it a ''classic'' in the future.

Personally, I think it can take near the top in Mecha anime. Great story overall. And the twists were amazing. But its just my opinion.

I consider the first season of Code Geass great. Dont get me wrong R2 is still enjoyable despite my criticism.

Just my opinion :

Aldnoah Zero 2 =  Train wreck and shit

Guilty Crown Second Half = Train wreck and shit 

Code Geass R2= Train Wreck but fun and great and satisfying Ending. Its easy to see why many peopled enjoyed it.

Good isn't objective, there are things you can do that might make a show better or worse, but overall if a show is well liked by the majority of people that watched it, it must be doing something right and is good in one way or another; this isn't a list of your favorite animes, it's a list of the most popular and highly rated tv shows, just cause you didn't like something doesn't  means everyone else shouldn't either ya dig
>> ARTICLE
If we are talking about shounen saying Onepiece is not good is blasphemy. For shounen genre its one of the best out there. Onepiece certainly belongs inside the 1000 animes 


I love my LOTGH,tatami galaxy,NHK,Gankutsuou,Monster,Mononoke,GITS and Ergo Proxy. Animes that are highly rated and most here definitely are not for the casual viewers and opposite of shounen but I consider Onepiece one of the best for its genre. Its unfair for me to compare it outside its genre.

I liked it, but I am extremely disappointed they cut out a lot of stuff from the manga. This fight had a great weigh in that gets cut.  Easily a volume and half worth material cover this episode.  I hope this fast pacing isn't a sign to come for future fights.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah,in anime it doesn't mention that Iwao doubts that Ippo is a true seaman after their meeting on the docks,and if I am not mistaken he even meets his mom there and there is a funny scene.They should've at least put that and at least a part of the training to overcome "dragging down to the bottom of the ocean" that Ippo did,this way the fight kinnda looses it's weight.But gotta say I am impressed with the action and the feels of watching this anime once again!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was completely unlike the previous series' fights.  They just threw us in there.  

As much as I like a fast pace, I don't want it to be at the cost of cutting corners.
>> ARTICLE
It could be they just want to do a fast pace for this fight to start things off, since they got a lot of content to cover.  About 17 volumes worth in 25 episodes.  As long as it slows down for the Ippo vs Sawamura fight (and Eagle fight), I would be okay for the season.  That is a great fight in the series.

I know they already re-arranged story some with the early Ippo childhood flashback, which was done pretty good.  I hope they don't change too much.
>> ARTICLE
Isnt the Coach flashback missing?

I dont remember having seen it in new challenger
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they haven't done it yet. 
>> ARTICLE
The Kamogawa and Nekota Post WWII Flashback arc was suppose to happen after the Takamura vs Hawk fight.  (In volume 45 to 46.)  But new challenger skipped it.   

It has been posted that they will be doing a TV special on it like Mashiba vs Kimura fight.   So chances are it probably won't air until this season is done.
>> ARTICLE
It was confirmed in the latest chapter of the manga it would be animated in HnI: Rising. Chances are we will see it quite soon which is great!

I think they're just doing this as they did with New Challenger which also starts right away with the movie fight.

Glad to see some of the original OST in there at the start.

This is what I liked the most. 

The original series had a goddamn fantastic soundtrack. The direction of the music in the second series was totally different and no where near the level of the original.

It popped up a couple of times in the episode, but when it kicks in at 13:09 it just gets me all "fuck yeah, it's time."

Dat [flashback](http://i.imgur.com/TlKMOFj.gif). 

I'm glad they didn't start off with an episode or two of recap from the previous two seasons. The action was great, and the animation looks a bit cleaner (though it might just be my imagination; it's been a while since S2). As always, they end the episode with a cliff-hanger.
>> ARTICLE
A great new opening song for an amazing new season.

Aw man I expected us to get blood pumping action from the start but we're being feed all these feels.

I'll miss Kenji dearly but the new actor is doing a good job so far for the coach.

I'm still not to sure about this new voice actor for Kamogawa Genji, I wish he would at least try and match some of the same pronunciation as the old one. When he calls ippo kid it sounds soo different and off the mark, the 'a' sounds like an 'o' and the 'z' isn't nearly as sharp.

Watching order: Hajime no Ippo (75 episodes) --> Champion Road (Movie 1) --> Mashiba vs. Kimura (Movie 2) --> New Challenger (26 episodes).


Sure, there are a lot of episodes, but it's really worth it!
>> ARTICLE
As an American fan, what would be the best way to watch Movie 2 and New Challenger?

I have everything Geneon released here before it cancelled the series/folded.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if in the near future that Crunchy Roll announces it picked up the previous season and movies to host.  Right now, the core audience for this show are only people who have seen the previous seasons/movies or read the manga.   Otherwise, non fans will be confused about what is going on.

Until they do, you will probably have to watch/stream it else where on more questionable sites.   Just do a google search for it.  (I would post links, but it is probably against /r/anime rules.)   Or you could go to /r/hajimenoippo  there should be links posted in one of the threads too.

Worst case, you could always read the manga as means to catch up quickly.   Just start from volume 31.

That right there is a one-way gateway hype trip to getting fit. I was in great shape during every season of Ippo. After seeing Rising's 1st episode, I will be fit by the end of the season! Also that flashback got me so emotional and motivated!
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree! I broke my knee several years ago (from soccer) and stopped my boxing/mma training. I picked up this anime about a year and a half ago and I've gotten right back into training! Honestly this anime provided me with the inspiration I needed to get back into shape. Really do owe it a lot, however sappy I may sound.

Nah man, I get it. It doesn't sound sappy at all. Some anime have that kind of effect on you. For example, Ippo motivates me to be fit, while TTGL motivates me want to become a better me.

Wooohoo!! One of the best sports anime of all time is back!

Good episode 1! really solid. I was just super surprised with the flashback opening. I knew it was coming but i didn't think they would start with that.

It's crazy how the fight immediately started in this episode. No build up, whatsoever. I read this part of the manga it had a pretty good story on it. I think it was this fight that triggered the Ippo flashback because he questioned if he was really a true son of the sea.

It seems like they will be doing things differently for this fight. We might see some flashbacks of their encounters with each other to build more depth in it. It might be a new style of progress that they are trying out.

Overall, super hype about the series coming back! There are a lot of great matches coming! And Takamura still OP!!

I really wanted to see that fight.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they release it as a movie
>> ARTICLE
That would actually be the best scenario possible.  The previous OVA/Movies seemed to have better animations than the series and is usually well done.  Please let thsi happen!
>> ARTICLE
This is the reason why I watch this show. Just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Never have I been this excited about a sports show and never did the sound of punches sound so satisfying. That last Counter-Dempsey Roll followed by a regular one was outstanding to watch.
>> ARTICLE
The music that played during the first episode fit so well. Honestly the evolved Dempsey Roll is so awesome. Double episodes are the greatest!
>> ARTICLE

Pay money to my pain - Weight of my pride.
Song was used a few episodes back as well.
Lead singer died a year ago.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I don't think many things can come close to Inner Lights awesomeness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmdOSIzsq3Q), this song does come close.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's a great opening!

I also really liked New Challengers opening, listened the crap out of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNnQnLp1Pu0
>> ARTICLE
Great song, the New Challenger is probably my favorite opening.

I just like Inner Light because of this sort of use (Obviously, Spoilers for people who haven't watched the previous seasons)

>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo has always been spot on with their choices of music. Especially in the first season. One of my favorite fights as well!
>> ARTICLE
Damn fucking perfect fit with that song, hope they keep using it.
>> ARTICLE
I really need the soundtrack.....JUST......FUCKING....GIVE IT TO ME!
>> ARTICLE
I thought it would come out the 18th of December.. but its the 22nd of January.. I can't wait.. 
>> ARTICLE
A reasonably large number of the songs that have been in this season were lifted from the old soundtracks.

Which is fine, because those are some of the best tracks I've heard in a sports series.
>> ARTICLE
> Hajime no Ippo ~~New Challenger~~ **Rising**
>> ARTICLE
:/ oh god I don't know how this slipped by me.
>> ARTICLE
>Hajime no Ippo ~~New Chaellenger~~ The fighting! Rising

Because more present-progressive form verbs cannot disappoint.
>> ARTICLE
If this wasn't a double episode, I might have died...There's no way I'd be able to survive waiting a week just to see how that ended.  Please Kamogawa, come up with some method that Ippo can use to train his lower body to endure those stop and go motions.  I just realized...[anime spoiler](/s "Miyata came up with the Jolt counter which can fatally end his boxing career if he's not careful and Ippo's new Dempsey Roll is basically the same.")
>> ARTICLE
Two episodes in one day? Best saturday ever.

The sound of tires screeching as Ippo stops.

That was an amazing fight. Hands down the best fight in the series so far imo. Also I want that insert song so bad. Do we have a name for that song yet?
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched the 2nd episode yet but holy shit Ippo's resolve to win had me at the edge of my seat! Awesome fight!
>> ARTICLE
What are you waiting for! 
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Just watched it and that is about all I can say. Probably my favorite fight so far for Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know how long this season will last? I can't wait for the next fight!
>> ARTICLE
25 episodes for this season.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, we're already half way done.  Hopefully this will be popular enough to make another season, instead of having to wait a few more years.
>> ARTICLE
 The insert song at the end of episode 12 was awesome when Ippo finally evolved the Dempsy roll. Ippo completely slaughtered him at the end of the fight, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
>> ARTICLE
This has the be the worse Ippo has messed up a person in a fight, right?  I mean you could actually see Sawamura's eye was messed up.  I bet Ippo is stronger than most people in a higher weight class.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing they gave us two episodes to finish the fight in one sitting. Hearing Sawamura talk about how tender Ippo was getting did get me hungry to go make a sandwich.
>> ARTICLE
They couldn't have used that insert song at a better moment than they did in ep 12
>> ARTICLE
And here I thought the fights can't get any more epic @o@

SO EPIC, MORE PLEASE!
>> ARTICLE
I had to come here after those episodes. Jeeze! IT WAS AWESOME!
>> ARTICLE
Just through these last few episodes, I finally got a definitive reason why we love our Featherweight King.

His morals. He's like the country-bumpkin hero in a story. He's plain and only has the most plainest of desires. On top of that, it's not simple strength from his fists, it's his honest intentions to have honorable fights and validation of effort that makes us want to do things.

If anything, this show just makes you wanna do stuff because of how hard work, effort, and pure determination seem to pull you through. 

And what makes Makunouchi the lovable country-bumpkin is the fact that he shoulders the responsibility of his title like a fucking champ. He's king, so he takes the responsibility of every opponent he's faced as well as those rising to the top. While he was initially mad at the challenger's disgraceful behavior, he even saw and respected his strength. 


In a line, you just can't hate this kid!
>> ARTICLE
Are the rest of the episodes guuna be the Eagle Vs Takamura bout?

>> ARTICLE
Most likely.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll be the one to say it, but there were many faults with these episodes, not least the clear budget saving that was going on.

I suppose one such element which exemplifies the problems is Takamura with the 'anti anti anti Dempsey Roll'. I felt like perhaps that was an attempt at humour, but it didn't fit with the moment. This show works best when the action kicks in the mood is focused like a laser.

Perhaps it was just Sawamura - I don't really consider him a great opponent and yet it's Ippo's biggest fight (arguably) since Sendo at the end of the original run.

This isn't to say it was bad, but it could have been better.
>> ARTICLE
I like how they aren't holding any punches (pun intended). The setting of post WW2 is a very interesting one which isn't featured much in anime. Seeing the poverty and hardships but also seeing the determination of the people to get back on their feet. I also enjoy how the evolution of boxing (at least in Japan) is shown and how young Kamogawa is depicted to behave very much like Ippo and Takamura 
>> ARTICLE
How old is coach anyway?
>> ARTICLE
Japan surrendered in 1945 and it's said in the episode that they are around 30 at the end of the war so that makes him over 80. But i don't know when exactly the series is set
>> ARTICLE
In the flashback?  I would have to guess in his early to mid twenties.   Since the series takes place in the "mid 1990's" (unofficially...since they it doesn't really list exact years...), I would think the present day Kamogawa would probably be in his 70's or maybe even early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
This episode made me want a serious period drama anime.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if this fit buy Rainbow might be one
>> ARTICLE
Lol you're not alone. After watching the episode, I looked up on myanimelist for the best historical anime but I already watched Baccano :/
>> ARTICLE
Check out [Rainbow](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow). It got me into boxing anime. Its based on juvenile delinquents in post WWII Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
Beware, is depressing as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
You might want to try [Ashita No Joe](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2402/Ashita_no_Joe ).  I think that takes place in the 60's or around that era, and the series tends to be regarded highly by some people.
>> ARTICLE
Pumpkin Scissors is loosely based after WW1.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really happy that we are seeing their past this season. I wonder if they will still show Aoki's new gimmick with his hair haha.
>> ARTICLE
What chapter is this arc in the manga? I FINALLY caught up with this series and I don't feel like waiting anymore.
>> ARTICLE
This arc is suppose to take place after the Takamura vs Hawk fight, which is around Round 399 (or 400).   

If you want to continue reading the series from where the Eagle vs Takamura fight ended, then you might want to read from Round 557 (or 558).

Of course, this season has actually cut quite a few things out to where it is actually worth it to go back and re-read this season.   If you want to do that, then you should start reading at Round 416.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thank you so much.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I should be fitting this question into here but I want to start watching this series should I have watched the other Hajime no Ippo series first?
>> ARTICLE
You could probably watch this season without watching the previous two season (and movies), but you might not understand some things in it like some of the characters in it and there history/back story.    So you won't be able to enjoy it fully, which is why it is better to watch from the beginning.

The watching order for it is:

- 1st Season (76 episodes long)

- Championship Road movie (Ippo vs Sanada fight)

- Kimura Movie/Ova

- 2nd Season (26 episodes long)

- 3rd Season (25 episodes long)

So you got about 127 episodes and two movies worth of content.  Out of that, I think there might be only 2 episodes of "filler" or recap material in it.
>> ARTICLE
 wow

 thanks for this. I just started the original two weeks ago (I'm 28 eps in).



>> ARTICLE
Yea, its a continuation of the past seasons, but I highly recommend you watch them!
>> ARTICLE
I'm really surprised they're seemingly gonna end on this arc. I don't think this is going past 26 right?
>> ARTICLE
This season is only going to be 25 episodes long.  So the present storyline is probably over or "on hold" until the next season comes out in (insert number) of years...   Even though there is still about 44 volumes worth of material out in the manga.   (Eagle vs Takamura fight ends in volume 61, and the current volume out in Japan is volume 105 (almost 106)

The next arc in the story is for [manga spoiler](/s "Itagaki and the start of Rookie King tournament for him.  So stopping at the David Eagle fight for the season makes sense.  Also, some stuff in the Kamogawa/Nekota flash dos get referred to later on in the series too.  So it is understandable for them, them include the flashback.")


>> ARTICLE
I know where the story goes, actually not a big fan of the majority of Ippo's next arc but there's nothing worse than no Ippo.

Was just curious, and kinda surprised, they'd end on this and not drag out the Takamura fight to end the season on that note.

This show won't even be remembered in two years. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just how this goes for a lot of unfinished LN adaptations that aren't standout shows.

Anime adaptation doesnt really reflect its manga. Example, Gate: 
>> ARTICLE
Anime and manga both are adaptation. Gate: is a novel.
>> ARTICLE
Oh TIL.  So, comparing the manga to its novel how far the violence got diluted? 
>> ARTICLE
Violence getting diluted doesn't really detract from the story for me. Spice and Wolf for instance has Holo on her wolf form just running around and people fall to the ground just because when they're in the sewers. On the LN, a lot of people got ravaged on that scene.

I mean, that rarely ever affects the story, so why bother?
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime

lmao

I know, but still, someone CAN actually be so addicted to the manga to go the stretch and say it'll be good no matter what... right? I mean, if they announced a season 3 for S&W it probably would be an auto-include on my 10 list because of the content of the LN :D.

I'm actually surprised Hunter x Hunter is second on this list, especially when it lost to Spice and Wolf in the Best Anime bracket. I feel like it's always mentioned on this sub but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
> but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 

Really? People talk about CA like it was the pinnacle of fiction.
>> ARTICLE
I meant it doesn't have a huge circle-jerk going for it to the point where it dominates every bracket.

And I've never seen the CA arc brought up without a mixture of praise and criticism. 
>> ARTICLE
Its kind of the same with Steins;Gate and FMA:B, I don't think that people rave on about it too much because they are very secure that they are regarded as good shows, they don't need to convince other people that it is a good show just to reaffirm their belief. I fucking loved HxH, but I anit gonna preach the shit out of it and put people off, not what I want to do at all.
>> ARTICLE
This is what initially turned me off of HxH, that and the episode count.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everyone who watches it ends up loving it, but a lot of people are turned off the either its length, art style, or beginning that make it seem like it's an anime for kids. It is pretty damn hyped in the comment sections, but that's simply not enough to boost it above other really popular anime with broader appeal in contests that have thousands of voters.
>> ARTICLE
It was a 9/10 for me... until the ant arc. The change in tone, ridiculously slow pacing, overpowered (dues ex machine) enemies ruined it for me. It took like 40 episodes for anything to happen and once it started it was so over narrated and over explained ever little detail. Until that point everyone  was strong because they trained and earn their power. The ants also felt so cartoony and out of place in what had been a dark Shonen. The mc's anger felt so forced and blown out of proportion.

/end rant 

Edit:Downvote isnt a disagree button. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with everything you say lol. A lot of people think the ant arc was the best.
>> ARTICLE
There's many that considers it the best arc of any shounen.
>> ARTICLE
did you watch the show while it was airing or after it finished?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after it was finished and thought the ant arc was the best by far, albeit it started off rather slow.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched it while it was airing, you would realize how bad and slow the pacing was. They basically copy pasted the manga, they showed whats going on, AND the narrator explained it. Which imo is bad in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Animes are much better when you can binge watch them though, chimera ant arc might have been really slow when it was airing but it would have had an extremely different feeling if you had been able to see everything at once, I was watching 40 episodes a day so this made it definitely one of the best arcs of any shounen to me.
>> ARTICLE
that's my point, many people ignore the terrible pacing of shows because they binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't the majority of anime created to promote the source material anyway? I'm also sure a good portion of the people that watched it (including me) didn't even touch the manga so it was a new experience to them. As far as the pacing, I already admitted that I also thought it was pretty slow, but the second half more than makes up for it imo.
>> ARTICLE
the second half is where it was slowest, 6 episodes for 3 minutes. Also that isn't an excuse to have godawful pacing, they promoted the manga by completely ending the show in a satisfying way so for the people that want more, they need to read the manga (even though there isn't much material).
>> ARTICLE
When it was finishes, and i'm used to shounen pacing. I loved it from the first episode as i knew it was going to be an epic journey. I'm glad they did it after the manga, that's the only way anime should be done.
>> ARTICLE
which "dues ex machine" are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
The people who comment on shit are different from the people who'd upvote shit. People who've watched HxH will have very strong opinions about it
>> ARTICLE
This is true. There are >300,000 subscribers here, but I'd say there's only around 500-1000 of us that regularly comment. What we tend to think of as "the /r/anime community" is only a tiny sliver of it. This is also a big part of the reason you'll see a tremendous outpouring of love for certain characters in the contests' comment sections only to have them get absolutely mutilated in the results.

Darker than Black 66... what the fuck guys.
>> ARTICLE
that's much cleaner. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda of curious on what makes Steins;Gate that good. I finished it last week and it was really good, but I feel it's a bit overrated. Maybe I was a bit overhyped on how it was going to end, but the ending left me kinda underwhelmed. Intro and outro songs are really awesome, I like the lyric change at the final two episodes and what the lyrics of the intro have to say, real interesting and ties in well with the story. 
>> ARTICLE
 Steins;Gate has various elements/genre in it, the characters aren't all that interesting but the amount of human emotions mixed in, all the feels, driving each one to their own desires, characters development. I'm assuming that you have watched both the OVAs and the movie, you would only not like it if you don't understand jack shit. I personally don't find anything lacking in Steins;Gate. 

But yeah overhyping it might be a factor, when does the real thing meets your expectation when you overhype, really?

ANWS DONT YOU FEEL THE PAIN OKABE IS GOING THROUGH


>> ARTICLE
Tu... tu... ruu
>> ARTICLE
I'm not talking about /r/anime folks but the general Steins;Gate audience: If you think from the perspective of a random adult you'd run into on the street in the Western world, Steins;Gate is the only show they might like out of the top 10 shows. The other 9 are extreme levels of "okay wtf am I watching?" to those outside of fantasy/fiction/anime culture.

For that specific non-anime audience, it would be a toss up between Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note. Steins;Gate would win the popularity contest because the other two are older series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat. I recently watched, too. And enjoyed but overall ranking in mine is not so high. I also wonder what makes it to the top. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Steins;Gate is a lot better when it's the first anime you've seen because it's more accessible to a western audience. It was the first anime I ever saw and I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread; I recently *rewatched* it a year after being introduced to anime and whilst I still thought it was great, it wasn't as incredible as I remembered it being.

Yep, and I did this anyway since the results could be different due to that one being a head-to-head tournament kinda thing and this just being raw favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It's nice seeing Higurashi, Mawaru Penguindrum and Great Teacher Onizuka on this list. Looks like r/anime's taste isn't so bad after all. 

How many votes did each of the Fate series get individually OP?

>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure, I was too far into it before realizing I should have kept track of them individually. I think it was about 40% F/Zero, 30% UBW and 30% F/SN
>> ARTICLE
>30% F/SN

That doesn't seem right... Maybe it would get like 5% vote if we were just talking about favorite in the Fate series, but favorite anime, on /r/anime? Nah, no way man.

EDIT: Okay i've decided to count up all of the Fate votes using Ctrl f.

Fate/Zero - 54 (I searched for "Fate/Zero" and "Fate Zero" and "F/Z")

Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works - 14 (I searched for UBW, Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay Night and Fate Stay Night)

Fate/Stay Night - 2 (Although one didn't specify if UBW or DEEN.) and (I searched for Fate/Stay Night and DEEN)

There was also one vote that said "Fate Zero/sn" so I don't know who to give that to...
>> ARTICLE
Well at least I knew zero was more popular than the others :P haha

Because it's by far the best.

Also the fights in Prisma illya>>> Fate/zero Batcave and Unlimited flashy works final fight. Ufotable can learn from Silver Link.

But don't people usually say the popular stuff is shit, like sao or naruto? So shouldn't that mean that fate/zero is actually the worst, because it's so popular?

popular irl =/= popular on r/anime

Just occasionally something becomes popular because it is actually good. And it's not as if fate/zero is mainstream.

It still made the top 100. There are thousands of anime out there, so that's really good.

Huh, I've only completed 3 out of the Top 10, but basically watched everything from 18 to 36. Interesting, but if I had to make a guess it's because the top one's tend to be quite long.

I don't see how Steins;Gate can be considered #1. It's great but it has serious flaws. There are much better anime ranked way lower on this list (Madoka, Tatami Galaxy, Mawaru Penguindrum).

You'll be able to dig out flaws in every show if you look for them, and besides, when has a list like that ever been more than a popularity contest, anyway? It's not as though anyone's claiming that Steins;Gate's a flawless masterpiece.

maybe a lot of people had it on 3?

Yes, steins;gate was more commonly 2 or 3 than 1
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the list would be more accurate if you had counted 1) thrice and 2) twice.

That would have been a lot of work though :O
>> ARTICLE
A weighted system, like CFB AP/BCS rankings instead of just a "mentions" poll. 
>> ARTICLE
That's subjective. I enjoyed the show a lot and loved the characters, and imo the pacing was good for me. I liked it more than Madoka, and Mawaru. No one's claiming it's flawless, but that it's a fantastic show (I mean it's #2 on MAL).

That feeling when the top 3 are in you're too 5 (or will be when I see the last few episodes of HxH)

Firstly, nice work in compiling the data together (manually, I assume?)

In terms of feedback, I have two things: one, when reporting the results, identically numbered items should be tied in rank with each other. So instead of having the shows with count of 4 being ranked 76-91, they all would be ranked as 76th (or 76th-91st if you want to be technical about it.  
Second, I think that a weighting system would be more ideal for doing tiebreakers if you wanted to bother (but then you would have to list those results to show why they ended up separated in rank).  
So the "sort order" if you will, would be Total Count > 1sts > 2nds > 3rds. Rank by Total Count, if group tie, rank within group by 1sts, and so on. I know it's a quite a bit more work for the all of the inevitable ties, but more transparency ~~will muffle the salty /r/anime users~~ is always awesome.

I started counting by people's first second and third favorites but it took too long and lots people said like "here's my top 3 in no order" so I stopped

what i find funny is that the 1st ep of hxh and steins were pretty boring but the shows turned out so well
>> ARTICLE
People are usually responsive with great fervor when others bring it up but I can't help but ask:

What's so good about Steins;gate? I watched it and it was good; I rated it 8/10. But it really wasn't anything above that for me. 

The drama (character death(s) or separations) did not give me a suspension of disbelief, meaning the writing behind it wasn't the best. I'll explain what I mean: in the best works of fiction, the setting and characters are presented in a way that can get the viewer invested in the events of the series despite being aware it's fiction. Like in Hunter x Hunter, Meruem and Komugi; or in Anohana, most characters. I won't spoil them, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you've watched. I never felt like I cared about the character(s) dying or being separated from Okabe in Steins;gate.

Speaking of characters in Steins;gate, they are interesting to the point where they are **not** a bore to watch. That's fine if the goal is to be just a decent anime. But they really weren't anything deeper than that. The character development was more about their individual circumstances, and less about how it affected their mentality, as I would have liked. For example, the unfortunate distancing between Feyris and her father. Sure that's kind of sad, but we don't see how it affects her character by having that problem. She's the same with and without the circumstances. Maybe she's good at hiding her sadness via a facade, but at least give the viewer an idea of what ways it affects Feyris's mentality. A great example of such a thing being done correctly is from Hunter Hunter: the childhood flashback of Gyro (the NGL king/druglord) and his alcoholic father. You're clearly shown what kind of devoted child Gyro was, and the events that made him change to who he is. This is just a side character and Togashi gave him such a powerful backstory. Netero's training in the mountains for his change was also superb. An argument against this is, Steins;gate was too short-running to develop its characters much. Then you can compare it to Cowboy Bebop or even Toradora, both of which give a lot of emphasis to why characters became how they are.

I have issues with the plot, although those complaints are more subjective than the above (I was annoyed that Okabe spent the entire "death repeat" arc learning there are consequences messing with time, only to be able to change the past as he pleases in the end with **no** consequence; what was the point of his learning then?!) . Some people may prefer a happy ending at the expense of abandoned development, so I can't criticize the anime on that part.

Overall the show was enjoyable, but I'm very confused how people treat it as a masterpiece. People imply it's a very cerebral show, like western television's The Affair or Mr Robot, but it's really not. It's a show on the level of things like Code Geass or Afro Samurai. It's a fun watch for many people, but none of the plot or characters are anything beyond that. 


>> ARTICLE
I find it odd you mention Feyris. The effects on her mental state are very clear. [spoilers](#s "The change from the loss of her father literally warps Tokyo. She loses herself to the moe because she has no other way to escape the guilt. It is not until her interaction with Okabe that she is ever able to accept it and move on.") Mind you, they don't explicitly spell this out for you. It is what you infer from her actions and the affect on the environment.

What it sounds like is you just don't like the characters. That is the common breaking point when people don't like the show as much. People who love the show are also the ones who adore the characters. This is personal preference more than anything. I watched a lot of Hunter x Hunter and I never got invested in the characters. But I didn't like them much in the first place, so it colors my opinion. Same thing, different show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really care about Steins;Gate characters at all, I rated it 9/10 for the excellent and original plot. Maybe if you think about Steins;Gate as a pure sci-fi show, it would be much more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is my top anime, I disagree that the characters need to be deeper than they were in the show. To me I really like smaller scale stores that are about the characters in circumstances, this is what makes the show shine to me. The amount of anime that just scale out of proportion compared to the start, or even from the beginning, cause me to lose interest. Love the characters, well thought out plot, for me it was well paced and held my attention. Further on wanting deeper characters, a lot of people like how they don't all just have some dramatic backstory that shaped who they are but are just friends only just finished school.

I don't know what could be number one that would make everyone happy because no show is perfect, I don't think all the people who have it at number 1 think of it as a masterpiece just their favorite show. What show would you even call a masterpiece and expect people to agree with? Do you expect everyone to like something more than just the enjoyment they have from watching it? 

I think maybe your just expecting the number 1 for most people to be more than just the show they most enjoy, and expect the audience to want more than just enjoyment of a show. A lot of people just enjoyed watching it the most and don't care about appreciating some show because its a classic, or has some deeper level to it.

Is HxH really that good? It's on my plan to watch but ep count kind of makes me put it off every time I check to see what to watch next.

Does it have fillers and meaningless episodes like other long, fighting anime or is it more like FMA where every episode has meaning to it?
>> ARTICLE
HxH doesn't have any filler (except for 2 recap episode, 13 and 26 I believe) and you should skip those. It's praised mostly because it breaks the shounen mold of bullshit powerups and other things.

It's way less about the fights and has a really good story (especially the chimera ant arc), but the fights are still great and well animated anyway.

Just don't go into it with too high of expectations because it'll ruin it (along with literally any other show ever, assumptions ruin things).

>> ARTICLE
We actually already had a [contest for this](http://animebracket.com/results/-r-anime-s-favourite-anime-of-all-time/?group=finals)
>> ARTICLE
The results for that were utterly different from this though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it also included a larger amount of people which would explain why it was different.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that is how it works. The sample size is large enough to consider it a reasonably accurate.

Brackets operate differently to just straight up voting for your favourite anime, HxH didn't do so well in the brackets, but is no.2 over here. Brackets are more 'do you like anime A or anime B more?', people that may like anime A may REALLY like it, but people that like anime B more may just, *kind of* like it, while this is a straight up, what is your favourite.

A good example is AoT, ranks 33 on this list, but it beat out Toradora in the contest whilst Toradora ranks 20 on this list. Admitedly, results come out simular, but they are taking different types of data here.

edit: Too simplify it, this is taking a tally of how many people consider each anime their favourite anime.

Anime bracket did a vote of how many people liked anime A over anime B, not what was their favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not a good argument, simply because of how the brackets are organized. The way it works is that the entries with the highest seeds go against the entires with the lowest seeds first. Meaning the ones who were voted in more, go against the ones who were voted in the least.

Besides, we can just look at the seeding for each show either way to nullify that argument.

1. Steins;Gate

2. FMA:B

3. Code Geass

4. FMA

5. Gurren Lagann

6. Fate/Zero

7. Toradora 

8. NGE

9. Kill la Kill

10. AoT

Considering the contest had a larger amount of people, rather than just regulars of /r/anime I believe the contest more. The problem with the OP's list is that its literally just people giving their top 3, and a lot of the time it wasn't even just that, they would list their top 10. Shows like Toradora and Hunter x Hunter have proved time and time again that their audience is just a vocal minority, in the contests they always get knocked out and aren't seeded as high as you would believe on /r/anime. However, shows like Steins;Gate, FMA:B and Monogatari have consistently gotten to the top in every type of contest with a large amount of people here. Then you have shows like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z which have fanbases larger than you would imagine, given how poorly /r/anime will talk about them sometimes.

Though keep in mind i'm not saying that contest voting is the best way to gauge what a group of people think is the best, but I believe its more accurate than the way OP tallied up the votes- no offense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just pointing out this is a different type of Data that has been collected here. 

If you had to answer what was r/anime's favourite anime, then the bracket would probably be your best bet, it is a mash up of everyone's opinion from r/anime.

If you had to answer what is the most common anime people consider their favourite anime on r/anime, this 'tally' would be more accurate. This is a different, there is no better or worse system between the two.
>> ARTICLE
My top two are the exact same as r/anime in the same order, I must have good taste.

Clannad? Wait what? I hear NOTHING but how much people hate that show, but it's top 10?

Often enough since I still haven't see so many anime. Right now its probably FMA, but it was Baccano, which is still up there. I try not to have a specific number 1, just 5 or so shows that I love above all else. Right this second those are probably FMAB, JJBA 2012, TTGL, Berserk, and Baccano.

Baccano is my #2. Right behind FMA:B. I wish Baccano was watched more. It really is just a fantastic show.

I only have 1 anime I rated a 10, and I won't lie I am largely bias to the Fate/ Series. So to even consider another to be anywhere close to it it would have to be extremely good. I'm not saying that there isn't anything as good as Fate/Zero, of course there is, but to me it would have to be so good, that it surpasses my bias.

 So I haven't had a change in my #1 for a long time, although if Ufotable does a worthy adaptation of the second half of UBW then I will probably finally change my #1.
>> ARTICLE
Saber is love. Saber is life.

Ufotable would have to diverge from the VN alottttt for UBW to top Fate/Zero IMO. Out of the two's source material I prefer Fate/Zero way more than Stay Night.

Fate /zero is my #1 also and I feel like the only thing that has potential to top it is the HF film(s).

The combination of nostalgia and an untold number of re-watches will never knock down NGE from #1. The real question is when does your #2 anime change.

I started watching anime somewhere in august 2014.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean it as an insult of that's how ya took it. I've just never seen someone have klk as their top. Welcome to the wonderful world of anime :D
>> ARTICLE
Only 10/10s are fma:B and kill la kill for me. Over 100 series watched *shrug*
>> ARTICLE
I do as well and from a critical standpoint KLK had a lot of flaws, I'd point them out but OneChan does a decent job. As a whole I enjoyed KLK and is one of my favorite animes of that year but overall it still doesn't compare to other animes that I've rated a 10, in my opinion, so putting it up there along with them would be an insult. Right after watching the series I thought it was a 9/10 but looking back on it now and reading more about other peoples opinions I would give it an 8 or and 8.5. Still a good anime but very, very far from my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
I've rated FMA:B a 10 as well, from an objective point of view it does well at a plethora of genres within the single show while not particularly excelling or being the best at one. Subjectively it isn't my favorite show for the same reason, while I do enjoy the show and think it's one of the best gate-way animes, as well as being an anime, veterans could enjoy as well it doesn't have that particular impact that Steins;Gate, Shinsekai Yori, Toradora, or Nodame Cantabile would in the sense that they hit their mark on the genre out of the ballpark. Kill la Kill however definitely has it's flaws whether it's from pacing through unnecessary arcs and fillers, or sometimes attempt at cutting budget i.e scenes that lacked animation in general (which to be honest it didn't bother me at all so I didn't base my scoring on it.) I enjoyed the early four episode ride, Elite 4 arc, and the end was alright as well, but KLK got an 8 from me and it might have a bias boosted score due to being made by Trigger.

At the end of the day scores will always be an subjective thing, but I made this input with the intent to say that shows that you started off with or shows that enlightened you to the medium will always hold a special place in your heart. Even I have a show that probably isn't considered a 10 by many, or hell most of the people now probably haven't even watched it (Tenchi Muyo OVA) will never know how much impact it had back then when the only source of anime at the time was VHS, and on top of that finding an Anime with such great characters, plot, and elements that would eventually make stepping stones for future animes. So regardless of how many series you've watched I still think with every passing series you do indulge in your taste will mold differently depending on the circumstances of order and emotional/personal significance it imparts on you at the time whether through relativity or the like. Over 500 series watched *shrug*

Yeah, been having a great  time so far.

Almost never. I've had the same number one anime for nearly seven years. And my previous number one held for about two years. Hell, my top five hasn't changed in the past five years.
>> ARTICLE
Mine hasn't changed since I started thinking of what my number one anime is, and I don't see it changing.
>> ARTICLE
Never. A few spots have changed in my top 5, but not my #1.
>> ARTICLE
It changes a bunch in the beginning, but once you have a good amount of watched series under your belt, your #1 should hold for awhile. Silver Spoon has been my #1 since June(?)
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much never. GTO is king of Anime. Though if I'm being fair, it's really tied with my top 20 or so and I could easily swap it around.
>> ARTICLE
My #1 anime changes pretty often. My top five series are Zetsuen no Tempest, Steins;Gate, Kokoro Connect, Katanagatari, and Bakemonogatari. I couldn't decide which of the five are my favorite so I just pick one at random. Today, I would say my favorite is Katanagatari. If you ask me tomorrow it might be one of the other four.
>> ARTICLE
can I ask what you find compelling about katanagatari? because I thought it made little sense, lacked interesting characters and was really boring. and the fight scenes were very meh.
>> ARTICLE
I would have agreed with you on most of those points if the last episode didn't exist. I thought the main character being so uninteresting and watching him interact with characters with at the very least interesting personalities was enough compensation for the lack of his personality. I thought Togame was funny and her true purpose kept me interested the entire time.

The fight scenes were a bit on the tame side from 1-11 because of the inherent limitation due to the nature of their mission, but the amount of badass that explodes throughout episode 12 made up for the less exciting fighting in previous episodes.

The story they set out to tell is finished, the resolution/explanation of the why it all happened may not be the most obvious or straightforward but I understood enough for the ending to be satisfying.

Now where the show truly shines in my opinion is art and dialogue. The character designs are all completely beautiful and unique. The eyes in this show are more interesting and quite a bit more beautiful than in most other series. The other thing is the dialogue. Shichika is pretty dull, but it's his dull, candid behavior that makes him so interesting to see interact with other characters. I've enjoyed the banter between Togame and him from the beginning, but I've enjoyed his discussions with those whom he eventually fights even more so. 

Overall I'd say the reason it's a contender for my #1 position is because it's one of the few series where I'm completely satisfied with how it ends. All of the other things are great, but nothing will make me love a series more than a fantastic ending that leaves me satisfied.
>> ARTICLE
smh. plebs. katanagatari was great.

Edit: Sorry, first reply is a pleb
>> ARTICLE
I guess I should have clarified that I never finished it. I think I made it to ep 8 or 9 and dropped it (which I never do for anime). I don't understand why people like the art and dialogue so much I mean the art is pretty standard and the dialogue is plain boring. is a satisfying ending worth trekking through  a pretty bland overall show?

>> ARTICLE
It never changes. I just happened to have many #1s!
>> ARTICLE
It's changed a few times over the years. Way back in the day *I believe* Naruto was my #1 when there was only a handful of series I'd seen. I know for a time it was Getbackers, and then sometime later it was Hunter x Hunter. 

Right now I don't really have a #1 as it'd be a tie between Gintama and One Piece. I could arbitrarily pick one but my answer would just depend on when you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
The first anime I ever considered a true favorite was Code Geass. It stayed there for years until I finally watched Clannad. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really have a #1. Maybe back when I had only seen a handful of a shows I could rank them more easily. Honestly with any medium (art, music, books, movies, etc. all included) once I reach a certain threshold I don't really have a favorite work. Instead I tend to categorize and have favorites within those categories. The categories themselves may be odd or nonsensical and usually involve what I feel like watching.

Some examples would be:

Favorite action shounen: *Samurai Champloo*  
" sci-fi drama (epic): *Legend of the Galactic Heroes*  
" sci-fi drama (episodic): *Cowboy Bebop*  
" romcom: *Toradora!*  
" slice of life josei: *Usagi Drop*  
" romance drama: *White Album 2*

...etc., etc.

These favorites are occasionally replaced when I find a worthy show, but it is quite rare. Maybe one show gets dethroned each year?

The first anime I ever watched was The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

To this day, my favorite anime is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

My first favorite was Bakemonogatari which I was for the first time last year and since then it has only changed once to Monogatari SS during Summer.
>> ARTICLE
Why do people think of them as different entities? Like, if someone asked your favorite anime, you wouldn't say Spice and Wolf S2, you'd just say Spice and Wolf. Why is Bake different? It's all one cohesive experience.
>> ARTICLE
Your post is dumb and 6 upvotes really shows how mindless this sub is. 

If this was about a more obvious show like Clannad or Darker than Black, you'd get downvoted to hell.

Spice and Wolf seasons are one of the rare examples that feel the same and are both equally good, but for most shows that isn't the case. Monogatari included.

Just because the name is the same, doesn't mean it is the same. Imagine thinking otherwise, what the fuck? 

Excluding god tier fanservice, I don't even like the rest of monogatari besides Bake and most of SS. 

It's not one huge overarching story that would give you a reason to think of it as one entity, and both visuals, OST, characters changed(either by adding new or changing the old) as the series progressed.
>> ARTICLE
>Your post is dumb 

I'm excited to read this already.

>and 6 upvotes really shows how mindless this sub is. 

Fantastic 

>Spice and Wolf seasons are one of the rare examples that feel the same and are both equally good, but for most shows that isn't the case. Monogatari included.

I'd say most of Monotagari feels the same, and even if it didn't, its all heading to the same place anyways. Plus there's such incredible fluctuation in tone and perspective in a single Monotagri episode, that nitpicking the differences between seasons is just as pointless.

>Just because the name is the same, doesn't mean it is the same. Imagine thinking otherwise, what the fuck? 

They are the same? Just more arcs to Arararararagi and Companies story. Wether or not they are different in tone or not is meaningless as its part of the same outer story.

>Excluding god tier fanservice, I don't even like the rest of monogatari besides Bake and most of SS. 

Ok? Just because you don't like the direction they took with some of the side arcs, which are in my opinion, the best, doesn't make your opinion right.

>It's not one huge overarching story that you have to think of it as one entity, and both visuals, OST, characters changed as the series progressed.

All these things changed during episodes? What are you even talking about, yes the art was different in Neko, but there was an enitre arc done on wall scroll during SS. You're making a pointless distinction.


Everything is constructed with the next item in mind. The whole thing was thematically constructed as a linear experience, and making distinctions by air date seems counterproductive to what is essentially an elaborately decorated coming of age story.
>> ARTICLE
> Ok? Just because you don;t like the direction they took with some of the side arcs, which are in my opinion, the best

And good job contradicting with your original statement where you said it's all the same entity.

>doesn't make your opinion right.

Never stated that once, I am even defending the person that has different opinion than me.

You're just putting words in my mouth because your reasoning is extremely flawed.

>All these things changed during episodes?

What? I said they changed as the series progressed.

Example: remember how the often combined real life images with the visuals in Bake? That doesn't happen anymore.

EDIT now that I woke up after writing these posts at 3AM and rereading everything, besides insulting in my original post, everything I said is completely valid. He DID answer his own question with his reply("what makes seasons different?" -> "I like that season the best"), accused me of something I never said and was saying pointless stuff, not deserving upvotes while MPOph's post that explained it further didn't get shit, this sub really is mindless.
>> ARTICLE
The term arcs, and series are different things.

>>Never stated that once, I am even defending the person that has different opinion than me.

>You're just putting words in my mouth because your reasoning is extremely flawed.

You said, they are different in art, sound, etc... My point was that you're making a pointless distinction and writing them off the main arc because you dislike them, an unfair assumption, but I don't really attack arguments that call me dumb right off the bat, very seriously.
>> ARTICLE
> The term arcs, and series are different things.

Exactly, and I used both of them correctly.

Series =/= episodes

>You said, they are different in art, sound, etc... My point was that you're making a pointless distinction and writing them off the main arc because you dislike them

I am not "writing them off", I said I didn't like them. 

I like Bake and SS and I prefer Bake. Simple as that

All of the arcs in every season have conclusions, there's no "main arc" either.

>but I don't really attack arguments that call me dumb right off the bat, very seriously.

Nice backpedaling

>> ARTICLE
>Exactly, and I used both of them correctly.

What are you even talking about man? Seriosuly, what argument is this sentence presenting? Are you saying I used the words incorrectly, are you genuinely saying you haven't? Because you've never said the word arc.

>Nice backpedaling

But I was being serious, I genuinely starting thinking of your response as a shit post the second you got so hostile over something so meaningless, I'm still thinking this, this whole thing is bizarrely aggressive. I think of Monotagari as a bunch of connected arcs, that can be seen as one entity, you've done nothing to refute this, you've just been pedantic.

Editing after you've posted is it just confusing for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
>over something so meaningless

>you've done nothing to refute this, you've just been pedantic.

Not only you're ironic, but you constantly make up what has been said to make yourself look like you're not in the wrong, ignoring literally every word I said.

Also learn what backpedaling means because that's what you're doing.
>> ARTICLE
I know what backpedaling is, I'm literally saying it was an unfair assumption, and I was treating you as a shitposter, so I admit I was wrong there, I still think of Bake as a series of interconnected arcs like Natsume, or Mushishi, and again you haven't really argued this.

>Not only you're ironic, but you constantly change what has been said to make yourself look like you're not in the wrong, ignoring literally every word I said.

Not ignoring, just arguing what I think is relevant to the discussion, I'm not gonna respond to every sentence, I don't really have time for that. I'm not gonna sit here and argue over minutiae.

>> ARTICLE
> writing them off the main arc

No, he's considering them to be separate entities. What about shows that have very bad sequels? They sequel doesn't automatically undermine the legacy of the original.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, but the distinction I was originally making was between Bake and SS, which is just a straight continuation. In movies and books it's an understandable seperation, but people don;t talk that way about tv series or anime. We talk about the complete series.
>> ARTICLE
Continuity doesn't matter, though. There are the cases where the sequel are far beneath the original. Perhaps it was a cash grab or a different studio picked it up. Regardless of the reason, the quality of the franchise isn't additive, making it an average show. Instead, you can make the distinction that season 1 was amazing while 2 was lackluster. And why shouldn't you be able to do so? It's done all the time, and the example that comes to mind is Gunslinger Girl.

>We talk about the complete series.

No, we don't. You're just extrapolating your own opinion. Have never heard of a TV show getting worse after a certain season when the original writers or actors left?

Seeing as how I'd be hard pressed to pick an absolute Number One Favorite Anime Of All Time, I'd say that it never happens. If you put a gun to my head and tell me I have exactly two minutes to say absolutely what my favorite anime of all time is or you'll blow my brains out, then you're going to have a brand-new absurdist art piece on a nearby wall exactly 121 seconds later. Cut it out, frame it, and call it "Indecisiveness" or something and it could probably be hanging on the walls of the Met before the year is out.

Instead, I have a category of absolute favorites. I might add something to the category every so often, but nothing gets taken off of the top shelf forever.

2003 was when I first discovered **FLCL** and I didn't really have a favorite series before that; I'd only started watching anime in 2001 or 2002 and just sort of watched whatever Adult Swim had on offer.

FLCL stayed firmly as my favorite until I saw all of **Eureka Seven** in 2007 or 2008.  E7's complex mix of detailed characters and setting really pulled me in, and I think it's a truly under-recognized masterpiece for how well it intertwines all of its different themes and elements.  You could easily pull one or two main characters out of the series and the world that's left still *works* -- there would still be several complete stories and the game's lore and universe still holds together.  That's kind of a rare thing in fiction.

Most recently, I'm torn.  After not seeing many new series for a while, I impulse-purchased a ton of anime and binged my way through it whenever I could starting late last year.  A lot of it was okay, and some of it was bad or just not my cup of tea, but some true gems stood out and now I'm not entirely sure I have a favorite and longer.

My two front-runners are **Spice & Wolf** and **Steins;Gate**.  Which one I prefer kind of depends on my mood as the two series both offer very different things to me as a viewer.

I love S;G for its comedy elements, its pacing, and its over-all plot.  It tells a solid, complete story from start to finish without ever wearing out its welcome while still sprinkling in a lot of smaller independent moments and elements.  Being primarily about time travel, the series also lends itself well to a rewatch, as many smart choices were made throughout the series to reward a second viewing.

Conversely, I love S&W for its fantastic character writing, acting, and presentation.  Holo is one of the most subtly deep, nuanced female leads I've seen or read in anything, and the banter between her and Lawrence is perfect so frequently that I'm pretty sure the show is the product of sorcery... or a bargain with a pagan deity.  The period-appropriate soundtrack is also a plus.  Unfortunately, the general lack of over-all plot (because *so much source material was left untapped for the anime seasons 1 & 2*) prevents this series from simply becoming my stand-out favorite.

Finally, I have to give an honorable mention to dark-horse **Highschool DxD**.  Underneath all of the (mostly entirely illogical *and* unnecessary) fanservice, there are several things to appreciate, if you have a taste for them:

* The (mostly crass) comedy is extremely well-written and actually had me laughing out loud on several occasions.
* The animation is generally well-done.
* Fight scenes are satisfying and detailed without being too visually busy.
* The fights themselves are gloriously self aware (I always love when someone gets impaled when they stop to monologue mid-combat) and retain much of the show's style of comedy.
* Surprisingly for a harem show that could easily be described as softcore porn, there's a genuinely sweet and sincere love story buried at the core.

It's not going to win any awards and will likely turn off a lot of viewers within the first 5 minutes, but DxD is extremely well put-together for what it is, and has a lot more to offer than just copious amounts of boobs.

And shit, nostalgia seeing Vorg again, this series has too many bros in it

I think the "unofficial" time line for Hajime No Ippo is suppose to be the 90's where VCR were still popular.  Even if series never lists it, or gives exact dates.  Most fight posters in the manga usually list the years as 199X.  

I think the popular belief is that this current fight is suppose to take place in 1995, where Ippo's been boxing for 5 years at this point.  It just goes to show how old this series is since it was started in 1989.  
>> ARTICLE
And then on the eve of 199X, when Ippo fights for the world title, the world ends, and its up to ippo to defend his title vs Kenshiro, right?

* Hajime no Ippo: Champion Road (Movie)
* Hajime no Ippo: Mashiba vs. Kimura (Movie)
* Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger (TV, 26 eps)

Based on oh-so reliable MAL recs, here's two series that are somewhat similar: [Kenichi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1559/Historys_Strongest_Disciple_Kenichi) and [Eyeshield 21](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15/Eyeshield_21).

I'm mildly upset they cut out the stuff before the fight, which made the end and the bottom of the sea talk less impacting. Also I feel like he smashed the Dempsey twice in the manga then went down in the same fashion. 
>> ARTICLE
As long as it's not a recurring thing, I'm fine with how they cut things out at the beginning of this fight. I feel like it jumped right into some of the action to draw in new viewers. After all the last season was 4 years ago, and the first season started over a decade ago. 

That being said, I hope they keep in the exposition stuff they normally do for the future episodes. There was definitely good characterization for the fighter in 2 episodes, but I can only imagine what the pre-fight stuff was like for this one.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, there was quite a bit. He talked to the guy a few times. The background of ippo's dad was introduced different and before the fight. More development of their friendship, and how they were men of the sea.

I feel sorry to those that haven't read the manga, and are watching Rising. Hopefully the enthusiasm they get from the show translates to an increase of readers (c'mon who wouldn't feel compelled to delve into the source material for more Ippo).

I can understand what you're saying... But for me i don't like reading manga... I feel it's dull to read manga in general. It's my own personal opinion, but i'd rather see those characters in manga animated and brought to life than to read them in manga, since manga characters for me just feel lifeless compared to anime which are two different mediums, but you get what i mean.
>> ARTICLE
You do realize that the manga is the original art form of this series and also the one true experience of the story, right?

It's called an anime ADAPTATION for a reason and although anime is great, it will never the substitute the great and the original experience that is reading Hajime no Ippo in manga version.


>> ARTICLE
I don't get what you mean. I can get as motivated and emotional from reading a manga as I can from watching an anime. What I'm saying is that both mediums are full of life, because I'm not simply just "reading" or "watching" I'm immersing myself into that medium. It's kind of like reading a book, and animating it in your mind.
>> ARTICLE
Yes but when you're reading a book you use your imagination to create the settings and how everything looks. With manga it's already setup for you there, and sort of loses its charm compared to reading books. Anyway it's a personal opinion. I know a lot of people who like reading manga, and a lot who don't. It's just a matter of opinion :)

I pretty much share the same traits -- I just cannot get interested with reading an action series regardless of how well drawn or presented it is.  Call it lack of imagination or whatever, but almost any other genre for me is fine for me when it comes to manga.

Here are my thoughts on it:

- A lot of great action in it.  

- New announcer takes some getting used to it.  A lot of people seem to hate him.  (I guess this is the biggest complaint I have read about the new season...)   
- Also seems like the announcer had a lot of lines this episode.  I don't remember the announcer speaking a lot in past fights.   Maybe they are trying to get a "real fight" feel to it that you see on TV.

- Not really happy that Ippo won due in part to a lucky punch (or Ultimate Punch for the manga-reader).   Makes it seem odd, that out of no where Ippo is able to throw that to turn the match around, when his previous strong punches had no effect...  Sigh.   

Anyway, over all I liked the episode.  The pacing was okay, and issue I had with the first episode.   Next episode will show us the pacing will be slow or fast with Aoki's title fight coming up.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't he save energy and then get motivated by the crowed? Motivation is a hell of a drug.
>> ARTICLE
I think the motivation was more for Ippo to "survive at the bottom of the sea" than help with his punches power.   The anime didn't really explain the whole "Sea man battle" that was going on for this fight.
>> ARTICLE
It was just his basics. In the manga, during a practice, ippo hears a crack and was shocked. It was a perfect punch, thrown with proper technique. It happens again in the fight( that's why they hyped up his form looking like he was hitting mitts). 

I hope all of the fights aren't this rushed. If you haven't, please read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I miss the old Announcer, I hope he makes a return at some point as he's also being animated differently.

Also, with it being such a fast pace they didn't really explain the special punch all that well. However, the concept pops up in the future (though I don't know if they'll get that far in the Anime).
>> ARTICLE
The "Ultimate Punch" was a one time thing in the manga, where Ippo is able to throw it twice.  One to explain the punch prior to the fight, and during this fight.    I wouldn't mind the punch so much, if Morikawa decided to use it again to show it wasn't a one hit wonder in order for Ippo to win.

I think the punch you might be referring to is Tekken (or Iron Fist) that is introduced in the Kamogawa flashback arc, which is suppose to air sometime in the future as a TV special.  Tekken and Ultimate Punches are two different types of punches, where Ultimate is more "luck" or random than anything since supposely it only gets thrown once out of X amount (like 10,000+) punches.
>> ARTICLE
I was more talking the thing with Miyata later on. I don't want to say more just cause it's a spoiler, but I'm sure that concept will continue to be built upon but who knows.

The fight itself definitely felt rushed, so along with the other comments that have mentioned it here, I'm hoping it's just because it was the introduction to the series.  The new announcer definitely lacks that exaggerated trailing of words that the original was well-known for doing. The new coach VA is fine to me at least.


>> ARTICLE
I'm honestly glad they rushed through this fight, in all of Ippo this is probably the worst fight of them all, up there with the Magician fight. It just drags on sooooo long in the manga. Now they have a lot of room for two of the best fights instead.
>> ARTICLE
Off topic but I'm watching Hajime no Ippo and it's fucking amazing. That is all.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yes.
>> ARTICLE
As RoxSangNoir said, the manga is on-going. Also, there hasn't been (to my knowledge) any statements saying the sequel is cancelled, so it could still be coming.
>> ARTICLE
Alright sweet, looking forward to it and also I might check out the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
The manga has something like 900+ chapters to it, I would love to read it (and actually buy it) but there's just so much to it.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it, but it did leave you at a cliff hanger as Ippo has yet to fight his rival... But the manga is still ongoing. 
>> ARTICLE
I really cant feel the excitement in manga as I do watching the anime. In a story like this, I need to see the moves being fluid and continuous but the manga doesn't really do it for. 
>> ARTICLE
for me it's the complete opposite. Didn't really like the anime but fell in love with the manga. It's the finer details like how George Morikawa took the time to make all the audience faces as different as possible. It's also how the hype build up before the matches seems more in depth with backstory and not felt rushed. Also the art work in the fights itself has great and lasting impact.

Like the fight with Sendoh when [](/s "Ippo gave him the liver blow and it cracked the ribs and he follows up with Gazelle punch and a Dempsy roll"). It gave such a satisfying feeling while I reading but I didn't really feel the intensity when watching the anime

Just my take on it. It's the same when comparing Eyeshield 21 manga and anime. Manga wins hands down
>> ARTICLE
UGHH! Now you make me want to read the manga of both Eyeshield 21 and hajime no ippo. I hated how Eyesheild 21 anime ended. But now your making me want to read them. Curse you for making me interested in manga! 
>> ARTICLE
Do it dude. Eyeshield anime for me got old fast when I realize they reuse his running animation over and over again. Also I fucking love Hiruma and his anime "YA HA" doesn't do the manga justice.
>> ARTICLE
Alright will do. 
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is the greatest EVAH!!!  Eyeshield 21 is great too, the anime and the manga are great.  The manga was awesome and I wanted more of it but i don't think that they are making anymore... *sadness*
>> ARTICLE
I fucking lost it when they all went to read Umezawa's manga, the slice of life part of this show with the rest of the guys is the funniest shit ever, it's a shame this season is skipping so many of those moments just for the fights.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights.
>> ARTICLE
Idk i think they nearly covered everything for the Sawamura fight. Only thing that i can think of is they skipped over Sendo meeting Sawamura.

I don't think I spelled his name right.
>> ARTICLE
Well the main things that got cut for the Sawamura fight was Sendo meeting Sawamura, and a little more back story on Sawamura.  

Then at the end of the fight, they sort of cut out part of Sendo's talk with Sawamura too, which I think is some what important for Sawamura because it sort of causes him to change his ways.  Instead, the anime sort makes it seems like "Ippo's healing fist" caused it.  Even though Sawamura ended up getting a lot of broken bones...from it

Then prior to this episode, Kumi was suppose to visit an injured/sleeping Ippo, and learn about his childhood/father from Ippo's mom, but that part cut/moved to the start of the season.

I think if this season had a normal pacing (like in the first season with 3 to 4 chapters per episode),  we would probably be on episode 20 with the amount of stuff they cut or because of the faster pace they are using.  Already, this season has cover about 100 chapter worth of material.  (From Round 416 to Round 508 - where this episode ends.)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know the exact manga pages but there were some really funny moments before the first fight of this season with the fisher dude, were Ippo gets a boner at the pool with Itakagi's sister or when he does the weighting completely naked, the sedon part you said and not entirely sure if they've missed some other stuff, but overall the focus seems to be on the more on the fights than the build up and Slice of Life stuff.
>> ARTICLE
The combination of the slice of life and the fighting/training makes Ippo such a great succes as a sports anime I like to believe. Without both aspects combined the anime wouldn't do good in either field.

Remember though that they had to cut back from 75 episodes, which gives a lot of room for more slice of life and comedy moments like the beach-trips, to 25 episodes for a season. They can't cut down fighting scenes, because that's what we come for mainly. They can't cut down training scenes because that's what gives it the little reality it has and needs, and compared to S1 they already have a lot less training scenes even though the fights are way longer apart. So the only thing left to cut down is the slice of life / comedy scenes. It's a bit sad, but I still think they create a great balance between sports & non-sports moments.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, but now that I think about it... shouldn't ippo be fairly wealthy from all of his wins? He is the national champ so I'm wondering what he does with the money.
>> ARTICLE
Not really, most boxer usually have 3 to 4 fights a year.  (Some of the more active boxers, might have 6 to 7 range.)  So if Ippo only makes 5k to 10k a fight (just a guess on the amount), he is only making 20k to 40k a year.  (It could be more too.) Which isn't a lot, since I think Japan tends to be somewhat expensive place to live, depending on where you live in it.  

So I think this is the reason why you see most boxers in the series have a "side job" to help pay the bills.  The only boxers that I can think of that don't have side jobs is Takamura, where Kamogawa probably supported him with money early on in his career since he knew Takamura could be a World title holder.   

So boxers probably don't start making money until they are World title holders.  Being Champion of a country, might make some cash but not a lot.  Usually, if a boxer is a champion, it might offer other means to make money like advertising/commercial for various products, or speaking engagements where they are able to profit from their fame.

As for what Ippo does with his money, he mention in the manga he like to buy stuff that helps him train for boxing.  (He ends up buying a lot of logs in the future...), I also think he bought that tire he hits with a hammer too.   I also wouldn't be surprised if some of the money he gets goes toward the fishing business, since I doubt that makes a lot of money for them.

>> ARTICLE
All good points. The manga has been running log enough that I'm sure the author has been asked/ thought about this before, so if it really did need to be explained it would have been.

Thinking back, he did buy a lot of logs.
>> ARTICLE
Here is a thread from a few days ago. there are a few spoilers though so be careful.

http://www.reddit.com/r/hajimenoippo/comments/1u904u/how_much_would_ippo_have_earned_in_the_real_world/
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
When Umezawa was walking along the river and Ippo was chasing after him yelling "You will always be my best friend", I almost cried manly tears. Ippo is such a good character, anime nowadays rarely have characters and relationships like Umezawa and Ippo. And at the end with Itagaki...that's foreshadowing at it's finest.
>> ARTICLE
I'm mainly excited for what will come next: Ippo recovering and discovering a new technique or even a more advanced style of boxing in which he uses his bulk posture and heavy punching to the maximum without giving it the downsides his current style has. All while we see Takamura fighting for the Heavy-weight world title.

I'm curious as to how these last 9 episodes will end up, but there is lots of potential for sure. No doubt about that.
>> ARTICLE
If Takamura's upcoming fight is as good as [Hajime No Ippo - New Challenger](/s "Takamura vs. Hawk") that would be epic... or if possible, something better <3

Oh my god, I don't know why the scene were Umezawa-kun confessing for an apology was so corny for me.

That's stupid go back to watching moe you buttlicker.
>> ARTICLE
Well most emotional moments are kinda corny right? I mean I didn't feel it that corny, just your average uplifting-Ippo-type moment but the apology was a nice thing, after all  in all those years Umezawa had never apologized for bullying Ippo for so long.
>> ARTICLE
Well some emotional moments got me teary-eyed. When the wolf left back to russia and when he said, "This is the last japanese I'm going to use, Goodbye." Got me bawling.

Even though I enjoyed Full Metal Panic, I feel they found their "voice" with full metal panic: fumoffu
>> ARTICLE
I personally liked all three of them. The first season was a really well mixed blend of slice of life/comedy and action, Fumoffu was basically all slice of life and comedy and the third one was almost completely action oriented (shit went down and it had a really dark tone to it). If they ever made a 4th season of FMP however, I would like to see some more development between Sousuke and Chidori (It's been 3 season people! Let's get a move on!).

I really hope for a 3rd (and probably 4th season), the light novels get really good, but its a huge departure from Fumoffu.

I'm not entirely sure on S&W, but Index should get a new season within two years, just depends on whether its before or after a Railgun season 3.

There can't really be a Sengoku Basara 3. the move was the Battle of Sekigahara, what most consider the final battle of that period and the unofficial beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Took me two months but I finally finished catching up to Ippo's anime (I plan on reading the manga after Rising's season is done) on the episode prior to this one. It was freaking awesome to have my first week of new Ippo episodes include 12 and 13.

If anybody is dismissing this series just for being a sports anime, don't. It's been running so long for a reason. The series could run on a slice of life of all the main characters and it'd be just as enjoyable. The fights are just as good as any supernatural fighting anime and always have you on the edge. I dismissed it as a sports anime at first and I feel like an idiot now. This series is phenomenal. 
>> ARTICLE
Ippo is hands down the best Sports anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
I was the same. I never thought I'd enjoy a series in the "sports" genre which is why I went years before watching it. How stupid of me.
>> ARTICLE
Do you happen to know what chapter will follow the end of the anime? 
>> ARTICLE
I've no clue, actually. I figured I'd just wait and see where the anime will finish off. I've heard it's another Takamura fight though. 
>> ARTICLE
From the opening of the current series it'll include a Takamura fight.

**The** Takamura fight really.
>> ARTICLE
> **The** Takamura fight really.

Oh? After how intense Takamura vs Brian was I can only imagine how epic this will be.
>> ARTICLE
The anime should end after Takamura fights David Eagle (the blonde boxer in the intro).   Its the next "big fight" in the series. So that fight ends around Round 556 - 557.

That being said, it would probably be a good idea to actually start where season 2 left off since season 3 has left out quite a bit of material in the manga.   So you might want to start at Round 416.

Of course, season 2 actually cut out some important material too.  The Kamogawa post WWII Flashback arc that takes place after Takamura vs Hawk match.   That flashback does sort of play a role in the series.  So you might want to read that first, and that starts at Round 399 - 400.   There is suppose to be a TV special (like the Kimura vs Mashiba fight) based on that flashback that is suppose to be aired sometime too.
>> ARTICLE
I actually recommend reading from the end of S2. There was a lot that rising dropped. Well that's my view anyway.
>> ARTICLE
So I've noticed. I'll be going back to see what bits I've missed. 
>> ARTICLE
Well that certainly was a hell of a punch.  Always love how intense the fight scenes in Ippo get.
>> ARTICLE
One of the most satisfying punches in the history of anime was Takamura vs Hawk. Man did that feel good. 
>> ARTICLE
It's even better when they replay that scene at the start of the next episode because you get to see the aftermath.  On that note, I absolutely  love the animation they use in the show because they know exactly how to sell a punch that should clearly be able to knock anyone flat on their ass if not worse!
>> ARTICLE
Spent the night watching Rising. The next episode is even better if that's even possible. 
>> ARTICLE
If there is any reason at all to watch the anime. It would be the animation of the fight scenes. I have watched much but the fight scenes are always the best. And it definitely is't the only reason to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I liked this for a bit, but I figured someone else liked it. After that it was over played by that person. I dismissed it and never again watched it. I want to get into it again. I feel like he ruined it for me. I pretended not to know about it. Any idea where I can watch it in good quality?
>> ARTICLE

Ok. THIS SHOW HAS BEEN ON MY PLAN-TO-WATCH FOR TOO LONG. I loved Kuroko no Basket and I think it's about time I start this show.

You should check out Slam Dunk! It's on crunchyroll i think. Old basketball anime but it's hilarious and really entertaining for a sports anime as well.
>> ARTICLE
I think I heard about it as the "other" amazing basketball anime, but 101 episodes is kinda intimidating heh
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Hajime No Ippo also has a lot of episodes in it too.

- Season 1 - 76 episodes (covers 30 volumes worth)
- Movie 1 - Ippo vs Sanada (covers volume 33 to 35, I think)
- Movie 2 - Kimura vs Mashiba (covers volume 31 to 33, I think)
- Season 2 - 26 episodes (covers 10 to 11 volumes - volume 35 to volume 46)
- Season 3 - 25 episodes planned (covers about 14 volumes worth - volume 47 to 61...)

So there is at least 127 episodes and 2 movies to watch.  Chances are, once season 3 ends, there will probably be 44 volumes worth of material that still needs to be animated in order to catch the current chapter Round 1043 in Japan, although the current scanlated chapter is 1039...
>> ARTICLE
Damn...although from what I've heard about Hajime no Ippo, I think it might be worth putting my time into an amazing series.
>> ARTICLE
FUCKYEAH.

I was planning on sleeping tonight, but I have 13 episodes of Ippo to catch up on. 

*And that's why you never procrastinate, kids*
>> ARTICLE
I was (and still am) in love with the first 50 or so episodes of the show, but as much as I like the characters and the over all style of the show it just get too repetitive for me. Maybe a strange complaint for a boxing show, but there are too many boxing matches and they usually play out a bit too similar for my taste.
>> ARTICLE
Which was the most recent fight you watched? It's just that I remember a point around that mark where I felt the same but after after around episode 55 the repetetiveness stopped completely.
>> ARTICLE

Not just /r/anime, go to other anime sites and these anime always come out at the top

Also you say it like its a bad thing, usually there is a good reason why something is popular and well received
>> ARTICLE
>go to other anime sites and these anime always come out at the top

Maybe, maybe not. As /u/Eminoi said, when /r/music did this the albums were very mainstream for Redditors, but not so for communities like 4chan. It's not impossible for the same thing to happen with anime, even if many of these shows are highly rated on MAL (and we all know how reliable MAL ratings are).

>Also you say it like its a bad thing

Well if you thought that I'm sorry. What I meant was that I wasn't really surprised that these titles won in the first place, given that they are the most lauded and talked-about series on this sub. Even though OP said that he had a relatively small sample size (which I agree with), I don't think the results would have changed that much even if more people voted save for the close ones like Hibike - Oregairu or Ping Pong - Shirobako. 

But then I wonder about Code Geass R2. I have no idea how the fuck that happened other than Lelouch.


>> ARTICLE
Code Geass considered the top anime for two years. Yep, that's /r/anime alright. I get why people like CG, I just honestly cannot fathom why people consider it a good show. It's a lot like Pacific Rim IMO, it was fun and I enjoyed it, but I'm never gonna put it on any top 10 lists. 
>> ARTICLE
You're definitely in the minority there. When I look at most top 10s or people's MAL it's ^almost always up there. I don't know about other people but for me the: action, drama, dialogue, suspense, shock/twists, plot, ending, theatrics and characters are what make CG great for me. Another factor of it's success is that it has aspects that appeal to all sorts of people who watch anime. You say you can't fathom why people consider it a good show but then you go on to say you enjoyed it. For most enjoyment is the biggest factor.

I'm curious as to why it wouldn't be on anyone's top 10. My guesses are that they did not like the:

- character/s (mainly the MC)

- theatrics or how the MC solved problems

- action

- animation

> You say you can't fathom why people consider it a good show but then you go on to say you enjoyed it.

I explained this with my Pacific Rim example. I've always found it funny how the anime community uses ratings more than anyone else, yet are the least critical. I think the key point is that this  is a poll asking for the "top" anime, or in other words, the best. If this poll was "what is your favorite anime", then I would have no qualms with any result, as that is a subjective question. 

And honestly when I said I enjoyed it, I was basically lying through my teeth. I only add that in when I'm critisizing Code Geass so I don't get ridiculous downvotes like I used to, but I did NOT enjoy this show. I think if I had seen it when I was a teenager I may have liked it a lot more.


I also really like how you are asking why people don't like it, then list basically every aspect of the show. Well, you got it, the show did  very little right.

>> ARTICLE
So you did not enjoy it but managed to go through 2 seasons of 50 episodes. I don't know whether that's obsession with completion or masochism ^^^^^^or ^^^^^^both .

I don't mind that you disagree, but I just want to know why. "I did not enjoy this show...did very little right." Pick any of my points and give me something specific to deal with... Was the MC unlikeable? Was the action too much? too little? Story over done? Is it too over the top?

If you don't want to be specific about CG tell me something another anime did right in comparison to it.

Here's an example: I did not like NGE because the animation hasn't aged well, the characters are crazy/whiny, the story is messed up and the last 2 episodes are low quality/vague/doesn't give closure/leaves people to their interpretations and generally a big middle finger. I'm so genuinely curious, and it's a little annoying when people just say "oh yeah didn't enjoy it. It did very little right" and just leave it at that.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I've never dropped anything. 

> The main problem for both seasons are the characters being absolutely flat apart from Lelouch and to a lesser extent C.C. Season 2 was just bad. The sword of akasha or w/e it's called arc was just so out of place, IMO and all the fights became less of Lelouch outsmarting his opponents and more of "HOHO I have the best mech now! So I will win this specific battle until you upgrade your mech!!11!" The ending was quite good, but it didn't redeem it fully. Basically it's my least favorite anime because I feel cheated. It could have been so much more, but it seems the writer's care more about absurd plot twists over character development and it really shows. Especially suzaku. Seriously fuck suzaku, what a poorly written piece of trash. "I'm not gonna let good things happen because the end doesn't j ustify the means" and he stays with that mantra for the entire show, showing 0 growth.

This is from an old, old, old thread, which outlines a few of the problems I found. Apologies for how poorly written it is, but it should give you a glimpse of my grievances. Oh and by the way, this got like -7, even though I was directly contributing to conversation.  
>> ARTICLE
> I'm curious as to why it wouldn't be on anyone's top 10

Ignoring "chasing dog" episodes I can pinpoint to you exact moment the show went unrecoverably downhill for some people. It was [](/s "episode 22 of season 1 - 'kill all Japanese' incident"). After that it was only exercise in total absurdity. Total absurdity is not a bad thing per se, but CG still insisted on treating itself seriously.  Ending redeemed the situation, but only very slightly (edit: and it still was ridiculous bullshit). It could be still entertaining watch, but CG being 'genuinely good show'? No way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for me I just found that Lelouch tripped too many Mary Sue flags during my viewing. I bailed out after episode 10 where IIRC Lelouch intentionally lead his troops into a trap, and then not only secured their complete, unquestioning obedience *after admitting he lead them into a trap*, but also managed to roflstomp the opposing army lead by a supposedly extremely competent commander. Everyone just loses 50 IQ points as soon as they go near Lelouch and it was enraging to watch.

Like, the show looked alright, had a great premise, and had some likable characters (Kallen, Euphy, Suzaku). I just wish that A. they had skipped all the high school bullshit B. Lelouch had actually faced some consequences for failure at some point in the first 10 episodes (I remember one time he got caught in the middle of the enemy army and Cornelia was ordering everyone to open their mech cockpits, but then C.C shows up dressed as Zero to ass pull him out of the situation) and C. he didn't have so many blatant Mary Sue traits.

I watched 13 eps of the first season and couldn't handle it anymore.  I know I didn't finish it, so I can't judge, but Lelouch was a bland Mary Sue, and the whole "they all go to the same High School" angle was just agony.

That's the better part of the show imo. It's all downhill from there.

What plot holes are you referring to?
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
First of all, use spoiler tags.

[For your first paragraph, that's not a plot hole.](/s "The reason why the Black Knights supported Schniezel is because they can no longer trust Lelouch. You can argue that this is illogical (I personally think it is) but that doesn't mean it is impossible to happen. Also, one of the reasons why they would support Schniezel is because he is seemingly willing to give back Japan if they can successfully apprehend Lelouch.")

Second Paragraph: That's not a plot hole either. I'm starting to think that you don't know what an actual plot hole is.

> You guys actually love this?

I don't love Code Geass but it is an entertaining anime series.

Not OP, but I'm guessing he was referring to stuff like out-of-nowhere plot developments and asspulls in general than bona fide plot holes.

Because despite its flaws (especially in R2) its still a very enjoyable show with great characters (especially Lelouch), awesome battles and a superb ending

So what is the "real" ending then?  No offense, I could be wrong and I would gladly accept your interpretation.

I agree with your criticism of the ending, and also think it's pretty naive, with empirical evidence to back that up. I've never heard of any other interpretation though. I may have to rewatch the last few episodes.

[CG R2 Spoilers](/s "A new start. I highly doubt that his actions lead to some kind of ideal world without war and conflict. They never try to force that idea onto you either, so i'm not sure why so many people interpret it that way. It's about giving everyone a chance to live their dreams. They did their best to eradicate the "evil" in the world and start on a clean slate. Lelouch talked about it with his parents. What charles and his mom wanted was a world without conflict, where everyone could be connected with each other at all times. Lelouch denied that world in favor of something more uncertain. He wanted a world where people could hope for a better future. It's all a bit fuzzy because i haven't watched it in a few years, but that's the general gist of it. ")

My favorite scene by far is the first battle between Kong Wenge and Kazama. The artstyle works beautifully in this battle, and I really felt overwhelmed and small after seeing Kazama play, just like Kong Wenge.

I gotta give my favorite scene to the final battle of the show. Amazingly done and still gives me chills. I hold it as my standard for enjoying a show. If any show can give me chills it automatically gets at least a 9/10

> I will say that Hibike! Euphonium is one of the best works I've seen in anime.

Can you elaborate on this for me, I'm reading through the comments and i can see it's really popular. I just don't see it, ignoring that its hard for me to relate, and since its only 12 episodes long i guess the shitty pacing can be excluded. Again for 12 episodes long they went into a decent amount of character backstory and development but it was still choppy, The main idea for me was, let's get better and win this competition and they mainly seemed to just focus on the drama of the characters which many issues were brought up and unresolved. The ending tied in with a beginning so I can't give it much crap, but it was still unsatisfying. For 12 episodes, with my elaborating and while typing this I've rewatched a few parts and take back my comment I made a few minutes ago below, that It's not above average, it definetly is, but only in terms of a 12 episode series. You saying it is one of the best works I've seen in anime, seems like an extreme exaggeration or maybe you haven't seen enough? If you enjoyed it that's what matters - I sincerely mean that but i guess my pet peeve with anime is *Even if i enjoy something, ***DEFINITELY** *does not always mean it is a good piece of work* end rant.

Tl;dr: For 12 episodes above average. one of the best works in anime IMO is an extreme exaggeration, to each his/her own, if you enjoyed that's what counts.

  
>> ARTICLE
Surely! (Warning: Spoilers galore ahead)  
  
Here's the thing: For me, I think relatability is a terrible, TERRIBLE way to rate something. I mean seriously, just because something is relatable doesn't mean it saves a trash work and failing to be relatable doesn't take something that was good and make it bad. That said, I can see why some people didn't like it, and why my comment might come off as off-hand or not thought out.  
  
To preface, I've watched my fair share of anime and TV shows and consumed more than enough stories (though definitely pales in comparison to many others on this site). What I loved about Hibike! Euphonium was a combination of factors: art, writing, character development, and cinematography.   
  
Let's talk art: The visuals were, of course, beautiful and astounding. It's amazing that they were able to get so much done consistently throughout the series, but it's more than just the budgetsmile.gif or the water flowing in the background. To me, it was the way that everything felt natural, how it became an active part of the story without just taking up space.   
  
That leads into cinematography (I'll save the writing and character development for last). The camera work was phenomenal, and I loved the small touches they had here and there; in episode 8 I believe, when Hazuki-chan is tearing up, the camera blurs out with her. How on the train, the camera lurches along with the passengers on the rail. The sweeping shots of the band, the intimate looks between friends, the far off shots to make you realize just how , in the grand scheme of things, small and insignificant these kids can be even in their own town.  
  
And that then leads to my favorite aspects: writing and character development. For me, main character narration is either hit or miss; if you're just using them as a mouthpiece to show what's going on, you're failing to utilize a potentially artistic aspect. Hibike! Euphonium knows this, and when they use Kumiko as the narrator, notice how she's not just reiterating what's going on. The way she jumps from thought to thought (with Aoi-senpai's departure, she talks about summer and the changing of seasons before leading into how the band falls apart) and the way she brings up other stories and metaphors to express feelings she can't quite convey (when walking up to the shrine and talking with Reina, she brings up the story of the Ice Spirit and mentions that this is how it felt to be okay with losing your life). These are not things that the viewer can pick up normally; they are subtleties that can be addressed, and add only to the experience when addressed.  
  
And that leads to the final point: character development. You see, in my estimation, Hibike! Euphonium is not an anime about band. It's not about cute girls doing cute things. It's not even about yuri bait. It's about the time in everyone's life when you realize that there is a void in your life: that you will one day have to do something from now until a considerable later time. And you have no idea what it is. Some of us know what we want to do when we're five, but many of us are lost. Kumiko is someone who's lost. In the beginning, she has no real motivation. She attends Kitauji because she likes the sailor uniform. She says she won't join band because Tsukamoto says he will. She rejoins band because her friends want to. She doesn't want to play euphonium because she always played euphonium. She plays euphonium because her senpai asks her to.  
 
Notice here that in EVERY INSTANCE, Kumiko has no agency. She's going with the flow. Even in the flashbacks, we see that Kumiko picked up euphonium because her sister did. She didn't feel particularly attached to band (did you really think we were going to nationals?) and had no real direction, as we can see from her spacing out at the parent- teacher conference.  
   
But as she meets Reina, she changes. Kumiko has a purpose, she sees what it's like when someone whats to be someone else, when they want to be something else. She witnesses what can drive people to greatness, to obsession, and she realizes that she needs to feel that empty void in her life and SHE wants to be the one to choose it. And choose it she does: she wants to be able to play the euphonium and become great at it.  
  
Only the path is difficult and full of disappointment. She is told by Taki-sensei to not play the part, and she's mad. She's crying tears of frustration. This is a MARKED difference from the Kumiko we see early on, yet over the course of 12 episodes it feels natural. The girl who didn't raise her hand in the beginning on whether or not to go for nationals is the one girl who stands up and gives Reina, the girl who clearly aces the solo audition, a standing ovation. She is the deciding factor, she believes in herself, and in such a small world and small way, she is learning what it means to grow up, to be human, to love and care about someone and something with all your heart.  
  
And that's why I love Hibike! Euphonium.

imo i watched it last week, here are reasons why i would rate this a 7 or 7.5/10, without any spoilers:

* the pacing is wonky and there are too many deus ex-machina moments.  It often gives you the answers to every mystery up to that point all at once instead of pacing itself.

* the major revelations aren't predictable, but they aren't gasp-worthy either 

* The world created for this anime could have had SO MUCH intriguing backstory, but they chose to keep everything vague.  

* Their powers are not explained well, nor do they have any scientific references or techno-babble to associate this world with reality.  

* There's a specific biological alteration in this society that is utter bullshit and lacks consistency throughout the story. 

* The art SUCKS.  I remember distinctly commending an episode on the drawings (i think episode 5, around the campfire).  All the kids had cool facial quirks going on and the coloring was great with the background, but that level of animation didn't show up after that episode.

* The dialogue keeps secrets from the audience that were already heavily foreshadowed by close-ups of faces (and names).  It lacks subtlety.

* Not every question is answered by the end, and not in an open-ended way.  More like, this part was a bit mysterious and they never went back to explain the whole thing, even though it didn't really matter to the whole story.

* The characters were fine, probably the high point of the series, but i thought they could have been a bit more charming.  This is indeed nitpicking haha

* 
* After it was over, i was just like "that's it?  that's what everyone was circle-jerking over?"  I think if you're a younger teenager and haven't seen very much you'll think the characters are bombastic and the thrilling parts are very exciting.  If you have an expansive knowledge of literary themes, tropes, story-telling, you'll probably think it was average like me.  There are great points to the series too, which is why i gave it a 7-7.5, i just wanted to share my negatives on a series that people have been calling perfect.

But the way they impacted the story and themes are on a different level and scale of ambition than ssy. Trying to answer questions like where is the human soul and how technology changes the way we think and act.

Because those were all cliches by the 90's.

In other mediums maybe, you said it youself. Gits was still a first. What has ssy done?

> here's a specific biological alteration in this society that is utter bullshit and lacks consistency throughout the story. 

what alteration?

what moments specifically?

> Not every question is answered by the end

really? what questions weren't answered by the end? I personally found this story one of the most conclusive.

> If you have an expansive knowledge of literary themes, tropes, story-telling, you'll probably think it was average like me

You are self-assured, that's for certain.
>> ARTICLE
ex-machina moments:

* any time Shun talks to Saki in her head, giving her correct instructions far beyond her imagination

* Saki happening to remember sharing her mantra with Satoru, the one person she had consequently split up with, causing him to regain his cantus and keep them both from dying.

* Saki's narration as an adult infers that she never dies on her adventures, cutting the tension in almost every scene.

* The walking library giving them a bunch of information, leading to a bigger mystery for the scooby and the gang.

* Tomiko spilling all the beans to Saki because she chose her to be the next leader of the civilization (on what grounds again? having a level head?)

* The pseudo-science of death feedback, where even if you believe you are of a different species, your subconscious mind can cause your body to shut down based on changes in your DNA.  If you want me to be invested in the philosophical questions like "what makes humans human," don't add an implausible device to explain why the cantus users can't kill each other without dying, but they can kill rat humans with only a little physical grief, and vice versa.  I don't understand how this keeps fiends from experiencing death feedback while they rampage.  If it's an innate reaction to killing, then whether you think the target is queerat or human shouldn't matter because they are both human in reality.  Perhaps I missed an explanation, but between 2011 and present there were a lot of changes in society that were left unexplained.  "The scientists divided the cantus users from the non-users, and both sides had their DNA modified"  Okay, great.  Mind elaborating a bit?

* It seems very convenient that the queerat that helped/abandoned/helped again Saki and Satoru ended up being the one who sought to forcefully end discrimination between the races.  Couldn't he have explained to Kiromaru his intention and reasoning well enough to get him to fight on his side?

* I want to say there are more, one dealing with the giant explosive fishes that could somehow be controlled by the queerats to wreak havoc in the waterways.  Those things did not seem sentient or easily captured and moved.  Just one of a couple random occurrences to create instant conflict. 

* All of the knowledge and tactics the queerats gained is meant to be assumed.  We have no idea if they're capable of anything but shooting arrows and pillaging their enemies territories before the first time skip. They could have extracted more thorough information from the library that would have helped the viewer get a better understanding of the world's history. 

questions i had at the end

* How did Squealer know Saki was going to Tokyo?  By smell? Did he know that there was a fiend-killing bacteria hidden in the depths there?  Does that mean he actually did find a library? 

* Why were there libraries walking around?

* Why did all of the queerats look the same except for a few who look like they're a different species?

* Didn't the townsfolk have Cantus powers?  Why were they unwilling to defend themselves during the queerat raids?

* If Maria's daughter was always a fiend, wouldn't she have tried to kill one of the queerats at some point while growing up?  she would have died based on death feedback.

* Why did the board of education head have two pupils in each eye?

* Weren't there ghosts at some point? Were those hallucinations?

* Are we supposed to assume Maria and Mamoru died?  How come they weren't strong enough to fend off the queerats?

* Was there a reason this society abstained from using electricity in everyday life?  Seems inconvenient, and though solar power is able to be used for libraries, people somehow don't find it to be useful enough to have solar power in their homes.

* Saki's sister was left a mystery.  Did she only have one sibling? 

i liked the show, honestly!  I just wanted the story to be something different than a queerat uprising because the world seemed much more interesting than an avoidable giant massacre.  I still plan on reading the novel for a better understanding of everything. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to discredit you out anything, but I believe the general opinion around here is that the characters were actually one of the weakest parts of the show.
>> ARTICLE
It's all opinion, and this comment does have spoilers.  I thought they were going for realistic personalities, which fit really well with the setting. Growing up as isolated as these kids did would make them boring and naive, but book smart and curious.  Their personalities changed as they learned more about their civilization and grew up.  Saki grew up to make a lot of commendable choices because she had made mistakes as well.  The whole story was from Saki's perspective anyway, so I'm surprised more reviewers don't view it as a good character-driven anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just take a llisten to it's second ending, Hanazawa is a god.
>> ARTICLE
Do it! Just finished it yesterday and I guarantee you it's worth the watch.

I really regret dropping it after 3 episodes when it first came out. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm about to watch episode 11. Personally I am not seeing what everybody loves about this show yet. It's like a 5/10 for me right now
>> ARTICLE
That's honestly how I felt about it and I thought it would come to fruition somehow. It didn't really for me. The ending was one of the highlights of the show, but I still would give it a 6/10 overall, maybe bump to 7 for how ambitious it was. In the end, worth a watch. That's it. 
>> ARTICLE
As a recommendation:

A personal favorite: [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) is a Science Fiction, Psychological Thriller created by the animation studio A-1 Pictures (other known works are Sword Art Online, the fairly recent Shigatsu Wa Kimi no Uso/ Your Lie in April, Anohana, and Fairy Tail). Emotionally gripping and provocative with its moral stances, Shinsekai Yori delivers a 25-episode journey focusing on Saki (main character) and her friends' interactions with the utopian-like society she is residing in.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Hibike, but Shinsekai Yori is really fucking good. It's my second favorite anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu <3

Death Parade

Hataraku Maou sama
>> ARTICLE
Hataraku Maou-sama had me balling tears of laughter.  That one is seriously underrated.  It's one of the most upbeat humorous animes that I've watched, along with Squid Girl.
>> ARTICLE
Yeh I want a s2 so badly
>> ARTICLE
I'm pleasantly surprised that it got an honorable mention. It's like a diamond in the shitstorm that is SoL light novel adaptations
>> ARTICLE
WOW TATAMI DIDN'T WIN 2010? I'm fucking salty.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Parasyte didnt even get an honorable mention. It's definitely not a 10/10 but with the hype and recency... I feel like somehow it was just passed up.


>> ARTICLE
A lot of people felt the female love interest was bland, whine-y, and useless. I don't disagree, but it's definitely not a 10/10 anime. I scored it 8/10, myself.
>> ARTICLE
Well UBW was even more hyped along with Danmachi and Oregairu yet Death parade beat it for a spot 2015. 
>> ARTICLE
That's fair. If I had to interject my personal opinion into this, I'd say UBW really isn't a top anime. *But* considering how much UBW is heralded on this sub, it really is surprising that it didn't win or at least get a spot in 2015.
>> ARTICLE
I dont really consider Parasyte,UBW great animes either. for 2014 I both rated Parasyte and UBW S1 at 7/10 which is good but not great  in my score. Second cour  of UBW i rated 6/10

Over all Parasyte was not as good  on its second half  that is why its not as popular so its no surprise  but still a good show to me.  Bahamut was actually my aots that season when UBW,parasyte and Bahamut all aired surprisingly .

I dont think UBW is herald here at all most think its a 6/10 or 7/10 unlike Fate/Zero where this sub really worships that show as some 10/10 masterpiece. The one Im suprise is there is no Jojo in 2015 since its was highly rated and most enjoyed it. But The Fate series in general is just popular here.
>> ARTICLE
Monster was beaten by FMA original wot

How the hell did Code Geass R2 beat Spice and Wolf ?!?! /salt

Glad to see that /r/anime's taste in mecha extends beyond the sub's 3 "exceptions" (Gurren Lagann, Eva, Code Geass), even if the other titles mentioned here didn't get as many votes.
>> ARTICLE
tfw when Giant Robo didn't even make honorable mention
>> ARTICLE
It's always nice to see Only Yesterday on top anime lists, even though it didn't get so many votes or had much competition. Such an underrated movie.
>> ARTICLE
I'm satisfied with the Haruhi series' results with Melancholy still getting some recognition and Disappearence winning despite the concurrence of Katanagatari, TTG, DRRR!!, Angel Beats! and TWGOK.
>> ARTICLE
I just know that come October, One Punch Man is going to take the top spot of 2015.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, most of this list was obvious. I'm kinda surprised Monogatari SS and Ping Pong were top of their respective years, but then again, this sub does give them more love than anywhere else.
>> ARTICLE
Good thing
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect some of those picks.

1995 - Eva is one of my favorite series, but I have to say GitS is a lot better put together and polished. And I don't even like GitS.

2006 - I'm surprised Code Geass beat Death Note. I gotta say I prefer Lelouche as the mastermind because he actually failed at points and adapted his plans and Light seemed to be able to predict events that probably shouldn't have happened. The real question though is, how did Haruhi lose? It's one of the quintessential animes.

2008 - Code Geass is my #1 of all time but I don't think Super Mecha Gambit Pileup Time beats Mercantilism 101.

2011 - Holy shit that was a good year.

2013 - I'm surprised the Devil is a Part Timer did that well. I love it, but it's pretty niche.

tl;dr: Apparantly the stuff I like is what people like even though I don't think the stuff I like is the best.
>> ARTICLE
So depressed HxH didn't win.  In my opinion 2011 would go HxH, F/Z, Steins;Gate, and then Madoka

2011 was just *too good* of a year for anime

I liked Soul Eater, but that frickin' ending man...

Have to agree. The ending sucked.

Manga ending was much better.
>> ARTICLE
People are probably just mad it derailed from the manga so hard. I liked both
>> ARTICLE
It's to be expected when Bones adapt an unfinished series. Fullmetal Alchemist, Noragami, Eureka Seven. Even Chaika to some extent. Anime-original ends are just their thing, and I kind of prefer them to the more conventional "...But our fight continues!" endings that go nowhere.

I would have been very interested to see what they would have done with Hunter x Hunter, if they'd been given the project rather than Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
No Hunter X Hunter 1999 not even in the honorable mentions well screw you boiz.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think that's just because most people who've seen HxH have only seen the 2011 version.
>> ARTICLE
ITT; Salt mines.
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu Zoku should be miles ahead for 2015 on this sub.
>> ARTICLE
I can guarantee it was because of downvotes from people who are against it being so popular (due to the recent best girl debacle)

Hibike Euphonium... not much hate against it I assume.

EDIT : The fact that you get downvoted for mentioning it, proves it. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime loves KyoAni in general, which is understandable.

I personally can't say anything about Euphonium because I haven't watched it myself.
>> ARTICLE
Eupho not only had one of the most beautiful animations i have **ever** seen (this can be easily noticed on the rainy episodes), since its a music anime (that is actually about music!) the OST is pretty outstanding compared to other anime OST.

And of course, the character development and all that.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the yuri baiting
>> ARTICLE
I watched both. Euph is pretty solid. The animation is gorgeous, the music is good, and the story is your standard stuff (minus a few stupid things here and there, especially regarding the music teacher). But definitely Zoku for me. Euph I would describe more as cute and all, but not too much else.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty solid show. I recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning to, but I want to watch other anime series first from my PTW list (story of my life).

Thanks for the quick recommendation regardless.
>> ARTICLE
You forget how massive the anti circle jerk is also 
>> ARTICLE
iirc oregairu was actually shitting on everyone else when this post was on the front page, mustve been the ones that went to it late that got hibike to first with only 2 votes more
>> ARTICLE
Down vote me all you want but Death Parade is so overrated its unreal. Its a good show but 7/10 show not a 10/10 deep psychological show greatness that people are saying.

Hell I liked Death Billiards better.
>> ARTICLE
imo its because some people are voting as if the question is what is your favourite anime of that year, death parade has a really interesting premise and universe behind it and not bad character development so i can see why its easily some peoples fav anime that year, thought obviously not the best
>> ARTICLE
Looking at these results, 2011 and 2005 were probably my favorite years in anime. 2011 had Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica, and so much more, While 2005 has Eureka 7, Blood+, Honey and Clover, some of my all time favorite shows as well.
>> ARTICLE
>2005

That's a funny way to spell 2006.
>> ARTICLE
Eureka Seven - April 17, 2005  
Blood+ - October 8, 2005  
Honey and Clover - April 14, 2005  

Im confused what you mean when I said "my favorite"
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see some of my favourite anime here (Code Geass, Steins Gate, Death Note) but I'm disappointed with no Fate/Zero

Easily better than Shinsekai Yori, Psycho Pass and Hyoukai in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Of course Eupho was the best of this year.

Even if the year hasn't ended, its pretty safe to say no other show will reach **that** kind of quality (OST, animation and subtle character development) on what is left of the year.


>> ARTICLE
What subtle character development are you talking about? I thought that hibike's character development, while excellent, wasn't even it's main draw. In terms of subtle character development among this year's anime, oregairu wins by a large margin. For me, hibike was all about the atmosphere(animation, character interactions, music). 
>> ARTICLE
I think that a lot of people might disagree with you on that, buddy. :P

At least for me, I would go with Yurikuma Arashi, Death Parade, Maria the Virgin Witch and (depending how it ends) Blood Blockade Battlefront as my bests of the year so far. Miss Hokusai might be there if I come around to watch it and it happens to be as good as it seems.
>> ARTICLE
Owarimonogatari? Or One Punch Man (at least for the first two categories).

I personally think Durarara would be a contender too once Ten is over.
>> ARTICLE
Im going to be downvoted for this but whatever.

Monogatari franchise, regardless if it is good or not (im not going to argue that), is over-hyped by /r/anime.

Can't compare an over-hyped franchise with a "standalone" anime *no one knew anything about before it aired* like Eupho. 

It wouldn't be fair to rely on the franchise popularity to beat "standalone" anime.

And OPM...i read the manga and webcomic, its pretty good but from the PVs i think the animation will be sightly above average. Nothing to say about the OST because its just a PV.

Kyo-ani went as far as animate **dust particles illuminated by the sun**, **rain drop falling in the glass**, and **pollen particles of the flowers** when doing eupho episodes. 

You don't see that kind of animation detail every season.
>> ARTICLE
Given how you described the animation I might have to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoani makes very pretty shows and I wish I could like them. But a show about girls playing brass instruments just isn't for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
> Can't compare an over-hyped franchise with a "standalone" anime no one knew anything about before it aired like Eupho.

Why not? Does it matter than no one knew about hibike before it aired? I also completely disagree with that statement because there were tons of people who were hyped for hibike well before it aired.

Why not just compare them based on their own merits? Hype shouldn't have anything to do with your comparisons.

>Kyo-ani went as far as animate dust particles illuminated by the sun, rain drop falling in the glass, and pollen particles of the flowers when doing eupho episodes.

Fawning over things like this seems overly pedantic. Just knowing that they animated dust particles doesn't tell me anything. Using that fact to describe how kyoani went to excruciating lengths to create an amazingly detailed and immersive world is much more substantial. 
>> ARTICLE
WOOO DURARARARARA! For as much crap people are giving this summer season, Durarara Ten and Gangsta are total contenders for me. I understand that these two shows aren't for everyone, which is a damn shame because these two have some of the best storytelling/crafting this year. 
>> ARTICLE
The current Durarara airing is great so far, I felt like x2 Shou was just alright. Put me to sleep several times. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess I need to finish hibike euphonium and watch ping pong. 
>> ARTICLE
Hibike is good until episode 8, at which point it becomes great. 
>> ARTICLE
i actually like this list
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Mushishi is the favourite of 2005 but its sequel isn't even an honourable mention for 2014. It's very good and anyone who liked the first series should watch the rest.

1988 though.
>> ARTICLE
Only back to 1985?  C'mon, mang

Holy crap, a list I almost completely agree with.

Yet another reminder of how incredibly overrated Code Geass R2 is. *sighs*
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako got robbed by five votes : (
>> ARTICLE
Man 99-01 was such a weak period for anime shows, there are like 2 series a year from that time that weren't totally forgotten. The digital transition has to be the biggest drop in the quantity of quality in the history of anime. 
>> ARTICLE
How is it possible that Fate/Zero is not even in honorable mentions? That anime was talked about all the time on /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
I see Code Geass and Steins;Gate. My inner fanboy is satisfied, for now. You have all been spared from the salt today.
>> ARTICLE
err... Hibike is definetly not the top anime of the year. Oregairu and Death parade are both better. I'd dare to say they are both much better (imo). 
>> ARTICLE
It might be last, but thank the lord Hibike! is on the list.

Edit: Fuck, Psycho-Pass and Shirobako.... Where is Fate/Zero?

TFW Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't ping pong deserve it?
>> ARTICLE
It's nice and all that they went for something new but I just don't think it was all that enjoyable. I feel like all of the show's appeal centers around its originality and story. Were it to be animated normally I believe it'd be unpopular, even though the quality of the content wouldn't change much. 
  
The story was good, I agree, but from a visual perspective it was awkward. It felt like taking a best-seller and animating it without any real value being gained from the change in medium.  
  
TLDR; It was a good story but it didn't feel like it capitalized on the medium at all. 
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of that, these contests are based on popularity so even if you believe what you do, many others wouldn't 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong's sales placed 42nd for its year. 
>> ARTICLE
I was talking about popularity on this sub 
>> ARTICLE
When you realise that after 2015 was the worst year so far
>> ARTICLE
This is actually a pretty good list
>> ARTICLE
Best thing about Ippo is how it makes sure to give backstories to pretty much everyone or at least all of the characters you're meant to take seriously. The crowd chanting for a Miyata-Ippo fight was perfect too. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved how when he "challenged" him the crowd was just like "who the fuck are y-...oh it's the champion"
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to this show every week. Does it get enough attention in Japan? Hajime no Ippo really needs to continue to be animated. 
>> ARTICLE
From what I have seen (various comments on other sites), I don't think it does.   Its not really selling DVD's.   Also the time it airs in Japan, doesn't really help attract viewers.   Sunday at 1:30 am isn't really known for having a lot of viewers being awake.   So chances are a lot of people record it, or watch it online.   So you probably can't get an accurate number for people that watch it to attract advertisers/investors.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly do not understand how a great show like this doesn't get the attention it deserves. I feel like people don't give it a chance because it's a boxing anime. The Japanese must think the same since they put it in such a late time slot. 
>> ARTICLE
I think in order to enjoy this season, you need to have watched the previous seasons or have read the manga.  Other wise, you will have a hard time following the series.   So getting new comers into the series can be quite difficult.   Not many people want to spent the time to watch 101 episodes (previous 2 season) and two movies in order to catch up and follow this season.   So I can see that turning some potential viewers off from it.

The manga itself probably intimidates some people too since it is so long.  1046 chapters to date in Japan, which is over 105 volumes.   That is a lot of reading for someone to catch up the current chapter.  So it faces the same problem to where new comers need to be a fan of the series in order to understand it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll bite. I never watched the series before this, it was big back then and I wasn't really into boxing so I never really looked at it.  
  
But so far, I love it. Sure, if an old face shows up I won't know who they are but as a newbie to Ippo, I don't have problems with the show and I'll continue to watch it.  
  
I know I should watch the old ones too but the first season had like 75 episodes and I have a lot more shows (TV, Anime, Cartoons, Movies) to catch up on.
>> ARTICLE
But following that logic, how do other monolithic shows like One Piece get so much attention despite having their own huge backlogs?
>> ARTICLE
Well, One Piece is THE series from the most popular magazine, also being the best selling manga ever. 

Ippo on the other hand isnt even close, and its like 10 years older and being so long its hard to attrack new readers
>> ARTICLE
I think One Piece has always been popular to where it had a lot of viewers/fans early on.  If you look at manga sells alone for the past year, you will see it sells 3 x times as many compared to the next closest series about, which was Attack of the Titan. Not to mention it continues to be great as the series goes on.  Where as, other long running series start to lose it after awhile.   So it being already popular and being well liked probably help it attract some new viewers to see what it is all about.

Where as this past year, I haven't seen Hajime No Ippo listed on any top 30 list for volumes sold.     Over all, I believe Hajime No Ippo [ranks about 13th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga ) for over all volumes with 94 million.  (Which is impressive, since that is mainly in Japan, its not licensed else where except in France I think.)  But a lot of that is because there is over 105 volumes in the series, and it has been going on for about 25 years.   So some of the new volumes haven't been selling that well.   I don't know if that means the series is losing some of its popularity, or its not attracting that many new readers.
>> ARTICLE
Solid show does not equals to sales 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for Takamuras fight!
>> ARTICLE
Dear god why didn't I know this was released sooner!? Well I know what I'm doing for the rest of my weekend!
>> ARTICLE
I noticed there wasn't near as much training on Takamura's part as there was when he fought Brian. Was there any training in the manga that was cut here?
>> ARTICLE
Most of the training for the Hawk fight, was in order to lose weight.  Since he moved up a weight class, the amount of weight he needs to lose isn't as much as it was for Hawk.  Its still an issue for Takamura, but it isn't as harsh was it was.  He doesn't need to go to extreme measures to lose those last few pounds to make weight.

He did train for Eagle, that camp he had with Miyata, where he fished at.  Then I think he did a have another training scene later on too.  
>> ARTICLE
That's it. Next time I'm going to go challenge an Olympic gold medallist I'm going fishing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes that's right I forgot about the weight class change. That explains it. Still feel like there wasn't enough training especially since people have said this is **THE** Takamura fight.
>> ARTICLE
Anyways he almost fucked up the loss weight, they cut the scene from the anime, but he had to take off the boxers to being in rule.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the anime did cut out a few things going into this fight.   [Manga Spoiler](/s "Going into this fight there was talk that Takamura might have a problem with his vision/eye.  It was something Miyata noticed during training camp when he punched him.  He asks Ippo about it, where Ippo starts to investigate it by asking Sanada about it.  So going into this fight, we aren't really for sure if Takamura has an eye injury or not.  He is known for having one eye closed...at times, which could be hinting at it, or a weird thing people in Japan are known to do.  The anime also left out a spar with Ippo vs Imai prior to the training camp.")   If you are interesting in reading about it, it starts around Round 511 in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
People keep pointing that out, and I heard someone say that it turns out it was nothing in the end. So I guess that's why that was cut out.
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler discussion](/s "Well for the fight, it didn't really play a factor.   So chances are, Morikawa added it in to put more drama in for the fight.  The past big fight for Takamura, his harsh weight control played a huge part in the fight.  Since that issue isn't as big of an issue, he needed another potential handicap.  So the 'eye' sort of plays a role for this fight.   Also, I don't think if it was ever confirmed that it wasn't an issue still.  Takamura is the type of person who would box, even if he had a handicap like that in order full fill his dream.   So at some point, it could become an issue for him, if Morikawa wanted to 'end' Takamura's boxing career.  Just like Ippo's 'knees' that was mentioned at the end of the Sawamura fight as a potential career ending injury.  I would think getting hit in the face a lot of times would be it, but I guess it could be his knees...")
>> ARTICLE
Ippo is pretty good with regards to that. They very rarely have extended fights or training sequences. Even then, a lot of the training sequences are used as a chance to spend time with the secondary cast, like Miyata and Takamura during the beachside camp.

Then there are episodes of pure insanity, like the fishing episodes or when Takamura attempts to "help" Ippo get laid.
>> ARTICLE
I freaking love this anime. Pumps me up for my soccer games later on in the day every damn week.
>> ARTICLE
That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring.
>> ARTICLE
It was more about setting up things for Miyata future
>> ARTICLE
I think Miyata is sort of the goal for Ippo at this point so the fight was to show that Miyata grew to be very powerful would add tension if they fight, add to the fact that the whole point that this was a match was because the other manager wanted to find a weak point on Miyata and he did find that.  
  
Although I love how they gave the other one a back story so I was kind of rooting for him instead of Miyata.
>> ARTICLE
I think the point was to foreshadow that Mr. Sacaguchi (not sure on spelling) is doing everything he can to destroy Miyata, even set up boxers just to analyze him.

dang you beat me to it. Yeah hopefully he gets the belt

[Wanna Be the Strongest in the World!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11763/Sekai_de_Ichiban_Tsuyoku_Naritai!) for my favorite sports anime (as well as one of my most favorite shows). It is a show I wish a lot more people would try, even if it isn't for everyone.

I also like [Free!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18507/Free!), which was a good mix of sports & life o'life.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, Wanna be Strongest was really overlooked because of how sexual it was in the first episodes (A lot of torturous training too!), but the matches down the line were incredible. Some of the best pro wrestling matches I've seen in anime. I really want more wrestling anime.

[Saki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5671/Saki), if mahjong counts as a sport.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, didn't know there was another mahjong anime. Did you enjoy Saki?
>> ARTICLE
Well, OP asked for *favorite* sports anime... 

So it's safe to say I like Saki a bit. It's the ridiculous kind of shounen sports anime where everyone has lengthy backstories and assorted mahjong-related superpowers. The actual format of mahjong makes the show really interesting, though. Because it's a four-player game, instead of the typical one-on-one or team-vs-team setup of other sports. It makes for a lot of cool dynamics and really lends itself to the way Saki builds characters and relationships. The only problem is that the manga is ongoing, so it does have the issue of not actually having an ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Hm that does sound more interesting than the typical 1v1 shonens. Might check it out, thanks mate
>> ARTICLE
I personally like Akagi better. Saki is still good though. 
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, wtf I didn't know there were so many mahjong animes. Looks a bit like Kaiji xD

5. Haikyu 6/10

1. Ping Pong. This is my favorite sports anime I have watched. I remember starting the first episode around 11:00 pm thinking that I would just watch an episode or 2 then go to bed. I was terribly wrong. The show was finished that night. RIP sleep.

2. Chihayafuru. This show has some of my favorite characters of any sports anime. Actually Taichi is my favorite male character in any anime that I have watched.

3. Shion no Ou. This is a little odd as I don't really know why myself I enjoy it so much. I guess I enjoyed the murder mystery that went along with shogi (even though I don't understand anything about shogi).
>> ARTICLE
Can Hibike Euphonium be considered a sports anime?

Anyway, would still have to say Chihayafuru. Euphonium is also good, though. And one nobody mentioned so far, Bamboo Blade was fun.

Hikaru no Go was pretty good.

Initial D has an amazing soundtrack

damn straight!

It sucks that their is probably going to be only 6 more episodes then another 5 year wait :(
>> ARTICLE
Five years?? 

D:
>> ARTICLE
First "season" of Hajime no Ippo started in 2000. Ended in March 2002 with 75 episodes. Episode 76 came out almost exactly a year later in 2003. Then there were two movies released in 2003 in April and September.

Season 2, New Challenger started in 2009. After the last episode, the voice of Takamura said, "Of course, a sequel is also being planned!".

Season 3 started last October 2013.

The waits have been getting shorter but it'll be at least a couple of years before we see Season 4.
>> ARTICLE
Well thats to be expected, but seriously... there's over a thousand chapters of source material could cover.

At this rate, we could see the latest chapter animated around 2026
>> ARTICLE
If Takamura's eye actually has a serious injury then this fight could get get seriously tense. Pretty great start to it though. I love how Eagle's boxing is so textbook and the exact opposite of Hawk's boxing. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought this was supposed to be about Takamura learning himself a lesson the hard way, but the final comment by Eagle made me slightly disappointed and it's probably gonna be about animalism outlasting, well, whatever you call Eagle's style. Experience? Composure? Something like that.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I skipped the episode when Takamura trained with Miyata but I thought the eye thing would have been resolved by now? Did the anime move it around a little? I was sure that Ippo [spoiler](/s "went to the boxer turned doctor and eventually they resolved the eye issue")
>> ARTICLE
The anime skipped/cut it out.   So people not familiar with the manga, would probably be surprised by it since there wasn't more attention drawn to it to show signs of it being a potential issue.

Honestly, they probably should have left the whole thing out since they skipped it, but I guess they put it in in order to have Miyata and Ippo to meet up to watch the fight together, since that was the reason for them meeting.     
>> ARTICLE
[IIRC](/s "in the manga it was brought up and Ippo went to the doctor he defeated earlier at the same time Takamura was with miyata and Ippo called Miyata about it around the same time. It then became an implied problem during the fight because of an injury and was resolved a bit afterwards")

I havent seen the new episode but last weeks episode(?) Miyata seemed surprised he was able to sucker punch Takamura but otherwise I dont think it came up during the training

Edit - saw the ep. I could very well be wrong
>> ARTICLE
Gah why wasn't this another double episode fight?! 
>> ARTICLE
There is a chance that this fight could go 3 episodes.  So even if it was a double episode, there might still be a cliff hanger.   

Of course, there is only two more episodes left before [they will air](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/02/06/miyano-mamoru-hiroyuki-yoshino-and-fumiko-orikasa-star-in-hajime-no-ippo-the-fighting-flashback-arc) the Kamogawa/Nekota Post WWII Flashback arc that is suppose to be the last 4 episodes.   It was originally suppose to take place after the Bryan Hawk match, but didn't...

Also nice to hear Nekota talk this episode.  I assume that it was still Ichiro Nagai voice, since he died last month.
>> ARTICLE
Saw people talking about the eye thing last week in the comments, hope they don't lay into it that hard.

>> ARTICLE
Coincidentally my real life friend had to quit boxing a few weeks back because of the exact same thing. I hope it won't affect Takamura this fight, but I wouldn't be suprised to see it as an upcoming plot device.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully once this season is over, we get a quick follow up. The pacing has been really nice. Since I know the outcome of the eye situation and the fight in general, I won't go into it but I like seeing the fight animated. Looking forward to next week.

so good

 even with that one frame where Eagle's arm looks weird

Man I'm loving this fight, Eagle style reminds me alot of Floyd Mayweather's boxing style.

Hajime no Ippo is a man's anime. Hot blood, sweat, tears. Basking in its glory truly makes all men grow a second pair of testicles.

This anime influenced my life so much. Just to challenge shit and not sit at home all day. It's actually caused me to start hitting the gym, and for the past three years since I watched it, I've been going every week. Thanks Ippo.

I'll have to give it a shot.  I liked Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple, Ikkei Toussen, Tenjho Tenge, et al; this sounds like it's in a similar vein.  Thanks.

I'm a little surprised there still are people who haven't watched this show, or at least heard a great deal about it. It has a big fan following.

But anyone who hasn't watched it needs to do so now. Both seasons. Now.
>> ARTICLE
agreed, it's surprising how many people I know who claim to be "anime freaks" but still haven't watched this show.
>> ARTICLE
It has like 300 more chapters out than One Piece, Bleach, or Naruto, the big shounen three. The problems it's run into are varied, the last fight Ippo was in was just awful, and Itagaki is just turning into Ippo but with speed instead of power.

And don't even get me started on the Miyata cop-out.

I agree about Itagaki (why didn't they just keep Geromichi?), and that the fight against the monkey kid was horrid, but I don't think it's really "bad" right now, and I'm kinda glad that Ippo finally isn't jacking off to Miyata (plus, I think they're gonna meet in the world, right before or after Ippo takes on Sanchez).
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the newer chapters focusing on Itagaki's fight just don't draw me in as much anymore. Maybe it's because of the damn pun's I don't understand?
>> ARTICLE
I think every pun isu naisu.
>> ARTICLE
This year it will reach 1000 chapters in 100 volumes.

Related question, does anyone know that victory music that occasionally plays after he wins? Like, trumpets and shit and sounds like gonna fly now (the main tune from rocky) a bit. I spent ages hunting through OSTs on youtube after watching and never found it again.


also loved hajime no ippo. haven't watched the sequel yet, is that any good?

IPPO, DON'T FORGET:

RIGHT BODY BLOW!!!
>> ARTICLE
It is such a great show.  It needs another season badly!  Considering how long it was between the first and Champion Road it might be awhile though. =(

It actually is getting a third season and a movie.

What you say?! Do you have a link ?

[Here you go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_no_ippo#Third_Season) (fun fact: Takamura's VA is also the VA of fake Luffy. This is way too fitting).

Yup. Right up there with Initial D 5th Stage. Wonderful anime that just sort of left you hanging with it's awesomeness.

Take notes from this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPozj2TGGM8

Also the manga is almost up to a thousand chapters.

When will we get another season... WHENNNNNN. There's so much unanimated manga chapters ;_;

The third season is confirmed, as well as a movie.
>> ARTICLE
Ippo the anime was really a pleasant surprise and because of it I started to look for a local boxing gym, sadly there are none in my town.
>> ARTICLE
I love the anime and i was all caught up with the manga before i took a break. Is Ippo still fighting in Japan/Asia or has he finally decide to take on the world? I remember being annoyed Ippo wouldn't challenge the world.
>> ARTICLE
Everytime I do any form of physical workout the soundtrack plays in my head off instinct, I kind of like it better that way...
>> ARTICLE
yes this anime (and even moreso, the manga) is amazing. One of the reasons I got into boxing!
>> ARTICLE
My favourite anime of all time. The manga is just as incredible. Looks like I'll be re watching this now, thanks r/anime!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome show. I just caught up on the manga a few days ago, and while I'm looking forward to more, I still can't help but be annoyed that after nearly 1000 chapters, The relationship between Ippo and Kumi is still not set. Hell, you could make a better case of a love interest in Miyata at this point.
>> ARTICLE
watched all the eps and movies twice allready, cant wait for another season, this anime is stupidly good!

>> ARTICLE
Ippo is always the CHALLENGER!!!
>> ARTICLE
No. he is not.
>> ARTICLE
In his mind he is.
>> ARTICLE
thx for the back up

>> ARTICLE
It gets quite dull after about 30 episodes, as it feels you've already seen the entire anime by then. It should have just been a 24-episode anime in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
My personal opinion is that Hajime no Ippo is that it is in the bad to average range. It hits all the pitfalls that plague the generic shonen genre. The biggest flaw would be the length of the show. They do the show in 75 episodes when it should have been done in 26. Second on the list of failures would be that every fight model is the exact same with Ippo initially disadvantaged then he gains some advantage from some special training he did. After that the opponent makes a moderate come back before Ippo ultimately wins. That pattern is repeated and repeated and repeated and re....well you get my point. I will award it points for having one interesting character, Miyata, heshows such promise for greatness before being thrown aback by Ippo and his journey back up. It doesn't help that fact that I've become jaded to shows like this because of the Rocky movies which frankly outclass Hajime no Ippo in just about every area.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yes. Upvotes for Ippo. It just keeps getting better, man.
>> ARTICLE
But then, a gigantic flaming faggot appeared. His retardedness was on a level so great that Takamura literally became Albert Einstein in comparison, he craves Ippo's dick so much that he carves sausages to look like it and eats them exclusively, and has *no personality whatsoever*. Now, you're probably thinking "that's basically Geromichi without the things that make Geromichi an interesting character". Mostly, yeah, but he also has SUPER SPEED AND X-RAY VISION FOR NO REASON AND WINS MOST OF HIS MATCHES WITHOUT EVEN TRYING! What is this retarded Mary-Sue faggot's name? 

**ITAGAKI MANABU.**
>> ARTICLE
How do you really feel?
>> ARTICLE
The anime was great, the manga though... ugh. Recent arcs have just had too much Mary Sue bullcrap.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's been running for over 20 years. It's gotta have some less good parts, right? Gotta give Morikawa some credit for being such a boss.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, it's the *recent* arcs that have been really going downhill. Woli and this most recent one with Itagaki harnessing the speed force or whatever have been especially &#3232;\_&#3232; worthy in my opinion. Randy Boy Jr. was pretty meh, but not especially bad (though I would make the argument that Miyata should've fallen with all the damage he had taken, especially the way his character is set up.)
>> ARTICLE
I liked Randy Boy, but Woli was just painful. Itagaki is the worst thing that happened to the series and I seriously hope he leaves the gym to challenge Ippo and then loses and can't come back because he's a traitor and will never be forgiven and then the manga will finally get better!
>> ARTICLE
I know man.... I'm only on episode 9 right now, but i can tell that this is going to be anime that will change the way i look at life... 
>> ARTICLE
There is a scene close to the end of the series that will blow your mind. Just rewatching it gets me super pumped. It makes rewatching the anime all over again worth it just to see that climax in the story.
>> ARTICLE
Which episode/scene? I just finished it and didnt really feel like there was one epic climax. Each fight had good climaxes though.
>> ARTICLE
Ippo using Dempsey roll on Sendo. There are two versions of it though. I think it's the OVA version that is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDv3BKnJFec

When this song comes on no matter where i am, i think of that scene where he uses dempsey roll, gazelle punch etc. - oh my god i'm getting pumped thinking about this! 

Perfect anime! 
>> ARTICLE
For a while, I used to use the opening song from that first season to get pumped up/motivated before working out.  Ippo is pretty great!
>> ARTICLE
The second OP song is just as good IMO. I used to have both songs on my mp3 player when I worked out. Actually, watching Hajime no Ippo always made me want to work out.
>> ARTICLE
I love that one too.  But the first OP has a much more positive, uplifting, and can-do spirit to it.  It's great for just getting into a workout mindset and building up the motivation to leave the house and start sweating.  The second one is much more angsty and brooding - great for a me vs the world mindset of being in an actual fight.  The 2nd OP is a little better for when I'm in the middle of doing some weight lifting and struggling to crank out a set.
>> ARTICLE
I actually used the song for my work out session today!
>> ARTICLE
It get's better...sooo much better. All I can say is enjoy!

I believe you man! Thanks, I'm sure I will enjoy it :)

Love the entire series.  I just hope the anime series continues soon.  I NEED MY FIX!!!

>> ARTICLE
My favorite scene from the anime is when Takamura beats the living shit out of a grizzly bear... Then eats it.
>> ARTICLE
then wears his skin !
>> ARTICLE
This anime has easily the best fights in an anime I've ever seen. Nothing has me on the edge of my seat more than these fights.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yeah man!!! The protagonist (Ippo) connects with my personality so much that I admired him as he overcame his obstacles. Lol, stupid onions ("MOM STOP CUTTING ONIONS!!"). 
I hope new hajime no ippo episodes come out soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I literally just finished watching the whole series yesterday, it drags on a lot and the ending leaves you wishing the fighters had accomplished more. The manga continues though, so it probably has them all becoming world champs.

Good series, fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Lol @ Aoki and Kimura going to the world.
>> ARTICLE
And after you finish both anime's you can start on the near 1000 chapter manga (21 years ongoing). Lots of Ippo to come.
>> ARTICLE
972, to be exact.
>> ARTICLE
If you ever get around to reading the manga, prepare yourself. Bleach is only at 486 chapters, but Hajime no Ippo has 971 chapters and is still going strong.
>> ARTICLE
woww 971 that just shows how great of a series Ippo is!
>> ARTICLE
The more recent arks have been kinda not so great (mainly due to Itagaki existing), but it's still good overall.
>> ARTICLE
I got caught up in the manga a couple months ago. It's my second favorite (first is One Piece). Anyway, I'm not a huge an of the anime unless it's a fight scene. The animation deviates quite a bit from George Morikawa's original design (the faces look Hana Barbara-ish), and the color pallet is really limited (if I see that shade of clay brown used for one more characters hair I'm  flashing Takamura), but I'd be lying if I said the fight scenes weren't amazing. Also, awesome music. My personal favorite track is [Stand Proud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AtIhuKn2No).
>> ARTICLE
[ALL DAY EVERY DAY SON](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLwVpvV1Dc)

No, but seriously, probably [Naked Fang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoLvqSMWC38) for me, just because it always reminds of me of when Takamura and Sendo went at it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes, the great Sendomura dick-tug. Good times.
>> ARTICLE
Great, Great show don't forget to watch the OVA it picks up right after the TV show left off. I watched this show in 2011 and I'm mad because my buddy told me to watch it years ago and now you can't find it in print. Right stuf used to have the entire collection for like 5 bucks a disc and now good luck finding them.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if/when this series will continue? 
>> ARTICLE
My favourite Shounen, deserves so much more attention. Just like everyone else in here I love the soundtrack and listen to it when running. The story itself is great too, it's easy to empathise with all the characters. And finally, the fights are pretty damn exciting.

In fact, it's so compelling and motivating that it made me buy a friggin' boxing bag, no kidding.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo has most of my all-time favorite characters in any anime. Sendo, Ippo, Takamura, Vorg, Miyata and so on. It's also my all-time favorite show. It really keeps my spirits high =)
>> ARTICLE
Dont forget to watch the OVA's and New Challenger !! Ippo is my Favorite sports anime of all time :)
>> ARTICLE
The manga is close to 1000 chapters and it's still good. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished up the series a few months ago, but I was/still am in the process of losing weight. That show is quite a motivator.  The fight scenes are freaking amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I love the interaction between Kumixippoxmashiba lol
>> ARTICLE
Really loved it too. One of the few TV shows I've ever watched that actually resulted in me exercising more and so on.  That is I actually *acted* on it, as opposed to just thinking about it.

First two OPs are still on my mp3 player. Superior workout songs.

The art is a bit dated (got some pretty weird anatomy abbreviations too) and some of the non fighting stories are a bit...awkward but an amazing show overall.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't think it'll be that good since it is old (Hajime No Ippo and Slam Dunk proves that wrong). But, after watching Real Steel at school, i had a sudden feeling to watch a boxing show, which is when i turned to Hajime No Ipppo, and it was definitely worth it.
>> ARTICLE
So has anyone heard any news of when the new season of Hajime No Ippo  is coming out?
>> ARTICLE
I leave the Angel Beats OST running when I sleep every night. It's pretty good background. That being said, I also have ClariS thrown in the playlist with it.
>> ARTICLE
[Brave Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYv_LV_xNJA) is perfect for going to sleep to.
>> ARTICLE
+1 to Angel Beats. Usually I only pick a few great songs from OSTs, but AB OST has a wide range, from epic (*theme of SSS*, *critical point*) to repeatable BGM (*school days*, *tactics*).
>> ARTICLE
[Samurai Champloo for sure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9hwjQBQFIo)

RIP Nujabes. My favorite artist by far.
>> ARTICLE
Favorite Soundtracks:

* Cowboy Bebop

* Samurai Champloo

* FLCL

Favorite OP' and EDs:

* Durarara!!

* Ergo Proxy

* Darker than Black


>> ARTICLE
[Fate/Zero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3UAZ0kCUWI&list=FLpJW4LdYIMlRreSNDv9Sblg&index=9&feature=plpp_video) has by far my favorite anime soundtrack.

K-ON, love every single song, holy shit

No mention of Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon yet? 'Tis one *damn* fine OST. And quite incredibly varied, too.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
[This one is my favorite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDJ8sKI0qlQ).
>> ARTICLE
Really love *Eureka Seven*'s. I'm digging *Astral Ocean*'s soundtrack, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think I like the original music better. *Astral Ocean* has some nice tracks, but it just doesn't measure up. I hope that changes as the anime progresses, but there just isn't any more room for new music with the 9 episodes left.

*fingers crossed for multiple seasons*
>> ARTICLE
A few that come to my mind are:  
[Welcome to the NHK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4VN0in4weA)  
[Shiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pbSDqruMY)  
[FLCL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEuDdgixhL4)  
[Bakemonogatari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEIZ5YogmEw)  
[Katanagatari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNtzmOliIos)  
[Yosuga no Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLQgPAwH-FY)  
[Angel Beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xxzH5wPQFY)  
[Oreimo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvxSMoODyWI)

[Ben-To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRnAp4bX2_g)  

Edit: Updated with examples.
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe this is the only post so far that mentions Katanagatari.  I absolutely loved that soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
Darker Than Black,
Cowboy Bebop,
TTGL,
FLCL,
Angel Beats, 
Baccano and DRRR,
Champloo,
Bake and Nisemonogatari, 
Hellsing,
and Air Gear.

I'm sure there are more but i cant remember much more off the top of my head
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari OST
>> ARTICLE
I've been listening to this for the past couple days,  it's so good.  I've probably listened to all the openings, as well as the ending, at least two dozen times in the past 72hrs.
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari OP4 is probably the cutest thing I've ever heard, along with Platinum Disco. :)
>> ARTICLE
Renai Circulation(OP4) is actually my favorite opening from Bakemonogatari. I just love the full version of that song . She has such a sweet sounding voice that goes so well with the music. 
>> ARTICLE

Awesome, I agree with most of those. No Mushi-Shi love though :(
>> ARTICLE
[Personally love this track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ewe2uF6O4)
>> ARTICLE
I'll particularly point out Simoun from that list, mostly because out of all the shows listed there, it's the one that's most likely to go completely unrecognized by most people.

If you are not at all familiar with it and you're looking for good anime soundtracks I would highly suggest you check it out, because it's absolutely fantastic. The show itself is also a downright masterpiece, but that's... beside the point.

Here's a few of the really good tracks:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyHmKEOMxQ  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwCd5tiEIsQ   
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO5cjevq1CQ

It's also got a great [OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbXGvku8dug) and [ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7SgOZmxlX0), while we're at it. I don't think those really count as part of the OST, but it's still worth mentioning.


>> ARTICLE
The Durarara soundtrack makes me happy inside.

And surprisingly enough, the soundtrack to Queen's Blade too.
>> ARTICLE
Anything Yuki Kajiura composes (Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero...) is genius in my eyes 
>> ARTICLE
I wholeheartedly concur! I have every one of her soundtracks, even for games and shows I never watched, because I love the music so much. Some of my favorites of hers have been .hack//SIGN and Tsubasa Chronicle, but they're all amazing. Fate/Zero was particularly good.
>> ARTICLE
On a different note, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt's is pretty solid.  Give it a listen!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDFBO41K-r4
>> ARTICLE
I agree I really enjoyed the panty and stocking soundtrack, it has a variety of different types of music. 

I also enjoy this song, it is not from the OST but is about Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt

>> ARTICLE
So true. The concert at AX this year was one of the best things I've gone to recently--everything is gorgeous, and it was such a rush to see it live.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the soundtracks from Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu/Shoushitsu,

especially [Itsumo no Fuukei Kara Hajimaru Monogatari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3FRcBM1wcw).

Also anything from Kajiura Yuki is great.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really think of a favourite but I really liked the soundtrack from "Spice and Wolf". The atmosphere it creates is so immersive, you feel like you're in the middle ages. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Hajime No Ippo New Challenger's opening: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHc78DyBFxU

TBH there are so many OST's that I love. A more recent one would be Madoka Magica's opening by ClariS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS7IjBJgJvE

Guilty Crown has always been an all time favorite of mines too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV-jTX4HIzs

Pretty much everything in my playlist I love: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC05B6E57E1B280EC&feature=mh_lolz

Haha..
>> ARTICLE
I preferred the original Ippo score to the New Challenger one. Either way they both were pretty good. I missed hearing "IT'S A COUNTERRRRRR" and this playing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoLvqSMWC38
>> ARTICLE
They're both great! I also like Inner Light along with the original opening. In terms of score, I like Stand Proud: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNCAdxbxbRI Obviously it takes inspiration from Rocky.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown just came out this year. 
>> ARTICLE
Last Year, but what's your point?
>> ARTICLE
"Has always been an all time favorite of mine" makes it sound like it has been out for a long time. It's pretty new.
>> ARTICLE
Well, all-time is relative to how long he's been watching anime, so what if he just started? Additionally, it could be used to emphasis the fact that he really loves GC. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to go with The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya's OST more specifically [Kyon's Theme] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02suPvuSkeI)
>> ARTICLE
I thought Erik Satie fit perfectly with that movie. Got goosebumps when [Gymnopedie no. 1 came up.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU)
>> ARTICLE
I always liked Haibane Renmei's OST. It had a real ethereal and otherworldly feel to it that really helped set the peaceful atmosphere of the anime. Also pretty much any jazz-related OST I dig (Bebop, Darker Than Black, Baccano, etc).
>> ARTICLE
Hell yes, Haibane Renmei. Here are a few examples:

[Free Bird (OP)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paN2a9y1-Cs). This is the *other* Free Bird.

[Just some ordinary, everyday background music.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHWie5-1ORM)

[To the Town.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBnykw4obwY) This is the song that plays right before we see the masked mute traders from outside the walls of town. Nice harmonica.

[A random piece.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFFiimEuEgc) This one has a bit of a darker tone, which suits the way the story progresses.
>> ARTICLE
All your links are great examples of the amazing music in Haibane Renmei. If I may also add to your links:

[Rustle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq8qMnFgWAg)

[Refrain of Memory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36DgAT5jWMY) - played when Rakka and Kana are up on the clocktower.

[Free Bird (Vocal Version)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuvVhffqrlU) - a bit different to the instrumental OP, but just as beautiful

Haibane Renmei had some of the best and most evocative background music I've heard and I find the whole series quite undervalued. People decry the weird setting or the slow pace, but I think it's one of the most beautiful anime out there. It's definitely made me more a fan of Yoshitoshi Abe's work (not that I wasn't one already).

Surprisingly, Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's has a pretty amazing soundtrack.

I like Darker Then Black Season 1, Digimon The Movie, Nurarihyon No Mago, a few from Bleach, and the Best Of Pokemon. Also various themes from Code Geass, Fairy Tail, Soul Eater, and more Digimon.
>> ARTICLE
.Hack//Sign's OST left the biggest imprint in my head out of the one's I've heard (which is a fair amount.) It is by far my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Anything by Tenmon or Yoko Kanno.  Makoto Shinkai's art direction combined with Tenmon's music is like nothing else.  Ghost in the Shell and Cowboy Bebop are both Yoko Kanno's work but she's made *so many* other soundtracks as well.

I'm also addicted to the Cave Story+ soundtrack, it suits the game perfectly.

Pretty much anything made by LiSA.

Code Geass also has an amazing soundtrack.

Angel Beats. Nuff said. Now, if we can bring visual novels into this, Katawa Shoujo's was incredible. Very calming, and brilliantly wrote. Spice and Wolf as well, had a pretty nice old timey feel, as well as just...for lack of better words, warmth.
>> ARTICLE
Despite watching them a good while ago, I'm still listening to soundtracks from: Berserk, Busou Renkin, Darker Than Black, FLCL Hellsing, Mushishi, Shippuuden, Akagi/Kaiji/Death Note (Taniuchi Hideki FTW) and Vision of Escaflowne.

Sora no Woto, Horizon's OST, and Shigofumi's OST are probably my top three.

Clannad, Kanon (Jun Maeda); pretty much all the Ghibli films (Joe Hisaishi); 5 cm/s (Tenmon). I would say with those three musicians, you can put together a playlist of songs a day long where you'll love every new tune that comes along.

Saint Seiya has the best BGM in the medium by far. I have yet to find an anime with the same amount of quality and quantity.

Too bad it didn't air in the US, Saint Seiya is bigger than DBZ in France and Latin American countries.
>> ARTICLE
That is right

Saint Seiya and Dragon Ball here in Brazil is pretty famous even to people who dont watch animes,
the reason i think is because of the DUB (which is very great).
You could feel what was happening to the characters thanks to the voice actors.

They did an incredible job.

Welcome to the NHK is one of my favorites as well. The Hellsing OST was very good as well. Though I have listed to the Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei OSTs more than any of those. [Classic, and terribly funny](http://youtu.be/tDiHGmGJxSE)

>> ARTICLE
I'll throw in some more offbeat ones

* *Chikyuu Shoujo Arjuna*. Beautiful, airy, eerie soundtrack by Yoko Kanno between Cowboy Bebop and Wolf's Rain. [Resonance of the Earth] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJV6jAyfOs4) and [Bike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InuI2XCHd2o) are good examples of the instumental and vocal (by Maaya Sakamoto) tracks.

* *Hourou Musuko*. Lots of beaitful piano pieces. Very minimalist, but beautiful. [ is a great example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-CJ9YKaOOE).

* *Kimagure Orange Road*. Pretty much *the* signature Shiro Sagisu Soundtracks, in my opinion. Lots of great 80s synth, pop, and saxophone jazz, such as the iconic ["Madoka's Theme ~ In Lovers Room"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAUsbfteeTk) and [Back to the Red Straw Hat Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wADOmjXw7RQ). The vocal songs are excellent, such as [ (like a Salvia Flower)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnF7UZgPi6U), sung by Kanako Wada.

Welcome to the NHK is my favorite but I also like Gurren Lagann, Ao no Exorcist, Kaiji, Death Note, all the big three, Angel Beats and now Kuroko`s Basketball cant wait for the ost to come out and more that I can't think of
>> ARTICLE
The *Vision of Escaflowne* soundtrack is one of my personal favorites--the composer did a great job of capturing a lot of different moods for the show in the music. Another one that stands out to me is the original *Fullmetal Alchemist* soundtrack. I love the FMA:B soundtrack, as well, but I think the original was better in many ways.

And of course anything by Joe Hisaishi (Ghibli movies) and Yuki Kajiura (*Madoka*, *Tsubasa Chronicle*, *.hack//*, *Fate/Zero*, etc...). I fall asleep to their soundtracks on a regular basis. They are some of my favorite soundtrack composers overall. Yuki even beats James Horner and John Williams for me!
>> ARTICLE
Right now I'm playing quite a few. Tops right now would have to be Baccano!, Sword of the Stranger, Clannad, Sakamichi no Appallon and Angel Beats!
>> ARTICLE
all of the original Naruto ost, they fit so perfectly in every situation any of them are used

Durarara's first opening song is the only one I can think of that I actually listened to every episode.

Angel Beats!, Evangelion, Toradora (OP1), Gintama (OP1), Elfen Lied, TTGL, Bakemono (snail OP), Nisemono (Platinum Disco), Code Geass (OP2), Attack On Titan, Baccano, Anohana, SAO (dat LiSA). The list goes on.

Best ED has to go to either Attack On Titan (ED1), Bebop, or FLCL (The Pillows etc)
>> ARTICLE
> Attack On Titan (ED1)

AoT's ED2 is actually one of my favorites ever.   It might be because of references only manga-readers would get, though.  I like the song, too, tho.
>> ARTICLE
OH... I totally forgot about the second ED. That one's great too.

Yes also Gate of Steiner,is also my favorite soundtrack in Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
ha~acking to the gate!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
So true
>> ARTICLE
Even better than "Tank!"?
>> ARTICLE
Its a tough choice, I think Baccano! has the better visuals, which edges it out.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano vs Cowboy Bebop openings are an inevitable comparison. It's hard to say one isn't heavily inspired by the other.
>> ARTICLE
Though I don't doubt it's easier to say Baccano is inspired by the Bebop opening since Bebop came first. Not that's necessarily true, though.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion's is awesome and probably my favorite and I don't even like the show
>> ARTICLE
I'm a big fan of [Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei's (NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8ODecbuhA).  Just so WTF much like the show itself and I love the song.

First season of bleach opening theme
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the only real representation of the Bleach aesthetic that got me into Bleach. Unfortunately, that waned out eventually and I just lost interest.
>> ARTICLE
I know exactly what you mean
>> ARTICLE
[Tabi no Tochuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6q1AWnjNiU) for Spice and Wolf is fantastic. Fits the mood of the show perfectly IMO
>> ARTICLE
Ones I remember clearly and fondly are

Ranma 1/2 first opening (Yapapaa, yepapapa! Don;t know the name of the song but that should make sense if you know it)

Chobits OP

Bleach OP that starts 'Woke up with you this morning, I still alive..." Rocked that out in some Karaoke in Roppongi years ago

Bakemonogatari's Tsubasa Cat opening "Sugar Sweet Nightmare" (And all the other opens as someone else mentioned)

Samurai Champloo's opening

One Piece "We go!"
>> ARTICLE
[Ranma  - Opening 1 "Jajauma ni Sasenaide" ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUjD5cfWPo)
>> ARTICLE
this always brings a smile to my face. that and the grandpa pervert who steals girls' underwear. :D
>> ARTICLE
 Yappa Paa I believe is ranma's 1st opening. 
>> ARTICLE
>Bleach OP that starts 'Woke up with you this morning, I still alive..." Rocked that out in some Karaoke in Roppongi years ago

Same band as the [OP for Beck.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ot0IpmdOMI) They're called Beat Crusaders.
>> ARTICLE
[The Bleach opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s94SBuQ99U)
>> ARTICLE
The Monogatari Series (Bake-,Nise-, Neko-, SS) has the best openings in my opinion b/c they've had 13 and they're all great 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not going to lie; while I don't like *Bakemonogatari* and I have yet to see any other Monogatari series, *Bakemonogatari* had some really good openings.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still sad contract shennanigans kept shinobu from having one 
>> ARTICLE
Same since I've never heard Maaya Sakamoto sing even though I know she has albums and stuff 
>> ARTICLE
The best among them I'd say are Marshmellow Justice(Karen Bee), Platinum Disco(Tsukihi Phoenix) and Chocolate Insomnia(Nekomonogatari: Shiro, Tsubasa Tiger).

Although I do have a special place in my heart for the [Best Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWKfGd2ZH68) opening.
>> ARTICLE
> Platinum Disco(Tsukihi Phoenix)

Best part of Nise. 
>> ARTICLE
Platinum Approved
>> ARTICLE
I personally really like the Saito Chiwa ones as well. Futakotome and Staple Stable.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes [Platinum Disco](http://vimeo.com/72708070), I can't get that song out of my head.  It's got that funky Japanese twist!
>> ARTICLE
I really have a hard time picking favorites b/w them all, but I think "perfect slumbers" (Neko:Kuro) would be my fav overall bc I love Yui Horie's singing. But if I went by season it'd go Ambivalent World (Bake-), Platinum Disco (Nise-), and Happy Bite (SS)
>> ARTICLE
I kind of feel that Ambivalent World is the weakest of all of the OPs. By no means am I saying it is bad, just not as good as the rest of them.

But then again, out of all of the members of the Araragi Harem, I like Kanbaru the least, so that may factor into that view somewhat.
>> ARTICLE
Well fuck you then. Just kidding. I like all of
Bakemonogatari's ops equally, but ambivalent world is the one I'm feeling the most right now though. 
>> ARTICLE
and whats great is that all the monogatari OPs make really good work out music. 
>> ARTICLE
ha, very true. I get so much energy when Kaerimichi comes on
>> ARTICLE
that and marshmallow justice is my cardio/running songs. the best. lol
>> ARTICLE
I would pick Sugar Sweet Nightmare, or Staple Stable.

But Sugar Sweet Nightmare for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
My reaction to Platinum Disco, and Monogatari in general, was:

"The hell is this

And Why do I love it?"
>> ARTICLE
[You forgot the best one!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEoMI9BwHp4)
>> ARTICLE
I..I think it's telling us to smoke weed.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually been practicing my gifmaking by making sets of what I consider to be the best anime OPs of all time.

[The current list](http://beamspams.tumblr.com/tagged/anime-openings):

 Fate/Zero - "To the Beginning"  
 Eureka 7 - Shounen Heart  
 Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha As - Eternal Blaze  
 Baccano! - Guns & Roses  
 Trigun - H.T  
 Soul Eater - Papermoon  
 Gundam Wing - Rhythm Emotion  
 Sailor Moon - Moonlight Densetsu  
 Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - Sorairo Days  
 Dragon Ball Z - Cha-La Head-Cha-La"  
 Neon Genesis Evangelion - A Cruel Angels Thesis  
 Cowboy Bebop - Tank!  

Still on my list to do:

Darker than Black - "Howling"  
Gundam 00 - "Daybreak's Bell"  
Gundam SEED - "Realize"  
Macross Frontier - "Lion"  
Attack on Titan - "Guren no Yumiya"

and the OPs to Death Note and Ghost in the Shell SAC which I am forgetting right now.

I think I have a pretty comprehensive list. But if anyone has anything I'm missing I'm glad to add it to the collection.
>> ARTICLE
Have you considered Samurai Champloo?
>> ARTICLE
I have not! I've actually never seen it. It's the same people as Cowboy Bebop, right? 
>> ARTICLE
yes, and is a spiritual successor.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats for me
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats' opening was amazing
>> ARTICLE
I've always loved the opening to Stand Alone Complex.  Oh and Cardcaptor Sakura first season opener is a guilty pleasure of mine.
>> ARTICLE
aria gloris right?  great tune.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say black lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
Just living in the database
>> ARTICLE
The progression was weird too, first episode had me feeling like whaaat? Then the second I was begrudgingly accepting it was a bit catchy, then third I was actively enjoying... since the fourth episode it has been consistently getting me pumped up for each new episode.
>> ARTICLE
I whisper along to the lyrics now...
>> ARTICLE
Most of the time when I watch anime I only watch the OP once. This is the first opening I keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
[Death Note 2nd OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGQAjAjsZNo)
>> ARTICLE
This opener brings back all the memories of how intense this show was. So representative of the screwed up nature of the story.
>> ARTICLE
My friend was watching death note and she said she felt scared for her sanity after she saw the 2nd OP
>> ARTICLE
It does that

Wow, haven't heard any Asian Kung-Fu Generation in a while.

Naruto had some other OP's that were really great too. The one I remember most easily is [7!!'s (7 oops) Lovers](http://youtu.be/MF8kHWWFO10)
>> ARTICLE
I was never a big fan of Naruto, but I remember hearing that OP and thinking "hell yeah I gotta download that"
>> ARTICLE
Naruto had a lot of good OPs. I am glad that when I was 16 I was too tired to care so much about what I watched.
>> ARTICLE
And now watching the OPs is really nostalgic, I love it!

(though I still watch naruto)
>> ARTICLE
[BTOOOM!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRmY907sJw) OP has become one of my favorites recently.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think this is Kemu's weakest song. Sure, the TV version is quite catchy, and then you listen to the full version and you realize it's actually super repetitive... 

Though if you liked the opening and if you only know this song from him, I definitely recommend to check his other works. He's, originally, a Vocaloid producer, so it may be off putting at first, but if you take time to just enjoy the song, you might get something good from it.  
>> ARTICLE
Oh! I forgot about that one. Definitely up there on my list.
>> ARTICLE
Deadman Wonderland!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZ-UpjtlXY
>> ARTICLE
Ugh... really? I always thought it sounded like some shitty Alice in Chains cover band....

Oh well we're all allowed to have our opinions :)
>> ARTICLE
They're actually an Fade cover band :)
They're called the Deadman Wonderband and I like their version better than the original (One Reason by Fade)

I like both Alice in Chains and Escape the Fate, but I like the Wonderland version better. I don't know why. Could be Nostalgia goggles.
>> ARTICLE
the band is called "Fade" not "the Deadman Wonderband".
>> ARTICLE
Crap! That's right! It's Fade not Escape the fate! (Was like 3 am when I wrote that) Sorry, but I do believe the opening is done by a cover band. Maybe I'm wrong, But I distinctly remember the attributing Artist being Deadman WonderBand. Will edit my previous post
>> ARTICLE
no, the song is by [Fade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICpzoZozwCU).

there is no band called Deadman Wonderband.
>> ARTICLE
I really like that op in fact I like it more than the actual show.
>> ARTICLE
[Legend of the Galactic Heroes - Sea of the Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUf-8aXt9Hw)

First  Durarara! Opening.

I like Kuroko no Basket's first and third opening. 
>> ARTICLE
what about the current ED? When I heard it for the first time, I downloaded and listened to it so much I got sick of it.
But yeah, the first OP is epic.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously no Raildex OPs, each one has atleast 1m+ views

Guilty Crown "My Dearest"

FMA Brotherhood Opening 4-"Period" 
The moment Pride is revealed behind the stone, it's just mind blowing 
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka- Mikansei Stride, the opening was so uplifting and cheerful i couldn't help but watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate and Attack on Titan those were the only intros I could actually sit and watch through. Though I usually skip past the intros...

EDIT: I forgot!! Death Note's intros were also quite cool! :3 
>> ARTICLE
elfen lied, hands down the best.

>> ARTICLE
I have a lot of favorites, but I think [Utena's OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL25C0H9vVw) is the one I always come back to when I try to pick just one.

It does everything I like in a OP. It has interesting visuals, a catchy song, it introduces the characters, and it straight-up tells you what the entire story of the showt(though in trademark Utena fashion, it's doing so in a very round about way).
>> ARTICLE
The Supernatural anime. Why? Because it doesn't have an opening. Yea, I know it's a cop out, but in my eyes openings are just a waste of 2 minutes that would have been better spent on the anime. 

But, if you twisted my arm for an answer I'd say say [Eden of the East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pdqeu9LW2c). It's Oasis man...
>> ARTICLE
The opening I never expected and honestly one of the few times I watched the opening for every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Because lets be honest, it eventually became the best part of Eden of the East.

[Lucky Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80l6tvxTpTI) obviously.

[Fang of the Sun DOUGRAM - "Saraba Yasashiki Hibi yo"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u79TyE9XYUA)

My favorite (since this is solely based on personal opinion) is the first opening of Haganai / Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. I love that song, and the visuals themselves are really good.
>> ARTICLE
[The Season 2 opening for Kuroko no Basket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcF4Bjr-kIk). I fell in love with this opening before I had even watched any of the show. Such an awesome song with great visuals.
>> ARTICLE
YES. YES.
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni
>> ARTICLE
It was as creepy as the show and I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the openings for Madoka Magica & Guilty Crown

This season I'm in love with the following openings:

- Nisekoi
- Nagi no Asukara
- Noragami
- Engaged to the Unidentified

I probably have A LOT more openings I love, but just can't remember... :(
>> ARTICLE
Unpopular opinion :

I don't really dislike Nagi no Asukara's openings, but... Damn, I don't understand why it's so well received. The animation is beautiful and all but, other than that, I find each ending in itself to be pretty average. It doesn't help that I feel like Kawada Mami's voice is modified quite noticeably in the post-prod, but that is probably just my imagination...

Oh yeah, and Engaged to the Unidentified. Damn. Junky knows his shit. It's pretty "generic" in a sense but it's damn catchy. And the bouncing boobs.

**Edit for clarification : I'm talking about the OPs** 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I'm evaluating NagiAsu compared to other series that have aired in the fall which is why I value it so highly (since, in my opinion, it wasn't a very blessed season). Also, I find the way character progression is to be one of the best (considering one of the themes of the anime involve growing up & moving on). I haven't given it a really proper analysis at all since I've been pretty absorbed, so I wouldn't be the best person as of yet to give an accurate reason why it's so damn good.

Engaged is great. I love the cast & the comedy/romance that hilarity ensues from.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no no, I mean, the openings (both Engaged to the Unidentified and NagiAsu). Ah shit. I failed with my words again!

I really like Nagi no Asukara as well, but I'm not as fond as some others of the openings, and even the endings, that's what I meant.
>> ARTICLE
LOL oh, that's what you meant. 

It's all fine, opinions differ so I don't expect everyone to feel the beauty of the openings like I do. I also think that the visuals aid in my deciding factor if I like an opening or not. Every time I'd listen to the song, memories fly back into my head

>> ARTICLE
Well, too bad for me, I don't usually listen to the OPs more than once, except when it's super catchy, like Engaged [...]'s OP (+ biased because Junky is/was a Vocaloid producer I can appreciate) or I'm totally fine with the genre (eg Log Horizon's Database, Noragami's OP and ED).

Then there's the moment when I'm tired of waiting 1 minute and 30 seconds for the episode to start (usually around half of the anime's length) and then I'll start to skip it everytime.
>> ARTICLE
It depends for me, if I am hyped up for the next episode, I will watch the OP to get a even more hyped-up feeling. 

If you've ever watched Madoka Magica, that was a prime example of how the OP just gave me this feeling of chills & excitement.

Same with the currently airing, Noragami & Mikakunin
>> ARTICLE
The [Guilty Crown OP1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjUtmbZt8zc) (only up to ep 9 so far) is amazing. The first 25s gives me chills because it's just beautiful and fits so well with the music.
>> ARTICLE
The second opening is also very beautifully composed, but it feels more fast-paced & energetic. Both are composed by supercell (with the second opening under the alias "EGOIST").
>> ARTICLE
Second opening also has a different singer.
>> ARTICLE
supercell always mixes up their singers from what I've seen
>> ARTICLE
[Shin Mazinger Z](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grK1I_6k_b8)
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah! Kanjite Knight is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
i'm so glad they did an update on Mazinger Z, the original is almost unwatchable at this point.
>> ARTICLE
>the original is almost unwatchable at this point.

Oh, I wouldn't say that. The Toei series has its own charms. Shin is pretty amazing though.
>> ARTICLE
It's good to see the classics in action, like Space Battleship Yamato 2199. 
>> ARTICLE
00 Gundam had some pretty rad openings.
>> ARTICLE
That 2nd ED though...
>> ARTICLE
Possibly Clannad: After Story for me. That one always gets me.
>> ARTICLE
Air Gear
>> ARTICLE
I can't decide on a single one as the best...but [Log Horizon.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0P3kR9g_Ks) I can't not watch the whole opening each episode. Plus it led to amazing gifs like [these](http://i.imgur.com/XwDGpW0.gif) [two.](http://shiftsubs.ru/img/DATABASE.gif)

Soul eater's openings are good, I prefer the first one
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Eureka Seven's third opening. You can view it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg7EQpMMUq0). It's one of my favorite OP's, although it's a little spoiler-y.

Mirai Nikki and both Sword Art Online openings are very replayable for me, the remain my favorites. 

other honorable mentions are the OPs for 
-HOTD
-Chobits
-Eureka 7: AO
-Mysterious Girlfriend X
-Shuffle!
>> ARTICLE
Even though it's mainstream a hell, I thought that Bleach's second OP was amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
The Steins:Gate OP will forever be my number 1.
>> ARTICLE
Lain's OP always has a special place in my heart.

In terms of sheer epic factor I'd have to go with Black Lagoon or the AoT first OP.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who has seen Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) would agree that their opening kicks ass.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's probably Btooom!'s first opening "No pain,no game" 
>> ARTICLE
[This one for sure! Turn on captions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2NHwqqaGpU)
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate (Hacking to the Gate), Fate Zero (To the Beginning), and Neon Genesis Evangelion (Cruel Angel's Thesis)
>> ARTICLE
To add to this discussion -- I feel that the opening of Gunslinger Girl really sets the mood of the series. I believe the song is titled "The Light Before we Land".
>> ARTICLE
I personally love the opening for [Gravitation](http://youtu.be/Tkj2UzD_oZw).
>> ARTICLE
Working!!'s [Someone Else](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al5ShpXbcp4) is the most fun, catchy, sing-along-in-your-car OP i've ever heard.
>> ARTICLE
[**Speed Grapher**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPZDVaT9-ek), for having a Duran Duran song, befitting it's theme.
>> ARTICLE
That one's probably one of the best uses of licensed music for fitting a theme. It's a real shame they couldn't get the license to use it on the NA (and other regions?) DVDs and we just got a kind of generic sounding piece instead.

>> ARTICLE
I've seen a lot...But I'd have to give my vote to Arpeggio of Blue Steel (Aoki Hagane No Arupejio) because the opening song is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
impossible to discern which is the best OP. But a good one from recent seasons is Hataraku Maou-Sama OP
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown! My favourite is Everlasting Guilty Crown though, that opening was just amazing. My Dearest is great too though :)

Currently, Nagi no Asukara's ebb and flow since... well, watch it and you'll just drown in feels.
>> ARTICLE
Very best OP is [Record of Lodoss War](http://youtu.be/blICu7KsmyA)'s opening. The visuals and the music mesh together so well. I really wish they would remake the series with the visual quality of the OP.
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody ever try the search bar before they post this thread? It basically shows up once every two weeks.

Anyways, I think the Nichijou openings are fantastic. The songs are catchy and the animation is good.
>> ARTICLE
The movie "Sword of the Stranger" and every fight in it. 10/10 as far as fight choreography and animation goes.
>> ARTICLE
That's in my top ten of best animated fights ever. Really top five. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It might not be very flashy but choreography is very good.
>> ARTICLE
Now you're talking about studio Bones my friend, Bones is the best studio for fight animation ( Soul eater, FMA, DTB,...). 
Edit : I correct FML to FMA.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if that was supposed to be a joke, but you put FML(Fuck My Life) not FMA(Full Metal Alchemist).
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, it was mistake haha. I don't know how i miss it.

Pretty sure not enough people watched Sekai Seifuku last season. It had a handful of great [fight](http://i.imgur.com/ksAasYK.gif) [scenes](http://i.imgur.com/kb18qqV.gif).

Oh thanks, I've been wondering what "that anime with the smart prince kid and the spear chick" was called for forever. I remember seeing an episode or two on Adult Swim a long time ago.

I feel like Gintama's fights get overlooked a lot. It doesn't have many of them, at least as far as I am in the series, but they're great. The [Gintoki vs Benizakura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_LHHHi4Mw) fight is AWESOME and pretty much propelled me to keep watching (at 70+ episodes in, lol) It has some excellent animation that would surprise me under most circumstances. I'm only at episode 123, so please no spoilers on future fights please.

I would also want to highlight a fight from One Piece Film Z. Yeah, it's not canon. Yeah, it's also One Piece (Although I feel that it gets very very overlooked on this subreddit) but STILL. This is a great fight. The last few minutes of [Luffy and Zephyr POUNDING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF EACH OTHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsBhpjalZy4) with no music or anything playing in the background... it was powerful. The next scene was just as good, but I don't want to spoil that. 

EDIT: I keep thinking about this. Yu Yu Hakusho has some amazing fights, too many to name, that people have probably overlooked as time goes by. It's not that common to find YYH fans around anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that OP fight. And yes yyh had amazing fights. Kuramas true power was so terrifying back on adult swim....  The entire show had amazing scenes and writing (not that surprising...)
>> ARTICLE
Kurama was by far my favorite character. Rare to find someone so badass with... for lack of a better term... so much swagger.
>> ARTICLE
YYH is best shounen and god damn if The Dark Tournament doesn't have the best fights ever!!!
>> ARTICLE
I'm loyal to One Piece as far as my stake in "best shounen" goes. Damn if YYH didn't get me hype though. I should finish it soon.
>> ARTICLE
Best fight is actually at the end of the arc after the Dark Tournament Arc so it gets more intense if you haven't seen it yet. Also Hunter x Hunter is made by the creator of YYH and everyone's usual choice for best shounen at least on this site. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, TRUST ME, I know about HxH fans on this subreddit. I like it too, but for other things than what I get out of my favorites. I feel like some hear of HxH and watch it, then proclaim it the "greatest shonen of all time" despite never giving other series a chance. It's frustrating to me personally.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but I'd still put HxH over One Piece any day personally, the world building is better on One Piece and if we're talking about anime then One Piece is pretty horrendous at times with excessive dragging with the pace, and awful animation while HxH the animation is excellent through out the entire thing and the pacing is really fast for the first half of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I mean if you're talking anime, yeah sure. Manga... I'd be hard pressed to agree. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know what you mean! For YYH, I just love Yusuke so much. That punk and general badass attitude combined with backing it up with his bare hands just really hits home for me. The powers of all the characters and variety that you see in the Dark Tournament is also one of my favorites. Sorry to ramble but the pacing is also one of the best imo because of how smoothly the fights start and end in about 2/3 episodes without dragging forever. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's really great honestly and deserves more recognition. The characters are all very well done and yeah I agree with everything you said. The pacing is like INCREDIBLY fast. I gotta finish it soon...
>> ARTICLE
I think your nostalgia hits you harder than you realize and you're giving it too much credit the only thing Yu Yu Hakusho had going on for itself were the characters, character are great for the most part but the show constantly relies on asspulls and power ups to keep the show going, fights don't even matter as all the main characters have severe plot armor and only win or lose to keep the story going, the pace is decent but it's nothing spectacular, the Sensui fight alone lasted like 10 episodios I think and that's excluding all the episodes of how they got to him. As did the fight with Toguro that last like 5 or 7 episodes, the less important fights did last around 2 episodes at least.

I think YYH was great practice for the author so he could write HxH better and not make the same mistakes he did.

See. See. That's what happens when you give Gainax a budget.

Best fight for me is the last fight in the Kenichi series. You know the one where the other leader battles him and he uses all of his masters training.

Other than that I agree with Hajime no Ippo, although that was the anime for me that opened up my life to more anime.
>> ARTICLE
For me its Accelerator vs Awaki (Index II Ep 7) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pREOMmhHyU8.  Short and to the point. 
>> ARTICLE
second that!
>> ARTICLE
Any fight from Birdy the mighty decode (and by extention its 2nd series). 

The cinematography (i think its called) is absolutely outstanding. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, i love the show and the fight scenes in particular we're amazing.  Some of the season 2 fights were a lot like the Pein vs Naruto fight.  Heck the fighting scenes were so good they put em in the new superman movie.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari fight between Shichika and Sabi in episode 4. Don't think anyone has seen it :-D 
>> ARTICLE
Is that the one they just talk about after the fact but never actually show?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. They go on and on about how amazing and close and epic the fight was. All we get is a small preview clip from the previous episode's "next time on..." segment.
>> ARTICLE
As an action lover, this is my list of must see:

* Berserk(all of it is badass-except that part...you know)
* Cowboy Bebop: The Movie
* a handful of bleach and naruto/shippuden when they don't anime logic it to shit
* same applies to fate/zero
* Death Note if you count intellectual fights
* Samurai Champloo at the beginning and towards the end
* a few burst epic moments from Soul eater and Madoka Magicka
* Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood(good story, handful of decent fights)

Top fight(obviously IMO): Naruto Shippuden - Madara vs Shinobi Alliance (even though I'm pretty sure it wasn't in the manga...loved it)
>> ARTICLE
I would kill to see some of the later fights of Berserk animated. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah hate the rest of Naruto all you like but when he fights smart (instead of just applying power creep) it's usually entertaining as hell.

And that Madara fight is insane. I literally had my jaw on the floor watching it.

Any fight scene from Karas

Takamura vs Bryan Hawk in Hajime no Ippo New Challenger.

[Kotomine vs Kiritsugu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkvauvbFYj8)

Fate/Zero is mostly talking but when there is fight it is perfect. I always loved when Saber were fighting. You could feel she was using heavy sword and heavy armor. Even gilgamesh "Fights" were cool to watch.

Tenjou Tenge has alot of fights and all of them are very brutal. It's not that realistic but i had fun watching it, especialy that it has alot of Kenichi vibes for me only darker and more bloody.

Almost all fights in Kenichi are cool. Not often in anime you can see real life material arts. But recently one of my favorite fights were in OVA 2 of kenichi. I don't know why but i just love it.

Every fight made by Studio Bones is the best at all.

Im sure alot of people have seen it (or maybe not) but buddy complex the extended coupling the background music make it even more better

The last fight in S-Cry-Ed. For some reason  that fight has wedge itself in my head as the manliest fight ever. (it is not.) 
>> ARTICLE
I like when Natsu was fighting the 2nd guild master and used Laxus' lightning.
>> ARTICLE
should be a little over 100 episodes or so with the new season in 2009.  I hear there is talks of another season, but as the saying goes, talk is cheap.
>> ARTICLE
oh yeah, plus the two oavs
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't there an announcement that a new season/OVA would air/be-sold in Q1 next year?
>> ARTICLE
This is by far a top 5 anime for me and I to wish more episodes would be created.  This is the only manga I have ever been able to read and not lose interest.
>> ARTICLE
The "one episode per volume" ratio seems pretty good to me. If you try to make an episode with less material, you get a boring anime.

So... 80 episodes for 96 volumes? Pretty good ratio.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that makes sense then. Thanks. I thought it was more like One Piece/Naruto ratio.
>> ARTICLE
Between 102 episodes and 2 OVAs, it's roughly 400+ chapters in. chapter 415 is where episode 25 of the newer series took place. Can't place where episode 26 comes from off the top of my head but yeah, nowhere near one episode per volume. Even when a volume is composed of one fight, it's longer than one episode in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Dat David Eagle ass.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Takamura fight someone who isn't an arrogant ass (Hawk). Should be a really exciting fight.
>> ARTICLE
Considering we had Hawk and Sawamara, makes sense to have an eagle scout next.
>> ARTICLE
Now the tables are turned. Our hero is an ass, and his opponent is a saint
>> ARTICLE
I love how this episode mixed the humour with the serious stuff. Eagle mistaking Ippo and Miyata for kids was hilarious. The interaction with Hawk was great too, it makes sense that Hawk would be a complete mess after the fight since all he had was his arrogance and ego and then that was shattered by Takamura. 
>> ARTICLE
Words cannot describe how much I hate the next 2 opponents for Aoki and Kimura.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's gonna be great! Hopefully it ends up as brilliant as Aoki's last fight.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope Japan doesn't really see filipinos and malaysians like that.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's how they see Filipinos and Malaysians (wasn't it Indonesian?). It's more for comedic reasons, they often play the extreme stereotypes for Americans in anime as well.
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, who will Miyata fight?[Is it](/s "Randy Boy Jr.?") Or is that later on?


>> ARTICLE
The name of Miyata's opponent is just Medngern Dachboy (or something).  The big surprise for this fight is a reappearance of [Manga Spoiler](/s "Mr. Sakaguchi, who was Arnie's Manager/Promoter...")  

The fight you mention doesn't happen till like 300 chapters later.   So it is quite a ways off. 
>> ARTICLE
Much later on. He interrupts something, remember?
>> ARTICLE
True, just went and read that chapter again. Randy is about 2-3 fights away.
>> ARTICLE
This probably have been the funniest episode so far... The sequel outdid the original for me.
>> ARTICLE
Loved this episode, building up hype for the match... This fight seems like it's going to be a real fight among true champions! As arrogant as Takamura is, he's always serious when it comes to boxing, a fight between two world champs that take boxing this serious must be epic :D
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like this episode. I'm usually happy with both the comedy and the action episodes because they balance eachother out and complement the other side of the show. But this rather felt like it was added in afterwards because they were an episode short. I don't know, I kept waiting for something memorable to happen but it's all confirmation or fluff.

I'm a bit dissapointed, I'd loved to at least see Takamaru spar with some people as it feels like the lack of presentable training is only to set Takamaru up for a loss (although I don't think he will lose due to his  icon status to both Ippo and the viewer) or a 'surprising' win.
>> ARTICLE
Losses still happen to the starts! Ippo loss to date remember? and Didnt Kimura lose to someone? i forget his name but there was an OVA for it
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I know it's a common thing for our boxers to lose in their first championship match, but through the entire show Takamura has been something unreachable for everyone. This pure, raw, untamed and godly power that amazes everyone combined with the complete confidence to win the world to himself.

It's not that the main characters never lose, it's that Takamura never loses. I can't predict or even see him lose a match due to his status in the show. I mean, he fought and beat up godamn fucking grizzly bear and wore his skin to a championship match - that just shows the kind of character Takamura is. Whilst Ippo, Aoi, Kimura and Miyata have had one or more losses and grew because of them as a boxer, Takamura isn't in the same league as them in neither the show or the image the writer is trying to get across with him.

Takamura's the one character that isn't realistic and it's not needed for him to be. He's there exactly to trash everything you could measure yourself to as both a person and a boxer. I woul be very surprised to see him lose such an important match, and I don't even know if it would be in line with his character design nor future development as a boxer and person.
>> ARTICLE
Thats kinda why Takamura is in the show, he is the godlke guy who our protagonist looks up to. 

And if im not wrong, Takamura doesent spar because he doesent have anyone who could do so. The only reason he is a middleweight was to have opponents in the country
>> ARTICLE
The anime has cut out a few things.  [Manga Spoiler](/s "There is suppose to be some drama about Takamura potentially having an eye issue, to where it could effect his boxing career.  Miyata notices during training camp and asked Ippo about it. Ippo was suppose to investigate it, but the anime ignores it...")   

For the most part, this fast pacing makes everything seem a little too fast, where it is more about the action/fights and less about the story.  At times, the series doesn't seem to "flow" as smooth as it has been in the past.  I still like the series, but at times it can get annoying.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really miss that part, especially considering what it all came down to in the end.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. The comedy episodes seem to flow better into the show as a whole, and that was probably due to the 74 episode format. They were allowed to take things slower and then just go "2 months after the fight ..." because they were set on creating the right image of the boxing world for their show.

Now all that is gone, but the truth remains that it is a 25 episode boxing show with the boxing as the more prominent aspect. They are almost forced into this format with a 25 episode format. It's unfair to blame either the mangaka or the producers of the show. It's simply a (rather sad) result of how the industry works and adapts manga into anime.

Man, the people who don't watch Ippo are missing out on some great anime. This season was stellar, and it seems as though it's going to end rather beautifully too. 

To many, the initial investment of all the previous seasons might seem daunting at first, but goddamn if you don't get your money's worth out of it.
>> ARTICLE
This season was a vast improvement over New Challenger. 

It had some good fights, but wasn't on part with the first or third seasons.
>> ARTICLE
I miss the animation in the first season :(
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, wow. I read this arc almost 5 years ago and I forgot how great it was. Madhouse did an excellent job animating it, and I was really happy about the choices in voice actors for the young Kamogawa, Nekota, Yuki, and the American. I can tell you guys the next episode will be great. The temptation to spoil is almost uncontrollable. Just take note of the title of episode 24 given at the end of this episode.

Edit: Also, this may be something that a lot of you have forgotten since it's been 5 years since New Challenger, but the other soldier that was accompanying the one that Nekota is fighting mentioned his name was Miguel Zale. Miguel was Brian Hawk's trainer up until his loss to Takamura.
>> ARTICLE
Also the other boxer who is talking with kamogawa about the american is [Dankichi](http://i.imgur.com/DhtO4xl.jpg), who used to be the trainer of Sanada (Ippo fights him in the movie) and now trainer of Vorg
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was like, oh sick, this season has Sawamura AND Eagle, two awesome fights.

Then the flashback references happened and I realized that THIS arc was also being animated. Lost my shit.
>> ARTICLE
I really like the tone of these last few episode. You can really feel what it is that they are fight for.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo manages to make you care for the side characters so much and this little backstory arc has more detail and character development than some whole shows. You'd probably call this filler somewhere else but not with Ippo. Love it. :D

Also reminds me of Rainbow a bit.


>> ARTICLE
Is the fight really over!?
>> ARTICLE
Based on every other fight in this series, I have to say "NO" with very high confidence.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really surprised how this series doesn't get all the attention it deserves... Everything about it is amazing, both the fights and the slice of life episodes.

They both play a role in the character's development, and even secondary characters get their fair share of character development.

Also, my respect for Nekota just sky rocketed this episode... I can't help but feel sorry for him. Kamogawa and Nekota both knew about Yuki's condition, but no one realized of Nekota's condition until the fight started... yet he still aims to bring hope to Yuki <3
>> ARTICLE
The thing I love about this series is that although it's a sports manga/anime, it is handles itself like a drama. Characters are able to grow and react to the world around them that's not related to boxing. These past episodes even discuss the social issues of post WW2 in Japan. Even bringing up Hiroshima and it's residence. This series is simply fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
This arc has been amazing.

Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this episode was difficult for me to watch because of how much pain Nekota and Yuki are going through, but damn that was really fucking good. I wasn't expecting to be this invested in Nekota and Coach Kamogawa's backstory but here I am.

I love this show.
