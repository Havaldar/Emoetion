THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST EPISODE OF HAIKYUU THAT END SEQUENCE HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
>> ARTICLE
This fucking Oikawa set up at the end was the highlight for me.

I get it he's an antagonist (kinda) but he's so fucking cool.
>> ARTICLE
It was unbelievable! Every spike felt like it would land. Every one. DAMN.
>> ARTICLE
Yoo I seriously think that end sequence shaved like 10 years off my life span my heart was beating so freaking fast
>> ARTICLE
Was holding my breath through that whole scene, it was sooooo exciting!
>> ARTICLE
My heart can't take this show...
>> ARTICLE
My heart was literally pounding out of my chest watching that. I can't even remember the last time it's done that for a show or movie.
>> ARTICLE
I had such high expectations for whatever the final sequence would be. I was like, I have no idea what it would be, but there is no way my expectations could be met. But they were absolutely obliterated. It was perhaps the single greatest bit of pacing I've ever seen in a scene. It lasted *the* perfect amount of time, which each element inside the sequence lasting a perfect amount of time. The extreme slow motion of the block reflected in Hinata's eye made me stop breathing.
>> ARTICLE
I don't tend to yell or get outwardly excited to shows like this, but fuck, everything in this episode was just dripping with hype and cool.

Really hope the next season can deliver this level of entertainment more often.
>> ARTICLE
Trust me, next season will be 10x more entertaining. The final match against [Kinda spoilery](/s "Shiratorizawa") will be AMAZING.
>> ARTICLE
How is the manga? I feel that for the sports genre, most manga wouldn't be able to match with animation. I kinda want to read it.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga before the anime, and its absolutely amazing. You'd think hype levels wouldn't be as pronounced in freaking drawings, but I cried the same way after reading this episode's chapters as I am now.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, 10x more entertaining? If what you speak is true, my heart won't be able to keep up
>> ARTICLE
Shiratorizawa is next and believe me... it's going to be hype as fuck, I'm already giddy just thinking about it animated
>> ARTICLE
Dude, Shiratorizawa....

Just thinking about it makes my heart rate go up. My God its going to amazing
>> ARTICLE
Damn, you guys are making it really hard to wait for Fall. I can barely contain myself from reading ahead in the manga as is.
>> ARTICLE
and this entire episode really just showcased everything the entire team had been been working towards during the first 12 episodes. (except for Kageyama's sass, that was always there). THAT PAYOFF THOUGH
>> ARTICLE
*YES*

I loved that. I love the mirror moment of Kageyama and Hinata setting up that play, but the new quick is what allowed them to win. 

...I think one of my contacts shifted.
>> ARTICLE
RIGHT! That last rally was absolutely mind blowing especially with the addition of the Hinata spike from the OP. Knew it was coming but soooo damn epic
>> ARTICLE
[This is me this entire episode](http://i.imgur.com/nn2sglV.jpg).

HOLY FUCK. I mean, HOLY FUCK! It's like every time you think "There's no way it's gonna get better than this" [the show proves you wrong](http://i.imgur.com/UhX9x1v.jpg). The final sequence was just out of this world, with that new piece of OST, incredible animation, [and everyone having a piece of action](http://i.imgur.com/rugXvCH.jpg). I have no words to describe the sheer AWESOMENESS of this episode. It's something else...

* [Oikawa is fucking incredible](http://i.imgur.com/WLLwWee.png)

* [Incredible animation detail right here](http://i.imgur.com/a4ACdvJ.jpg) as Oikawa tries to get up as fast as possible and slips up

that part where Oikawa slipped was such amazing animation I was like :OOOOOOO

I was not that quiet...

> show proves you wrong

You know if he didn't have Yui already that picture on the left would lead to me shipping...

>  and everyone having a piece of action

Tsukki didn't do too much but it's fine, everything is fine :p

Yeah this episode was so hypeI forgot to even mention how amazing the animation was, gosh this is just too good!!

on the other hand... I noticed Tsukki low key celebrating a shot [for the very first time] (http://i.imgur.com/FC1McA4.jpg)

Holy SHIT I completely missed that!  Nice catch. 
>> ARTICLE
Would have been nice to see his face!
>> ARTICLE
It's probably something like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Xg3A3zM.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, Oikawa was both so human and superhuman in this match. He is a great player and it shows but him trying so much and those scenes where he falls to receive the ball and then slips when he wants to run back, or when he is down while Kageyama is looking down to him...gaah he's great, they are all great!
>> ARTICLE
I love that Haikyuu completely dispels with the old trope of the main characters winning because they want it more. Every opponent fights tooth and nail to win and when they lose you can see how much it meant to them as well. Oikawa was clearly desperate to win and to make sure he did every thing possible for his team.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that is one thing that sports anime has always been great at though. A lot of sports anime even dating back as far back as the 70s, made you feel really conflicted because the opponents felt like they had ever much as the desire and the right to win. Even more complex if former teammates join the opponents. That may be a bit of a sports anime clich in itself, but a very effective one.
>> ARTICLE
I might as well stop watching anime now.  It's going to be hard to ever be more invested and hyped than this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, Icing is needed, wait for the last episode to cool down your damaged cells from watching this exciting game!

on god that manga panel of Oikawa "is he a monster of what?" is one of my favorite in the entire series. The anime has done most things justice but thats one i wish lived up to the manga version

edit: wow these gifs are terrific. You're amazing, thanks for doing this every episode!
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me...that episode was **fantastic**!!

They finally beat them!! Not only that everyone was so hypuu this match. Yamaguchi being great, Suga coming in and being awesome, Daichi getting that big serve...seriously this episode was just amazing. 

Easily the best episode of the series for me, I was pretty audible when Kageyama hit that dump, that was just perfect, so happy right now!

Got chills when they flashed all the ace spikers before Daichi made the receive on Oikawa's second serve. Such a fantastic way of showing how experience can make or break a play. 

And I feel like a goddamn echo right now, but that last rally was incredibly animated and had me on the edge of my seat. One of the best episodes of ANY show I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a simple sports anime watching girl, and Kageyama's dump from last season was still my favourite moment of the show due to the sheer hype and cheek of the moment. But I was speaking to my brother a few days ago and he was like I cant wait for them to do a surprise dump again and I replied "nah man they wouldnt be able to play it off as well and I'd hate for such an awesome moment to become a cheap shock trick." BUT HOLY SMOKES WAS I WRONG. MOVE OVER MEDIOCRE IN COMPARISON DUMP OF SEASON ONE. WE HAVE A NEW WINNER FOR MOST HYPE MOMENT OF THE SERIES FULL STOP.

This is the first time I've wished for a sports anime to go on for so long that we see them playing volleyball in college and as pros.
>> ARTICLE
> This is the first time I've wished for a sports anime to go on for so long that we see them playing volleyball in college and as pros.

Gah now I really want this too...
>> ARTICLE
My god the look on everyone's face after that dump. And Oikawa was so pissed at him. The whole thing had me jumping around like a child.
>> ARTICLE
speaking of faces, how many face receives did we even see this episode? Everyone on both teams was so desperate to keep the ball up!
>> ARTICLE
I really thought Oikawa was going to get it, such an intense scene!
>> ARTICLE
They spent so much time over the past two seasons explaining that Oikawa wasn't a genius like Kageyama, but he damn sure looked like one in this match. His near-impossible to hit serves, the super long set to Iwaizumi, his recovery after crashing HARD into that table - I was never really a fan of him, but my god this episode made me a believer.

EDIT: Oh, and the fact that he would have gotten Hinata's spike if Kindaichi's hand didn't put it off course. 
>> ARTICLE
When they call Kageyama a genius, I think it refers more to his raw talent. Oikawa kind of monologues about this through this week's episode. He runs on instinct, reflexes and feeling. Sometimes playing based on his senses and with less thought leaves his team mates in the dust resulting in things like the King's Toss. Volleyball comes naturally to him and his potential is enormous.

For Owikawa, his volley ball was forged over time. He doesn't have Kageyama's innate talent. He trained hard and though his natural ability isn't as high, he makes up for it with every other tool at his disposal. He considers his team, uses his team, and does whatever he can to make up the difference. Even that killer serve didn't appear over night. He's been honing that monster for years along with developing strategies and schemes. Kageyama and Hinata on the other hand pick up new techniques far more quickly.

Oikawa is a strong rival, but he doesn't quite have the natural talent that would make him a genius and he's very aware of it. His fixation with defeating Ushijima and Kageyama are a testament to those feelings.

Edit: Putting it another way, Oikawa thinks, Kageyama feels.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny because from Tobio's perspective, we felt like Oikawa is a genius. Remember the episode when Tobio went ahead to scout him, and how he felt overwhelmed because Oikawa has the ability to be thrown into a pack of complete strangers and within minutes he can work with them in great coordination? And how Tobio repeatedly felt overwhelmed by Oikawa's abilities?

It's like they're telling us the difference of who's genius ultimately boils down to the results.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa may not be the best passer, but his serve and general play and command of his teammates is still top notch. He'd be pretty much unbeatable if he had Kageyama's passing ability.
>> ARTICLE
That's what's so great about Haikyuu, part of me really wanted him to get it. By the end of every match I'm rooting for the opposition and every point has me conflicted.
>> ARTICLE
Daijoubu Yamaguchi ;__;

Tsukishima being nonchalant about Hinata's block was hilarious.

And never forget *YOU LITTLE BRATSSSSSSS*

That last sequence was the SEQUENCE TO END ALL SEQUENCES. **Best sports anime ever.** I would love to see a "What's in a Scene?" analysis done for it because there were so many details that stood out. The way the "camera" would frame around five frozen players for suspense before focusing fully on the sixth player (Who you probably forgot about) saving the day, the usage of slow motion, the way the court is covered 360 degrees simply by the perspective "traveling" with the ball, the way the music resonates with every action...just SO perfect!

P.S. The *tiny* background detail of Yachi embracing Tanaka onee-san during the victory cheer was so great! I'm surprised that the coaches and manager could just sit on the bench calmly though, as seen in the background during the Kageyama-Oikawa staring contest.

P.S. 2 As a long-time volleyball fan I recommend checking out [this real-life long rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSsZcqrZ0i4), considering the finale of this episode. Besides the insane teamwork and endurance, it also helps you remember how HUGE the court actually can be for six people to cover, although for high school-level the dimensions might be smaller.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu really is far ahead of all the other sport anime, but I'm still not sure if I like Ping Pong the Animation a little bit more. The art style was so refreshing and it had a lot of moments that gave me goosebumps like Haikyuu did.

Both are so well done, even people who don't do sports or have never seen a sport anime so far will enjoy this A TON.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing keeping me away from ping pong is the animation/art style tbh.
>> ARTICLE
It starts to grow on you by the 2nd or 3rd ep.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I have been singing the praise of Volleyball as an amazing spectator sport. The kinds of intense rallies we see in this show, almost every pro Volleyball game has at least one of these. Some truly great matches even are filled with these rallies.

I really wish someday, pro volleyball takes off in places like America. It's already sizable in Asia and parts of Europe, but it seems people only get exposed to it during Olympics.
>> ARTICLE
What in the fuck was that rally

That was superb

Just watching it was exhausting. Wow

Tsukishima was perfect in that moment. "Well, yeah. He's a middle blocker. He's supposed to be able to block." Priceless.

You'd think that straight face attitude would get old by now but nope still great <3

I cracked up so hard that I rewound and watched it again...such perfectly-delivered deadpan by Uchiyama Kouki there. Also reminded me of how little we actually see Hinata blocking despite having the title, lol.

I love the quotes.

"Today might be the day to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, the next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think it'll never come, it probably never will."

"Talent is something you make bloom. Instinct is something you polish."

No win of Karasuno's felt this good! Ahhhh I'm still shaking!

It'd just kill me if this is the last Karasuno vs current Aoba Jousai. I don't care if it's a practice match, just let me see it again!
>> ARTICLE
That moment for Oikawa was really nice.

The animation of that scene was mindblowing. I'm slightly sad they cut an important line from Aoba Johsai's Coach. After he saw that pass he says that he actually underestimated just how much of a beast Oikawa is. 
>> ARTICLE
the best episode i have ever seen in any anime to be honest. Before watching i was sleepy but after just watching first minutes of the episode i got so hyped like i drank tons of redbulls or something. Oikawa running for a chance ball and pointing at his teammate that hes going to serve him was just incredible. God damn this anime just keeps on delivering

I've had a cold for the past few days and this episode TOTALLY made me forget about it. I was running around my apartment hype as fuck after that last point!

*Yes it is*.

#GET HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Call me crazy, but that was the best episode of any anime I've seen in almost a year. Honestly, when you think about where Hinata was at the start of his volleyball journey, it's absolutely unbelievable how far he's come not just in terms of skill/ability, but as a player and everything around him. 

Deep down, I was 99% Karasuno would win this just because it'd be unheard of the main team to lose twice to the same team, especially as this was the 3rd years last tournament, but there were countless moments where I thought they'd actually lose. I'm a guy who's fairly into real life sports, but I don't think I've gotten this hyped and screamed at my television this loudly in any other game I've ever watched.

The music was perfect, the animation was glorious, the transitions from one play to the next was flawless and overall, this episode just solidified this season as a 10/10 for me. Can't wait for next week and season three...I'm still shaking a bit from the ending to this episode. Well done Prod IG, this was truly fantastic.

I absolutely cannot wait to see what they pull for the Shiratorizawa game in season 3.

>> ARTICLE
That dump also reminded me of how tall Kageyama really is, as it's hard to trick your opponents into thinking it's actually another set if you need a huge jump to tap the ball over the net.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's official height is 5'11 (I was shocked when I read that since I thought he looked like a 5'8-5'9)

Tsukishima's official height - 6'2 (I know he's the tallest but not that tall 0.0 I can't stop seeing him as someone who is 5'11 until the Tokyo training camp where I finally accepted that he is really that damn tall)

Hinata's offcial height- 5'4 ( I thought he'd be taller than that but it makes sense. At least he's taller than me XD)
>> ARTICLE
I like how it was all thanks to Suga's forehead that that block didn't go in, holy shit

Also, what's the intense game soundtrack? Plays immediately after the opening, couldn't find its name

I like when Oikawa was scrambling to get up from that falling-down-cross-court set he did in that final volley, he stumbled a bit in his haste to get back on the court.  It's little details like those that helps make this show incredible.  Also the fact that he totally made a Gurren Lagann face after Tanaka made that save.
>> ARTICLE
yea... Oikawa may be a really talented player with almost inhuman god-like serve...but in the end he's just a guy scrambling like any other to win
>> ARTICLE
That last point was breathtaking
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if anyone gets this reaction, but for the last 3 episodes solidly, at least half of the episode I have spent crying from uncontrollable happiness for characters.  Every time a player on either team made a big play my whole body gets shivers and my face starts leaking, heck even the moment when the opposing blonde who yelled at Mad-Dog-Chan earlier looks at Mad-Dog and just says 'We are counting on you' and then Mad-Dog just shifts his body slightly to denote that he is giving even more of himself to the game, even that slight interaction and redeeming of mad-dog-chan made my face leak.  god I love haikyuu.

I feel you. It's an uncontrollable train of smiles and small tear-ups. Add that their small moments that you can identify parts of your life in them.
>> ARTICLE
This is such a great way of putting it. It's easy to say, from the outside, "It's just highschool volleyball! How can it make you so emotional?" What people who bash on or don't watch this show don't realize is that the importance of the sport to the characters is what makes it emotional. We see their struggles, how much they put into this to get stronger, how they support and help their friends, how they break down when they lose, *everything*. And we all have our own 'volleyball' in our lives that make us do those things, that we're passionate about.
>> ARTICLE
That may just be one of the best episodes of any form of media I have seen, it did what it set out to do perfectly, even knowing who would win (I read a spoiler by accident) the tension was brilliant, the hype built perfectly into that final rally where I literally got out of bed to sit on the edge of my seat, everything about it was masterful. 

Anyway I know we have another episode but I think I'll be manga ahoy any day now, I need my fix. 

Also [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/UhX9x1v.jpg) basically shows every single one of my reactions from this episode... well done Hypuu, well done.

EDIT: Dammit why does my Volleyball club have to be on Thursdays, really want to play volleyball now, so hyped.

I was holding my breath [during that whole last scene](http://i.imgur.com/SM0pGrL.jpg) wondering what would happen. [It was amazing!](http://i.imgur.com/7T6KllV.jpg)

Yamaguchi might have not made a lot of points this time but his serves are so absurd, they are great! I really really liked [his reaction](http://i.imgur.com/Racbkpe.jpg) to the coach, it was so great seeing him so relieved. Even [Oikawa was amazed at him](http://i.imgur.com/m1uHLYv.jpg).

I really liked his story and thoughts throughout the episode, especially when [this happened](http://i.imgur.com/wiSYwtW.jpg) and it was like everything got reversed.

[Some great reactions](http://i.imgur.com/YVso0wr.jpg) this episode and they were all justified. This was a great episode, especially so close to the end of the season. Also, lol at [Kageyama's "my sides" pose](http://i.imgur.com/XSCwkLg.jpg).

[I'm really glad this is getting another season](http://i.imgur.com/4GPdInq.jpg) and I don't have to be too sad there's only one episode left in this one.

Infinity/10

That was probably one of the best episodes of anime of all time. Probably.

It's terms of narrative, you knew Karasuno had to win. The director, author, and writers know this too. So the only way to get you to buy into the tension and the stakes is to to pull you into the moment-to-moment and make you forget all that. 

Given my current heart rate and the soreness in my jaw, I think they've succeeded. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they went in a totally different way than other animes and it worked out soo well.

Somehow they made us feel for Oikawa and by the end of it you have these mixed emotions. You're happy Karasuno won but at the same time Aoba Johsai worked just as hard and deserve to win just as much and you just don't know whether you should be happy or sad. Ah Oikawa :( 

Uggh why does this anime do this to mee!!

THAT... WAS SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST HYPE AND BEST EPISODES OF ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN HOLY HELL.

Everything they did that ep was perfect, from animation, to soundtrack to anime-original scenes (Oikawa looking up at Kageyama wasn't there in the manga if I remember correctly).  
That last ball, holy mother of god.  
  
That moment when Hinata blocked the trap spike and soundtrack kicked in. Holy shit.  
Daichi, Tanaka and Suga's forehead are the MVPs of that fucking game.

Best episode i have seen in years. I screamed at so many moments, holy fuck.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT THE FUCK 20 MNS GONE BY ALREADY? BUT IT JUST STARTED
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCK. THAT'S ALL. Those fucking rallies that makes you stop breathing. It's fucking amazing how this anime can bring nervousness from spectators when they watch long rallies in a match. This is a fucking A game! Holy shit!!!


I love how they find way to use Sugawara in crucial moment. He's not really pinch server, but for me he's the pinch player. He always gets some sleeves in his hand. That setter's dump from Kageyama was just s satisfying.


Also god dammit, Oikawa is just so fucking OP. He reminds me so much of Hisoka from HxH. Remember when HxH had that dodgeball tournament, damn! 
>> ARTICLE
Bless this fucking show. Putting the rest of this winter season on it's back.

This whole Haikyuu season was glorious. The development, struggle, redemption, emotion.

Perfection.
>> ARTICLE
Whole episode was freaking fantastic but [when Hinata squeezed his hand into a fist after that hit at the end...](http://imgur.com/8S3WyU4) Holy crap I got goosebumps, it was so satisfying to see him so powerful.
>> ARTICLE
I can't even be happy though, after building up Seijoh so well I'm just sad that they lost
>> ARTICLE
Welp... This episode probably cemented Haikyuu as my favourite sports anime that I've seen so far (which means not a whole lot actually, but hey). Everything is so damn good with this it's just unfair. 

I can't find words to describe how good this shit is. Rarely have I felt as hyped and stressed for the characters as I am with Haikyuu, although you should know they're gonna win because they're the main team we're following! 

There's so much tension and it keeps you on the edge every goddamn time. It's so good. 

That episode was intense as all hell, and I absolutely loved that. 

Hot damn... That shit was good and I'll be sad when Season 3 ends... 
>> ARTICLE
Well boys and girls, this season of Haikyuu might be the first sports anime that gets a well deserved 10/10 for me. Few episodes of any genre have had me as enthralled as this one, and it wasn't the first to get my adrenaline pumping in Haikyuu.  

Cross Game came the closest so far, but Haikyuu just does so much right! The suspense, the lead-up, the hype, the delivery, and certainly the finish in each episode. On top of all that, there are no super powers, or absolutely ridiculous moves (Meteor shot, or spinning tornado attacks). We saw the blood, sweat, and tears that Karasuno poured into everything that they show.  

And to top that off, the show doesn't stop there. Character development, team development and growth, opponents that you just can't hate because they get development and growth, too. Spice all that up with fantastic animation and voice acting, and it's hard to find fault with this season.  

Finally, the finish has been strong. Each of the last few episodes has been ratcheting up the intensity and hype. The music seems to fit so well with the pace of the show, and it's hard to recall anytime I've ever been so rooted in place for 22 minutes at a time. Superb.

Never have I gotten so many chills from an anime

AND THAT'S WHY HAIKYUU IS THE BEST!!! Just amazing, the OST is perfect (Never tired of saying that) and really well adaptated.

This episode covered from chapter 143 up to chapter 147

That last point was like a cardio workout with how much it got me jumping up and down! That was an AMAZING Hypuu!! episode

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT. That was utterly amazing, my heart was pounding throughout that last set.

So glad I picked this up after kuroko no basuke.     
Sports anime is a genre you never thought you would enjoy.    
But with stuff like this, how you couldn't enjoy it idk.     
Oikawa is still "King" in my heart.

THEY FUCKING WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I was sweating so bad through that whole episode, such an amazing show

I actually am on the verge of tears. That was easily one of my favorite episodes of this entire show.

Hey guys, JTricks here with another episode breakdown/commentary, this time of Haikyuu!!
We're right in the middle of the 3rd set between Karasuno and Aoba Johsai and things are definitely heating up. It's been an incredibly fun match, let's see how it ends!

Karasuno FLY!

**Haikyuu!! Season 2 Episode 24**

0:21 - [Nice Kill!](http://i.imgur.com/2y7RrVw.png) We pick up where we left off, impressive to see just how much Kageyama and Hinata's skills and chemistry have developed throughout the show.

I have a feeling this'll be a KageHina focused episode, it's been a while.

0:53 - [Even when complimenting Kageyama, Oikawa always manages to put in a cheeky jab.](http://i.imgur.com/rW44MkK.png)

1:19 - [But he's OUR idiot](http://i.imgur.com/1SPUQ52.png)

1:35 - [The jokes write themselves](http://i.imgur.com/zj6ty9E.png)

4:27 - [Love the focus on these two, really shows that the Mad Dog has been tamed by Matsukawa-senpai](http://i.imgur.com/6gEa92q.png)

5:11 - [PISSED OIKAWA](http://i.imgur.com/vdI67wk.png)

6:28 - [Sakuga time! The "Back-Breaker" serve haha](http://i.imgur.com/VZJcWW0.png)

6:48 - [He's baaaaack!](http://i.imgur.com/QueMkC4.png)

Crazy to see the crowd acknowledging him now as a threat, when they were criticizing him before, how the tables have turned!

7:13 - [Ahh Tsukishima best bro!](http://i.imgur.com/KUiARaD.png)

8:33 - [Iwaizumi carried that exchange soooo hard!](http://i.imgur.com/OwykcZE.png)

9:51 - [Oikawa's serve was so fast, I couldn't printscreen fast enough](http://i.imgur.com/ez5WyUH.png)

11:16 - [Serious Oikawa vs Serious Daichi!](http://i.imgur.com/1xbo5wf.png)

Daichi comes through with his team on the brink of losing!

12:38 - [HINATA IS READY TO "KILL"](http://i.imgur.com/rFhN8Sc.png)

13:48 - ["He's the middle blocker"](http://i.imgur.com/SqeOMek.png)

These Fate/Stay level quotes are killing me today lol

15:25 - [Payback for the first season!](http://i.imgur.com/2XgEnvJ.png)

I love the reversal here, before it was Oikawa executing a dump, but now it's Oikawa on the floor with Kageyama on top! Beautiful scene.

And Brief Oikawa History was great!

15:52 - [SUPER SERIOUS OIKAWA](http://i.imgur.com/v5rXP19.png)

One of the best sports antagonists for sure, I love his backstory, his personality and he's pretty good at volleyball.

18:08 - [Aoba Johsei has a synchronized chant with a ton of people and these two can't even chant at the same time haha](http://i.imgur.com/3ZurZH0.png)

19:29 [HOLY SHIT!](http://i.imgur.com/JVOHDSU.png)

Oikawa is putting his body on the line!

20:40 - [I'm SOOO HYPED, I'm crying LOOL](http://i.imgur.com/TbQ1jMr.png)

21:28 - [There it is! THEY DID IT!](http://i.imgur.com/KeQj3jN.png)

21:57 - [Crushing Defeat](http://i.imgur.com/YvTvy4z.png) vs [Pure Joy](http://i.imgur.com/mjijhaL.png)

22:14 - [Beautiful Final Shot](http://i.imgur.com/lne1q9v.png)

**END**

WOW! What an episode. That was one of the most hyped episodes I've watched in a while! Haikyuu!! truly turned it up here, as this is most likely the climax of the season. Next episode will probably be a brief Shiratorizawa intro. I'm definitely going to miss Aoba Johsai, such an interesting combination of personalities and talent. On the other hand, everyone on Karasuno definitely stepped up, shoutouts to SUGA-san! 

MOU IKKAI! Season 3 can't come soon enough.

Check out my previous episode breakdown of [DRRR!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4a4asq/spoilers_durararax2_ketsu_episode_10_discussion/d0xbdbd?context=3) and [Haikyuu!! episode 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugeycol1UnE)








>> ARTICLE
I just love being absorbed with this episode so much, buuut

> 22:14 - Beautiful Final Shot

umm... I thought it was great when I was watching it, but now I look at it, it looks a bit... weird. Is it only me? 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe.

You have to take into account the context of this screenshot as well. In season 1, the iconic picture of the match between Karasuno and Aoba Johsei was Oikawa standing tall and Kageyama and Hinata on the ground. This shot symbolizes that Kageyama can finally stand toe-to-toe with Oikawa, which is a huge accomplishment for him. 

Also, looking at a still screenshot is  very different from watching the show  when you're filled with emotion and the soundtrack playing in the background, so you have to account for that as well.
>> ARTICLE
The art style for the reaction of Aoba Johsai after they lose is just perfect. It's like every thing they have has been drained from them.
>> ARTICLE
> and he's pretty good at volleyball

Understatement of the year.
>> ARTICLE
Including manga characters, I honestly think if I had to pick a single best player from Haikyu it would be Oikawa. Aside from his incredible serve, he reads his opponents incredibly well (as seen when he came so close to catching Hinata's hit at the end of the episode), he brings out the absolute best of his teammates (even better than they think they can do, like with Kindaichi), he's incredible at setting and recieving, he's even a good spiker. There's nothing he's *not* very good or amazing at.
>> ARTICLE
That [super long toss](http://imgur.com/R7lackW) was the coolest moment of the episode for me. And his serves are fucking monstrous. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree on that being the coolest moment! Along with Iwaizumi's double incredible recieves in a row...           

Honestly came pretty close to rooting for Aoba Johsai. Only pretty close, though. 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY

FUCK

THIS

EPISODE

HOLY

SHIT

OMFG
>> ARTICLE
My God I don't even know how to describe this episode apart from brilliant.

It had me tensed up but with a smile throughout the entire episode, about as shocked as Aoba Johsai was when Kageyama did that dump, and that final point... absolutely brilliant. I don't know how I'm going to manage to wait for S3 until Fall.... "so close yet so far" never felt so real.

On another note, while I'm completely ecstatic that Karasuno finally won, it's rather sad for Aoba Johsai... Oikawa especially. You could really see how badly he wanted to have a rematch against Shiratorizawa, and it didn't help that the show has fleshed out his character a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
That last rally is the most intense thing this show has ever done. FUCCCKKKKKKKKKK.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. Had to rewatch that final sequence. I think my favourite part of this episode was Oikawa scrambling to get up after setting from outside the court. It just embodies the desperation of everybody playing in the game. They all know they can't lie on the ground and wait for the play to finish and have to give it their all until the ball drops. Beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
If anyone needs me I'll be crying in my room
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, what an episode.

>> ARTICLE
I knew this episode was going to be a good one when they opened with my favorite hype track. Mad Dog-chan and Oikawa get the spot light but Iwaizumi is so important to that team. He's the ace, clutch on defense and keeps the team in line. What a way for it to end. Kageyama must have ice in his veins. That dump on match point was savage. The hype levels are unreal.

Words can't describe how excited I am that this series is getting another season!

Edit: Can't forget Sugawara either. What Kageyama lacks in stability and tactics, Suga brings. Those serves weren't very strong but they were accurate and his ability to ground the entire Kurasano line up... This team is so damn magic, I really hope we get to see Kenma and Hinata's wish come true and get a Battle at the Garbage Dump in the spring tournament.

Edit 2: damnit, I'm not even at the end of the episode yet...

Edit 3: Oikawa's tenacity. Iwaizumi isn't the only wing spiker that can make big defensive plays! SUGA'S FACE! OIKAWA'S READS! HINATA'S WIPE!!! WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!?!
>> ARTICLE
> Can't forget Sugawara either

Of course we can't! He is calm, thinks things through and has great tactics. Also, he might have thought it was lame to receive that ball with his head in the end but he saved it! :D
>> ARTICLE
This episode started kinda weak, to be honest. Lots of repeated stuff from episodes before. Almost looked like a clip show.

I'll preface the rest of this by saying I'm a huge sports fan. I've run down snowy streets shouting (with no few others for company) over championships. Hell, I run a very well-trafficked blog semi-professionally. I'm serious about this stuff, however silly it might be.

By the end of this episode, I was about as pumped for Karasuno's victory as I would be for a real-life championship. From 19-20 on...holy shit that was masterful. Anime has gotten me emotional, angry, euphoric, you name it. Haikyuu, in this episode, got me invested in a fictional sporting event the way I would be in a real one, and frankly I'm stunned. I don't give out 10s easily. This was a 10.

Eh, 10.5.

One other thing: the structure of this season was perfect. Typically in a situation like this, you can get an idea of what's going to happen. Hell, just a basic understanding of story arcs would tell you Karasuno probably wasn't going to drop this game. Having this matchup be the one that thwarts them at the end of the season again would just be really hard to do well, especially with it spelling the end for the third years.

But...the end of the season started drawing closer and closer. And the match didn't end. How are they gonna get in the last bout against Mr. Japan? They wouldn't just let the season end without it, would they? Then that means...

I legitimately had no clue going into this episode who would win. If the price of that is a long, long wait for the finals, I will pay it every time.

Gonna go watch this entire show over. God damn but it's good.
>> ARTICLE
That cross court serve Oikawa did and then slipping up in the (tablecloth??) Was so hype, he really tried his best this game and I can't help but feel really bad for them losing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad that both teams had a chance to do their thing and really go all out. Like despite losing, Seijoh had a really truly crazy performance that would have steamrolled most other teams. And although all of their team had moments, we really saw just how good Oikawa is. True nailbiter.
>> ARTICLE
THIS EPISODE HAD ME SCREAMING!!!!!! I'M SO FREAKING [HAPPY](http://24.media.tumblr.com/bbd8bf5a655faa69a2582b30fa3f4e7b/tumblr_mtt3poBmY51svp3buo1_1280.gif) XD
>> ARTICLE
The final rally was just fucking amazing. The buildup throughout the entire episode to that point, was just beautiful. The ost, and the animation, was all on point today. Fucking great.
>> ARTICLE
That shot of seijohs schools huge synchronized cheering, followed immediately by karasunos very tiny and unsynchronized but rowdy cheering squad...oh god that was just adorable 
>> ARTICLE
my throat is sore ... damn... great episode
>> ARTICLE
oikawa's long shoot set from outside the court was the most impressive volleyball play of the match... so good
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I feel bad for Aobai, wanted Oikawa to win so bad. 

It's sad, I feel like they are underdogs that were promised. 
>> ARTICLE
This entire match has been amazing but this episode was on another level. 10/10. I think Haikyuu may have become my new favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
This episode just ruined real life sports for me. I think i'm never gonna see anything so fucking exciting. HOLY FUCK!
>> ARTICLE
This show never stops surprising me, holy fucking shit. Just when i thought that it couldn't get any better. If it gets even better in season 3 (which i suppose it will - shiratorizawa hype), i'm jumping off a bridge out of excitement. I HAVE NO WORDS, JUST AMAZING!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, lived up the build up like crazy. Holy fuck
>> ARTICLE
Fuck those last 5 minutes made me damn near have a heart attack. Intense as fuck. Well done Karasuno. Season 3 is gonna be hype.
>> ARTICLE
What a fantastic episode. I'm shaking. So fucking good. That ending wow.

I WAS SO HYPED I BROKE ONE OF MY BRACES FOR BITING SO HARD

I am way too emotionally invested into anime volleyball.

I revoke every rude comment about sports anime I ever uttered in my previously uneducated life. This show. This show man. How did it get me to feel things about sports. GOOD EP.

Holy shit so much happened and it was just so good i don't even know what to comment on. What a 100% perfect Episode.
>> ARTICLE
This was an AMAZING episode.

it's ok...i'll just lie here...for the rest of the day... trying to calm my heart down after that intense episode...

Ahh what an end to that play and with new season announced things are looking good

THERE CAN ONLY BE SO MUCH HYPE!!!

HOLY SHIT

MOST INTENSE EPISODE OF ANIME I'VE WATCHED
>> ARTICLE
My body is ready for season 3

By far one of the greatest episodes of anime that I've ever watched. The intensity of the entire episode was insane. I look forward to the final episode next week and the coming third season.

This takes the cake, I've never been so hyped for an episode of anime before, fucking 10/10 no doubts about it. Haikyuu is goddamn amazing!

I feel sorry for Seij's Libero, he did not have a good match.

The hype was insane from the start of the episode, but holy shit did they get to the next level after the commercial break.

SHUT IT DOWN SHUT IT DOWN LET'S GO HOME

That last serve by Kageyama was 100% the same serve from last time, aka when they lost. But this time, HINATA GOT HIS EYES OPEN YOH! NO ONE CAN STOP HIM padjoiwadhakjdwjaifkawdapodwj

I still have goosebumps from that last rally

That was some amazing writing, you never knew what was going to happen at the end. I feel like it's hard to keep sports genre anime unpredictable. That was seriously a huge assclench the last play.

BEST
MATCH
IN
SERIES
I HOPE THAT FIRST MATCH IN 3RD SEASON WILL BE ALSO AS GOOD AS IT.
Okay, now I should stop caps.
Animation was great - I won't be surprised if last episode will have shitty animation. I suppose that next episode will show match of Shiratorizawa(please don't confirm if it's true). 
I think I'll have to consider if this season deserves for 10. 
>> ARTICLE
That last sequence might have been one of the most well animated and intense scenes I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn sports animes give me such an intense feeling... 
>> ARTICLE
bless the director of this show

so fucking hyped throughout this episode like damn
>> ARTICLE
So glad I decided to randomly pick this show up. Just saw it with such high ratings on MAL and gave it a shot even though I don't watch sports anime (sans Ping Pong) and don't particularly like volleyball. One of my favorite series! That ending was so satisfying but you know it was a hard fought journey for Karasuno.
>> ARTICLE
When you think this show can't get even more hyped, stuff like that happens! I find myself cheering out loud for both teams and it's exhilarating~  
I'm already going in withdrawal waiting for the next episode.....   

FASTEST FIVE MINUTES OF MY LIFE!!! OMG THAT WAS SOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, I don't recall there ever being this much traffic on any of the weekly Haikyuu threads, this episode was too OP.

THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME

HOLY FUCK THAT EPISODE WAS AMAZING!

My heart...

That well animated last hit! The atmosphere was so intense, so epic!!!!! And so many characters on BOTH TEAMS shined this episodes it was AMAZING! TRULY BRILLIANT!

Only one more episode this season... :(
I CANT WAIT FOR FALL WHEN THE 3rd SEASON WILL START! :D
>> ARTICLE
I hereby declare this "Anime-azing." So much hype. So much awesome. Words fail me.

As much as I've loved riding the hype train every week, I'm really looking forward to slamming the whole show as quickly as possible after the second season ends.

mY HEART IS GONNA BURST OUT OF MY CHEST. THE HYPE. 
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love how the match ended with Hinata and Kageyama's UPGRADED QUICK, considering how they lost against Seijoh last time around with the old quick. Production I.G. also used the exactly same frames as they did for the final quick against Seijoh in the Inter High tournament. Really really looking forward to the next episode since it'll seemingly shower us some moments with Oikawa + Ushijima + Hinata/Kageyama.

FeelsGoodMan
>> ARTICLE
We all knew how it was going to be. But the sheer brilliance of the moments which led to the result was absolutely fabulous to watch.
>> ARTICLE
 I held my breathe for the entirety of the last few minutes. Fuck.
>> ARTICLE
My heart was pounding quite a bit during that last point too. I think I held my breath during that last point too. It's amazing how much tension and anticipation there was in this episode. I had so many chills with both teams scoring points back and forth. 

Seriously the best episode of Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Is this a good time to start watching this show?
>> ARTICLE
yes, yes and also yes. 

Season 2 is just about to finish and if you start now you'll probably catch up in time for the finale episode... unless your watch at a normal pace unlike I did but still 2 seasons worth of content with season 3 arriving later in the year.
>> ARTICLE
*scrolls up to see 200+ comments about not being able to breathe,  heart attacks, and sore throats*


yep, just do it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been on the fence for the last few weeks regarding whether Kuroko no Basket or Haikyuu!! was better. That was pretty fucking decisive
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm probably over reacting since I just watched the episode, but that might be one of the best episodes of any show I have ever watched. I knew what the result of the match but I was still tearing up and my heart was racing. The animation was beautiful and the OST was perfect. Haikyuu is up there with my favorite animes, not just sports animes.
>> ARTICLE
That last scene was FUCKING AMAZING!!
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot to like this episode, but I think the music really knocked it out of the park.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was pretty neat.
>> ARTICLE
The last minutes.. 
Holy shit.. I couldn't even look.. I was holding my breath.. It was so intense..  

It's impossible to describe it..  like i was there..It was the best  and most exiting episode in Sports Anime History!  

>> ARTICLE
What is the song that plays at the start around the time Tsuki serves?

>> ARTICLE
So...are they saying Oikawa is just an extremely polished player with a setter's disposition (not a genius) yet Tobio is a genius even though he's only blossomed with Shoyo?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, in a nutshell Kageyama is physically capable of things that others aren't, that's what makes him a genius. For example, setting the ball for cross-court/straights when we're talking about quicks (remember Tsukishima's complaint about this in Season 1), that falling toss, synchronising the toss to Hinata's swing when he had his eyes shut, etc. Just think of it as Kageyama being able to make the ball do whatever he wants it to.

In contrast, Oikawa is not like that. That's what he used to be resentful of, and his mindset seems to be changing ("Talent is something you make bloom. Instinct is something you polish."), plus we do get that ridiculous long set to Iwaizumi this episode that is probably a milestone in the blossoming of his talent. However, no matter how you see it, he's nowhere near Kageyama in ball control.

But. As is obvious, there are many other factors that play into what makes either of them a better player, like intellect, game sense, etc. And I think it's pretty clear that as a player, Oikawa is not worse off by any means. He's probably the MVP of the entire show, tbh. So even though Kageyama is a genius and he is not, that's how they are for now. Hope this helps!
>> ARTICLE
I did a double take when i saw ryu go for the save, did not expect that to happen at all!
>> ARTICLE
This was such a great episode! I'm so happy that Karasuno won :D 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode. Haikyuu always gets me so hyped, but this was through the roof starting with Tsukki. I mean I usually get engaged, but this episode had me yelling at my screen, fist pumping, 10,000% engaged over here. Animation was so on point that last set, absolutely perfect.
>> ARTICLE
This show is just unbelievable. the artwork is always great and consistent. whereas some shows the artwork gets crappy for awhile only to get good for important moments. the last point was put together so amazing well. the music, the tenseness for the few times you thought it was over and even the camera angles for when things happened. the small things like when Oikawa did that long set and fell then as he was getting up slipped to get back on the court or when Kageyama was setting up for Hinata's last spike and you see his body shift or the spinning of the ball. I have so much respect for the people who directed and helped make this series. if only they could help with Hajime No Ippo.  JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH. 
>> ARTICLE
Heart was beating the whole time. That final rally was insane.  
For some reason the detail of him slipping on the floor mat was great. And the "Chance ball!" "Like hell!" Was SO HYPE. HOLY SHIT THAT EPISODE WAS INSANE. AOTS.

I WANT TO SCREAM BUT I'M GONNA GET KICKED OUT OF THE APARTMENT HOW AM I EVEN SUPPOSED TO FEEL AFTER SUCH AN AMAZING EPISODE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Thought I would watch my favourite anime before bed... I'm not sleeping for 6 more hours because whAT THE FUCK I'M SO FUCKING HYPED THAT WAS FUCKING AMAZING AND MY HEART IS RACING AND I'M GONNA DIE
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCKING SHIT GODDAMN I'M SO HAPPY BUT SO SAD I LOVE HAIKYUU SO MUCH like seriously when I think about it, this show is such a positive influence on my life and I'm so happy it exists. I pity those who haven't watched Haikyuu!!. Their loss.

Not a manga reader, but I knew that Karasuno was going to win the match, because how could they not? And I still cried when Aoba Jousei lost. I'm so so happy for Karasuno, but this show is so good, and I'm so attached to nearly every single character and team, that I can't help but be really really sad when any of them lose. Which happens literally every match? Like, literally every single match one of the team loses (duh) and I end up sad. Haikyuu. Why do u do this to me.
>> ARTICLE
So fucking good. WHAT AN EPISODE.

Hinata's feint, Daichi's receive, Kageyama's dump, Tanaka's save, Asahi's back court hit. FUCKING HYPE. And that's not even including the madness from the Aoba team!! The director absolutely nailed conveying just how much each team and player wanted to win the match, the intensity was unreal.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've been so conflicted by a win before this match. By the end of the episode, I had gotten so invested in Oikawa's near superhuman dedication to winning and proving himself past the sheer raw talent that Kageyama (and Ushikawa) both have that I was so heartbroken about Aoba Johsai losing despite rooting for Karasuno wholeheartedly most of the match. While I do think he's a jackass, he's by far the one character whose efforts I've respected the most no matter what and just... to see the great king fall? I thought I wanted it, but man did I actually really not want to see it at all.

The cross-court set to Iwaizumi during the final rally had me on the edge of my seat and the rest of that rally on served to drop my jaw to the floor and skyrocket my heart rate with how into it I got. I honestly wasn't sure whether or not my heart would give out or the rally would end first.
>> ARTICLE
Karasuno should bring Oikawa on as a coach or something. I know that makes no sense, but I hope they work him into season 3 somehow.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling Oikawa is brilliant enough of a player to go full pro soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about season 3, but he HAS to come back, either competing against Ushijima after high school, or watching Seijo. 
>> ARTICLE
Hooolllyyy shiiiieett!! That was soooo goood! There were so many close calls for that last point!

I really ddnt want this match to end, but that was such a great end sequence

What a damn amazing episode!!! Just as the team continually surprises so does the show. I am shivering right now. I am just blown away. I was actually screaming during that episode. How old am I again? Good grief I just can't contain myself anymore. This show has broken me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man I cant contain myself. I feel like I need to go running! Best episode of season 2!! Next episode will be the aftermath episode for Seijoh. :( I need to mentally prepare myself for all the feels.
>> ARTICLE
i think im gunna loose my voice after yelling so much, MUCH HYPE!!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
This episode man... Am I the only one that's been hit so hard by the win. At some point I was just rooting for Oikawa and when he saw that gap in the block, I got this sudden urge of hope that maybe it's not over yet, maybe they'll end it on a cliffhanger... 
>> ARTICLE
i need help, i just binge watched all of it in two days.

My body can't take so much hype in so little time.

im not kidding, every time i wanted to stop hinata screamed in my brain "MOU IKKAI"
>> ARTICLE
**WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!**

i knew it was coming (as a manga reader) BUT HOLY CRAP THAT WAS SOOOO SATISFYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh man and here i was ready to rave about yamaguchi's serve, and then suddenly kag's drop! BUT THE WIN ALL IN ONE EPISODE?! OH YES! OH FUCKING HELL YES!!

i'm so looking forward to the next episode. we have 26 episodes for this season, right?
>> ARTICLE
I came
>> ARTICLE
This episode was by far the best out of s2 imo, that part with Oikawa in the last rally with the long fast set and the animation with him recovering from it was absolutely AMAZING. 
>> ARTICLE
Did any one else notice all of the similarities with this episode and the last time they played them? The end of the set was very similar especially. 
>> ARTICLE
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS EPISODE WAS SPOT FRICKING ON I WAS HYPED EVERY SINGLE SECOND DAMMIT I LOVE HAIKYUU 

THAT SCENE WHEN OIKAWA WAS ON THE FLOOR.........LOOKING UP AT KAGEYAMA.............................THEN AT THE VERY FRICKING END WHEN HINATA COULD SEE THE CIRCLE AND IT KEPT BLINKING AND OIKAWA COULDN'T GET IT PROPERLY.....................DAMN
>> ARTICLE
[THE MAN OF THE FUCKING OUR](http://imgur.com/k2hy9OH)....WHAT A SAVE

OMFG I GOTTA GO ALL CAPS BECAUSE HOLY SHILJGKLDNMLknfdlkgfdngfld...!!!!!!!!


BEST ANIME!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Phenomenal episode. LOVE how they used the exact same shots from last season's finale match on that last point to specifically call out that kageyama and hinata together have surpassed oikawa.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody is talking about Buddha Tanaka's epic save!
>> ARTICLE
I swear I burn 2000 calories just by watching Haikyuu

>> ARTICLE
This was the best episode so far this whole series, my god. Probably the best episode of the season too. So fucking good.

Even though they lost, this match pretty much cements Oikawa as my favorite character of the show. Can any manga reader tell me if we will see more of him in the future?
>> ARTICLE
talent is something you make bloom. instinct is something you polish
>> ARTICLE
So i wonder how much of the next season the shiratorizawa match is gonna take because it went from chapter 151 to 189 (38) in the manga for just that one match whereas the aoba josai rematch was 129-148 (19) which is 19 less chapters
>> ARTICLE
SHOYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>> ARTICLE
By the way, my heart just dropped when I saw the manager's reaction to when the captain (sorry can't remember names from the amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins) caught Oikawa's serve. Like as if she doesn't get any cuter than that.
>> ARTICLE
I almost threw my plate of dinner! That's how intense this shit is! So many holy shit moments! Kageyama slaying Oikawa and making him realize who the real king is! Hinata's block, holy shit! This whole episode, just holy shit~!!

And next week, the infamous meme is coming! XD
>> ARTICLE
10/10, what a fantastic episode. I had tears in my eyes throughout the whole thing. 


>> ARTICLE
My heartrate was off the roof, this show is going to kill me one day! Does anyone know the name of the song that was playing during the scene right after the OP? That slow buildup was amazing
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga but watching it animated was an even more amazing experience. I was at the edge of my seat watching! Kageyama's dump is such a reckless play but still ingenious. Nothing you can expect from him. Hinata taking the final point is such a sweet taste considering he was blocked the last time.

I love Aoba Jhousai (love Oikawa and Iwaizaumi) so I am sad to see them be defeated but there can be only one winner. They won the last time and Karusno fought to death to win this. Season 3 HYPE! The long and intense 5 setter match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa begins!
>> ARTICLE
The amount of emphasis they put on the eyes this episode made this episode really intense imo
>> ARTICLE
Anyone knows what's the OST during 16.34 when Oikawa's coach was talking and then in 18:50?  This episode was simply breathtaking, I had goosebumps throughout. The music was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
how is erased any close to this quality somone tell me please
>> ARTICLE
How many chapters into the manga did the show go?
>> ARTICLE
This was only the semi-finals right?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, finals in season 3
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, that was beautiful. Kageyama's dump and Oikawa's cross-court toss were awesome. And I love how Oikawa scrambled to get back when he fell, kicking chairs away in the process. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that there are no comments about how that last point ended exactly the way that it ended the previous time they fought against Johsai. 

Hinata up against three blockers. This time though, thanks to the new impossible set, Hinata could *see*. 

It's a beautiful nod to their previous match with Johsai and to everything they learned since then. 

Oh and I'm happy to say I saw this ending coming from months ago. It's just too perfect for the story to not do. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never held my breath so much until this episode.  
God damn this was tense as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda expecting points to get past 26 where it's like Season 1, ending past 30. But, during the episode, specifically during the last rally, "nah, too many epic moments for each of the players already, this should be the deciding point."
>> ARTICLE
Yachi entering the club and getting the jacket was amazingly satisfying for me. Tsukishima made it even better with everyone showing their jackets except him. I need a picture of that scene, it was great.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa didnt notice it. But yeah he is that kind of guy and thats why we love him so much :D 
>> ARTICLE
i love how tsukki stayed in character for that like nope, he won't do that. hahaha!
>> ARTICLE
Hah, how did I not notice that. [Here's the screencap.](http://i.imgur.com/7FU2wFe.png)
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know who the 3 dudes in the back left are...  Were they even given names yet?
>> ARTICLE
They're Kinoshita, Narita, and Ennoshita. The first two don't really have too much character development but Ennoshita becomes involved in the plot later when we find out that [manga spoilers](/s "he's probably going to be the captain next year.")
>> ARTICLE
Well for Narita [Manga Spoilers](/s "Narita is going to be getting a lot of playing time in their last set in the best of 5 against Ushiwaka because of Tsukishima getting injured")
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy he's finally getting some development but [manga spoilers](/s "I hope Tsukki gets better soon as he's my favorite. But I do want Narita to finish the match because he really needs to show off.") Hopefully Kinoshita will get some story time soon!
>> ARTICLE
Kinoshita, Narita, and Ennoshita
>> ARTICLE
I noticed it because I love Tsukishima as a character and it was a lot of black and then some white, so it stood out to me. Thanks for the screencap though!
>> ARTICLE
Haha he's great. I remember at the end of one of the games last season it showed everyone bowing but him.
>> ARTICLE
How is it even possible to make every single character in a show so likeable without them feeling like copies of eachother? Haikyuu is so amazing at making everyone feel so human. 

Also the animation was noticeably good this episode. I was sort of worried we would get a dip in quality after season one.

The final like 5 second made me cry from laughing. It's so comforting to know what the best show this season will be by the third episode ;)
>> ARTICLE
I agree about the animation. It makes the characters seem more normal with how fluid it is.
>> ARTICLE
[Oh Yachi, you better get used to it.](http://i.imgur.com/alyExNM.jpg)

Mmm.
>> ARTICLE
[My doujins are writing on their own.](https://i.imgur.com/mZsn3HW.jpg)

Man, what it must have meant to Hinata to have seen that poster. "The Little Giant Returns!" 

Definitely misted up a little bit there.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until the away training in tokyo. Shit gets real intense.
>> ARTICLE
i had to stop for a second to take it all in when i got to that point [in the manga.](http://a.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9904/09-076.0/compressed/i012-013.jpg)

it was a really great moment, possibly one of my favorites to be honest. (there's more to come, people! it just keeps getting better.)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I want to burn through the manga or just take it in week by week. All I know is that the wait is killing me
>> ARTICLE
Go for it!! Once you've started, it is pretty hard to put down. It is just that gooood.
>> ARTICLE
The whole decision segment got to me, what is this liquid flowing off my eyes?
>> ARTICLE
I've said it before and I'll say it again, it's the heart that makes this show so damn enjoyable. I've yet to find another show that has that same feeling.
>> ARTICLE
I felt some chills when I saw that poster. It was a great moment.
>> ARTICLE
I loved that it paralleled with the first scene of the entire show. Hinata riding his bike when "The Little Giant" catches his eye. 
>> ARTICLE
That sent shivers down my spine. I gotta give it to Yachi for coming up with that idea too. That's a brilliant picture to use for a poster, and I know it would catch my eye.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, although I have to wonder what was wrong with the original poster that her mom said needed to be improved, since it showed that Yachi asked Hinata for help immediately after telling her mom she wanted to be the manager.
>> ARTICLE
The mom saying there was something wrong likely came before Yachi asking Hinata for help, and it was just presented in a different order to provide background plot (pretty much like a flashback).
>> ARTICLE
Did it though? I thought she asked immediately after, and then it cut out before the question was asked. 

Then they went back and showed that scene after Yachi's scene with her mom and Hinata seeing the poster.
>> ARTICLE
Oohh yeah you're right. They seemed closer when the mom says there's something wrong, so it came after the train station scene. Wait a minute... If she asked Hinata for help before she was criticized by her mom, why did she envision the spike **then**?  Surely she must have come up with the idea of using Hinata's spike as an image before then, because she asked Hinata for help... 

Okay, the only explanation I can come up with, is at first she had the image, up on the computer, with some bland black writing saying "The Karasuno High School Volleyball club is looking for donations." or something, and then when she thought of Hinata jumping for a spike, the phrase "the little giant" came to mind. So she then changed it to "The Little Giant Returns" and spiced up the font a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I think that has to be it, because I can't think of another situation that would be the reason why the mom didn't think it was that impressive. Solid work team!
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect it at all it was perfectly executed
>> ARTICLE
The hype is real. That was one of the best moments in the entire show for me.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, probably one of my favorite moments as well.
>> ARTICLE
[Their reactions are always so awesome!](http://i.imgur.com/THvnjeJ.jpg)

The way they welcomed Yachi to the club was great, plus that poster she made was amazing. Couldn't stop grinning this episode.
>> ARTICLE
From the looks alone, I'm guessing bottom right failed. It would also be interesting as a narrative, because a new kid needs to take his place
>> ARTICLE
They haven't even gotten their tests back I don't think. Pretty sure those are their "PLEASE HAVE PASSED, I NEED TO PLAY IN THE AWAY GAMES" faces.
>> ARTICLE
But that dude is my favorite! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's awesome. Sorry I forget his name, I've forgotten almost all of their names except Hinata. ~~But the guy's a third year, and~~ I think our speciality serve-guy needs some ego-boost. Maybe.

edit: stupidity
>> ARTICLE
I'm bad with names too. I can normally only remember Kageyama and Shimizu's names lol. 
>> ARTICLE
Bottom right is Tanaka, bottom left is Nishinoya, and they're both 2nd years.

I mean he probably can be bothered, just not bothered enough to do the pose.

But he didn't even bother to say welcome to the team with the rest of them (minus Kageyama who at least posed)!
>> ARTICLE
[Yachi got hit with a downvote irl.](http://i.imgur.com/MK8G81X.png)

I love how this is a sports show... yet they haven't *really* played the sport for 3 episodes and I'm still hyped. Yachi's a great addition to the cast.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting kind of annoyed with Yachi's super nervous personality. Like I'm sure it'll settle in but for the past 2 episodes half of her screen time is her freaking out for no reason. 
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda how a normal person would react to Hinata and co being super intense, though. Hinata gets fired up over nothing every 15 seconds, in fairness. I'd be freaked out, too.
>> ARTICLE
haha it's even infectious! Like in episode 1 where Hinata was freaking out over a bus, and fields, and signposts....
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I must admit I do get a bit fired up myself when I hear Hinata getting fired up. He makes no effort to hide how excited he is about things. =P
>> ARTICLE
They could not play for the rest of the season and I'd still have a blast with this cast :)

Gotta agree with Ryu and Noya, [the more lively Kiyoko](http://imgur.com/FZ4G5eR) is really great this season.

And I like how Ukai just calls them "the four Idiots."

it's so true, and i just realized with this episode how fitting her VA is for her character. she sounds so mature and put together yet still gentle and kind. *gaaah!*

Yachi and Hinata's conversations are even better. They communicate without even using real words.

It's like, she's an actual character now! Seriously this is great, compared to season 1, where she felt a bit like a cardboard cutout.

What allowed the transformation was that Haikyuu never used her as a fanservice character.

I'm loving this second season, even more than the first. Yachi's an awesome addition to the cast, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters on the show. And it's amazing how good they are at building hype even though they haven't actually played an official game yet.

Man, I wish I had the patience to wait until this finishes airing so I could binge watch it. Waiting a week for each episode is killing me.
>> ARTICLE
 loved first season but second so far have been even better... this shows quickly becoming one of my favourites.

Goddam Hinata, why must you stir people's hearts without realizing it? This is not a shoujo manga yet I'm still shipping Hinata x Hitoka.

Great episode.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's yawn was really cute it reminded me of how Yacho compared spending time with Hinata as being in direct sunlight. That boy tires you  out
>> ARTICLE
Alright, more Yachi, woot!

The scene with Yachi's mom talking with Hinata and Kageyama wasn't in the manga; that was where the freak quick duo is supposed to meet Ushiwaka for the first time. Props to whoever decided to rearrange things---it made for an amazing climax in the first episode while putting more focus on Yachi in this one.

We're finally gonna meet the Fukurodani group next episode! Can't wait!!!
>> ARTICLE
A pretty great episode, it's great to see all these Yachi moments animated. And I had the biggest shit-eating grin when [major manga spoilers](/s "Tsukishima said there's no way they'd be able to block Ushiwaka.")
>> ARTICLE
Do you think they're gonna adapt the game that's going on right now in the manga before the season ends? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really hoping so! considering they did the huge hyped set-up in the first episode this season!
>> ARTICLE
I think they'd have to. Unless they pull a Yowapeda.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I think it'll likely be towards the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
It's really hard to tell whether they're going to get to the game where the spoiler occurs. Considering how many chapters the first season covered, they would have to condense quite a bit in order to make it in 26 episodes.

oh my god when the non manga readers see this in the show, I can't wait for it.

I freakin know right? oh my god I can't wait for that moment.

It's perfect, thank you kind sir.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show. I think this is getting added to my top ten. Thank you whoever did the rewatch. I didn't join, but I checked out the finale rewatch thread and decided to binge this show. Best decision ever! Love the cast - season 2 is even better than season 1. 

Three episodes in and I'm sure this is AOTS for me. Yachi is a nice addition to the cast. I enjoyed her interaction with Kyoko. It great to see how passionate Kyoko with being manager of the volleyball team. Yachi's mom is awesome and hot. Even thou there hasn't been much volleyball lastly, it still very enjoyable. I have the biggest grin on my face every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole Hinata-Yachi interaction from getting the textbook till the subway station was super cute, I didn't get the same feeling in the manga, glad to see that the anime adapted it better :)

Also, we're getting HEY HEY HEY next week which should be great!
>> ARTICLE

Hooting intensifies
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the way the relationship between Yachi and her mother was shown. It was ratter quick (half an episode?), and yet enough to make me smile as her mother was impressed by her confidence. This anime knows how to create hype out of everything!

Also, that Hinata poster was awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Hitoka has been such an amazing addition to the show. Seeing more Kiyoko was already a bonus but now we get a cute ship also. Loved seeing an episode focused on her, liked her in episode 1 but loved her in episode 2 this show just has such great characters :)
>> ARTICLE
fucking christ, not everything has to be a "ship"
>> ARTICLE
You seem to have a hatred for shipping? At least I'm not fujoshipping lol
>> ARTICLE
She really brings back the awe of seeing the simple stuff that we should have already been used to. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed that too and love it :3
>> ARTICLE
I never would have thought that a sports show would have such great characters. Just seeing everyone interact with all their little quirks leaves me smiling each episode.
>> ARTICLE
It got me emotional, laughing and smiling. they introduced her mom this episode and she had some powerful moments for me! 
>> ARTICLE
I thought her mom was going to be the cold parent type at first be she turned out to be really caring which was a nice change.
>> ARTICLE
Sports shows always have the best characters! There's just so much room for development as you watch them go through their struggles and failures until they're finally victorious.

Some of the best characters and character development I've seen in anime has come from shows like Chihayafuru, Baby Steps and Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Major!  It has a fantastic cast!!
>> ARTICLE
Put characters through the stresses of battle, strength, endurance to test their mettle and to watch them grow as a result. Basically every shounen, and as long as the characters aren't 2D, it works every time.

This show is going to end up being my favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
No Lie I was super excited for that episode of Haikyuu. This may end up being my favorite episode of the season. It also does awesome jobs with the subtle things like Hinata Bowing much lower than everyone else before the match and the managers almost villainous smirk to show that she is in and a part of the team. But the A story with new girl and her mom was so well done I'm excited to see the rest of the adaptation
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has a perfect combination of being serious when it has to and overall goofy and comfortable at other times. The series is just so soothing to watch. It warms my heart.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was EXACTLY as I wanted it to be. I was so hyped about this and they totally delivered. It was just perfect, as a reader I'm completely satisfied and happy. Yachi x Hinata canon please, they are the cutest thing EVER and they're totally made for each other.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoko's advice on "all you need is curiosity to start with", Hinata's poster moment, the "Townsperson B" feeling in the second half of the episode. I identified with a lot of moments because I'm one of those people who felt like they're unlucky for not having a passion in their life, always stuck in a "Townsperson B" role.

I was seriously tearing up multiple times. Thank you Haikyu!
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! always makes me tear up in every single episode. I suppose all of them are somehow very heartwarming 
>> ARTICLE
One of the most heart-warming episode i've watched, each character was unique in their own way and can't wait till next week 
>> ARTICLE
FANTASTIC EPISODE, SHIT! Got massive goosebumps when i saw the poster made by Yachi. She is awesome and her story about joining the club was very well done, too.

Also some nice and short volleyball with the amazing OST's returning. I loved this.
>> ARTICLE
ahhh I can really relate to Yachi a lot. Much as I'd like to try new things out of curiosity, I usually end up spending more time worrying about a million what-ifs before committing to something. She and her mom are both super cute (haha tissues!) and accomplished though.

and omg that last second tanaka monk pose

I loved seeing Hinata power up in the back ground before the match.

Can someone make a gif of them getting their exams back?

That was one of the most chilling smiling grinding episode i ve seen. I mean like this is the best anime. Comedy, slice of life and action all packed together
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, this season is leagues above the first so far and is a strong contender for my AOTS. The characters are just great. Two weeks in a row now where I couldn't stop smiling for the whole 24 minutes. I'm beginning to fall in love with this show!
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could upvote this episode more than once. It was such an amazing scene where Hinata saw the poster.
>> ARTICLE
That's my favorite eyecatch yet, with Yachi's instant dogeza
>> ARTICLE
Oh my Gaaaaawwwwwwwddddd this episode was amazing, the poster got my teary eyed for sure and Yachi is gunning for that best girl spot. Don't get me wrong Manager-san is a beauty but I dunno I'm really feeling all this character development for Yachi. 
>> ARTICLE
This show never fails to get me smiling. It started out great and continues to be great! :D I always find it super neat that they use shots of Hinata like [this](http://imgur.com/jHi836T) to convey a sense of intensity in his attitude. Super excited to get to some actual volleyball next week!

wonder why not more ppl are into this.. i think this is one of the better anime this season..

Just keeps getting better.

This episode is so cute! I love Yachi, and I loved the moment when she's yelling at her mom at the train station. Townperson B can fight too! 

I'm really excited about the upcoming arc as well. I've been keeping up with the manga, and I can't wait to see what happens next animated.

Yeees, loving this and that poster! 
DAMN. 
Yachi is too cute though, too cute.

Another excellent episode and the poster was great. Loved Yachi can't wait for more Haikyu action.

Anyone know the song thats being played during the match?

Someone want to tell me why they say "Nice serve" before the serve is even hit? :P (I don't know volleyball, just watch this anime)
>> ARTICLE
That's just how they say "give a good serve" it sounds a bit weird since we would use the phrase "nice serve" differently.
>> ARTICLE
It's sort of like, *go for a nice serve!*, just condensed. Like you'd tell someone at bat in baseball to hit it out of the park.
>> ARTICLE
Good luck and motivation?
>> ARTICLE
why have sports anime such good openings and endings? 

hachi is adorable
>> ARTICLE
I'm not imagining this, right? I feel like they're kind of building up a Hinata/Yachi setting.

I don't want to call it a pairing or coupling, because Haikyuu isn't really a show for that, but I feel like they have those two interact more than she interacts with the others, besides Kiyoko.
>> ARTICLE
Got a little teary-eyed at that poster... Hinata finally seeing his dream come true after years of hard work.
>> ARTICLE
"Townperson B has its own kind of awesomeness!" is for me one of the best lines in Haikyuu ever. It's a very empowering quote.

After last week's epic episode I'm not even prepared to wait another six months for the next stage, even though that's not a long wait at all in anime terms.

"I got goosebumps." *To say the least*

[This upsets me](http://i.imgur.com/nsrSLkJ.png) :'(

[Ok, happy again](http://i.imgur.com/JZkhgOZ.png) :')

[THE SMUG FACE FROM LAST SEASON RETURNS](http://i.imgur.com/nQrm0A0.png). And [this one should be a contender for sub reaction face](http://i.imgur.com/HMicOPF.png).

[These two](http://i.imgur.com/1qKbOdD.png) and [these two](http://i.imgur.com/XAxhwBO.png) make me want a napping buddy...and then there is [Kageyama](https://41.media.tumblr.com/7d6ed67fbcba431e1e8ba05428043a1a/tumblr_o4nvo1Z4Lv1se2hxko2_540.png).

[This moment just gave me all the feels](http://i.imgur.com/R1OsHsz.png)! I was always somewhat disappointed that the Karasuno support crowd was small compared to the other schools, so it's beyond heartwarming to see the whole school recognizing them like this.

TFW the episode is over and you realize again that "tomorrow" is **six months away**:

like seriously, is he ok? I'm concerned. Poor tired baby.

I didn't even think about how long the wait's gonna be. Six months? UGH
>> ARTICLE
That's a lot better than being a Kuroko fan. 2 years (2013 - 2015) between seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Let's not even get started on the chapter pacing for that last match. Like, it was great, but was it going-for-more-than-1-year-level great? Was it 60+-chapters-worth-of-one-match-level great? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a giant Kuroko fan and waiting week to week for the [](/s "Rakuzan") match in the anime almost killed me. When I actually went back to read the manga version though, it hit me that it was just under a year chapter wise going week to week. How in the world was that? I couldn't even imagine reading Kuroko Weekly since I never just read one chapter at a time
>> ARTICLE
>How in the world was that?

It sucked donkey balls, especially since half of them would end on cliffhangers. I learned my lesson by the time the anime rolled around though, I didn't touch the last 11 or so episodes until everything had finished airing.

Oikawa's face is priceless.

You must undergo wilderness survival training to be able to withstand the level of hype that is sure to come in Season 3 anyway, so you should be *thankful* there is a six month wait.

[I spent all week writing up a long character analysis of Oikawa.](http://minuteart.net/2016/03/26/oikawa-blooms/)

He's probably the most important non-Karasuno character in the show, and more or less the main antagonist of the first two seasons. He provides a foil for Kageyama plus a complement to Sugawara and so many other setters and players. Also I have a pretty serious mancrush on him.

Seeing as how his high school volleyball career ended last episode, and his arc reaches a semi-conclusion/turning point this episode, it's only fitting to look back at what got him to this point. Hope you enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the manga, so how does his arc continue? Isn't he donezo?
>> ARTICLE
His arc hasn't actually continued in the manga, but this episode/chapter doesn't really conclude him as a character. The implication is that he will continue to play in college, presumably against teams that feature Ushijima and other geniuses. At this point, Oikawa has lost to geniuses, but has doubled-down on his pride. Whether or not we ever see an official storyline past high school remains to be seen, but even if the mangaka doesn't continue to that point, there's enough development for fans to do so on their own.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa is easily my favorite non-Karasuno character, so I just wanted to say that your analysis is pretty awesome and thank you for writing it all up  :)
>> ARTICLE
oh man I forgot all about college, Oikawa is sure to get on a good team.

that makes me happy.
>> ARTICLE
> there's enough development for fans to do so on their own.

In all seriousness though, some of the fanfiction written on Oikawa's growth as a university setter is absolutely amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Example?
>> ARTICLE
Great write-up, I loved the spacing using the pictures between your paragraphs. It made the read much easier than a wall of text, and supported your points.  

I've always thought that the use of the word genius in Haikyuu was slightly misleading. Prodigy would be the word I would use, or perhaps physically talented, but I understand that the meaning of genius is often the same, and it was subtitled this way.  

Of all the characters, I tend to think of Oikawa as the closest to a mental genius. He uses his teammates as the weapons in his arsenal, and outside of his killer serve, it's his decision making that really moves Aobajsai forwards. It's the way he has changed his game into such a calculated, thinking sport, in response to the pressure that he feels from those naturally talented players.  From his strategical attacks, to the carefully thought out words he uses to inspire or motivate his team mates, that make me consider him the closest to a genius in the traditional sense. 

On top of all this, he has a sense for the game, and many of the decisions he makes are in the moment. He comes across as the most cerebral player, although he often disguises it behind his cheerful persona. While Kenma from Nekoma might be more intelligent, at this point he lacks both the desire and the communication skills of Oikawa.  

Sorry for the minor rant, it's just something that comes up when I think about how Oikawa refers to these talented volleyball players as genuises. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I think being able to see the show as you read about it really improves the essay. Perhaps a video is even better, but that's something for the future :P

As for the geniuses thing, I think it might just be a matter of translation. I'm in no position to say for sure, but I think the Japanese word doesn't really hold the same connotations as the English 'genius'. In English, 'genius' has come to refer to intelligence more than anything, although its meaning isn't actually that narrow. When Oikawa says 'genius', I just read it as implying some sort of raw talent or advantage.

I definitely agree with you though.
>> ARTICLE
I could read book after book just on Oikawa's development. Thank God for fanfiction.
>> ARTICLE
>Thank God for fanfiction.

That is not a sentence I am accustomed to seeing.
>> ARTICLE
> I have a pretty serious man crush on him

Don't we all? Nice write-up, by the way.
>> ARTICLE
We're only human, after all :P
>> ARTICLE
Great analysis! Also, the fact that he almost got Hinata's spike is also symbolic, in the same manner as he's feeling that he can touch that level but he cannot definitely surpass it.

But then, would the wall distorting the course of the ball imply Ushijimas claim as true, that he would be better off in another team perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa would rather struggle to take a set from Shiratorizawa than team up with Ushijima to win. His ego won't let him take the easy way out.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what's really interesting about this episode. It's kinda just up for us to decide. Oikawa is definitely more likely to win tournaments playing for Shiratorizawa+whatever college Ushijima attends, but maybe his pride is worth a harder road to success. Oikawa certainly seems to think proving he can overcome geniuses is more important than playing with them.
>> ARTICLE
I would think that to Oikawa that playing for Shiratorizawa would have been like playing for like the Bulls when Jordan was in his hey day and had Pippin and Dennis Rodman. the team is a powerhouse. So winning isn't something that would be too hard, but Oikawa going to another team that he could make better and even play to the level of Shiratorizawa or even beat them would be much more meaningful. Yes it was prideful but the victories meant more knowing that he could actually make a team that amazing and bring them to another level 
>> ARTICLE
And so ends this fantastic season of Haikyuu, I didn't think any sports anime would top season 1 but this season was just fantastic.

This wasn't a hype finale but it was still a great one. I actually teared up twice, [once](http://i.imgur.com/acb6Rc7.png) for [Yui](http://i.imgur.com/LTstJnL.png) and again during Yachi's speech. Seeing the whole school cheer them on was such a nice touch!

If season 3 is even better than this I have no idea how I'll be able to handle it.

Edit: [Bonus](http://i.imgur.com/Yy6VrpN.gifv) [Yui](http://i.imgur.com/FMU9hAP.gifv). Seriously seeing her again put the biggest smile on my face and when she saw Daichi was hurt *hnnnggg* that is what ships are made of :)

(don't worry, no spoilers), the Karasuno Girls Volleyball team would be there to cheer the Boys Team against Shiratorizawa at the stadium. More Yui is always great.

To see Karasuno welcomed back like the triumphant heroes...that had to have meant so much to all of them, but even more for the third-years. Even when asked to stop playing, they kept going. And to see that sight...man, I can't even imagine.

This was AOTY for me. I'm expecting Handa-kun in summer to come close, but nothing will top this. Everything was perfect. As a manga reader, this was a perfect example of a perfect adaptation. 

I can't wait to see the match against Shiratorizawa animated. Fall 2016 will be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so, clear this up for me because I've been confused on the whole thing for a while now. For example, when an anime starts in fall 2015, and continues on into the next year's Winter season 2016(in this case) Is it counted as an anime from 2015 or 2016, or both? Because I've been waiting for this moment to make it official, that Haiykuu season 2 IS my AOTY...2015...Or is it 2016...I don't know, but to me it feels kind of cheap to have this as AOTY 2015 AND 2016, because believe me, and I may sound hypocritical for saying this but I doubt there's any future anime coming out this year that can top Haiykuu S2. But there is always the third season coming out in Fall, so I suppose its inevitable. Haikyuu potentially AOTY 3 times in a row?...Wow.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I have not seen or read any Jojo.

I have just caught up to the latest BnHA chapter and I'm pretty excited for the anime, however I can't help but feel uneasy about the adaptation, not about the studio, I think Bones will do great, but pretty much if it will come down to being a 10-13 episode series or a 22-26 episode series. I just can't see this one being a successful adaptation unless it gets atleast 22+ episodes. 

Also, I always say that too about a season, that it's going to be the "greatest" season ever, but by the end I leave with finishing like 5-6 shows and dropping a bunch of them. So, I guess I learnt not to get over hyped for upcoming seasons.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on people and if it's split cour or not. Usually a 2 cour (2 season/24-25 episode) series will be counted from the year it started, in this case 2015. However, some people will still count it for 2016 awards, specially if it's as popular as Haikyuu.

If it's a split cour then they usually account for both years.

I imagine a lot of people feel the same.... this second season is currently top #12 on MAL

As someone who took part of the first season rewatch as a first timer, it's been since mid-September that I've been watching new episodes of Haikyuu either daily or weekly. I don't want this 7-month long tradition to end.

[](#frustration)

Now we've gotta wait the same amount of time before we see more. October can't come quick enough.
>> ARTICLE
I know! At least we have the manga which is weekly so it's not like Haikyuu completely disappears, but it will be so weird not having any Haikyuu to watch unless I rewatch everything. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm hesitant to get into the manga because I feel like this series in particular benefits so much from being animated. The animation itself is gorgeous, the VAs nail it, and the OST is godly. I'll probably give in after the third season, though. The wait for a fourth seems like it'll be a long one.
>> ARTICLE
I understand, but sort of disagree. Sports manga in general benefit from animation because you can see everything going on. KnB imo is one that greatly benefits from being animated because the manga sometimes makes what's actually happening hard to follow. Furudate does an absolutely fabulous job of showing movements so it's really not too different from the anime. It's also one of the few where I didn't feel any less hyped about the show after getting into the manga. You are right the anime does add a lot, but the manga is still really absolutely fabulous on its own. 

As for the wait, I don't know. I'm sort of wondering if they aren't planning for the whole 3rd season to be the Shiratorizawa match (which would be crazy, but because of the lack of much else pretty possible). If it was it probably wouldn't be much longer of a wait since there would be pretty much a whole year of content for them to make the next season from by that point.
>> ARTICLE
All valid points, I totally get you on everything. I've gotten lost before just in the 3d space that manga is trying to convey before and I could totally see it happening in one confined to a basketball court where movement and positioning is all really important. I'll definitely give the manga a try after season 3, then.

Based off [the name of the third season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32935/Haikyuu_Karasuno_Koukou_VS_Shiratorizawa_Gakuen_Koukou), I'm pretty sure it'll just be the one match, and probably only 12 episodes at that. How much longer would we have to wait after the end of the 3rd season for enough post-Shiratorizawa source material for a full additional 25-episode season? I wouldn't be surprised if it was ~a year or more.


>> ARTICLE
That's why I love the Haikyuu manga. I've never gotten lost or confused about what was going on or what he sort of motion he was trying to portray. 

> How much longer would we have to wait after the end of the 3rd season for enough post-Shiratorizawa source material for a full additional 25-episode season?

I doubt it would be that long because Shiratorizawa ended the beginning of this year (like second or third week of January). Season 3 isn't starting until Fall which is another 6-7mos. Then if it's 25 episodes it won't end until March again so that's over a year of manga content. Right now there's already almost a third to a half (depending on how they did it) of season's worth of content past Shiratorizawa. But I'm doubting that it would be part of season 3 because it would make a really weird second half of a season imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I might be biased, but Haikyuu, especially this second half of the season was probably the best series of the season. The source material is incredibly strong, but the anime studio should be praised as their adaptation made it even better.

This second season of Haikyuu had a decent advantage over the first season. We already had the main cast fleshed out, experienced a taste of tournament games, as well as a harsh loss to recover from by improving the team through training. Arcs with the Tokyo clubs as well as the tournament matches that led up to Karasuno facing Aoba Josai were all really good parts in the manga which as I've mentioned before were made better by the animation studio who stepped it up in their own way from the first season. They also made sure to make the final match of Karasuno vs. Aoba Josai the most hype thing ever. Episode 24 of this season is definitely one of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen. I've read the manga before hand, but I was on the edge of my seat from the excitement that the animators created in those final points. I could mention a wall of things that was done well such as Tsukki character growth, Yamaguchi serve, faceless 2nd year stepping in for injured captain, and much more. This series BROUGHT EVERYTHING and DELIVERED.

This final episode set up the next season which was already announced because this show is amazing, which will be the Karasuno vs. Shiratorizawa match. I will say I'm slightly worried about how they're gonna do that match. It was a really long arc and in my opinion the animators should do what they can to try and cut unimportant material and keep that whole arc to a 12 episode series. That's just my opinion from my experience with the manga, and that is only if they plan on focusing on the Shiratorizawa match and a little backstory of some of the charcaters.

God, there is so much more I want to say like the emotion you seem from the characters. You really felt for Aoba Josai at the beginning of this episode. Also the comedy is still there for the show as well and the characters are all just great at being who they are. That's not only Karasuno characters, but the Tokyo characters with Kenma and owl-boy, Aoba Josai's team, the adults, the supporters, EVERYONE IS AWESOME.

 I felt a bit emotional near the end when Kageyama and Hinata were thanking Yachi for her being there from the attachment I've gained through watching this series and being a supporter. In a weird way to me, it felt like the animators were using that scene to thank us as viewers for being here and watching the masterful animation they worked hard to achieve. Since in a way we're basically in Yachi's position of just just wondering into a volleyball anime and watching the games play out and I know that I'm thankful for the amazing matches I got to see. I feel like I'm saying amazing a lot. I digress though, if I say anymore  it'll just be more complements to a great series.

Haikyuu 2nd Season gets a 10/10 from me. If anyone thinks, oh this is a sports anime? I've seen Free! I'm not gay (Free is still fuckin good though), or who gives a crap about volleyball... GIVE THIS ANIME AND MANGA A CHANCE. Trust me, I thought the same thing when I started watching the 1st season, but you will soon understand how great this series is and not regret starting.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with everything you said. I dont read the manga so I was happy that some of the characters got some special attention. Besides Hinata and Kageyama, Daichi really stole the show. Totaly a meh volleyball player but his heart brings morale to the team. I enjoyed every scene that he was in even at the part how he described his new bruised face to the girls. Just an outstanding man. I guess thats why they chose him as the Captain. 
>> ARTICLE
>Totally a meh volleyball player

You take that back. Oikawa acknowledges the whole team is strong.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't know what to say. It was just... incredible. Haikyuu S1 was such an amazing and unexpected experience for me, and S2 managed to, somehow, beat it in every single aspect. It's just otherworldly! I cannot wait for the next season. [Is it even possible to be better than season 2](http://i.imgur.com/enYEIBX.jpg)?!

* Since I came in late for the discussion, I just wanna say that [Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/zfJr0Ls.jpg) is an incredible addition to the cast. I think her biggest strength comes from the fact that she's a polar opposite of [Kiyoko](http://i.imgur.com/El88Pta.jpg). She's super expressive, outspoken, imaginative, and the show constantly shows us her thought process. Not to mention that she's simply goddamn hilarious and her interactions with Hinata are amazing.

>  the fact that she's a polar opposite of Kiyoko

When Kiyoko was being stern with the guys I immediately thought of another character she voices ;)

[Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/Khljpe5.jpg) though wow just her addition alone would have made this better than season 1, she was just such a treat :)
>> ARTICLE
> I just wanna say that Yachi is an incredible addition to the cast.

Yachi was a great addition, indeed. I didn't expect her to add so much to everyone's development at first but as you said, she's so expressive and outspoken that she helped a lot with that (especially Hinata-Kageyama). Also, [great](http://i.imgur.com/qEmUtXp.gif) [reaction](http://i.imgur.com/Q9JBsrk.gif) [faces](http://i.imgur.com/UK2VbxQ.gif)!

The match against shiratorizawa is a day after the previous match right? Then why do we have to wait half a year to watch this! Curse you time!
>> ARTICLE
F*** it, I'm going to rewatch both of these seasons.
>> ARTICLE
I'll definitely be running a rewatch of both seasons before S3 airs. Assuming S3 starts airing around the start of October, the rewatch will probably start sometime in August.
>> ARTICLE
It's better the second time.


>> ARTICLE
Or the third. Or the fourth. Who needs to study- not me.

No mom I'm not crying because of a volleyball anime.

Everything about Haikyuu is amazing, the wait between now and season 3 is going to kill me. I want to see Hinata and Kageyama put Ushijima in his place so bad.
>> ARTICLE
;_;

I teared up so many times this episode. Iwaizumi having that short crying moment post-match broke my heart a little, especially because he's normally the strong one that keeps Oikawa in check. And Kindaichi in the hallway :( And Oikawa! Man, the past two episodes reminded me that he's my favourite non-Karasuno character. Hell, he might be my favourite overall.

But aside from all the sad tears, I can't wait for the next season. It just sucks that tomorrow on the show = six months from now ;_;
>> ARTICLE
It broke my heart when Iwa-chan was beating himself for that spike. Call me a pansy but the feels were really strong in that scene! 

Don't worry Iwa-chan, you're still best Seijoh in my heart ~~(and my Haikyuu OTP with Oikawa)~~
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised people aren't talking about Iwaizumi more, and how he let his team down. If anyone has ever been the go to guy and you mess up that shit hurts more than anything, you'll be in the shower like two years later and it'll suddenly pop back in your mind. 
>> ARTICLE
"We who grew from the concrete..."

Hinata sure knows how to wrap up a season. It's amazing that a post-match episode, instead of feeling anti-climactic, manages to keep me hyped and entertained.

Another Daichi x Yui moment, Yachi being adorable, Hinata-Kageyama bromance, Nishinoya and Tanaka being dorky... this episode had all the out-of-match elements I enjoy in Haikyuu.

I don't know if I can survive the wait for season 3.

Aghh redrawing took way too long ^^^^and ^^^^it's ^^^^not ^^^^even ^^^^good

Second half after the bus scene was anime original so don't have any comparisons of scenes after that. Also I'm a little sad they removed [Daichi's dream/the 3rd years as 1st years (minor spoilers?)](http://imgur.com/a/I7cvf) but hopefully they'll include it in S3!
>> ARTICLE
Can't thank you enough for these!
>> ARTICLE
Amazing story, adaptation, OST, animation, characters. By far the best sports anime I have ever seen.

[](#scrumptiouslymoe)

Nice way to finish the season, although I would've preferred that it ended with Ushijima's jump serve and the ball getting closer to the screen until it went black, but it was nice too.

Now we have to wait until fall for the longest match yet on haikyuu (almost 40 manga chapters!).

This episode covered from chapter 148 up to the beginning of chapter 150 (They changed and skipped some things from around the time they were on the bus back to school so you should start from chapter 149)

There were a lot of anime-only scenes in this episode which I am actually really happy for. They were really great and added a lot to some of the characters. Or with the whole school cheering them on ....... No these aren't tears in my eyes... ;_;

For those who can't wait until Fall or just want to know in general, last episode ended at chapter 148 and this at 149 or 150. Somewhere around there.
>> ARTICLE
[Same here!](http://i.imgur.com/781oAud.jpg)

This was a great end to the season. So happy they won, yet also sad for Aoba Johsai. Even [Kiyoko had tears in her eyes!](http://i.imgur.com/KeTZkPl.jpg)

This show always makes me feel like I like every team and feel so bad when some of the opponents lose. Same this time, [there were some really sad moments](http://i.imgur.com/nk0UMFY.jpg) that had [equally great encouraging moments](http://i.imgur.com/wkuFBc3.jpg) (that look on Oikawa's face just shows he's trying so hard to hold back). 

[Spectators](http://i.imgur.com/QKgZ8YB.jpg) also sad for Aoba Johsai but also [thrilled for Karasuno](http://i.imgur.com/tITuLN3.jpg). Loved both reactions, not to mention [everyone who waited for them back at the school](http://i.imgur.com/cr3BwpN.jpg) (love the look the other girl is giving Yui there, it's like "Come on, we know you like him!")

As for [Oikawa's](http://i.imgur.com/pL6XMLs.jpg) meeting with Ushijima, I liked how he stood up for what he chose and how he mentioned Kageyama. It showed how he also thinks they've progressed a lot. Also, some really good reaction faces there, once again like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/0LbJNoQ.jpg), [this one](http://i.imgur.com/8Jgfb5g.jpg) and last but scariest [this one...](http://i.imgur.com/VMV9Hnd.jpg) O_O

I really can't wait for fall to come. I want the next match right now!

Gahhhhhhh it's just so great. Loved that entire scene!

Yeah between the last two I don't which I like better...that last one was just too awesome though.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for season 3! I wish the next episode was tomorrow like the next game is in the show. I also realized while people were getting congratulated everyone except Tsukishima had there moment this season. Tsukishima had some minor ones but not that huge breakthrough one. I can't wait to see what his will undoubtable be next season :O
>> ARTICLE
Oh, you won't be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Is Ushiwaka just some oni drifting through Japan? He's always walking by himself just waiting to say ominous shit to the other characters. This was an incredible cool-down finale though, definitely setting the stage for next season very neatly, although there aren't many 'loose ends' to tie up in a show like this, so it has so much freedom to just develop characters and relationships, which is what this entire ep was about.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe that's why he is called "Mr.Japan". 

Seriously tho, he just pops out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
What should I even do with my life until fall now. Season 3 couldn't come sooner.
>> ARTICLE
It's been real, friends. :'(
>> ARTICLE
Great last episode, sad that it's over, happy that it will start again so soon.

Ushiwaka can look at Oikawa and Aoba Johsai and honestly say that he chose the wrong path... just ugh.

Kageyama and Hinata couldn't even remember that they fought, classic simpletons. And Yachi was so worried about them, too.

Well then, Fall can't come soon enough.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how I'm going to manage to make it without Haikyuu every week.  The total support when they got back to school really teared me up.  

I want them to beat Shiratorizawa so badly.  The insults he gave Oikawa after the match really made me want to see them lose so badly after how hard Oikawa tried.
>> ARTICLE
Ah they ended with my favorite track on the entire OST.  LOL @ the way Tanaka and Nishinoya slept on the bus ride home.  Since Haikyuu is literally the only anime I watch nowadays allow me to just say I'm going to miss these weekly Haikyuu threads.  Ladies and gents, it's been a pleasure.  See you all for season 3!  Fall can't get here fast enough!
>> ARTICLE
I couldnt help relating to Yachi during that final talk with Kageyama and Hinata that if she had never decided to become part of their management team - she would have never been able to see them grow and reach the epic heights that were episode 24. 

I dont usually watch sports anime and Knb is the only other one I've seen some of (have had it on hold at s2 for a year now)- so deciding to watch Haikyuu was something I really did on a whim and I wasnt wowed by the first episode but boy am  I grateful I stuck with it because episode 24 is easily one of my favourites of anything ever and I honestly dont know what my anime experience would be like if it werent for these characters and this series. Time to pick up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
This season was so phenomenal. I wouldn't change a thing.
>> ARTICLE
C O N C R E T E B O Y S 
>> ARTICLE
Welp, that settles it, Im too hyped to wait for season 3, i need to read the manga now. Also this is such a good show, im really glad i decided to watch it. I've really enjoyed coming to know and love the characters of this show.
>> ARTICLE
Nope. This amazing anime has ended. It will probably makes a lot of  people pick up the manga after this, because how can you not?? Thankfully, they will make the most hype match ever, soon, in fall season! 

Also for sure we will meet Oikawa again! How can we not with such amazing last line from Oikawa to Ushiwaka? If only this manga never stops, watching these guys become even more amazing player in higher level will be such a treat! Although the impact of Oikawa's 'worthless pride' was better in manga. But the additional scenes from students in Karasuno was amazing! 

This season has been such an amazing season. The animation is clearly one of the best. The soundtrack never fails. The comedy is still top notch. And although most of the time you can predict where the match is going or ends up, we still feel the sorrow for other teams. That's what I love the most about Haikyuu!! Not to mention the characters' development and interaction which is an absolute joy.

Also it's not everydays occurance in anime when the previous season you were crying because of your protagonist team lost, but in this season you cry because of 'enemy' who had beaten your protagonist team lost. Oh, Haikyuu!! 
>> ARTICLE
How did they even manage to make the end of a season episode so hype?!?! Argh!! 

Amazing adaptation by Production IG. They added a lot of scenes (the whole second half was practically anime-original) and everything just worked and helped to hype the upcoming S3. Can it be October now?! 
>> ARTICLE
GAH are you kidding me? This episode hyped the Shiratorizawa match up so much and now we have to wait until fall... :'(

Seeing Aoba Johsai so sad pained me, but "the team with six strong players is stronger" and Karasuno just so happened to be stronger. Oikawa, Iwaizumi and the other third years will despair for a while for sure, but they'll eventually recover from it, and the kouhais will practice even harder to get their revenge next year.

When Yachi reminded Hinata and Kageyama of their fight earlier in the season and they didn't even remember it- classic Hinata and Kageyama- that was priceless. Right before Yachi even mentioned it, I was totally thinking "the two of them practicing tosses now totally parallels them practicing tosses earlier in the season, cool" so Yachi's comments were terrifically timed.

I don't know how I'll manage to wait half a year for more episodes, but I'll try my best. Until then, I'll just have to rewatch the show several times and listen to the soundtracks on repeat nonstop.

Well, [see you all this fall!](http://i.imgur.com/2QqV8Ii.png)
>> ARTICLE
A nice, quiet little finale to cool us down from all hype of the last few episodes. If there's anything I've realized from watching this show, it's that Oikawa is one of the best anime characters I have ever seen. Never have I liked and rooted for the antagonist in a show as much as I did for him. Everything about him is just perfect: from his funny childish and petty outward behaviour to his cocky and smug attitude, to his extremely relatable struggle against those with natural talent. I really hope we get to see more of him in the future!  
>> ARTICLE
I honestly forgot that they had one more match after Seijoh. This has to be the most intense tournament I've ever seen in any anime, sports, fighting, etc. 

The fact that we get a season 3 so soon after this ended is probably the greatest gift the anime gods could ever give us, well maybe not including a Haruhi season 3, but still. I don't ever want a world where this show doesn't exist. 
>> ARTICLE
Wish we got more of Mad Dog and how he felt/what he was thinking after the match, but oh well.

This was a really satisfying conclusion to the season. I'm so hyped for S3 and the match with Shiratorizawa.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I love how this show makes me feel for both teams. Great character development all around. 

Gonna go down as one of the best sports anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
My first real sports anime. Gave it a 10. No shame. Now watching *Eyeshield 21* because I need more sports. Season 3 can't get here soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to discourage you or anything, since it's always great having more sports anime fans, but I would recommend reading Eyeshield 21 instead of watching the anime. The whole reason the series got popular was due to Murata's godly art, and the anime was really deprived of that.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo, Baby Steps, Diamond no Ace, and Kuroko no Basket  are definitely some you should check out.
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 was a pretty bad adaption from what I was told, to get the real experience you should read the manga because the art is absolutely incredible and the story is great though much less realistic.

If you want a good sports show, def pick up Hajime no Ippo which is easily the greatest sports show of all time. If you want something a little more modern, Diamond no Ace is pretty good and if you can deal with the campy first season, Major is a great show as well it just goes on one season too long.
>> ARTICLE
What a fantastic journey. I cant wait for the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I didn't expect the wrap-up episode to get me teary eyed like every other episode does. My favourite scene was when the entire school stayed behind to show their support for the team. Haikyuu's story is just about a bunch of high schoolers who really like volleyball, but scenes like that make you forget how little that would matter in reality, and instead want to believe that there are groups of people who are truly that passionate about a single thing.
>> ARTICLE
That's how you end a season! Fantastic.  

Woe my weekly Haikyuu fix, though.
>> ARTICLE
The wait for season 3 is gonna be painful...
>> ARTICLE
There wasn't even any playing and I was still hyped out of my mind holy hell I love this show!
>> ARTICLE
I want to protect Yachi's smile, she is so cute! 

That scene where Karasuno congratulated the team was really awesome to see, you can see how much it meant to the team. as well as Kageyama and Hinata bro fist

Finals hype! How long is S3 gonna be?
>> ARTICLE
Yachi best girl!


...also I love the guitars of that ending song.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't go with the scenes from the manga. Probably the only thing I didn't love about the season
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if the matches in real high school tournaments are played on consecutive days like in Haikyuu!!. Sounds pretty stressful to play multiple matches within little time even though volleyball isn't the most physically demanding sport. I wish there was a short time span given to teams to come up with new strategies or to rest, etc.

Either way, season 3 hype!
>> ARTICLE
It's gonna be hard to find a new sports anime to top Haikyuu! It has been an amazing adaptation which I have watched with pleasure. 
>> ARTICLE
6 MONTHS. I HAVE TO WAIT 6 MONTHS. I'M NEVER COMPLAINING ABOUT HAVING TO WAIT A WEEK FOR A NEW EPISODE EVER AGAIN.

Often time reading the manga ruins the anime experience, but damn this adapation was perfect. It made me laugh and cry while leaving me on the edge of my seat. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I really hope this isn't the end for Oikawa. He's gotten so much character development over the past two seasons, I can't bear it if this is the end of the road for him [unless the managaka has something else planned ;) ]. He's my favorite character by far and I even cosplayed him for AB. Here's to hoping for a triumphant return!
>> ARTICLE
Amazing season for haikyuu. 

I kind of wanted them to incorporate [ spoiler for Shiratorizawa match](/s "Tsukishima into the picture in this episode as the battle vs Shiraoriawa is really a battle between Ushijima vs Hinata and Tsukishima") But whatever. Super hype for season 3.

[Spoiler](/s "I have been dying to remember this chapter. It was such an amazing moment and its going to be such a great episode.")

Fall couldn't come any faster. Well, I guess I can finally get off of Karasuno's wild ride.
>> ARTICLE
I was interested to see how they ended this season without making it feel a bit odd. They did a really good job making the final episode. I'm excited/nervous to see how they handle the Shiratorizawa match since it's so damn long. It's absolutely fabulous, but it went on for like 6mos so that's a lot of content for one match.

Also everyone getting their face shoved into Saeko's boobs make me laugh ([Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/hpeL45u.png), [Tanaka](http://i.imgur.com/UMCakN8.png)). Along with her Saeko saying "What you can't handle some boobs in your face?"

Thanks dude!

What an absolutely amazing show...I came into haikyuu originally not expecting much and now it's definitely one of my favourites! 
>> ARTICLE
This anime always gets me with the little things it does. I was so happy and weld up a little when they went back to school after winning and seeing everyone had waited for them to cheer for them.

Also when Hinata at the end met with the Captain of Shiratorizawa and said "i want to fight him" his facial reaction of excitment was so freaking good and the music with the violin is way too good at pulling on your emotions. It also gave me flash backs to when they showed the Crows fighting the Eagle in the sky. Done so freaking great.  I'm upset i have to wait for another season. 

These sports anime are so good. After watching Hajime No Ippo, Kurko No Basketball, Prince of Tennis and the one about bicking with the kid with the glasses and yellow jumpsuit I have been getting into sports anime way more. 
>> ARTICLE
well damn! haikyuu keeps on surpassing expectations. this was a darn good finale with all the feel-good and heartwarming bits in it.

i am sad we won't be getting more of this week by week *but* at least we don't have to wait too long! 

i can't even pick a favorite moment to fangirl over in this episode. IT WAS JUST GREAT. ALL OF IT. noya and hinata toppling over the whole team (aww!), the sleeping karasuno, yachi's general adorableness, yui!!!

Just wait till the anime catches up to where the manga is. Tsukki is now one of my favorite characters.

When do you think the anime will catch up?

This season will probably end where the manga is at right now. Maybe 2-3 more chapters even.
>> ARTICLE
I really doubt that. We're going at ~2 chapters per episode, and with 80+ chapters to go, they'll have to put a lot of it in a 3rd season

We'll see. There's no good place to end it between the game now and where they're at in the anime. Unless they end it right before the current game in the manga which would be pretty dumb IMO.

wait one or two weeks because the manga is in the middle of a match and it'll be done in a couple of chapters 
>> ARTICLE
couple...sure haha
>> ARTICLE
It honestly can't be stretched out much farther. 1-2 to finish game, 1-2 reactions
>> ARTICLE
For sure. If it doesn't end in 2 chapters max they're really pushing it. This game is great but it's been going on for around 30 chapters now. 
>> ARTICLE
Lmao the last Kuroko match in the manga went for over 60
>> ARTICLE
lemme guess, they won, like by the slimmest margin humanly possible? once a battle/game exceeds a certain length, it actually tends to decrease rather than increase the suspense because you know there's no way they'll lose
>> ARTICLE
BINGE IT. COMPLETELY WORTH NO REGRETS.
>> ARTICLE
I want to but I'm in the middle of Berserk right now and don't have enough time on the bus :/

I may though. I think I'll wait for the season to end (around 25 episode mark) then I'll binge and catch up with the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I think watching it after this season ends might be a good idea. It'll build an appropriate amount of hype if it ends where i think itll end. Message me when you do read! I'll be down to re-read and discuss.
>> ARTICLE
I may. I might not because I'm totally lazy and might forget :(

Maybe every 20 chapters or so :)
>> ARTICLE
Okay! I hope you don't forget because its such a fun read!
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. I've been thinking about picking both it and Noragami up. And Gangsta. Damn that 'fuck you, read the manga' season end...
>> ARTICLE
Man, Haikyuu is full on the Tsukki hype train, both manga and anime. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a favourite character pool and he'd contest first place right now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so ready. He's always been one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of feel like i'm the only one who doesn't really like him that much.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait
>> ARTICLE
> who doesn't really like him that much yet

FTFY



>> ARTICLE
He has a really antagonistic personality. This past few episodes and his growth later change a lot of people's views on him.
>> ARTICLE
But he's already so tall...
>> ARTICLE
I'm still laughing about this.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow... that look Tsukki's brother gave him from across the court was just heartbreaking. 

[](#forgotkeys)

I wasn't sure if I wanted a flashback sequence at first, but that was really well done.
>> ARTICLE
I felt pretty heartbroken and I'm so glad it wasnt just him losing a game like I thought last episode it would be.
>> ARTICLE
I was certain it was gonna be that his brother got injured. Somehow I think this was sadder.

>> ARTICLE
At least with injury he will still have the younger brother on his side.

In this scenario he completely lost him.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I felt like this was the only way it could go early on this episode. Last episode, I was split between the scenario we saw and the injury crushing his brother's (and, by proxy, his) world angle, but with all the tension we saw building in his brother, knowing that his brother also was on the same team as "The Little Giant" (sourced from Tanaka's older sister, Saeko in an earlier episode), and all the "he feels inferior to Hinata/won't put in effort to be his best because "it's only a stupid [fucking] game *teeth grit and angry stomp away*"" moments between the other characters RE: Tsukishima I became pretty certain this was a story of bitter betrayal, though I honestly didn't see the betrayal coming in the form of his brother being the aggressor until they did the flashback with all Tsukki-Onii's hesitation in body language getting added as the extra ingredient to the concoction... I did think it was well done.  I loved Tsukishima as a kid. Perfect, haha

>> ARTICLE
Oki, limb here, so feel free to chop me down: Review [this](https://streamable.com/o739) scene graciously provided by /u/tsumehtai below. Towards the end, after Yamaguchi says "what more than pride", Tsukishima comments "To think this day would come". This obviously has the surface meaning that gets directly spelled out in the form of Tsuki telling Yama that he "can't believe he's cool", but there's a possible ironic interpretation as well: "he never thought the day where he could understand (maybe not forgive, but understand) his brother's actions." At least begin to. He seems to be smiling at his memory of his brother and all his own pent up emotion about it. There's reason for him, Tsukishima Kei, to be outside of that experience with his volleyball, too. So a third interpretation, even! (kinda 2.5, I'd say).

I appreciated how they kept him level headed and didn't give him so dramatic moment of realization, though I'm wanting the pace to increase. I just want to see him [own already](https://45.media.tumblr.com/bb77e06966e4ffd35d3460723b4f0834/tumblr_ny5x3mUFjc1qimk8ao6_r1_540.gif).  (also from /u/tsumehtai  - seriously, thanks yo.)

This anime and Diamond no Ace always make my week. I can't figure out which I like more
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is a fun, very fast-paced and exciting anime with the very typical storyline of underdogs to champions. While One-outs is a completely different beast, a more psychological anime than sports and deals with much more mature themes. The focus is mostly on one or two characters at most and ignores all other characters. Overall I preferred one-outs, its main character Tokuchi Toua is such an epic person
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
IMO I would say yes , give it a chance. I really like Diamond it's very exciting and never fails to disappoint 
>> ARTICLE
i found giant killing pretty boring but sure, then there's eyeshield 21, cross game and major. they're _amazing_

one outs was amazing but doesn't finish unfortunately. kuroko is good fun.
>> ARTICLE
I love Haikyuu but I can't get invested into Diamond no Ace even though I've read the manga and watched the anime. I guess it's because I just don't like stupid characters. I don't mind if they stretch it a bit with the jokes but at a certain point Sawamura just gets annoying to watch because he's just so stupid.


Haikyuu draws a clear line between being stupid for comedic relief i.e Hinata, Tanaka and Nishinoya and their normal behaviour which they showcase during matches and otherwise. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm right there with you for years I hated sports animes, But summer of last year s1 Haikyuu I figured I'd give it a chance so binged that then binged diamond and a whole bunch others now their a guarenteed corner of my must watch every week, as to which I like better I think it's tough, Diamond... is a bit....slower in my eyes and the way they do cliffhangers piss me off Haikyuu Cliffhangers after showing off something cool, then pumps you up to see more, Diamond Cliffhangers right before something cool and forces you to watch wondering what it could be and thats more aggravating to me I suppose, so I guss I like Haikyuu more...but really not by much

>> ARTICLE
Any chance you have watched Cross Game? 
>> ARTICLE
I have not but sounds like it'll be a busy sunday for me.

>> ARTICLE
It is fantastic! Its a 50 episode show, and I finished it in less than a week because it kept me hooked. I would say its about 40% Romance, 40% Sports, 20% Comedy. The art is styled a little older, but it is great. If you like the character development aspect of Haikyuu you will like this show, plus there are a lot of those Haikyuu-like moments where something awesome happens in a game where you are just left feeling all "Eff yeah!". I don't want to talk it up too much, but it really is a great show.
>> ARTICLE
Alright if this sucks you owe me a sunday :D haha
>> ARTICLE
Hah fair. I'll tell ya what, if you go through the first 5 or so episodes and absolutely hate it I'll buy you Reddit gold. No lying though!

Giant killing was great, so sad it got shit canned.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like sports anime are very essence of classic shonen tropes of camaraderie, overcoming your own weaknesses and challenges set by others, improving yourself physically and mentally, often just for the sake of your own growth. I also find, that sports anime can utilize "absolute defeat" as a trope much better, than anime based on fighting to the death, because you don't have to pull "dragon balls" out of your ass to keep characters in game, so to speak. It just works better. Absolutely love most sports anime.

Major is probably my favorite series of all time, although binging on it is nowhere near the same as watching it, year after year, when it was coming out, growing with characters and watching them grow. Man, I love it so much, it makes me tear up a little. Such a journey - I don't think anime industry have it in, to make something like this again, but as long as they are sports anime, I will watch sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Absolute defeat, I can def uinderstand as being better portrayed here, adn shit 154 Episodes I have some watching to do. 
>> ARTICLE
Yowamushi Pedal has some great death scenes even though they don't die.
>> ARTICLE
*Furuya no Ace
>> ARTICLE
I really hate this term, as an anime watcher, you should know this show has less to do with sawamura and more about seido. Also, I can bet you my life, that sawamura has a considerable amount on screen pitching than furuya. The whole point of the show is the rivalry between furuya and sawamura and sawamura achieving the ace status as the underdog. Please, stop with obvious biast you have toward sawamura and you feel butthurt that furuya gets about equal time shown on the show as sawamura.
>> ARTICLE
No need to get defensive. It's anime. It's all subjective. People will care about who they want to care about. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, relax. I'm pretty sure he was just poking fun at the fact that the protagonist (which is Sawamura, btw) is being completely overshadowed by a supporting character. I'm sure he understands why this is the case, as you so eloquently pointed out. 

And what's wrong with having a bias towards a character? You're telling the guy he can't have his own opinion? 

It's good to be passionate about a show, but maybe don't shit on other people while displaying said passion.
>> ARTICLE
I am not saying it's bad having a bias toward a character, but when you use it to make a pretty dumb statement such as "furuya no ace" it kind of gets on my nerves when the whole point of the manga is that sawamura gets overshadowed, that is why he is the "underdog" and at the last minute he is going to snatch the ace position from furuya. I wasn't trying not to be dick, but everytime I open the  diamond no ace thread when a new episode comes out all I see is furuya hate and the same joke of "furuya no ace." What do you want? Furuya to magically give up his spot as the ace and give it to sawamura and call it a day. The terijime is setting up an "underdog" story and that is what is so good about the anime. It breaks away from the shitty interhigh, beach summer camp, romance subplot, Goku style moves to create a story about rivalry and team strategy. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're coming from the "underdog" perspective, No shit Furuya is getting hate, because he's literally the main character's competition
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, I'm pretty sure most fans recognize that. They're still frustrated, since we're over a 100 episodes in and the spotlight's still on Furuya. I understand their frustration, but you're right; this isn't the typical formula that's followed, which is super refreshing in its own way. 

I think we're all frustrated, but I know the payoff will be well worth it. For now, I'm just trying to enjoy the ride there.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't think people realize the act 1 of the manga is 413 chapters, with part 2 just started is going to be probably as long. Right now the anime is around 350 chapters in or so.
>> ARTICLE
Beware if you read all my previous comments, I'm a furuya supporter.. HE'S THE ONE TRUE ACE

LEAVE.

Athlete not playing to their full potential, episode title with the word "hero" in it, recurring visual motif of the moon that comes from the kanji in their name, and they're voiced by Kouki Uchiyama.

Holy shit I never made that link between This and Ping Pong! Both are so alike and with the same monotone voice
>> ARTICLE
The samurai beheading moment was done super well! 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Haikyuu and Ping Pong are totally different in how they address winning. Ping Pong was about finding the ambitions to play and realizing who/what you play for, while earlier in the season of Haikyuu Hinata said something along "Why do you need a reason to win?" Both different, yet fantastic shows. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, in a sense, ping pong is aimed for an older audience who's gone through the "teens", and feel emotional when looking back upon it(i know i did), how everyone struggles and shape to be so beautifully

whilst, haikyuu is just a very well handle shonen sports, ie, there's significantly more hype around haikyuu, cuz suspense and impact is important for shonen anime, to grab attention people who have "shorter" attention spans, whereas, ping pong, it slowly builds up to the best moment over the whole anime
>> ARTICLE
Yeah episodes 10 and 11 of Ping Pong are my 2 favorite episodes ever.

Trust me if it actually spoils anything for you, you haven't really been paying attention.  It just confirms something that you probably already suspect if you've been watching.

Bokuto showing why he and Kuroo are Best Couple. The scene between Tsukishima and Yamaguchi was well done (They've adapted pretty well the manga overall).

This episode covered chapters 87 from page 16 up to chapter 89.

Bokuto and Kuroo are hilarious lol they kill me every time

I live for baby Yamaguchi and Tsukki. Also I love the lil moon on Tsukki's hoodie lol.

Didn't even notice that! What a cool addition
>> ARTICLE
Well that was a really good episode. You could really feel the tension when Yamaguchi confronted Tsukishima.

Can we take a moment to praise the soundtrack? It's been great all season, but the music that played at the end of this episode was *fantastic*. It really gave me the feeling that something big is coming.
>> ARTICLE
Btw if anyone find this soundtrack plz link me the video :) 

>> ARTICLE
Also what about the piece that played when Bokuto was motivating Tsukishima? With the intense fiddle?? AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
*yeeess* that one was pretty epic and fitting.
>> ARTICLE
Ouch my heart. 

So mini Tsukki was basically Hinata, with the same interest in volleyball, problems getting along with new teammates upon joining a team, and dislike for recieving. He even got the exact same advice about receiving that Hinata got from Sugawara way back in season one. 

Unfortunately, unlike Hinata and the Little giant, his idol happened to be his big brother, who had all the same passion for volleyball but not enough of the talent.

Can't wait for what's about to happen next.


>> ARTICLE
This anime is just way too freaking good
>> ARTICLE
Some of the manga moments I was eager for have finally been animated! One of the things Haikyuu!! does really nicely is giving all of the characters some form of personality or development, from the side characters to the other teams' players...

Tsukishima could easily have remained the sneering pseudo-antagonist from the first episodes/chapters throughout this entire series, but instead he too is given depth and and reasons/motivations of his own. Yamaguchi could have easily been relegated to 'the sidekick' archetype but he turned out to be a lot more than that (heck, he's one of my favorite characters). 

I dunno, it's one of the reasons I think Haikyuu!! is pretty great -- it's one of the reasons I got into Haikyuu!! despite not having much of an interest in sports anime. 

Also, the animation quality shined with Yamaguchi and Tsukishima's confrontation just like it did with Kageyama and Hinata's fight. Mainly with Yamaguchi's movements, I mean. 

Really nice seeing the flashbacks animated as well. 

>> ARTICLE
I saw it coming that Tsukki's brother was lying the whole time, but damn, his soul-crushed face when he was found out. I almost felt like **I** was the one who ended up getting caught up in the lie.
>> ARTICLE
The thought of tsukishima actually putting his full effort in something for once is making me squeal like a fangirl
>> ARTICLE
* Baby Tsukki and Yamaguchi are absolutely adorable :(
* Oh man. That moment when the brothers saw each other across the court... heartbreaking.
* YES Yamaguchi has his little outburst. And Tsukki's smile! :D
* Oya? Oya oya? Oya oya oya?
* Daaaamn Tsukki really went for it there. 'Bokuto-san, ima nigemashita'
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to actually like Tsukki.
>> ARTICLE
don't worry, you will like him more
>> ARTICLE
That look in his eyes when Tsukki found out the truth...god damn. I can only imaging being so proud of your brother only to find out he's been lying the entire time.
>> ARTICLE
Well that was nothing short of amazing, Tsukhishima is definitely a force to be reckoned with now.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching the episode and ooh man. Tsukki is so wonderfully relatable which I adore. Hinatas comment about Tsukki needing to be cool was really great as well.

I'm pretty interested in the image that went with Yachis last comment because it was the moon existin in day time aka at the same time as the sun. Perhaps the best way to pull out the boys potential is to have them on the court at the same time?

(also the captains are so charming and completely steal any scene they're in. Oya oya.) 
>> ARTICLE
> Perhaps the best way to pull out the boys potential is to have them on the court at the same time?

i hope we'll get to see their dynamics animated soon. your guess is actually pretty close there. :)
>> ARTICLE
So many great things from this episode. Baby Yamaguchi is honestly the cutest!! Bokuto's speech was probably the best moment this season other than the freak combo meeting Ushiwaka, and the soundtrack is once again on point.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Kuroo give me life.

This anime is always such a roller coaster of emotions. It's the thing I look forward to every week and I love everything about it. Keep on keepin' on, Haikyuu!!.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is the only show this season that I'm VERY excited to watch each week (Kagewani is up there as well). Definitely AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
I think this completely kills the whole "Glasses senpai is the Little Giant" theory, since Tsukki and Yamaguchi have both seen the Little Giant.  I mean, so has Hinata since the beginning, but Hinata is a bit of an airhead, so it can be explained away, but it's unlikely that someone as cerebral as Tsukki would forget the person who was the actual Ace instead of his brother.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the fact that Senpai is 29 where as Saeko is only 21 so that theory was killed once she gave her backstory about going to Karasuno at the same time as the Little Giant.
>> ARTICLE
I love Yamaguchi, both present and past versions.
>> ARTICLE
I went from watching Doctor Who to going right to this and let me tell you this

That Tsukki flashback and the confrontation with Yamaguchi got me right in the feels. That was just awesome and now I just want Tsukki to kill everything....on the court. And then I forgot to check how much time was left on the episode and just like that the ED kicked in :(
>> ARTICLE
I knew after they were hitting the ball against the backboard that his brother probably wasn't the ace, but not even on the team? That was heartbreaking...
>> ARTICLE
Really nice character backstory for Tsukishima. Better than him just being a to lazy too care smart guy. I do want the next episode right now though.
>> ARTICLE
This is the episode I've been waiting for. Everything finally pays off for both Tsukishima and Yamaguchi. The underlying resentment that Tsukishima has for Hinata makes way more sense. Also, all those moments from last episode where you can see Yamaguchi worrying over Tsukishima builds up perfectly to him losing his shit at him.

Mad props to I.G. They really caught the atmosphere and tension of the couple chapters they covered this episode. Not that that's anything new.

What was the ost that played when Tsukki said, "we don't have to stop it?" 
>> ARTICLE
i am searching for that one too !

do you know at @17:10 ?
>> ARTICLE
Finally caught up to the latest episode. Totally regret not starting this series earlier since I always thought sports anime were not for me, but OH BOY Haikyuu is one of the few shows can get me soooooo pumped and emotional. Probably owes to all the super loveable and relatable characters. Even Tsukishima is starting to grow on me as of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Quite a few grins int his episode.
>> ARTICLE
My personal fav was Kiyoko's when she explained kill blocks to Yachi. 
>> ARTICLE
Those 2 are always doing something great :)
>> ARTICLE
haha yachi is so serious about learning about volleyball so she's lucky kiyoko is there to [actually explain things to her](http://i.imgur.com/iuaCdmJ.jpg?1)...
>> ARTICLE
BRUUUUUUUH Tsukishima my man finally starting to evolve.
>> ARTICLE
ah this week's episode is too short once again. i just want *more*!

i love how the tsukki and yamaguchi confrontation scene worked out. plus the "oy oy oy" from bokuto and kuroo. 
>> ARTICLE
The tsundere of the team is starting to open up!  Favorite part of any anime.
>> ARTICLE
Not only their names, but their hairstyles resemble the sun and moon too :o
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 was great but I like season 2 even more.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, boner. Yep.
>> ARTICLE
couldn't contain myself last week and went back to re read the manga
>> ARTICLE
any idea what the song/ost is called @11:52 ? 

 
>> ARTICLE
Could someone pls tell me what chapter in the manga this was ? 
>> ARTICLE
End of c87 to end of c89.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much :)
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely heartbreaking. Tsukishima's brother... Holy crap man, I felt so bad. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok so this is unrelated to the current episode but its a theory. I am currently watching the anime and not reading the manga so please dont spoil. I've been watching season 1 again and there are a lot of flashbacks to the Little Giant. The more I look at it the more he looks like Takeda Sensei. I know they couldnt be more different but their hairstyle is so similar
>> ARTICLE
No [Tacos](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CChFsjEVIAE5Cao.png) shirt tho ): how come they animated Hinata's stupid red thingy shirt but not the TACOS one? I was really looking forward to it.

Other than that, the tension, voice acting and ost were right on point. My feels were up to my throat all during the flashback. Props to the director!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this would have been a great episode if I cared about Tsukki, like, at all. But I don't, so I skipped over like 5 minutes of flashback out of sheer boredom just so I could get back to characters I like. God bless Bokuto and Kuroo though. 

EDIT: wtf, is it a crime to hate Tsukki? It's not my fault he sucks.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if you watched the flashbacks you'd like him better
>> ARTICLE
I watched like half of it and it *just kept on going*. I think it took me like 10 minutes to watch two minutes of flashback. My options were either skip the flashback or drop the show entirely, and I ain't about to give up my Hinata. 
>> ARTICLE
I take it you don't care about Yamaguchi then? The flashbacks pertained to him too, you know. 
>> ARTICLE
Finishing moves in other anime: "the zone," "emperor eye," "rolling thunder," etc

Hinata and Tobio's: "the quick that goes like whoosh" and "the floaty one"

So much tension this episode, but at the same time... what utter dorks.
>> ARTICLE
MODAFUKIN ZONE !! Fucking love Kuroko no Basuke!!!
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget the Direct Drive Zone.

I love Kuroko no Basuke, I really do, but seriously? A fucking gate?
>> ARTICLE
You love Kuroko no Basuke but have an issue with [KnB Spoiler](/s "the ultimate move emphasizing teamwork? That's, like, the name of the show.  What basketball does Kuroko play? The kind where his team means something to him.")  Seems you made it through over 70 episodes of a cheesy shounen only to be surprised that it was, in fact, a cheesy shounen.  I loved it, but I also realized what it was.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the other teams call it the freak quick but to them it is just the whoosh 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, this show has a rolling thunder as well! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXTJ6Fi5dKQ
>> ARTICLE
but the clip shows the move "rolling thunder again" which is far more stronger than the "rolling thunder"
>> ARTICLE
hehe, I included 'rolling thunder' above, so yea it's mainly just our strange duo that communicates in gyuuns and whatnot
>> ARTICLE
An episode full of emotions. Hinata's and Kageyama's arguments are both valid. Hinata needs to improve so he can become a better asset to the team, but as long as he can't make the play correctly, Kageyama can't toss the ball to him on real matches.

Also the scene where Hinata tries to steal the ball from Asahi was great, you could feel the tension surrounding Karasuno. 

This episode covered chapters 80, 81 and 82 (up to page 17) for those interested.
>> ARTICLE
Hey did you notice that when the Russian guy did the "read block" he touched Asahi's spike and yelled out loud "ONE TOUCH!!" and then they other guy said "Chance Ball" and passed it to the setter which Lev then spiked,right?

Isn't that 4 touches(3 is max right) ??
>> ARTICLE
Blocks don't count as hits. The most effective block is one that flies straight back into the opposing teams court. But a one touch is also good because it takes the pace off the ball. What would be a massive spike down would fly up, make an easy chance ball and easier setup for the next big hit.
>> ARTICLE
>Blocks don't count as hits.

Oh,thanks.Didn't know that.I thought 3 touches where it.
>> ARTICLE
Bloody stupid anime....why is this fight making me cry! DAMMIT!!!

They need to evolve, and when you evolve there are two ways to go, the selfish, or the selfless. It looks like we almost saw the Former and I'm curious to see the latter
>> ARTICLE
It's mainly the timeframe that's an issue too. With only a month left and Hinata's receives and serves the way they are...most people would agree that trying something so drastic could actually make it utterly unusable by the time the tournament rolls around
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's right but so is Hinata in the sense that he (and the team too) need to evolve if they want to seriously compete. The way they are right now, they barely put up a fight in practice matches much less a tournament. It's only a matter of time before people learn to deal with their freak quicks which from this episode has already begun. 

Hinata might be overly ambitious right now but the rest of the team need to pick up on his ambitions and really use this month to develop new tactics and techniques in order to be ready for the tournament,
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has better animated fights than most battle anime.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that fight made me really uncomfortable, everyone's ^supposed ^^to ^^^get ^^^^along.
>> ARTICLE
It was beautifully animated, which made it so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Better now than later, when things get super serious. 
>> ARTICLE
It felt so much like a real high school fight
>> ARTICLE
Yachi telling them to be friends :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah just hearing in the background and running out, that hit me the hardest. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love a well done fight, where you can kinda see them losing control of what they're saying until they explode. It's realistic and hits you right in the feels. Shirobako has a good one between a production assistant and animation director where you can see their self-control just deteriorate until they start screaming.
>> ARTICLE
I remember it being a real punch in the gut when it was first illustrated in the manga but the accompanying music and delivery by the VAs absolutely took the experience to a whole other level.
>> ARTICLE
i agree. you can just feel the emotions in their voices, not to mention it was animated very well. i love that little detail where kags bounced a bit before attacking hinata. oh man, it just looked and felt so real.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think they could go better than the manga but god, Kageyama's VA hit the ball out of the park. So much emotion in his voice, and combined with the soundtrack, it was just damn
>> ARTICLE
There was actually almost no soundtrack in that scene (save for a few dramatic moments), which made it all the more intense as their raw emotion filled voices became the focus of sound instead. Really helped to create that uncomfortable and tense atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to the piano and guitar piece that started playing when Hinata and Kageyama started going at each other (~18:12) and the fact that it continued to be carried over when Hinata and Yachi were walking home.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yeah youre right, I just watched that back. The sudden music really highlights the breaking point of all that tension when Hinata charges at Kageyama. 
>> ARTICLE
The tension has been steadily building up for a while too, which just goes to show how well done this entire season is.
>> ARTICLE
Gaah, I remember reading these chapters, and seeing it animated is just... TT___TT

EDIT: NEXT WEEK'S GRANDPA UKAI WOOT WOOT SO FUCKING HYPED
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa next episode as well!!!
>> ARTICLE
Grandpa Ukai is my spirit animal, this is gonna be bomb
>> ARTICLE
old ukai is kreygasm 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. He's so cool. TT--TT Also there's the extended Ukai family too! I mean, I'm assuming they were relatives. I'm looking forward to the other setters.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, between Hinata (subconsciously) trying to usurp Asahi, and the fight, that was quite the tense episode. Even so, you have to appreciate the quality animation that went into that fight scene.

I can only assume that Hinata will end up improving the freak quick to the point where he can keep his eyes open during it, but Kageyama's thoughts are valid that it could take a long time to get to that point and Hinata should probably just focus on improving serves, receives, and the normal quick in time for the spring tournament. Interested to see how the aftermath of their argument will pan out.

And in case anyone missed it, Hinata was crying [(see the tears?)](http://i.imgur.com/2Vy7MLF.png) as he biked home after the fight and after talking to Yachi about his relationship with Kageyama.

In the preview for next episode, I have no idea what the context of this scene will be but [OIKAWA MAKES AN APPEARANCE](http://i.imgur.com/bpwZ5LN.png). Be still, my heart.

Edit: Also, I just rewatched the fight scene (because it's so well done and I wanted to make myself cry or something???) and noticed the [attention](http://i.imgur.com/15mBsBH.png) to [detail](http://i.imgur.com/paBlQVC.png) in the reflections in the floor, something I've only ever actively noticed before in works by KyoAni (though I'm sure it's been done plenty in other studios' works, I just haven't noticed it as much there). The animation quality was *definitely* bumped up a notch between Haikyuu!! S1 and S2.

>> ARTICLE
I have never been so excited to see Oikawa as I am now lol
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap I've never noticed the high quality in the reflections. It's so nice to see the artists focus on just the little things, they could of gone with shadows but they really wanted that as a focal point
>> ARTICLE
>could have 

Could of is incorrect. As a Dutch person this mistake is very easily avoided because every word is translated and checked in my mind. "of" just won't make sense, other than sounding alike to " 've". But even then of has a very short o sound to it while the latter has a more uhf sound to it.

I find it fascinating how often this mistake is made. To the point I automatically suspect people to write it wrong in their sentences and it more often surprises me when people do it correctly. 
>> ARTICLE
As a fellow Dutchie, I find it easier to just say could've, makes the thought easier and it's  less likely to go wrong (for me at least).
>> ARTICLE
[Nooooo, don't cry, Yachi ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/389r3h1.jpg)

I really can't wait for more! [Scenes like this](http://i.imgur.com/pOIFv8I.jpg) get me so curious and hyped for what's about to come! I really want to know what happens >.<
>> ARTICLE
I love that picture but I couldn't help laughing when I saw Kageyama. It might have been cooler if he was sitting on the tree branch with his back turned, legs dangling and his head turned towards us. But I guess I get the symbolism of resembling a crow. He just looks a little silly to me.
>> ARTICLE
The feathers and squatting remind me of Niizuma Eiji from Bakuman.
>> ARTICLE
Standing (even squatting like Kageyama is in the picture) has a bigger impact in terms of portraying power than sitting does.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. When I saw this scene I interpreted as the King and the side kick. I felt chills after seeing that.

Slav squat is show of power

[Now in wallpaper size.](http://i.imgur.com/Ku3SPOr.jpg)

Question: how do you make something wallpaper size? Like a regular image

It's not really anything like that. I just had the 1080p version of the episode and while having it full-screen, I took a screenshot.

EDIT: You can however use tools like [Waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/) to make wallpapers out of regular images. Just enter the link of the image you would like and try upscaling it, either 1,6x or 2x.

Sorry for the dumb question but can it be made into a phone wallpaper? I already have a cycle of like 7 wallpapers that I really like but I need one for my phone

I don't know what size that is, but you could try any of [these](http://imgur.com/a/uCyUN)
>> ARTICLE
I could feel a chill down my spine when Hinata tried to steal Asahi's toss. He's getting intense as hell. I think Kageyama is really angry at him because Hinata might be acting/thinking just like him when he started to aim for the top setter spot.

Yachi is still adorable.
>> ARTICLE
he became a Passive-aggressive little sh.t.
>> ARTICLE
He passive-aggressively collided mid-air with Asahi, passive-aggressively announced on the court that he was going to stop closing his eyes, then passive-aggressively launched himself at Kageyama shouting he wouldn't let go until he was tossed to. If that's his passive-aggressive, I can't wait to see what his aggressive is then
>> ARTICLE
Your definition of passive-aggressive is weird because physically throwing yourself at someone is anything but passive. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Hinata is 100% correct though. They are getting crushed by the other teams with how they are, so they need to do something, and what they currently are doing isn't enough. They rely on Hinata to be strong, but then they limit Hinatas strength/growth. That doesn't make sense.
>> ARTICLE
daang I didn't even think about kageyama seeing himself in Hinata, that definitely adds another level to their fight.
>> ARTICLE
God I love this anime so much
>> ARTICLE
It feels so weird to call a sports anime and Haikyuu of all things heavy but damn that episode really was. From the moment Hinata bumped into Asahi right in the beginning of the episode you could just feel the tension resonate as it just kept building and building leading up to that super uncomfortable fight between Hinata and Kageyama and it really didn't help to have that feeling related through Yachi who had to witness it all too. 

The shift we're getting in Hinata's character this season is really interesting. I love all the super intense stares and his classic 'well i'm just gonna jump really high and shock you', but it was Asahi basically saying I better sharpen up and watch my back or Hinata is gonna "eat me up" that really summed up for me his current development. 

Cant wait for the tournament and the moment Kageyama trusts in him as he blows everyone's socks off with a new move. 

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode is beautiful in a way I really did not expect from Haikyuu. The tension this week was the most oppressive I've seen since the Tokyo Ghoul S1 finale. And goddamn as much as I love Kageyama he's being an absolute ass of a utilitarian to someone who should be his *friend*. 

There's a lot more I wanna say but my thoughts are still a jumble right now. Apparently Hinata's character arc is, uh, somewhat controversial with manga-readers, but I am hella excited because he's my baby.
>> ARTICLE
why is his arc considered controversial? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know the specifics, but a few of my friends who read the manga said this is when they "started to hate Hinata". (Which is completely baffling to me because Hinata is precious and needs to be hugged.)
>> ARTICLE
O_o because he's being greedy maybe? but he's also actual literal sunshine howww
>> ARTICLE
I guess because he's creating so much drama? But he's *right* and Kageyama especially is being way more selfish than Hinata right now.
>> ARTICLE
But *is* he right? I mean, I understand the drive to improve oneself as much as anyone, but the spring tournament is approaching and I can completely see Kageyama's point. If this were anything but a sports anime where players evolve freakishly fast, I wouldn't think it realistic for Hinata to improve so much in such a short period of time. They're both being selfish. 
>> ARTICLE
As it is, their options are basically: do the Same Old Thing (and we know how well *that* worked), or to try something new. I'm still baffled as to why everyone was so opposed to Hinata trying something new at a *training camp* of all places. If ever there was a place to try a new tactic, that's it. 

He's also right that Kageyama's still stuck in his old way of thinking. Karasuno's victories and losses are all in terms of *him*, in his mind. He thinks of how to *use* his teammates as a setter, instead of how to work *with* them. As things stand, Hinata only matters insofar as Kageyama can make use of him; if their quick doesn't work (and as we've seen, it's not difficult for exceptional athletes to deal with it), then Hinata becomes useless. 

The entire rest of the team are so focused on maintaining the status quo (which Hinata is trying to upset), that they can't see the bigger picture. Which is why I'm starting to think that the third years staying on the team is actually holding them back. Nekoma's coach mentioned that it takes a certain amount of greed to be an ace -- to even want to *be* an ace. With Asahi, I don't think Karasuno is actually used to having an *actual* ace. He didn't want to be an ace, it just got pushed onto him by circumstance. 

But Hinata wants it. He wants to fight to the last second to let his team win (which he can't do if he's only a tool for Kageyama's tosses). And he's willing to stand up to the rest of his team to make it happen.
>> ARTICLE
They all have good reasons. Kageyama summarized his points quite clearly:

1. From the way they see it, there's only a small chance Hinata can even do what he claims he wants to do, much less with just a month to go. And if it ain't broke, don't mess with it. If they're still in midst of revising it by the time the tournament comes around, even their original quick that they'd perfected could be useless if Hinata's still flailing about. Then the whole quality and balance of the team would be brought down. This uncertainty probably plays a bit on kageyama's insecurities too, given his middle school experience.

2. Hinata has a LOT of other things he can work on. Like kenma said last episode, he really sucks at almost all the basics. Today we saw he couldn't even do a single flying leap, which would really help with his receives. Those skills can't possibly get worse than they already are, and if he got better at them, he'd be able to provide tremendous support to the team and stop losing points on serves.
>> ARTICLE
> And if it ain't broke, don't mess with it.

But it *is* broken, and nobody else realizes it. This week, Lev was able to block it in a single set. How long will it last against Shiratorizawa? Nekoma's coach said it, too: will playing it safe really let them progress? 
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I mean I absolutely agree with Hinata, but when the options are possibly split between falling apart long before they can play Shiratorizawa vs not beating shiratorizawa, I can see why the team would choose the safer, less riskier, route
>> ARTICLE
I came here for volleyball hype not for the feels goddammit T_T, now i'm gonna be sad all week till next episode

Edit: Russians sure enjoy dividing a ~~country~~ team
>> ARTICLE
There's always the manga, it's amazing :) 


>> ARTICLE
Geez this was an intense episode, it's one character but I love how much Yachi adds to the show. Even though the main focus of the fight was Kageyama and Hinata I found her part was the one to make me the most emotional. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I can relate to her well, because I'm a third wheel most of the time when me and my friends that are dating go hang out so when they get into a fight I feel basically the same as Yachi in this episode (though I can't go call for help :'c)

Dang. That fight I knew it was coming but ouch :(. Also Hinata jumping into Asahi, jesus christ.

Edit: Also want to say the animation for that fight was awesome.

Haha we should start a Haikyuu group to watch the show together every week or something.  I did that with Breaking Bad back in the day, just a group of friends from all over the country met online via Mumble to watch the show together and discuss it afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I would totally join in on this.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds awesome, should we post something on this sub?
>> ARTICLE
I was looking forward to the fight scene (having read the manga), but, Jesus *Christ* did I not expect that animation quality. Kageyama skid-stopping as Hinata plows into him, grabbing Hinata and then pushing him away, but *especially* Kageyama bounce-stepping/keeping on his toes as he braces for Hinata's rebound. The little details and effort like that helped make the fight natural and fucking fantastic to watch. 

I mean, Haikyuu!! is pretty consistent with having really fluid and high-quality animation, but this scene--this scene was incredible. It exemplifies the high animation standards Haikyuu!! has and surpasses them at the same time. 


>> ARTICLE
i know it was a sad scene but man, it was my favorite to watch in this episode precisely for those details you've mentioned (plus the VA's performances!).
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting that fight at all... and it was pretty intense. Jeez.

looking forward to Hinata's and Kageyama's improved freakquick animated but bootcamp 2.0 is where this seasons's real fun starts.

that was hard to watch. watching 2 friends fight.

this show is so fucking good. i cant ever get enough.

When Hinata was in mid flight about to collide with Asahi I couldnt help but feel so awk . Love this build up though, if they can make it through this they will be stronger than ever.

Why. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Damn, I can't stand seeing Hinata suffering. Can't wait to see how they'll improve!



~~Also I hope my ship get well soon~~

Fuuuuck, that fight hit deep.

There were some really great shots from this ep including the fight scene.

I really didnt expect that. Im not a manga reader. That fight was difficult to watch and I was afraid someone would get hurt. That tension was really well done.

Hypekyuu strikes again. It was hard to see Hinata and Kageyama fighting, but this can only make them stronger.

Is this like the feels weekend? First Noragami, now Haikyu!!. I'm not used to being this emotional during animes. Funnily enough they are both second seasons too.

Thanks bby
>> ARTICLE
This season seems to be focusing only on growth. Whilst other anime chooses battlegrounds as the sudden growth catalyst, Haikyuu seems to be opting for a more normal path. 

It certainly is entertaining though, I really liked 'Hinata' going into sort of zone. It kinda portrays being in zone is useless if it takes you out of sync with the team or you yourself are not ready to be in zone.  

I could really relate with Hinata as an engineering student. There are times, when you are so very motivated but you still keep on failing irrespective of your efforts.  
>> ARTICLE
Where is this in terms of the manga? I've just convinced myself to read it. Or should I start from the beginning?

And where should I read it?

Chapter ~~78~~ 80/82

Read it here: http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/haikyuu-r1873

No need to start from the beginning. There were a few minor (like really minor) scenes missing or done slightly different but they are of no importance

Every time an episode ends I get the urge to read the manga, but I don't want to spoil it for myself. I will probably read once the season ends, but its soo tempting to find out what happens next.

Yup, can confirm.

I won't be stopping anytime soon with reading...

Wonderful episode.  Can't wait to see what Hinata decides to do.  He's definitely causing the rift right now but I also enjoy seeing him struggle and wanting to grow no matter how greedy it is.

That was a really REALLY GOOD episode

Im glad I stayed up instead of going to sleep in order to watch it, the problem is that now Im so hyped it will take me some time to sleep :") but its totally worth it of course

The conflict between Hinata and Kageyama was really well done. I could feel my stomach churning from the emotions caused by the tense atmosphere.

Oh shit that would be awesome.

But neesan would have recognised since she knew the little giant.

Yeah, I noticed the age difference too; hopes were crushed :(
>> ARTICLE
I've got a theory that the Little Giant is the teacher's younger brother.
>> ARTICLE
the coach really dropped the ball on this one. he's actually the one who lead to all this fighting. had he realized the potential and had the courage to help hinata pursue his ambition, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place. due to his lack of experience as a coach, where the players are suppose to look to him as a pillar for guidance, instead, they are left fractured. i hope coach ukai really steps it up next episode. i'd rather see the team crash and burn in pursue of their potential than stable and weak. there's nothing worse than when management is afraid to change and unwilling to take risk because they feel they're better off with the status quo.
>> ARTICLE
that scene made me cry and shout into the screen. 
>> ARTICLE
finally it's animated! damn, you can really feel the tension here. i'm excited for what's to come next. 

i also love how hinata is the baby crow even in canon. baby crow needs to spread his wings and fly, kagayama! come on!

[Nekoma's other coach](http://i.imgur.com/fy5sTVX.png) is down for the count.

I am really glad that Yachi didn't try to get in the middle of their fight and physically stop them she could have gotten hurt. Instead she did the smart thing and ran and got someone else. 

Why must [the](http://i.imgur.com/96ZJJgy.png) [cutes](http://i.imgur.com/Wqtuurm.png) [fight](http://i.imgur.com/75L0rqJ.png)? My heart can't take it

inb4 training episode. I actually really like the training episodes and learning about volleyball though.
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode was quite good.

Anyone knows the name of the OST that started in the beginning when the coach was talking to the players?
>> ARTICLE
I just can't get over this anime. The feels are real. I love all those characters so much and to see the fighting makes its tough, but its these kind of character building episodes that help make the show so much more worth while and amazing.
>> ARTICLE
my babies ;__;; such tense fighting;;; looking forward to see how it pans out (hoping it's win win ...orz) 
>> ARTICLE
Came across a video that showed Hinata doing the open eye spike. Basically they showed it in season 1 in the practice match against aoba josai like hinata said in this episode.

Whats the theme song that starts the episode off?
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Haikyuu season one some time ago but I dropped it after a few episodes... It just didn't interest me as much as other Sport anime like Hajime No Ippo and Kuroko No Basuke. Is it worth giving another try? 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu I think you really need to stick with until after the practice matches & gets into the actual competitions. That's when things settle. I think the beginning can be a bit meh to some people because there's so much set up at that point, but it definitely picks up a lot. It also has a lot of elements that I think were lacking in KnB.

During the first season, it was tied with KnB for me. With the second season it's greatly taken over as my number 1 anime. 
>> ARTICLE
yes. watched knb after watching haikyuu, although it was fun and i enjoyed it a lot, too, i would prefer haikyuu over knb any time.
>> ARTICLE
I love all 3 shows listed; in fact, I rank Haikyuu over Kuroko
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu isn't as flashy as Kuroko is, but the characters and plot/development are a lot better I think (coming from someone who really likes both shows).  It depends on what you're looking for, but especially given how intense the latest episode was I'd definitely give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, boner.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata's latest bathroom adventure had me dying 
>> ARTICLE
The last 5 minutes of that episode had me crying lol
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting for him to say something badass to Ushiwaka when Ushiwaka started walking away, but sadly nothing happened.
>> ARTICLE
Was hoping that they would include this scene this week, legit one of the funniest moments in the series. Ushikawa's smugness level is just amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
He probably just goes to the bathroom for those meetings/adventures alone lately. Worth it!
>> ARTICLE
No kidding. I giggled watching him struggle entering the toilet as I hoped he would bump into Oikawa. Then it got even more better. Oh man, the tears of joy...

I hadn't considered this until just now, but I think that's actually relevant! I think it's really interesting that he's adopted such a similar grin. It fits.

[I missed smug Tsukki!](http://i.imgur.com/Xg3A3zM.jpg)

It's just been two weeks but it felt like ages! The new opening is really good, both sound and animation. Ending, as well.

Kageyama spying on the others and thinking how [great Oikawa is](http://i.imgur.com/WWfX7jk.jpg) was hilarious. 

[The](http://i.imgur.com/fDhZyPx.jpg) [reactions](http://i.imgur.com/GdQtya4.jpg) to Tsukishima asking for advice and agreeing to play were great! 

And once again, [these two](http://i.imgur.com/TfrIODj.jpg) are the best (and completely synced!), they even [froze mid-air together!](http://i.imgur.com/5xOqW65.jpg) (lol [at Yachi's face](http://i.imgur.com/gKavnNQ.jpg))

[Oikawa's "teehee" face](http://i.imgur.com/ZEljKY9.png) on the eyecatch was spot on for his character, too.

I can't wait for the matches!

I'm actually really happy to hear "Go, Go, let's go! Let's go Date" chant, always loved that.

Another training montage to set up this second half...this is going to be so exciting!!

Also really looking forward to seeing more of that girl on the other team, even though it doesn't have many this show excels at them!
>> ARTICLE
I could hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9Uwhjlog8) in my head during the training montage.

Hahaha I also thought of that :p

Love that chant too. So hyped for next episode
>> ARTICLE
I loved Date Tech last time. Hope Karasuno gets to verse them again
>> ARTICLE
The DateKo chant is one of my highlights from the first season.

It's so good that after watching two subpar shows from this season, it brought me back to full hype.
>> ARTICLE
The new ED is AMAZING. Having read the manga, knowing the frames, and seeing it all animated with the same art. Oh man, how cool. Plus tacica is just fantastic.

Going to miss the old opening though.  no more "SHOO AIMA BERIEVAAAAAHH!"

Seriously though, I like the new opening as well.  It fits the show.

Yachi > Kiyoko

I missed my boys so much I barely survived last week.

Also the new op is absolute fire.

Edit: YAMAGUCHIS SERVE OMG
>> ARTICLE
Yes! I was also barely survive on the one week hiatus. And Yamaguchi's serve was amazing. Finally Nishinoya couldn't received it in the end. I also can't wait on follow up of Tsukki's 'glasses' discussion between Akiteru and his mom.
>> ARTICLE
If you notice at the end he's got like the athletic goggles

Like EverythingOP said, [here's Tsukki wearing athletic goggle thingies as seen in this episode's next-episode-preview](http://i.imgur.com/XppQtr5.png). (also lol at Daichi and Asahi's faces)

Fuck, my eyes watered a little this episode when Nishinoya couldn't receive his serve. If he hits a floater serve in an official game I will sob.

If Yamaguchi hits a game winning serve haikyuu is moving up from a 10/10 to an 11/10. 
>> ARTICLE
I will hack MAL to rate Haikyuu!! an 11.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I'm completely captivated by the opening alone. This anime always nails the opening. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't agree at all. I liked the opening that they had before, i don't like this new opening at all. I didn't like the song, i didn't feel the hype that i had with the other two songs, i didn't like that they used photos during all the opening apart from two animated scenes. It would be better if we had yet the opening 1 or 2. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed god damn this opening was great especially animation wise. Will definitely be hearing it on repeat and I will be loving it more as the weeks pass I am sure of it. It could end up being my favorite of the 4 by the end.
>> ARTICLE
And the endings too! I really loved the last ending, and the new one didn't disappointed me at all.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a believer was my favourite opening of last season and I already miss it but considering this is haikyuu I'll get addicted to the new one in 2-3 weeks max :)
>> ARTICLE
I firmly believed that the new OP and new ED wouldn't be able to match up to the last ones because I'm a Believer and Climber were so great but somehow *these ones are even better and I'm so happy*
>> ARTICLE
It is definitely the most well-animated of the four Haikyuu!! openings that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
The song's great too. Kinda sounds like Goose House.
>> ARTICLE
First one all the way. They're all great, but the first one is the best one.

Gotta love a series that doesn't mind taking its time developing something, hope the payoff is as epic as what I've built up in my head.

Given that he spent an entire fucking season getting it to work, I hope he scores at least half a dozen points with it in the next game.

Yamaguchi beating Nishinoya, that was a very nice scene.

I think it's great how they managed to introduce Tsukki and (to a lesser extent) Yamaguchi as antagonistic team mates/rivals and now they are two of my favorite characters.

I hated Tsukishima in season 1 but after reading the Manga he became one of my favorites (Nishinoya and Tanaka still the best though).

Tanaka and Nishinoya never fail to entertain me haha that frozen in mid air scene was hilarious

It should be illegal for an anime to get you this hyped. Loved it.

YESSSSS IT'S BACK IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

* My boy Akiteru! Man, I love this guy. Best bro.

* Oh, Kageyama. You kill me. There simply is no "easygoing" setting built into you.

* Tsukki just let Hinata goad him into trying. That's adorable.

* I burst out laughing when Tanaka got hit in the head. And it was acknowledged!

* Aww yisss Tsukki gettin' some more character development. I like this.

* Oooooo Mad Dog-kun looks interesting. Good to know Oikawa is still terrifying to him :P

* YES YAMAGUCHI CAN DO FLOATING SERVES NOW!!!

* Oh, Bokuto. You're so vain XD

* Yacchan is becoming a manager in her own right! Awwww she's all grown up now.

* Haha Johzenji's manager is apologizing for him. I get the feeling this is a regular occurrence.

* HA Hinata recognizes his own trope.

* LOL it's incredibly entertaining that Oikawa and Iwaizumi are so pissed at Ushiwaka.

* Aww Aone from Date is as polite as ever :)

> Tsukki just let Hinata goad him into trying. That's adorable.

Tsukki is hella adorable. Like a little puppy that's trying to be angry but you're just like "aw, look at this puppy trying to be angry, that's so cute".

Edit: Kageyama the master of disguise lmao
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu properly delivering the hype for this upcoming season. I have to say the animators really were smart by placing this episode's manga events at this point in the season. Brings back all the characters and sets up the national qualifying tournament perfectly by showing everyone doing their final push towards being improving themselves and being ready for this competition. This episode felt long in a very good way to me, where they managed to place so much content into a single episode and it just flowed perfectly.

SO happy to see everyone developing, for some reason the scene with Yamaguchi finally getting a serve past Nishinoya really made me happy.

This new OP is groovy as fuck

Also Lol at Hinata realizing he meets dangerous people in the bathroom.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto is a fan of transitive property.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, how I missed you Hypeuu!! Welcome back, my love.

Alone in this episode happened so much. I don't even where to start. Maybe I just talk about my two favourite characters:

Never. Stop. The. Tsukki. Development. Never. It's just so much fun watching him growing into a block beast. Looking forward to see his improved skills!

And Oikawa just showed why he is my second favourite. I just love his whole "I am friendly towards you but know that you aren't worth the dirt under my shoes." - attitude. And his face while talking with Mad Dog - chan. Brilliant.

Really looking forward to Karasuno's match with the party team.^^^^fuckingweirdhearing8manwithsuchahappyattitude

On a side note: I really like the opening and ending. The opening may be not as a hype as the SPYAIR one but I don't think it "kills" the hype like the second opening from S1. I think the ending is as good as the first one (but that might change in either direction after listening to it several times).

I literally just smiled for 24 minutes straight. Like, it's been at least 15 minutes since I finished watching the episode, and I can *still* feel fatigue in my facial muscles. Tsukki's smug grin. Yamaguchi's serve. Kageyama's shitty spying. Nishinoya and Tanaka freezing mid-air. Yachi. ^(Ushiwaka being oddly attractive for the .3 seconds of the episode he featured in.) Oikawa. Iwaizumi. **Oikawa and Iwaizumi**. *Hinata going to the bathroom*. **Aone bowing**. I *literally* can't even with this show there is too much for me to praise I don't know where to begin.

See y'all next week for more Hypekyuu!!.

[I really love writing about Haikyuu, so of course I had to do something for the start of this second cour.](http://minuteart.net/2016/01/07/faces-in-failure/)

This essay is focused on the last episode of Season 1, but I believe it's a great way to hype us up for the second half of this season! With (hopefully) matches against Aoba Johsai and Shiratorizawa approaching, I think it's the perfect time to remember the events of last tournament and the struggles of our favorite volleyball team.

Looking forward to the rest of this season :) 
>> ARTICLE
At the end Aoba Josai and Shiratorizawa saying about only one team could win I was expecting Hinata to give one of his death stares and announce that Karasuno would win.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was gonna jump 10 ft. in the air and *then* do what you said.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that the intense, silent gaze was far more powerful in this situation.
>> ARTICLE
 I'm in love with the new OP as always :3
New ED is very cool, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think this OP is going to be one of the best of 2016, man that was great.



>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I had some misgivings about the new cour at the beginning of the episodes, what with the new OP, the rushed subplot of Kageyama spying on Oikawa, and some shots that lingered a little awkwardly imo. Seeing the Bokuto, Kenma, and the rest in Kanto was nice, but I was finally convinced when I saw [Yamaguchi's face](http://i.imgur.com/nKTiR8k.jpg) after he hit a service ace against Nishinoya, of all people. I can't help but grin whenever something goes right for Yamaguchi; he's such a hard worker, he's humble, and he's a great friend to Tsukishima. From then on, the episode was beyond smooth sailing. What a great show.

Bonus: [King Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/TA2EqUP.jpg)

Saeko in the opening! Hope we get more of her in future episodes, she's awesome.

Glad to be watching my AOTY 2015, in 2016. It gets to be the highlight of my week for another 3 months, heck yea!

Next episodes are going to be awesome. I just finished watching this episode and I can't wait to see next. I'm glad that Tsukki has become important character and that we finally know something Yamaguchi's serves.

The hype is unreal with this one.

Also the new bathroom scene was hilarious.

That intro got me goose bumps the first 10 seconds.

And i missed Yachi so much.

I was cool with a new Opening, but I'm totally against the new Ending song, the old one was just too epic.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh yes, Oikawa in the new ED is finally back in his villain form.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, loved both the OP and the ED! We are finally starting the tournament so from now on. Also mad dog-chan makes his appearance! Pretty good episode overall.

This episode covered from page 15 of chapter 105 up to chapter 108 (skipped a few scenes of this chapter).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I could ever get enough of Bokuto. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong , but does the mad dog share the same voice actor as Aomine Daiki from KnB?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Mad dog is Shunsuke Takeuchi; he's a newbie whose first anime voice-acting role was in 2014.
>> ARTICLE
God the ending of this episode was epic, it was great to hear all those different school's chants.

Also I like the new OP and ED.
>> ARTICLE
Woo! The moment I've waiting for all season has come: The games! We got a taste of it last week and the game before that, but now the real thing has arrived. It has now time to see if half a season of training and development will finally pay off and if i can truly say it tops sesson 1. While there were a lot of great moments in the first half and I liked the development, the games are the true soul of these types of shows and I can't wait.

As a side note, the other teams Karasuno played in the training cap are in a diffrent presciptiure(that's probably the wrong word) or something right? They won't play them unless they take top spot in this torment?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah think those are all in the Tokyo Prefecture, which is why both Karasuno and Nekoma need to win their prefectures and go to nationals for the battle at the garbage dump to truly take place. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they said that since Tokyo is so large two teams from there go to nationals. Only can imagine it will be Nekoma and Bokuto's team.
>> ARTICLE
[Hinata sure has bad luck going to the bathroom!](https://i.imgur.com/iKq6Fe2.jpg)

This show makes me miss my HS Vball days so much.  Every episode continues to keep me excited for what comes next!
>> ARTICLE
I only played intramural in HS. But it made me decide I want to play again. My best friend has been playing pepper with me and in a few weeks I'm going to join this open play day, and hopefully his league in September. I need to lose weight so that when I dive for a ball I don't shatter my kneecaps. 
>> ARTICLE
I swear! Blonde-with-Glasses better actually change his attitude during this tournament!! Looks like he just might actually do it since his older brother still loves and plays VB.
>> ARTICLE
I can't remember the last time I've been this hyped about anything. See you all next week.
>> ARTICLE
I wanna read the manga what chapter is this ep at?

>> ARTICLE
i enjoy the raven theme it makes it badass'er
>> ARTICLE
This is the show I look forward to the most this season.
>> ARTICLE
yep, pretty much only watching this and OPM
>> ARTICLE
cavalry isnt that shit.. not your avg shounen/ecchi manga, mc isnt a dimwit id recommend it if you have free time
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, me too! Its actually the only animes currently airing that I'm watching.
>> ARTICLE
I've been reading lots of good things about OPM. So I'm going to wait for OPM to finish airing then I'll binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Better yet just read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
LOL, HE WANTS TO BINGE WATCH AND U RECOMMEND THE MANGA?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. 
>> ARTICLE
Just saying because the rate of release with the pages is amazingly slow
>> ARTICLE
More material than the anime. Might as well if he wants to binge watch. 
>> ARTICLE
You know it's a short chapter when reading the discussion thread takes longer than the actual chapter
>> ARTICLE
Its not really the kind of show you binge watch, it's really episodic. 
>> ARTICLE
The episodic episodes are going to end pretty soon
>> ARTICLE
Still not a very plot driven show, beating enemies and climbing up the ranks of the hero association is pretty much all it is, besides the latest chapters. 
>> ARTICLE
It goes more into arcs though rather than a story that is pretty much wrapped up in an episode

>> ARTICLE
the hair style of the Little Giant as well was the exact same but black
>> ARTICLE
One silly theory going around is that the little giant is the glasses teacher
>> ARTICLE
I could see that actually
>> ARTICLE
This would be hilarious
>> ARTICLE
Didn't someone have to explain the basics of volleyball to the glasses teacher early in the first season?
>> ARTICLE
Yea thats why its a silly theory
>> ARTICLE
Takeda is also too old to be the Little Giant. He's supposed to be around Saeko's age. 
>> ARTICLE
My theory is close to that one. I feel like the teacher is related to the Little Giant.
>> ARTICLE
Depending on how long the story has left, the Little Giant might not even been shown up and is an entirely new character.
>> ARTICLE
It seems we've found a character whose driving rivals Miyamori's from Shirobako.

The tall dude actually seemed like a nice guy. It should be a good match when they play each other.

He was featured in [this special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25303/Haikyuu!!:_Jump_Festa_2014_Special) and he was really likeable!

You just gave me an extra 24 minutes of haikyuu to enjoy! Thank you!

Finally!! I felt like I was waiting for so long for the Tokyo training arc, but it's finally here!!! I'm way too happy. Far out.

Not only do we get to hang out with some incredibly amusing new characters, but we get to watch the boys grow and develop. I'm so stupidly excited for the next several episodes!! 

Just the preview for next week has me feeling all giddy with anticipation. Bring it on.

This arc is my favourite in the whole manga, next week is going to be great

i'm *so* excited for this whole arc to be animated, it's going to be so awesome! give me all the angst and all the character growth!!

It's still a mystery for me how Haikyuu!! can have such a likeable cast.
I can't even dislike one character. Goddamn.

NO ONE SLEEPS IN TOKYO!
>> ARTICLE
whew! you can really start to feel a bit anxious for Karasuno. They're barely holding their own against the powerful teams there, and pretty much only because of their freak quick. And the more they use it, the quicker the opposing teams are going to figure out how to defend against it.

Really gives the feeling of four walls (or incidentally, the other 4 teams) just closing in on them.
>> ARTICLE
Jump out of the way of the 4 walls :\^)
>> ARTICLE
HYPE!

Goddamnit, why the heck are those episodes so short?!

I miss the 1st season binge-watch that I did with my orignal watch. But Yeah, this was a great Episode again. Can't wait for more episodes. 

On a sidenote: not enough Yachi this episode.
>> ARTICLE
And now starts, one week of suffering without Haikyuu!!, this is the first time I feel like I can't stand the wait for another episode. [Crying intensifies]
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought they might try to [transform](http://imgur.com/1wwKV3O) into some kind of educational magical boy during this sequence. Way too [funny](http://i.imgur.com/aamxFvQ.gif).

Does anyone else really like how the guys look in their [school uniforms](http://imgur.com/ACTSgql)? They're in sleeveless shirts all the time, the change is kind of nice.

Such [great](http://i.imgur.com/0UabANd.jpg) faces during the [drive](http://i.imgur.com/BFfAigN.jpg).

This is the first time we've seen the [little giant's face](http://i.imgur.com/KeW7nyt.jpg), right? I love that he has the same serious face that Hinata sometimes gets.

The slice of life moments this season have been so good, from reaction faces to [bedhead](http://i.imgur.com/jwtdqXA.gif).

OTOH, the serious game scenes have [great animation](http://imgur.com/m0dN7Ev), too. God, that's intimidating.

I really really like how they showed the crazy height disparity with sharp [camera angles](http://i.imgur.com/unFCoys.jpg).

[Again](http://i.imgur.com/MFpBbRC.jpg), the [faces](http://i.imgur.com/7CLyYBA.jpg) are top tier.

Didn't we already have this [conflict](http://i.imgur.com/bxgxp76.jpg)? Hinata, don't you go trying to steal Asahi's thunder again. You have an incredibly important role to play. Speaking of which, [manga spoilers](/s "There was a scene where Hinata does such a good job as decoy that even Kageyama gets confused as to which teammate he wanted to pass the ball to. Was that in season 1, or is it manga-only so far? I read the manga too long ago to remember.")

I have a feeling that, "Aces score the most points!" is gonna fuck with Hinatas head a bit and he's gonna try to get way too greedy. 
>> ARTICLE
normally I'd think that, but the upper years always put them in their place when they get remotely cocky
>> ARTICLE
Yea I think it will affect him in just the next game. He's gonna try to do too much I think though.
>> ARTICLE
forgot what happens, I'm gonna re read the training arc, it was really amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Next week's episode title is "Greed"
>> ARTICLE
Well shit
>> ARTICLE
I love how they have people talk in the background while the main conversation is happening, makes the anime feel alive
>> ARTICLE
Woohoo! Finally we got to see all the teams that will be training with Karasuno. This episode covered chapters 78 and 79 of the manga for those interested, keeping the ~2 chapters per episode.

And although he didn't have too much screen time, we finally got to see [him <3](https://36.media.tumblr.com/a2b1170561039f8823a3c08e7241cbc2/tumblr_nvuzijis7k1tre7ggo1_400.png). [The Hype is real boys!](https://i.gyazo.com/73b2a198a1af576e18525c3a564f9dbc.png)

If there was a spin-off manga just for Fukurodani and the antics of Bokuto, I'd buy it in a heartbeat
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this is said enough: The soundtrack to this show is fucking PHENOMENAL. 

In most cases soundtracks are very unnoticeable and it doesn't necessarily effect my enjoyment of a show (when talking about shows people don't usually say "this shows soundtrack sucks" they either say that it's good or nothing about it at all). IMO in the cases where a powerful soundtrack is used, it REALLY enhances the experience.

Saeko is starting to grow on me. Granted she hasn't been on screen much but I'm liking that tomboyish attitude she has.

the creepy cat eyes..little giant has them too

Yep, boner.
>> ARTICLE
I recently picked up a bunch of sports anime that I really enjoy.

So far I've watched the 3 seasons of Kuroko no Basket, Season 1 and up to current episode in Season 2 of Diamond no Ace (<- still running), Majors S1-S6 and Haikyuu, now just started with Hajime no Ippo. If you haven't seen all of these then you'd probably enjoy them if you like Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Kuroko no Basket 2 days ago, it's pretty awesome and it reminds me of Haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
4 sure, i'm loving it as well.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Major, out of those (watched Diamond no Ace and One Outs, from baseball related series). How do you compare it to the first one? I really liked the characters in DnA, so does it have similar character development?
>> ARTICLE
Major is one of my favorite anime of all time.  And as Akilee said, since it has 6 seasons, it has plenty of character development.  And not just for the MC, Goro, either.  Many side characters get a good amount of character development.  And since Major takes place from the life of a 5 year old boy until he becomes a man, you have a huge supporting cast as well.  Yet despite this, each character feels like their own person, and many of these characters get a good amount of screen time/character development as well.  In fact, I prefer some of the supporting characters to Goro, and he gets a great amount of development.  Also, I really love Goro too.  So that should give at least a small idea of how good the development in Major is.  

I could go on and on about how great Major, and it's cast, are, but I'd rather not ramble on for too long.  Also, the best way to see how good it is will be watching it for yourself.  You may not end up funding it in your favorites list unlike me, (although of course there's still a chance you will) however I can say for certain that Major is worth a try.  And despite its length, Major is actually incredibly easy to marathon.  More so than many other anime that I've watched.  So give it a try!  If nothing else, it's worth that much.

P.S. I recommend trying to watch a little over 10 episodes before deciding for sure if you want to keep going or not since it's kinda hard to get a feel for it until then.  However, I will say that season 5 is probably the best in Major, along with most of 6, however all of the seasons are incredible.  I honestly couldn't rank them if I tried, as all gave really great moments.  So yeah.  You should check it out!  :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot for the input. I'll try to make some time so I can check it out, myself :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha you're welcome.  Thanks for actually reading my kinda long, two week late comment.  :)

I hope that you're able to find the time for it, and that you'll be able to really enjoy it too.
>> ARTICLE
Major is 6 seasons long so there's plenty of character development. It starts a little slow but it gets better for sure, at first the MC is 5 years old and at that point its about his father, then there's a couple of time skips in this anime where it will be about the MCs baseball.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is god tier, just saying.
>> ARTICLE
yowamushi pedal is good, too! (the pacing sucks but it's an enjoyable watch actually.) reminds me of haikyuu with its tone and feel.
>> ARTICLE
Wow nothing from the king of the sports genre Mitsuru Adachi. Please watch Cross Game and Touch.
>> ARTICLE
In addition to what others have mentioned: eyeshield 21, yowamushi pedal, and free.
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield is a better read though. They [massacred](http://img.animecross.tk/poster/eyeshield-21-episode-22-23-24.jpg) Murata's [amazing](http://sekijitsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Faded-Colour.png) [art](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/xparrot/1307689/5259/5259_original.gif). An amazing series, regardless
>> ARTICLE
> now just started with Hajime no Ippo

:D One of my favorite Anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
On episode 8 atm, already loving it!
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo arguably best sport.anime, i mean, it even is in top like 7th spot in myanimelist rating. Ippo is indeed amazing, and I hope you have a nice ride :)
>> ARTICLE
Check out Ping Pong and One Outs as well. So many good sports shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I've checked out Ping Pong but I didn't like it, probably because it's a seinen, and the animation is really not my cup of tea. I dropped it after 7 episodes, I just couldn't enjoy it as I've enjoyed other sports anime.

Will have to check out One Outs.
>> ARTICLE
One outs is less about sport and more psychological but a really good watch nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 10 and 11 of Ping Pong are my favorite 2 episodes of anime ever. You should be starting the competition soon so it should be all matches from episode 7 onwards if that means anything to you. I recommend finishing it up. 
>> ARTICLE
one outs is also a seinin, but it's different from PP
>> ARTICLE
why is no one suggesting Slam fucking Dunk. It's basically what popularized this whole sports anime genre. It's still considered Japan's favorite manga since like the 90s. The 90s animation might be a little weird, but if you dont like that, theres always the manga
>> ARTICLE
You should check out Ookiku Furikabutte.

Great comedy-style baseball show.
>> ARTICLE
Can't forget Cross game bro
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen that, atleast not yet.

edit: So far I've only watched shounen sports anime so I'm a little worried about Cross Game that they might not have this added almost magical effect to things like pitches which makes it really enjoyable, things like adding auras to intimidating or fired up opponents really brings excitement. I hope it's the same with Cross Game!
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game doesn't have "auras" or "special powers" but it definitely gets you hype. It still has that feeling of the main character being a boss.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, then don't watch Cross game. More about the people playing the sport than the special effects and hyping each other up before the game.
>> ARTICLE
Should add baby steps to that too. Not the best in terms of animation(ignore the bg always haha) but it's really good. No super power bs or anything either. 
>> ARTICLE
The BG almost makes the anime unwatchable for me, when I first noticed how the people look I could never forget and it just distracts me. I would much rather their be no fans with "magic cheering" than the manikin audience we got.


To be clear, I love Baby Steps. It's an amazing story with great characters and progression.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man, studio perriot really dropped the ball with baby steps. They can make some excellent animation, though they known to cut corners, however baby steps was really bad in alot of aspects. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested to see what kind of steps Hinata takes to compensate for the faults in their quick attacks. One thing I thought of is Hinata isn't strategic enough when at the net. He never does that little push upwards I see Tsukishima use for example.
>> ARTICLE
As in a tip instead of a spike? (Not quite sure what you're trying to describe)
>> ARTICLE
Most likely yes. I'm not sure what a tip is, but the one where the person "spiking" pushing the ball lightly over the net with the tips of their fingers, in such a way that it goes over the blockers reach.
>> ARTICLE
I think the word you're looking for is "feint". 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that would work:)
>> ARTICLE
Finally the dude from [Haikyuu!! Jump Fiesta 2014](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25303/Haikyuu!!:_Jump_Festa_2014_Special) makes an appearance!
>> ARTICLE
Man I can't believe how quickly this episode went by! As always I still look forward to the next episode and having read ahead in the manga I'm positively giddy for the character development that happens during the training camp! :D
>> ARTICLE
That OST when Hinata and Kageyama were warming up was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
This has now overtaken Owarimonogatari as my AOTS ^^so ^^far

I'm thankful that Lev was introduced in the 2014 Jump Festa special and he wasn't jut thrown in. Looks like he and Hinata could be great rivals!

These episodes go by to fast but I'm absolutely loving them!

I almost died at the "hey hey hey" from Bokuto. And his legging-kneepads. And just everything in general about him being animated and given a voice. I love the volleyowls and can't wait to see more of them.

Also. WOW Lev is tall. So lanky. 

Much hype for next week's episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Every time I think that they've run out of motivational moments in this show, they keep coming back with more. I LOVE IT.

Chapter 1.

Definitely a "transition" episode, but I enjoyed the heck out of it and next week looks awesome.
>> ARTICLE
So many great scenes as usual! Can't wait to see hinata vs lev next week
>> ARTICLE
Just realised that the scene in the OP where Hinata and Kageyama puts down their water bottles, Kageyama's water bottle has "EGO" written on it.

After every episode finishes I wish there was more T_T

GODDAMIT, WHY ARE EVERY OPPONENT TEAM SO LIKEABLE? I feel bad seeing them lose every time. Even Takeru is an Upstanding Guy. Haikyuu does this so well
>> ARTICLE
In the manga I actually found Shiratoriza (spelling?) not very likable.
>> ARTICLE
Shiratorizawa. They are probably set to be the opposite of Karasuno, since even the name reflects that. Shira (shiro) means white, and tori means bird, shiratori is a swan. And anyway, they are set up to be the big bad guys, so we can't build nice characters to be the big bad guys before they are defeated or in the process of being defeated.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that makes sense. Like I don't hate them, I just don't like them.
>> ARTICLE
It is one of the things I really like about it. These are kids playing high school sports. Very few of them are going to be unholy monsters dedicated to sadism and war crimes. They are students trying to be the (very) best (like no one ever was). The Ravens are our protagonists, but every character from every team is "the good guy." Well, for the most part.

Hajime No Ippo also did this well a lot of the time. Most of Ippo's opponents were more likable than Ippo's gym buddies.

Exactly! There are no villains that are evil dicks with no souls, they are all cool dudes and you want to see them all succeed even though you're rooting for Karasuno

Tanaka, Asahi, Ennoshita (black-haired 2nd year), and Kinoshita (brown-haired 2nd year, don't think he's had any speaking chances yet) are the remaining Wing Spikers IIRC.

You are amazing. Clearly I need to train harder in Haikyuu.

It's all in the manga matey, which I 100% recommend to anyone who loves Haikyuu. Shit has me gasping for air at times

Once this season ends I might end up doing that.

Stop killing my dream. Yamaguchi can do whatever the fuck he wants, yo.

>> ARTICLE
Not when it's not his position. :) I'm not saying he won't get a chance at some point. I'm just saying he has to swap out with Tsukki or Hinata to serve. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching and get more hyped for future episode... Yamaguchi will get his shot! That's what Haikyuu is all about! Also glad someone else is a Yamaguchi lover.
>> ARTICLE
How could someone not love Yamaguchi?
>> ARTICLE
I will never stop wishing for the Yamaguchi game winning serve. 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCKING SHIT DAICHI. I was not expecting that. Oh god. And the total silence when it happened.

On another note, can we all appreciate the [attention to detail given to something as minor as variating skin tone](http://i.imgur.com/g2tSh0h.jpg)?

[We all did, Coach-san. We all did.](http://i.imgur.com/ea22YkE.png)

Man, seeing the manager leave with the co-manager crying on the tribune.... one day Kiyoko will leave too, and then it's gonna be Yachi shedding that tear.

Also, it's very small, but it took way too long to see Asahi again. They hyped him up as the unstoppable spiker in the beginning, but he didn't really get any screentime, or moments that made him feel important to the team.
>> ARTICLE
Remember they still havent versed the big giants of their area. Those games will be really long (i mean i expect them to  atleast verse Aoba this tournament) and then we will see every character get its moment
>> ARTICLE
Even against the big giants, I feel like Asahi and Tanaka are "useless" once they face a giant wall or a strong receiver. 

Daichi is... a pretty well-balanced, but also average player. His qualities come from being a good captain, not a good player. 

Tsukishima is good, no question. Nishinoya is 50-50, sometimes the savior of the game, sometimes just a bystander.

And Kageyama and Hinata are just solo-carrying Karasuno most of the time, really.

...that's 50% of Karasuno that I would consider "really good" players (atleast by the standards at which they are playing at), excluding those that warm the bench like Yamaguchi.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone actually stopped Tanaka yet? From what I gather, he's a hothead who really relies on momentum. If he gets fired up and into it, he's practically unblockable, but otherwise he's just an average player.

Asahi is primarily used as the strong hitter from the back. He doesn't get as many up front spikes, so the power is a little lost, but he's the only one with the power to do a good back attack. On top of that, they need to use Hinata a lot so the other team focuses in on him. That's when the rest of the spikers get to shine. They literally call Hinata "the best decoy".

And Daichi is extremely balanced, but definitely one of the best receivers in the group. They've shown that where everyone else on the team can't receive certain hits or serves, Nishinoya and Daichi are the only ones who can. On top of that, Daichi gets in some spikes and is a solid blocker. He's the backbone of the team.
>> ARTICLE
Noya has been repeatedly mentioned as one of the best liberos at that age (and the best in middle school). And the whole point of Daichi is that he's the most fundamentally sound out of all of them. He's up there in skill.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but the show made it a point this season to portray the older years getting better. Those will come to show in the big matches. Asahi's serve, Nishinoya's setting, Tanaka's....something. Daichi is a well balanced average player, but its his leadership that matters the most. He is always there with the defense at the most important time. One of the weaknesses of the team last season was outside of Hinata and Kageyama, everyone was average at best. Thats why the whole training camp saga mattered so much as they were all trying to get better
>> ARTICLE
I think Tanaka is working on his cut short after seeing bokuto do it. Just like how bokuto worked on his straight to become a top 5 ace I can see that happening for Tanaka
>> ARTICLE
I remember KnB stretching the last 5 minutes of game into an entire episode.

This was my favorite episode so far in since the new season began. The action was extremely intense, and when Daichi was injured at the very end I was completely taken by surprise. So so so excited for next week!

H o l y shit. This anime gets me every time.
>> ARTICLE
oh..... [FUCK FUCK FUCK DON'T DIE!!!](http://imgur.com/YxZWwCT)

God I should have seen this Dadchi injury coming, they were giving him way more attention than usual. 

Also does anyone else see a bit of Yachi in the yellow teams manager? I definitely did. 
>> ARTICLE
Of all the teams to call Karasuno [outrageous](http://i.imgur.com/WAl0WJo.jpg), it's the one with this [fabulous spiker](https://gfycat.com/DeadDemandingAtlasmoth)???

Also, how great was [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/J6iXSjz.jpg) with Ennoshita? I like to imagine that, as a second year, he's had to deal with Tanaka's and Nishinoya's antics for years now. His [attention](http://i.imgur.com/G7PIfjF.jpg) to detail even when on the bench is also really impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita has the demeanor of a future captain. He is way more level headed than Noya, Tanaka and the regular first years.

Somebody has to be team mom. That's Ennoshita. He's been doing it in the background for the whole series.

Daichi-senpai is perfectly fine. He's just sleeping. He'll get back up right? RIGHT?!

Daichi!!! Noooooooooo!!!

Besides that, Haikyuu continues to do an amazing job at building up the opposing teams. I really like that.

This episode went from 100 to FUCK in 2 seconds flat

Damn it, they ended it there? And the silence makes it even more dramatic! If I hadn't read the manga, pretty sure my heart would stop. Well, it did stop when I read this part in the manga. 

Aone was extremely adorable, as always. He really seems pretty fond of Hinata. I love how he's just pointed his hand, and Fukutachi just translate what he means by it. 

Also finally development for THAT CHARACTER next week. I can't wait. Also am I the only who who consistently checking on time while watching Haikyuu!! Because every episode feels like only 5 minutes, sigh.

Oh shit

ouch i really felt that one
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking this season a lot, even more so than the first I think. They've alleviated the "freak quick" problem I had with the first season where Hinata would just spike with his eyes closed which I always thought was perhaps a little too unrealistic and they've really built on some characters that didn't have much development in the first season (Tsukki and Kiyoko). Animation has remained at the top level as expected and the new tracks in the OST have been great.

Hype keeps on delivering with every episode and game. I wish I could see other viewer's faces when the shot switches to Daichi's downed body. Everyone probably had a looks of utter horror lol.

This was a great episode, but I was kind of expecting more end feels from the first team, they built them up and it seemed a lot quicker to end than most of them so far.

Tbh, I was hoping the Johzenji game would at least go to a deuce because they're so fun to watch! But somehow Wakuman is even more fun to watch too! They're definitely making these games ramp up in their suspense again.
>> ARTICLE
Aw Daichi. I know he's probably dazed/knocked out, but man the silence and tension made me super worried for a second. T___T;;

Also the more I hear of tacica in both this ED and season 1's 2nd ED, the more I can't stop associating them with The Living Dead/Jupiter era Bump of Chicken (early 2000s). That's a good thing in my book though.
>> ARTICLE
It's more than that. The morale base/source for the entire team stems from Daichi, especially for all the less... smrt... players.

The foreshadowing about how this'd be a battle of captains, is going to be really about how Karusuno will learn to succeed even without their captain actively being there.

It will most likely boil down to a "Daichi won't be here next year, will we just fail, or show him that we can succeed, and appreciate his captain-ship.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean to imply that the collision wasn't severe enough to take him out of the match at the very least, but rather was more noting just how tense the direction at that moment filled me with enough tension/dread that despite knowing that he'd eventually end up okay, that something far worse had happened.

Still, I agree with you on how the team is at a crossroads in how it can move forward without him really pulling them together.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, if the 100% only reason why the team works together/succeeds is down on the ground. i.e. the 100% reliable/relied upon member of the team (even for the third years), is lying there motionless... That tension was appropriate imo.

Never said it wasn't appropriate

My heart has yet to start beating again. How long do you think I can hold out until the next episode?

That cliffhanger though, RIP DAICHI.
>> ARTICLE
I will never understand why they say "Nice Serve" before people even do the serve.

If someone says "Nice Serve" before the serve and you fail, that'd be pretty weird.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always a little bit sad when they decide to have a player get injured in sports anime. Sure it's a good way to build tension but i believe it's a bit of an easy way out.
>> ARTICLE
Wonder if that what Cavaliers fans felt when Irving got injured in Game 1 of the finals.
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't, given how often injuries actually happen. Daichi is also the player who seems to be rotated out of the squad the least (alongside Asahi), so he's at additional risk. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more of a personal preference. I know that injuries happen often but it's usually the timing of the injuries that i do not like. It's always in a more important match to build that extra tension. 
>> ARTICLE
Technically all of these matches are important. If they lose, their dream of nationals goes out the door.

I mean, do you want an injury here, or against the two perennial title contenders? I'd take it here any day of the week.

YAMAGUCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GOD. Is it next Saturday yet? *Is it Saturday??*

So I've absolutely blitzed this show in the past few days - it's incredible. Very impressed. 

YAMAGUCHI, NICE SERVE!

OMG! Oikawa and Mad Dog were so intense. I hope that Daiichi and Nishinoya manages to received those bone breaking serves.

And to think that there is a more powerful spiker than Mad Dog-chan.

Haikyuu has consistenly been the anime I look forward to most each week, hopefully there will be a third season after the manga has had time to progress a bit further.

I feel like the studio keeps doing a better and better job of animating the manga. I can't wait to see what else they do with the rest of the episodes
>> ARTICLE
That Yamaguchi hype at the end. Can't wait for next week!

This match is better than any match from Kuroko no Basket. It's just awesome. Yamaguchi is my favorite side character and I'm happy that he will play in the next episode. Mad Dog is great character, Seijoh needed someone like that. 
>> ARTICLE
And this is simply the semis for the Prefecture qualifier. What will happen in the finals if they reach it?

Man Mad Dog-chan is pretty awesome.  Crazy good episode as usual though.

i just loved it when sugamama came in and changed it up! even if it was just for a short while. it was a nice change.

It's really nice when (side/other) characters get the spotlight. 
>> ARTICLE
These past couple episodes have left me so drained after they're over, I'm so anxious whether or not Karasuno is actually going to win!
>> ARTICLE
I think Tadashi Yamaguchi is one of the most famous character in Haikyuu. He is not blesssed with so much speed, athleticism, vertical leap and strength, but that doesn't stop him to play the sport that he loves, that's why almost everyone can relate to him more than the other (gifted) characters. (Spoiler: That last scene was one of the best I've ever seen in this anime)
>> ARTICLE
That last scene was really *really* good, yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who wants Karasuno to win but thinks that Mad Dog is really awesome? :D

>> ARTICLE
Mad Dog is crazy dude, just shoving away the spiker and steals it for himself... Truly mad
>> ARTICLE
He's so damn powerful which makes him pretty awesome :D
>> ARTICLE
Only reason people say he can be awesome it's because he's on Haikyuu and a fictional character. I play sports and having a guy like him in a team is frustrating to no end!
>> ARTICLE
I know, but I have a guy on my team which is pretty nice but he spikes just as powerful. Though his hair is not that cool :D

>> ARTICLE
It would be funny if Karasuno lost. I would rate this anime 10/10 instantly for being unpredictable.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I dislike about most animes that you already know what's going to happen
>> ARTICLE
Can someone get me a GIF of that last moment when Ukai's talking to Yamaguchi
>> ARTICLE
What was the violin song used near the end? It occurs around 21:12 - 22:10. I've been looking everywhere for that song but I can't find it in the OST list... Help :(
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a contrabass, not a violin. Or something, whatever. I'm interested in this as well. This OST keeps bugging me because it sounds so familiar, similar to a Three Days Grace or some other band's song, but I can't figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds more like a cello to me. Unfortunately, I haven't listened to the OST yet. I don't really even know if it has been released. Has been used brilliantly in this show though. Makes it *super* intense and adds a lot to some of the best moments.

Late, but since the OST just came out we now have an answer! :D

It's '[/Confrontation With The King](https://youtu.be/GpOz4a9v3mQ?t=264)'. 4:24 if the video doesn't automatically start at that time.

I'm not sure if this has been addressed before but can someone tell me why Iwaizumi is not Seijoh's captain? He clearly is more respected by all including Oikawa, the captain himself and the loose cannon, Mad-dog-chan.
>> ARTICLE
At the end of the day, Oikawa is the one that brings the most out of the team and got them to this point.
>> ARTICLE
Iwaizumi keeps the team together, but Oikawa leads it. Both of them are pretty important to having it work well, but serve in different roles.
>> ARTICLE
The double setter play was awesome, was a shame we didn't see more of it.

Yamaguchi HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoiler](/s "The match against Shiratorizawa will feature at least one more double setter play, feat. Sugamama.")
>> ARTICLE
There is not enough capitalization in the universe to capture the intensity if hype I feel waiting for next week.

I knew as soon as coach started saying "Oh shut up already, I know." what was coming. It didn't even need to cut to Yamaguchi.

This show just keeps getting better and better. The two-setters/five-spikers blew my mind. The music was phenomenal as always. I felt like there were greater amounts of the really fluid motion shots that I love. My only possible critique is that some of Mad Dog-chan's spikes are beginning to fray into DBZ-sports territory. 

Is it next Saturday yet?
>> ARTICLE
So I'm thinking about starting this show. I don't really know anything about it so I just want to ask about why it's so highly regarded? Is it like Kuroko? 
>> ARTICLE
It's like Kuroko if Kuroko had good writing and interesting characters
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kuroko was pretty good. If it doesn't even match Haikyuu then I'll probably enjoy it a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
They're acutally both made by production IG. So animation and music wise, you know they're both going to be strong. But where Haikyuu excels really is maintaining hype (its moniker is 'hypeku') but with greater focus on the characters and more comedic moments. Nothing is revolutionary in terms of sports anime persay, but it does everything so well you don't even have to give a shit about volleyball to enjoy the show. In fact, they do characters so well, chances are you'll have have more than a few favorite characters that aren't even on the main sports team

Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I encourage you to try it out (from the first season of course) and form your own opinion, but here's my two cents (i.e rant).

Haikyuu is by far my favourite sports anime of all time. If I were rating shows out of enjoyment, it would be my #1 favourite on MAL. Haikyuu takes everything exaggerated in Kuroko and does it to a lesser degree, making the plays a lot more believable, while maintaining a similar atmosphere. You won't find moves that have names attached to them in this show. 

Haikyuu has MUCH more fleshed out characters, making you sympathize much more with each team they play against, and the relationships between each character are just amazingly well done. You'll see stuff like one of the main characters fooling around with the enemy spiker because they share the interest towards their beautiful manager. People blocking the back of their heads when a lousy server is behind them. Enemy teams getting pumped up for their final match after 3 years of training, and losing. Opposing teams laughing and practicing together outside of matches. 

Of course the main characters have much much greater depth than the other teams, and I really want to say how so but it'll be spoilers... Anyway, the main characters are all brilliant. Sorry but that's all I can leave it at.

And btw, I don't think there's been a single episode of filler yet.

The greatest trait about it though is it's absolutely hilarious when it wants to be, and absolutely serious and tense when it wants to be, and does both perfectly.

Yeah you're pretty much [correct](https://my.mixtape.moe/ewfvqi.webm)

For real though, I enjoy Kuroko and I think it's a very entertaining show... but it's also kind of insane at times. Which, on the whole, actually works in its favor - it's not like it ever presents itself as anything realistic.

Manga readers, if there is a next match after this, will they have the time to animate it.

no not enough time. let's just say that no matter how this match ends, people are going to have a hard time NOT reading the manga after this season ends. Because given the source material, it'll likely be another 1-1.5 years before season 3.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yea its really sad, I'm up to date on the english translations and I'll say there's only about another 8-10 eps worth of content after this season.

Yeah that's the weird part about it, if they make another season. The Finals for this tournament would be overshadowed by the Nationals arc. The finals for this tournament should have been the ending of this season somehow (not possible if they skip shit). The seijoh vs. Karasuno game is hype af doe and deserves to be the season ender but I feel like The finals is just as hype or even more hype.

You might want to spoiler tag. But I do agree, since they're sticking to a 25 episode season the arc doesn't really fit properly.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, there's at least half a season worth of material.
>> ARTICLE
Including stuff that's untranslated? Either way, with the pacing of the manga there's still at least a year until there's enough for another 25 ep season.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with a year. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey hey hey! It's better to wait than seeing the whole show ruined by fillers, isn't it? 
>> ARTICLE
Ya I suppose...but first one punch man and now this!?! I hate waiting damn it 
>> ARTICLE
nope. there's not even enough for a third season yet actually. 
>> ARTICLE
Let me put it this way. The Seijoh match last season took like, 6 episodes. This one should be similar, but it looks like they could wrap it up in 5, and let episode 25 be a season 3 setup.

The match after this will take 10+ episodes at their current pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I have a good feeling it might be a movie. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what I've been thinking. There are a lot of chapters in that match, but I think you run the risk of burning out your audience if every week is a midgame cliffhanger. Making it a movie, and condensing it a bit would help a lot, then we could start season 3 without there feeling like too much of a wait.
>> ARTICLE
Anime only viewers are gonna have to read the next match because that was such a doozy. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup.
>> ARTICLE
Probably a 3 part movie. [Manga spoilers](/s "The finals took 5 grueling sets before it was concluded. If the final scene of this season ends with Karasuno stepping on the court for the finals match then it will be a movie. And season 3 will start with their preparation for the Nationals after 2 years or so.")

Thanks so much for this, I needed to relive that manga hype
>> ARTICLE
3,5,6,10 are the ones where the anime is better

it's just that manga has much more impact
>> ARTICLE
To me the ~~enemy~~ anime is better in all, the manga doesn't have the same depth in style as the anime.

Edit: made a mistake.
>> ARTICLE
but manga has impact when it needs it

i think the thing about the manga is when they draw close ups without a background, it doens't work

and the good thing about the anime is that you can put much more stuff in in one shot

I honestly feel the same impact with the anime.. and even more

Damn episodes 20&21 just got me so hyped I had to read the manga. I try to stop myself from reading further, but the hype is just too big.

Yeah man I have that feeling for a lot of anime. Usually ruins the Anime for me but there are some gems that even doe I know whats going to happen its still hype af. (Shokugeki no Soma and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso)

I had to get a coat, because that final scene with Yamaguchi literally sent chills down my spine. So excited for next week! 
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling Yamaguchi is going to have an insane serve coming up next episode
>> ARTICLE
this episode was so fkin hype i havent felt like this since saitama vs boros fight
>> ARTICLE
Reading that fight was the ultimate hype. The the manga artist in charge of that, has to be by far the best artists of action shots I have ever seen. And that is coming from an artist. 
>> ARTICLE
which one u mean
>> ARTICLE
not sure if sarcasm but the remake. Not even sure if you can classify original as manga, maybe mangapasta. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they might be been asking whether or not you were talking about Haikyuu's or OPM's manga artist.
>> ARTICLE
eyeshield 21 is a sports manga and it was previously done by Murata the one who draws the redone version of opm, its really fucking good too
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa reminded me of Johan Liebert a lot this Episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa reminded me of Hisoka from HunterxHunter ever since he debuted. It's not just his voice, but also his expressions.
>> ARTICLE
I got started on this show back in Season 1 thinking I was just going to get an exciting volleyball anime and now here I am practically crying every episode and praying every player on Karasuno can achieve their dreams. If Yamaguchi doesn't wind up proud of himself after next episode I don't know if my heart can go on.
>> ARTICLE
i have a new favourite character for this season the mad dog is so badass
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure everyone will be loving this match so far. I think one thing the anime did better from my recollection of the manga so far is the integration of mad dog boy into team Aoba Josai. At least from my memory of the manga, the mad dog kid kinda came out of nowhere and felt more like a ringer for Aoba Josai than a real member of the team. 

Like, he's not that likable as a character, at least for me, and he was randomly spawned into the story as if he always was a part of the Aoba Josai team, and seemed like a cheap attempt at bringing in a new hurdle for the Aoba Josai team to face Karasuno against. These reasons were why I didn't like mad dog boy when I read about him in the manga.

However, in the anime from what I just saw, they integrated him really well into the team. Like I said, this could just be from poor memory because its been awhile since I read this part of the manga, but I don't remember from the manga making a huge point that the anime does about how Aoba Josai/Oikawa are a team that bring out the best in their players. This properly explains why they're able to use Mad dog kid. He's so unpredictable, that unless you have a team that can cater to his playstyle, he would more likely be a hindrance than anything positive, but Aoba Josai is capable of handling that struggle, and the anime, this episode does a good job to get that point across. So I think it works here really well. The hype shots of his spikes also bring out a huge impact of his presence in the match.

Besides that numerous other opportunities of hype, along with serve mistakes, along with super cannonball serves, along with people excited for Yamaguchi. He rarely shows serious expressions like that, but you gotta figure now... it... is... ON.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the point of adding kyotani is so he can feel out of place, though
>> ARTICLE
Rather than having Kyotani feel out of place, we can say that the point of adding Kyotani is to throw off Karasuno because Karasuno are so in-sync with Aobajohsai that Seijou is having trouble getting ahead.
>> ARTICLE
The music in this episode was top notch, it really helped build the tension. Overall another great episode in the series!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome match, the pinnacle of 2 seasons!!
>> ARTICLE
I'm really happy to see Oikawa's "tactician" side in anime.
>> ARTICLE
This has to be one of the best episodes of Haikyuu!! till now. I could actually feel the tension during the match and the power of Kyotani (Mad Dog) with each spike. And damn, that ending! Yamaguchi is finally ready to show off his serve! Can't wait until next episode.

Edit: I forgot to mention how amazing the soundtrack was.
>> ARTICLE
> This has to be one of the best episodes of Haikyuu!! till now

me every episode
>> ARTICLE
Unleash Yamaguchi 
>> ARTICLE
Music was so on point this episode. Anybody else catch the track that went on during Oikawa's second serve after the perfect toss ace? The one he hits the net on.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that Mad Dog's serve! It has the intensity of Oikawa's ultimate serve. Also super glad that we can see Suga played in this match. It fits what the coach was thinking in the previous match of Karasuno and Seijoh, that they can use two setters in one match. Not to mention Suga is pretty calculative player. Something that lacks on Karasuno if we compare it with an overwhelming calculative Oikawa. 


But god dammit, I'm so hyped for Yamaguchi in the next episode! Karasuno stil has a deadly weapon. I love how they keep using metaphor that Mad Dog is the double edge sword as Seijoh's weapon. But Karasuno also has weapon that has been polished for a while. Definitely different kind and probably opposite side of double edge sword, but hopefully as deadly. 


Now how am I supposed to wait until next week? 
>> ARTICLE
Funny you should talk about Yamaguchi that way! In a bunch of the promotional materials for the manga, he's depicted holding a giant spear. http://imgur.com/99qJroJ

So you're totally spot on with your description, Hahha.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, even though I read the manga, I totally forgot about this cover. If I'm not mistaken, Tsukki's promotional material holds shield, right? Which also totally amazing considering his skill in blocking


>> ARTICLE
Yeah absolutely! So it sort of all ties in to that thing with Yamaguchi taking really keen interest in the idea of 'Serve and Block' during the Tokyo away games arc. Yamaguchi the spear with his serves. Tsukki the shield with his blocks. It's really well thought out.

There's also some official sketches showing Tsukki holding the spear and asking Yamaguchi if he can borrow it because it looks cooler. Yamaguchi of course agrees because it's Tsukki, lol.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. I remember the scene when Yamaguchi watched match of two Tokyo high schools and they use incredible serves and blocks. Oh wow, to think these parallels makes me appreciate the writing even more. I also remember that in anime, when Ukai brought neighborhood team, Shimada san actually gave the ball to Yamaguchi on his first scene there. What a neat parallel. 

Really? There are official sketches on tsukki and yama talking about spear and blocking? That's so cute! I wonder whether you can link them to me?

Yamaguchi wants in! Seijou is the wall that he needs to break down, I'm excited to see all that hard work pay off.

Don't know if they did this on purpose, but I remember the 21st episode of the 1st season actually opened with Karasuno switching out Kageyama for Suga under less happy circumstances while playing Seijoh.

And that last rising shot on Yamaguchi was pure, concentrated hype. WHY isn't it next week yet?

I know this gets said a lot, but the reason why I love Haikyuu so damn much is the amount of focus we have on other characters and other teams. Like, 4 out of my 5 top characters aren't even *in* Karasuno.

Just put it in there to be sure. Didn't want to rustle anyone's jimmies.

so all these weeks when you manga readers have been saying [SPOILER](/s "Yamaguchi is gonna get his chance to shine") you've been talking about next episode? 

I can't wait. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually think I might cry during next episode, lets wait and see
>> ARTICLE
Yep! Seriously, it'll probably be the most hype bit of the anime yet. Just from seeing that last shot of Yamaguchi rise up, I can tell Production I.G are going to make it amazing.
>> ARTICLE
What I will never fully understand is how teammates would yell "Nice Serve" right before the guy tosses up the ball, or during it. I would hate it as a player when I'm trying to concentrate and my teammates are screaming at me.

It's like icing your own player at the free throw line in basketball. I wouldn't want people screaming "Nice Shot!" right before I shoot the ball. I can understand *after* it, or even after they miss. But before it, my personal preference is to keep quiet and let the guy concentrate.

***

Regarding the actual episode...man, what a thriller. I just love how Haikyuu will still animate quick montage scenes, even if it's the small fluttering of clothes. Other anime should take more notice. Even tiny movements and looping them would make still screens that much more watchable.

And how all the events connect so well to each other. Like when Karasuno faked the spike, Oikawa saved it, right back to a Seijou spike. That scene and the transitions were so smooth I had to watch it twice. Couldn't even wait 'til the end of the episode. I rewinded it and watched it again.
>> ARTICLE
It's an endearing shout

Kinda like (/add oil) or (fighting!/hwaiting!/!)
Also Eastern Asian culture is different when it comes to encouragement
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, I get that. It's supposed to be something like, "You can do it!" or a "You can do a nice serve!" kinda encouragement.

...Which I sorta understand it, but I'll never *fully* understand it.

My sister teaches in Japan. I went back and saw a basketball practice, but everything (including their and Haikyuu's shouts) seems so mechanical, like a routine to say it.

And I know things are different. But it's just something I'll never fully understand.
>> ARTICLE
We have the same things in English. It's just that the languages are so different that things that roll off the tongue are much different in each language.

If you go onto any sports court you'll hear the same sort of thing thing, but because it seems natural we miss how much it is mechanical.
>> ARTICLE
Is it a volleyball thing? Because I've never seen or heard this happen in baseball, soccer, football, basketball, hockey, tennis, or any other sport I played back when I was in school.

Or has times changed so much that this is now "old school"?
>> ARTICLE
> I would hate it as a player when I'm trying to concentrate and my teammates are screaming at me.

And if something so simple breaks your concentration you're probably not cut out to be an athlete :>
>> ARTICLE
That's what people always say, but it's not that simple. You can filter out crowd noise. You can even filter out opponent noise. It's hard to filter out teammates' noise.

And it's not like it's going to fail 100% of the time it's done to you. But as an athlete, you want to be put in the best situation you can be in, which is when you can fully concentrate. It's not as simple as "if you can't do it, don't do it." It's more "I can do it, but don't make it any harder for me to do it."
>> ARTICLE
Dunno why you got downvoted, as that's pretty common even in professional sorts.  In MLB home fans usually cheer and shout when the opposing pitcher is going to rattle them, and are quiet when their own is pitching.  Same with pro football; quiet when your team is on offense so they can communicate, and loud on defense so your opponent can't do the same.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's episode 21, so any kind of negative opinion is more prone to get downvotes, I guess? Idk, I'm not really complaining about it. Downvotes will happen at times. I just thought, from an athlete's perspective, that "Nice Serve" was something that could actually hurt the performance of the server, since it *could* break concentration (not saying it will).

In my free throw example, players will [deliberately try to break your concentration](https://streamable.com/q3cz) with the most simplest acts. A player named Chris Paul literally [screamed at his own teammate](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2430503-chris-paul-at-a-crossroads) for taking too much time. People say, "well, if your concentration breaks that easily, maybe you shouldn't be an athlete," but it's *because* concentration for *anyone* breaks so easily, teammates should keep quiet and let them concentrate. You want to put them in the most optimal situation to succeed.

...is what I learned through personal experience and in sports psych. Obviously different for Japan.

Kageyama was fucking killer there.

I thought I'd die laughing.
>> ARTICLE
You beautiful bastard
>> ARTICLE
This feels just like the the weekly OPM ones you do! Thanks for the hard work!
>> ARTICLE
No.9 anime > 10x manga.
>> ARTICLE
tbh I feel that way about Haikyuu's anime as a whole in that it exceeds the manga by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say by a long shot, but the movements are really good animated, which is hard to do in a manga. But most of the time the manga looks great as well (especially no. 6).
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the anime is so smooth and the soundtrack adds that whole other level. Personally, the anime got me hooked, but I love the manga too. I feel like it conveys movement and action really well!  
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's(i think) exactly what he means. Haikyuu is all about motion, well anime is about motion, but Haikyuu has that feeling about it because its very attached to moving around and the flow of the players/ball. Obviously you're gonna think that anime is better than the manga because you're seeing everything moving, rather than just a still picture.
>> ARTICLE
It's like the opposite of Kuroko no Basuke for me. Haikyuu!!'s animation is very fluid and focused on motion, while the way Kuroko works is that the manga focuses a lot on making each individual panel look really dynamic. There are so many times where I think the Kuroko manga did it better than the anime (though the anime takes the cake every once and awhile, especially with Aomine).
>> ARTICLE
Volleyball girls are cute

Old coach's are bad-ass

And the idea that everybody's training different areas of play is so fucking great. Haikyu is so good.

Tsukishima's ability to not give a fuck is unparalleled  
EDIT: Wait shit I saw the preview for next weeks episode and it looks like he'll start giving some fucks.

Can't wait for that to be animated, its going to be great

It really doesn't take off till after this arc though, right?
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Tsuki is one of those people who gives all the fucks, but never where anyone else sees it.

Such tsun

I-its not l-like i give a f-fuck or anything~ Baka!

Tsukki's development next episode???? I can't wait!

the music in this anime is actually amazing.

Indeed! The violin theme during the training was awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
I love training montages/episodes, always so satisfying to see the new and improved techniques in actual use later on.
>> ARTICLE
 I know what you mean!  Plus the music is always awesome in a montage.  :D
>> ARTICLE
And the suspense knowing that they'll be much better for the training camp! So pumped
>> ARTICLE
Feel bad for all the plebs that aren't watching Haikyuu this season. Probably my favourite show of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like sports anime because of Kuroko no Basket.  
Got bored as fuck and for some reason I haven't figured out, decided to watch first episode of Haikyuu just to "kill some time".  
Ended up killing way more time than expected because I binge watched the whole first season, found it amazingly funny and nice to watch because of the "power progression" when it comes to characters, even for Shoyo you get his background of practicing alone and with people who didn't play volleyball and he suddenly becomes this star with the help of Kageyama.  
Season 2 has been cool as fuck, hopefully it'll top S1 which was already insanelly good.
>> ARTICLE
somehow, this was my story this season. Was waiting for some "cool series" to come on Sunday, wasn't really following anything else during the week, and started watching hte 1st episode of S2 in boredom. Now I look forward to saturdays more than sundays, wondering how the heck i got to this point
>> ARTICLE
Definitely AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no idea why so many people avoid sports anime around here.
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean it's easy to get burned on bad sports series.

But it's like any other genre, there's a ton of garbage and then maybe 5% of all of them are actually any good.

And when a sports series is on point it can be *great.*
>> ARTICLE
Because an absolute shitload of sport shows are just average. And having Kuroko no Basket as the most popular one in the genre isn't helping, because it embraces everything people dislike in shounen shows without the satisfaction of Luffy/Naruto/Ichigo physically beating up their opponents.

I love sport shows, and I've followed every sport show in the last couple of years. But let's not act as if Haikyuu isn't pretty much a revelation to the genre.

Free, Ace no Diamond & YowaPedal are great for sports fans, but aren't the things to draw in new fans. Kuroko no Basket lacks substance, Chihayafuru was too niche to call it an actual sport show and Baby Steps' production quality was utter shite in its first season, on top of not sucking you in immediately with its slow start.

That leaves us with Ookiku Furikabutte & Cross Game (both which stayed low-key, although I see Cross Game being referenced more and more!) and a couple of long-running shows before we get back to Hajime no Ippo, *the* sport show ever made.

Haikyuu is an outlier. Many shows lack pacing, substantial character growth off the field and a diverse enough cast to not turn it into a self-insert power show. It's sad that that is what makes that Haikyuu is not as popular as it could be, because it's the best sport anime there is in my opinion, even surpassing Hajime no Ippo, but there is a definite explanation as to why the sport genre is in the state it is in.
>> ARTICLE
It also doesn't help that the Eyeshield 21 anime is absolutely horrible compared to the source material too. 
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is in some no man's land where its neither a sports or a shoujo (at least I don't seem to think so) and sadly it doesn't get the number of fans that it should
>> ARTICLE
> sadly it doesn't get the number of fans that it should

I'm actually surprised by the amount of fans it does have. It's recommended and praised really often on this sub and I didn't think it came close to the excitement and feels you got from Hajime no Ippo or Haikyuu.

I thought Chihayafuru's sport was hard to relate too. I just don't think it portrayed the hardwork, sacrifice, and dreams like Hajime No Ippo or the special comradery you see in Haikyuu or most other sports anime.

I know it's just a matter of preference, but what in your opinion made it so great?


>> ARTICLE
First of all, the big thing that drew me in was the typical sports premise about making a team and competing to win competitions, that changed into me wanting Chihaya and Tachi to succeed. Although not on the level of Ippo's sacrifice (not going to school to become a pro boxer) you can see the dedication that Chihaya puts in which is in its own sense endearing. As you can see that she realises that she is lacking in certain areas and works hard to overcome her shortcomings 

 She never backs down from strong opponents and it makes you want to cheer for her, and every game is going to be different with its own circumstances unlike say Kuroko no Basket where you know  Kuroko is going to step in steal the ball and pass it to kagami who is going to do a slam dunk (I read the entire manga btw) and also you never know who is going to win. Especially since the Karuta tournament that Chihaya is in is a team based tournament where they have to get majority of the wins so its not a guarantee that Chihaya is going to win every match unlike Kuroko No Basket where you basically know hey these guys are definitely going to win.

Another thing that Chihayafuru does well is to portray realism in a sense, it doesn't allow Chihaya to win matches that she should be able to and theres usually even when she wins its not down to some bullshit thing like friendship power or anything but an actually well explained reason. An example would be like [Kuroko No Basket Spoilers](/s "How Kuroko manages to win Akashi and his team of 4 uncrowned generals with their honestly half baked team that won because of some bullshit mid game power spike")

And thats only talking about Chihaya and none of the other characters like Tachi Nishida Oe Desktomu (I can't remember his actual name, damn I'm a failure)

And thats only Season 1 and not Season 2 which brings more characters in and shows even more development for the group 


PS sorry for not being able to do spoilers properly, really cant figure out why it can't work just hover over it thanks
>> ARTICLE
That, and the fact it has 2 seasons yet still no conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that it deserves a 3rd season, the amount of source material is incredible, the anime ends of at around chapter 90+ and as of now there are up to 154 chapters (currently at 114) and whats more is that one chapter has 30+ pages instead of the normal 17-20 which means that in terms of source material there's at least enough for one more season or two at least
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't having average series apply to every genre out there? I agree that Kuroko no Basket gives the genre a bad rep and that Haikyuu!! is an outlier, but if something nailing both production values and storytelling can't hook audiences its going to be a really difficult job.
>> ARTICLE
I should've been more clear I guess.

Because the sports genre is a smaller one, the percentage of quality shows has to be higher than in other genres because you still need an actual number of good shows to interest people. I only feel comfortable recommending Haikyuu or Ippo to people unfamiliar with the genre.
>> ARTICLE
 think it's my top 3 all time
>> ARTICLE
I love seeing everyone trying to learn new techniques, well except Tsukki :(. 

I'm also so incredibly excited for next week. [Slight Manga Spoilers](/s "Though I'm not sure I'm ready for the Tsukki-Yamaguchi drama. :(")

This [wat face](http://i.imgur.com/KDYATbG.jpg) was hilarious.

Yachi is always [so adorable](http://i.imgur.com/4AXNBK1.jpg) even if she showed up so little this time.

Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/spf9zZ7.jpg).[kid](http://i.imgur.com/YYauolW.png) looked so happy every frame! Kinda reminds me of Hinata and how he always acts so amazed at everything.

There was also another kid who looked like baby Iwaizumi :D

Oikawa showing even more why he is the best character.

You mean second to Tsukki? That's absolutely correct then.

When both of them were introduced I really thought "Damn, they are just not likeable." But they are my two favorite characters.

But I can't say that I dislike even one character.
>> ARTICLE
I realised this episode that he has the same voice actor as hisoka 
>> ARTICLE
Me too! I was thinking it sounded familiar!
>> ARTICLE
Shwing?
>> ARTICLE
!!
>> ARTICLE
every character is the best character in Haikyuu!
>> ARTICLE
What was kageyamas goal in going to the kids camp anyway? To visualize Hinata hitting his tosses? Hahaha

Anyway, so it looks like kageyama has done some introspection, humbling himself in the process, and decided to use his training time to practice this new setting technique, somewhat blindly, without any assurance Hinata can pull this off. But given that Hinata has placed his trust 100% in him from the beginning, it's damn satisfying to finally see kageyama reciprocate and to have to attempt something with his own eyes closed this time around.

Both of them are still constipated high school boys who don't talk about their feelings though.
>> ARTICLE
> What was kageyamas goal in going to the kids camp anyway?

They didn't include a full translation of the poster in the last episode, but the poster includes "Learn from a pro" at the top so I assume he went to ask a pro about his situation only to run into Oikawa. 
>> ARTICLE
ahaha, so we got the very impassioned bowing scene instead. he already bowed once to tsukkishima so he probably figured he couldn't go any lower
>> ARTICLE
I just meant the translation wasn't included so his reason for going wasn't as clear as in the manga. The whole Oikawa scene was in the Manga as well.

Great thing was they made Oikawa even more of an ass than in the Manga. Didn't think that was possible.
>> ARTICLE
[Dies because Oikawa Toru is in this episode and Namikawa Daisuke's voice is so damn awesome] (http://imgur.com/CdZ1xqz)

>> ARTICLE
God I love every single character in this show. Grandpa Ukai is hilarious and I cant help but giggle like a child every time Oikawa is on screen, he's so ridiculously petty even his nephew called him out.

Also Hinata having that flash of being the little giant might have stopped my heart for a second

I love how the team just found that common ground that they all need to improve as individuals if they want to succeed. We didn't need a huge cheesy speech or anything, because obviously the athletes want to get better. Im hype as shit to see noyas toss, and yamaguchis float serve and whatever the freak duo will manage to pull next!

Also sensing a Tsukki plotline which Im already positive I will love.

"one centimetre, one millimetre, one second faster to the top" of my anime list because this show is fucking spectacular

>Also Hinata having that flash of being the little giant might have stopped my heart for a second

I feel like it's the same effect as Eyeshield 21 in that both are chasing an ideal entity, improving themselves step by step to get just a little bit closer

It's a testament to this show that I enjoy the training episodes just as much if not more than the games. The soundtrack this episode in particular was on point. I could feel some chills.

YESSSS summer training camp and more Tsukki next week.

Takeru busting Oikawa's balls was pretty funny. Even the minor characters that you might not see ever again are likeable. 

Also, that was another great montage. The one in the first episode of the show is still one of the best I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, I need someone to photoshop (young) Ukai flying through space with his car. When the scene in which he was driving back to Karasuno appeared I just had to laugh so much for some reason and got that idea.

Amazing episode as always, can't wait to see the results of their training so far!

I only watch 2 shows anymore, it's this and One Punch Man.  Somehow a show about volleyball manages to bring about a similar level of hype as a show about an invincible superman that was practically designed to be the hypest fucking show of all time.

OPM was deffinitely not desinged to be hype.

I'd say rakudai is also a good show to watch, atleast if you like romance.

Noragami is also very good

glad grandpa coach punched lil coach. it is his fault in the end after all. his incompetence as a coach. but like his team, everybody is pulling through and getting better at their job.

This show just does NOT dissapoint on any level. It's just great to see everyone doing their own thing, however, still keeping the team in mind.

Also, Yachi is just the best thing ever. Her reactions and interactions with the crew are amazing.

I swear all my friends ask me how I watch anime with volley. The first season had the best character development. Imperfect human beings trying their best to fight. Then they realize they can't fight themselves and they cooperate. You see the struggle the problems , the team bonding together. They lose , they try to evolve, they fight and they still try to figure this out. I mean it's basically how life is supposed to be with bonus of hyped fights in volleyball and laugh as well. This and your lie in April are truly masterpieces in my book.

Especially Nekoma's coach.

Karasuno's still in the rough carbon that needs more time and polishing to become a crystal clear diamond.

Don't forget to spoiler tag your quote as well
>> ARTICLE
I just did it, but it's a bit late, and my original reasoning not to was that if someone read the comment I was responding to, then they would have already seen the spoiler. But I guess it's sensible to spoiler tag it just in case. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's how I feel as well. I mean, there was some foreshadowing, but we didn't *really* know. I don't like this sort of thing because now I know for sure it's happening and it kind of lessens the drama. 
>> ARTICLE
The sheer athletics displayed in the scene where Hinata makes the receive (including Ukai desperately trying to move the bench out of his way) was animated beautifully - and that was just in the first six minutes. I think this episode, more than any other since the series' start, showed the beauty of receives and just made them look AWESOME. I have a newfound appreciation for the defensive players on the team.

Also Ennoshita is amazing and lovely and I'm sad we're just starting to meet him a season and a half into the show.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita really grew on me, I mean Im glad that Dad is back but I hope that the show continues into the next year so we can get even more second year development.
>> ARTICLE
> dad
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita's been there in the background the whole time. It's really amazing how they pull the focus away, but he's always there. I noticed it after reading the manga and rereading chapters and watching the anime, but he's always there.
>> ARTICLE
Supposedly Ennoshita's (and Yamaguchi's) story was not planned from the beginning.  I guess Ennoshita as the next leader just developed out of his character like happens in real life.  
>> ARTICLE
> including Ukai desperately trying to move the bench out of his way

I loved that touch, they didn't need to do it but it was just something little but so perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I think we can all agree tho that the best part was Take-chan getting knocked over.
>> ARTICLE
Im actually really glad that they put this in. I remember it from the manga and it made me appreciate the amount of attention that went into the little things. Iirc it was a chair in the manga though which makes more sense to pick up if you sort of think about it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, In the episode it didn't really seem like a big concern, due to the way it was shown.

But I also think it needed to be their purely to demonstrate how far out he was actually going to get that one touch and then get back.

I mean logically none of the benches would be placed within an area even considered for potential play.

WTF Suga.  Typical Irino to draw the attention to himself given the chance.  

I wish the anime would take a page from Let's?! Haikyuu and start having characters bite their tongues.  
>> ARTICLE
just curious, how do you make these gifs? how long do they usually take? is there a fast way to do this?
>> ARTICLE
Hm the time it takes varies but maybe an average of around 4-5h? (excluding breaks ~~and me getting distracted by things~~)

Making the gifs takes about 2h so what really takes time is cleaning+redrawing the caps. Of course if the caps don't need redrawing then it takes less time! Also if the redraws are more complex then it'll take a longer time since I'm still an amateur.

I don't know if there's a "fast" way to do it; there's probably a more efficient method but I'm used to the way I make these so \\\_()\_/

Oh, and I use Photoshop CS6 to make gifs :)

Hopefully there will be more afterwards. Either a summer league, or we get to see the next year, where Hinata and Kageyama will be 2nd years. So we'll see some other characters again and hopefully get matchups that were missed out on.

I'm a bit disappointed at how obvious they're making it that Date Tech will lose, but I will be flipping out if they actually win.

It's in the OP. I'm pretty sure it was like that in season one as well. The OP gives away the teams they will play. TBH I prefer Dateko over Seijo

I think its the combination of Bokuto, Akaashi, and Kuroo that really helped them all shine. Some of the best moments of this season involved those three.

I like that Hinata and Kageyama do DBZ-type fighting now instead of just Kageyama choking Hinata or something.  Shows they're getting closer to being equals and no longer just Hinata benefiting from Kageyama being a genius.  Little things like that, this anime does so damn well.
>> ARTICLE
The main team of the series, Karasuno, won. So why am I crying that Wakanun lost against them? What is wroing with the series to make me/us feel such things for almost all characters? This is not fair.

Overall I thought the episode was really intense. And suddenly... Bokuto appeared. That got a good laugh out of me.

Also shoutout to Ukai-san for the fast reflexes!

And next week... Aoba vs Date Tech hype!
>> ARTICLE
[*"Once more...let me do it once more."*](https://i.imgur.com/pJNmurL.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Wakanun was interesting in that it seemed the most Karasuno-like of all the teams thus far. We've had guys who don't care, dominating presences like Oikawa, gimmicks like the two meter man and "party team," and the silent giant of Dateko. But these were just a bunch of well-balanced players who understood one another with one abnormally talented player in the same vein as Hinata, right down to the fixation on the Little Giant. 

Usually Haikyuu has to go to some serious lengths to get you interested in the other team. They crammed a lot of backstory into that Ohgi Minami match to make the ending so effective. This one was almost like easy mode. Why do we care about Wakanun? Because it's easy to see Karasuno in them.
>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with the series to make me/us feel such things for almost all characters? This is not fair.

This is what happens when an anime has excellent character development. Its a rare sight nowadays.

And why (one of the reasons) I have the first season a 10 and probably this one as well
>> ARTICLE
STOP MAKING ME CRY OVER ANIME BOYS PLAYING VOLLEYBALL
>> ARTICLE
I think I actually teared up a bit---what with Ennoshita berating himself for his failures even when the team won, and Yam's face... that last scene with Takeru was definitely the final straw. I definitely full on cried because it's just so fucking relatable. And I don't even play sports.

This episode had that same feeling of melancholy and regret during last season's episode 16 (Karasuno's first match in the Interhigh, plus the Karasuno girl's team's match), and I loved that one.

On a more lighter note, Daichi's back! I don't even know why but he seems hotter than usual... (is it the posing, like how coy he looked scratching the back of his head... I don't even fucking know god)

And yay we're gonna get to see bits of the Seijoh vs Dateko match! I love Dateko and their chant and their unfair tallness and Aone's missing eyebrows and [character that's gonna appear next ep](/s "Koganegawa, who's unfairly tall and adorable")
>> ARTICLE
ever episode makes my eyes watery..
>> ARTICLE
>he seems hotter than usual

I attribute it to "absence makes the heart grow fonder" and the fact that there is now credible evidence to point to him being awesome and rugged.
>> ARTICLE
I think Daichi was originally supposed to come across as intimidating.  Like, in addition to being "scary when angered", he's one of the densest characters in the series (the only characters with a higher BMI are all in Fukurodani and Date-kou, lol).  It didn't really work out like that since he ended up being "dad".  

I thought this scene was the opposite of rugged.  It was kind of cute with his awkward apology.  
>> ARTICLE
I can't even decide who I hope is their next opponent.  I'd love to see the rematch after that loss in season 1, but Karasuno's offense versus the Iron Wall defense would be a fantastic match also.    

[](#hypeoverload)

I hope it's Aoba! We need an Aoba vs Karasuno rematch!!

AAAAAAAAAA I love this show SO much.

So many great moments this episode. Kageyama's "kind advice". Ukai frantically moving the bench out of the way and dumping Takeda-sensei. Tanaka parroting Ennoshita's lines. Ennoshita's amazing receive with the play that HE thought up. Hinata's rebound and Bokuto's spidey sense. Nishinoya's compliment. Tsukishima's solid block. Kageyama's push over the net. Nishinoya's method of "cheering up" Asahi. Hinata seeing Nakashima's wipe. Ennoshita doing that incredible receive right after. Hinata's face in the back after seeing Daichi.

I'm so glad that Ennoshita's getting some attention now. He's absolutely lovely. Now I'm just waiting for Yamaguchi's moment in the spotlight! And I can't wait for next week. Date vs. Aoba Johsai is gonna be SO HYPE.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time commenting in the Haikyuu! thread! I'm so nervous!

Dang what a game. It's nice seeing that Hinata isn't the only person who [was inspired by The Little Giant](http://i.imgur.com/Hqjm5BS.jpg). This is another strong aspect of the show. You're not the only one. You're not the only one working hard, you're not the only one who gives it your all, you're not the only one who earns for victory. And as always, despite the fact that [I'm super happy for Karasuno](http://i.imgur.com/jAeM5eW.jpg), [it's really hard to see the other team lose](http://i.imgur.com/dkC5zzg.jpg).

Of course Daichi is okay. Did you think a little thing like a potential concussion could stop him? Teeth? Do you need them to play volleyball? It's probably just holding Daichi back.

A..perfect episode really. Ticked every box with what makes Haikyuu episodes: great dialogue, amazing match matched with great animation, comedy, Hinata/Kageyama duo galore, staple emotional moments (nice receive Ennoshita) and the abundance of mixed feelings at the conclusion of our team winning a match accompanied with the return of our hero. 

The only way is up with these Haikyuu episodes tbh. I really hope the whole of next episode is dedicated to showing Seijoh v Date Tech. I cant believe one of them is gonna be eliminated before playing Karasuno. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is absolutely incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
Hinata was a fucking beast. That save followed by an immediate counter was beautiful

Chikara not being satisfied despite the win makes me want to look forward to see him get better and better.

Date Tech vs. Seijoh is gonna be hype even though we all who's gonna win thanks to the OP.

can we take a minute to look how easy it was for Ukai to pick up the bench with the teacher sitting on it lol
>> ARTICLE
Tried to put off watching the second season until it was all the way through.

Finally gave in on Wednesday.

And now here I am.

God damn this show is too good. And I think the second season is actually better than the first somehow. Having gone so heavily on Hinata and Kageyama in the first half, those two can kind of simmer while they develop everyone else, even guys like Ennoshita who barely existed in season one. 

Just the most human cast of characters I've seen in a long time, which is made all the more impressive by how damn large that cast is.
>> ARTICLE
>too good

... Are you suggesting it should be worse?

> Finally gave in on Wednesday.

I guess that answered my question already.

And welcome to front of the hype train. A basic week feels like this: 6 days 23 hours and 30 minutes of waiting for the next episode, 25 minutes of watching the [amazing] newest episode, and 5 minutes (or up to 6 days 23 hours and 35 minutes) of merely basking in how amazing what you just watched was. Hope you survive. It is quite a ride.
>> ARTICLE
Its nice that Hinata is skilled through practice and determination like a traditional shonen protagonist is, however I appreciate that there is also natural talent that can't be be aquired through sheer hard work. There is some natural instincts that Hinata has that take him above and beyond the average player.  And I am just waiting for Yamaguchi to come through. It is going to be a glorious moment when he finally does.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu really strikes a realistic balance between "this character worked really hard to get where they are" and "this character is a naturally talented freak" in their character development. You get the feeling that Oikawa, Hinata, Aone, and everyone else got so powerful because they took their innate strengths and honed them incredibly well.
>> ARTICLE
This is precisely why I love this show. People like them have natural talent, yes, but they so obviously work and practice and put their blood, sweat, and tears into becoming so skilled. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy the score keepers little comments. They are just so casual compared to the tension of the games
>> ARTICLE
Yo, the bathroom has become a magnet of challenges.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably bias because he's my favorite, but I love how Nishinoya continually lives up to his Guardian Deity status with well-timed reassurances to both Ennoshita and Asahi.

Damn that final play had my heart on edge though. I'm really happy with all of the focus we've had on Ennoshita these past few episodes. I hope to see a lot more of him in the future now that he's got a real fire lit in his heart now -- though admittedly not *too* much since I still want to see a ton of Daichi (who unfortunately got a series of welcome-back punches from Suga right after he came back). That Daichi trusted him with the last few plays was really heartwarming too.

Once again while I'm really happy that Karasuno won, I'm still upset that their opponents lost.

I'm assuming Aoba Josai wins against Date Tech though due to the sheer focus in the OP/ED they get. I'm sure I'll still watch that match on the edge of my seat though. It'll be a nice parallel to S1 if Karasuno can win on a rematch vs Aoba Josai to finish out this season.

edit: removed an unnecessary apostrophe
>> ARTICLE
I end up thinking about this after any episode featuring Tsuki and Yamaguchi, but think about what you thought about them when you were first introduced to them. Now think about how you feel about them now.

At what point did I go from thinking they were jerks to thinking they were vital parts of the team and members of the cast? It just sort of happened at some point.
>> ARTICLE
That scene at around the 18 minute mark where it looks like Hinata is standing alone but then you realize Kags is beside him was really really cool. Good symbolism for how they achieve success.

Really the only right answer for being excited to go to the bathroom. Good call Kageyama [](http://i.imgur.com/kN9kEcU.png)
>> ARTICLE
What a game! Props to both of teams, as usual in Haikyuu!!, you will feel despair no matter which team has won the match. It's very nice to see Kageyama and Hinata funny interaction in this episode. When Hinata said to Kageyama "Why do you have to break my heart?", I was laughing loudly. It was phrased differently in the translated manga chapter, so it's sort of becomes nice little surprise. 


Ennoshita's last receive was amazing. He also displays his ability to commandnas future captain. We definitely need to get more Ennoshita! Also the last bit when Yamaguchi went to bathroom. God dammit that poop/shit joke will always funny! It's also such a nice display how all of first years are in that scene.


Last but not the least, dateko and seijoh chant all over the stadium gives me chills! 
>> ARTICLE
I really would like to see another Date Tech vs. Karasuno. But it's shounen and im certain that Aoba Johsai will win next match so Karasuno can have their "revenge".
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving how the other characters in Karasuno, like Ennoshita, are now getting motivated to not only be in the team, but to *actively play* during matches. Hopefully we may see the same thing with the other characters (Yamaguchi will succeed next time I'm sure). 

Hype for seeing Mad-Dog chan play next week!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Without knowing where the manga ends up making it to. Whether they just run through Hinata and Kageyama as first years. Or make it to a point where they are second years it's interesting because normally the backups literally just exist to justify the player being off the court for a couple of minutes to recouperate.

But this is the first team sports anime where it seems like the team is actually trying to make sure they are competitive in the future as well.

---

If you were to take Kuroko, a year later, half the team is gone, and they haven't spent a lot of time making sure their backups can really take their place.
>> ARTICLE
As always, Haikyuu manages to make me feel both happy and sad at the same time. Also i'm gonna miss Touma, Index III when?
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part was the final shot of Takeru/Wakunan against the fall-colored trees; it gave me chills, esp when you compare it to the one opening shot of the rain outside the venue. It really gives off the impression that both teams are taking something positive away from the match, even if it doesn't seem like it at first.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting that Karasuno is continually recognized as continually recognized as this offensive power house. It's mentioned that they have the fire power to break through, but their defense seems pretty under rated. Hinata is amazing and Kageyama is a genius, but that defense! With Daichi, they've got a very solid ability to receive, complimented by the best Junior High libero. Tsukki's ability to read offensive plays and shore up his blocking is growing by the game. It's no iron wall, but it's getting good.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it, I couldn't help be tear up a bit this episode.
It hurt to see Ennoshita be so hard on himself even though they won. It was the first time we got to see him play but I already like him a lot since hes actually really relatable. 
Felt so bad for the other team too, especially when the captain started crying :( Damn you Haikyuu and all your sympathetic opponent teams!
>> ARTICLE
I am so so so excited to see Oikawa and Iwaizumi in action again next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so as I mentioned in FTF I just got caught up with Haikyuu earlier today. The wait to see how this match would pan out has been a very painful few hours (and that's only partly due to the killer sore throat I've got). Now I have to wait an entire week for the next episode? I honestly don't know how I'm going to cope.

Super glad Daichi made it back safe and sound for their next match but I'm also happy that we got a spotlight on Chikara, and by extension the other 2nd years, these past few episodes. I have no idea how far this series will go but it gives a strong hope for a solid team even after the 3rd years move on from Karasuno.

This show is just so insanely awesome and is easily sailing to a 10/10 finish, joining the first season for me to give a perfect score.

Man, every single one of these episodes brings me close to man tears out of sheer happiness at the growh of Karasuno players.
>> ARTICLE
The fighting was hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
goddamn. this episode was so hype. im REALLY regretting not picking up a sport back in high school now. goddamn. now im just bogged down with commitments. closest thing to the 'slow motion' ill ever feel is from playing dota 2 lol.

First time posting, 
The Feels this episode had!!!

>> ARTICLE
Easily one of my favorite things about this anime is that I feel like I never actually know who is going to win, even though of course the hero team is going to win. You really get to feel the tension when Karasuno is backed into a corner.
>> ARTICLE
I need to remember to have haikyuu as last anime to watch for the night because there's nothing that can top it and it keeps ruining other shows.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so real I can't even begin to describe. Every week I'm stunned by every aspect of this show from the animation to the characters to the music and everything.
>> ARTICLE
Ah this show continues to be amazing. I'm glad that I can still count on good ol' Haikyuu.
I don't remember it from the manga, but I really liked the moment where Nishinoya complimented Ennoshita on his receive.

Still looking forward to Yamaguchi getting the spotlight eventually.

Also looking forward to what appears to be the season's final match of Karasuno vs. one of their two rival teams. :D
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love Nishinoya! He's like the team cheerleader but reliable as fuck in a pinch!
>> ARTICLE
I like the part where Nishinoya tickled Asahi when his serve hit out.
>> ARTICLE
This is so good ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the Wakanun coach look like a younger version of Ukai?
>> ARTICLE
Such a good episode. So hyped for Oikura and company!

The only thing that could make this series better is if there were some epic rallies going back and forth with little to no monologue.
>> ARTICLE
I got so emotional towards the end. "The Losers" was a proper title. Not everyone in the winning team won.
>> ARTICLE
And simultaneously, they also don't just focus on the winning team, and we're reminded of the losing team as well. This series > 
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita got his time to shine yet he's still disappointed at his self.

Yamaguchi still regrets what he's done or haven't done for the team. You're gonna have your own time to shine bruh.

Nishinoya still badass as always. Getting a compliment from a great libero about receiving would really lift one's spirit.

Tsuki is still sharp as always, noticing very small details at everything. The one I'm most excited to see shine in this show but we still have long long way to go.

Btw the bathrooms in this anime is really where all action and drama takes place so when a character goes in a bathroom, you know shits gonna happen.
>> ARTICLE
The amount of detail the animators put into this was amazing; notice that right after Kageyama tells Hinata to watch the ball, the following play by the opponent tricks Hinata into jumping just a [bit](http://i.imgur.com/nb4WdPl.png), while Kageyama sees through it and immediately goes to the ball, while Hinata lags slightly behind, which leads perfectly into the gap formed in the block right after.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda disappointed that Suga didn't play any part in the victory. With Daichi gone you would think that Suga would be the vice captain of sorts and he would finally be able to step up to the plate and help the team over the line. I understand that he's a setter and a double setter line up is probably not ideal but him not having anything to do with the win is quite strange to me.
>> ARTICLE
Finally catched up to Haikyuu!!, it's such an amazing series and this episode was insane!
>> ARTICLE
I think that Takeru was influenced by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQimzAluRg) player. Pretty awesome that there is someone in real life that can do that.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap what a beautiful episode...

...and it's over...
>> ARTICLE
i was actually expecting the episode to end after the first jump toss + asahi's spike and all. i was just *so used* to haikyuu leaving me high and dry like that -- but then we got more! 

and then it's over.
>> ARTICLE
ARGH, I HATE THAT THEY'RE SO SHORT. But that episode was beautiful. Now another week's wait for another great episode.
>> ARTICLE
that basically felt like 2 minutes of adrenaline rush.
>> ARTICLE
The animation this episode was top notch. Oikawas serve and mad-dogs spike were incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I swear I was only watching for 5 minutes. Haikyuu-time is a real thing.
>> ARTICLE
Holy.... That trumpet at the end gave me the chills. I read the manga and know whats gonna happen but that really gave me the chills.
>> ARTICLE
On that note, there was a short piece within the first minute or so that I swear came straight from Mario Kart.
>> ARTICLE
Really smart by the sound team in my opinion. The implementation of the trumpet, an instrument we haven't heard in any of Haikyuu's soundtrack so far IIRC, changes the atmosphere quite differently and it really goes well with how Mad Dog's substitution will drastically change Aoba Johsai's system of play.

Or I might be just reading too much into it.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the sound production team for this show is one of the best I've ever seen. They know exactly how to heighten a scene to the best it can be, whether it be a complete lack of music and just SFX (Oikawa's jump serve this ep), or a really good track (Mad Dog and Ennoshita's scenes) to send hype levels through the roof.
>> ARTICLE
The bgm flowed with the intensity of the show so well.
>> ARTICLE
Nah I don't think you are. The track that's playing during that moment is incredibly sinister-sounding with the choppy, distorted guitars and the slow, ominous drumbeat. When it does come in, the trumpet enters on an off-key note that drowns out the other instruments through sheer volume. It also doesn't play in time with the other instruments as the song continues, and its parting flourish is the last thing we hear before the ED starts - which, even though it's the most [dissonant](http://www.britannica.com/art/consonance-music) out of all of the EDs so far, actually sounds pretty soothing compared to the song that played before it. 

The song was likely specifically written to reinforce the visual of the gears straining against each other and being forced to run counter to their intended purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad that I wasn't wrong on my thesis. I wanted to word it more properly, but I would've never noticed those aspects you mentioned. 
>> ARTICLE
Careful though, I don't think a lot of what he said is correct.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call the starting note off-key...It was a non-chord tone (appoggiatura that resolves right away) and then does some improv-style pentatonics before ending on the tonic. I would describe as more of an "intense" or "wild" feel rather than "sinister". Also, it's not really the "volume" that "drowns out" since the track is gain compressed; we hear it so clearly because the high-frequency spectrum has these overtone harmonics that you get in the high-register of the trumpet.

Plus the ED isn't really what I would call a "dissonant" piece. Follows pretty standard chord progressions harmonically and resolves typically. Though the singers sound pretty out of tune at times, lol, I guess you could call that dissonance.
>> ARTICLE
Damn i love this show and you just made me love it more.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that trumpet sound was new. It gave me chills too, but at first I thought my headphones were broken.
>> ARTICLE
What trumpet sound are you guys talking about? Like at what time? (I'm hard of hearing and I miss some things. :P)
>> ARTICLE
Its a bit after the new guy hits that spike, its a little high pitch/squeaky.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
> a little high pitch/squeaky.

Wasn't that just Hinata talking?

I can't get over how great the anime adapts the manga and makes it even better! I just love how the characters are developed so well and how they intertwine with each other! There are no bad guys or unfavourable players! DAMN IT I LOVE THIS SHOW
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and the anime still never fails to excite me
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, Haikyuu is one of the best manga-to-anime adaptations I've ever seen.

For me its just ever so slightly above Yowapeda. If you haven't seen it, I HIGHLY recommend it.

That and ace of diamond.
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning to watch Daiya one day, but it's kinda long, I don't watch series which have episodes more than 25 (no time)
>> ARTICLE
Another good sports anime is one outs. 25 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ace of Diamond is a slow anime but its amazing. It takes the time to develop each character so the slowness is justified. There are some episodes where they hella blue ball you but oh well. 

I remember binge watching the whole first season, and I'm glad I didn't find out about that anime until the season was over because waiting for an episode a week right now is torture.
>> ARTICLE
I caught up to just before the knuckleball pitcher was introduced, saw the trailer for it in a Japanese restaurant after having it in my queue for a while and said fuck it. I'm pretty sure this season has been going for like 7 months now lmao.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, didn't the second season also release like right after the 1st season ended too? although the first few episodes were recaps haha
>> ARTICLE
Yeah second season started like late spring early summer, crazy how long it's been.
>> ARTICLE
then I'm game, character development is my weak spot.
>> ARTICLE
You're gonna be stuck watching the first season 24 hours straight if you're not careful.

I did that mistake by watching Haikyuu just before my finals week.

All the rushes and feelings I had from the manga are multiplied by 100 in the anime, its beyond perfect

For those last 2 it's one of those rare occurrences where the anime manages to make a scene even better than the original.

The original sucks to be honest. The art is pretty bad most of the time.

Or just all +300 episodes of Gintama so far really. Gintama in anime form works much better than the manga.

I'm unfamiliar with the manga so I wouldn't know.

Not only do I have no idea what's going to happen next, I have no idea what I want to happen next. This show definitely knows how to keep me on the edge of my seat.

This is gonna hurt me so bad.

Oh god, it is, isn't it!? There will be flashbacks and we'll feel bad for them and want EITHER of the teams to win. I'm not prepared. ;___; But it's what I love most about Haikyuu!!.

Damn it if [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/VrkKhf8.png) wasn't super satisfying out of nowhere. I think after some serious contemplation Iwaizumi has become my favorite Haikyuu!! character. Also, wondering: did Iwaizumi always do really intense jump serves? I feel like that's a new thing.

[Calm down, Tsukki.](http://i.imgur.com/ZpKDh92.png) Thanks for [saving Hinata's blocked spike](http://i.imgur.com/nGIuTUJ.png), though. That's definitely not something Tsukki would have put forth the effort to do towards the beginning of this season.

[Same, Daichi. Same.](http://i.imgur.com/4vHr2Hb.png)

The animation/soundtrack/EVERYTHING is on point as always.

Interested to see how Kyoutani (new, scary Seijou player) affects the game.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was shocked it was Tsukishima that saved Hinata's spike! But I thought it was a really nice touch. :') He's starting to actually care.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY CRAP the ending ost. That trumpet sent chills up my spine.

I love how Hinata still goes for enthusiastic high-fives with [Kageyama] (http://i.imgur.com/guJT0If.png?1) despite knowing how he's going to regret it.

Also, Oikawa, [talk shit, get hit] (https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/27D89D419F1311217165546196992_59f54ad846a.3.0.15047848625038248674.mp4?versionId=fUp.jLITMTSlVjsydXVW8vT010gXQHS2). You're such a child.

Gosh this match is AWESOME. Was hyped with even the slightest thing happening and both teams are so good. Not even sure who I'm rooting for anymore, I just want the match to continue.

[Oikawa vs Kageyama](http://i.imgur.com/gXxYUQE.jpg) right off the bat, as well as the [other players getting annoyed](http://i.imgur.com/lSRsZm1.jpg) when they realised there is a new girl in Karasuno's club were funny but nothing beats the various [reactions](http://i.imgur.com/8jfImWl.jpg) when things were going right.

Bokuto is the shining light of this show.

THAT SERVE! THAT SPIKE! Like holy hell is this what the rest of the match is gonna be like?!

Also was it just me or was the OST particularly on point this week as well?
>> ARTICLE
I know this has been said over and over again, but seriously, Haikyuu gets me hyped up more than any other show I've seen in a long time. Everything about it is just so perfect, the characters, the music, the story and honestly, it all just blends together so naturally. I wasn't expecting the first set to go by this quick, but I had a feeling it would go into OT from the getgo. 

We finally get to see Mad Dog in action and I knew he would have some "beast-like" personality/playstyle, but that last spike even surprised me a bit. I don't know if I can make it through to next week without dying from hype, but until then, KARASUNOOO FIGHT!!

PS. Could anyone tell me the OST around the 5:35 mark? I might be wrong, but it sounds like a string instrument? It's the really upbeat soundtrack that gets you pumped up. Hopefully this makes sense...would really appreciate it! 
>> ARTICLE
> PS. Could anyone tell me the OST around the 5:35 mark?

That was a crazy episode, which is exactly what I expected. I knew that guy at the end was gonna be scary good, but for some reason, I didn't expect him to be a huge asshole, too! I probably should have expected it, but the way he pushed over his teammate just to get that spike. It's almost like he's Hinata's evil twin or something.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a big sports fan, and the best sporting event I have seen in a while has been this show. I was cheering every point. 

Also the whole Yachi interaction was perfect. 

Kageyama kicking Hinata was hysterical but it totally worked and got him calmed down. I just love that he literally kicked his ass to get him into shape.

Daichi Being terrified of that monster serve and analyzing it, and then Noya being like holy shit I want to recieve that. Perfectly shows that dynamic. Daichi is level-headed, and Noya is having a blast and just wants to be challenged. I love it.

Also fuck Mad-dog-chan for knocking down Kindaichi. That's a reckless play and how people get hurt.

holy shit that was intense!!! the match every1 has been waiting for, and they delivered it p fckin great!! next episode gonna be even better! this is haikyuu time to show if it deserves a 10

Every week i have to emotionally prepare myself for the ending at the halfway point of each episode, a week is too long to wait after a spike like that.

It's interesting that Mad dog got put in because Karasunos biggest weakness is apparently calm collected teams that scope them out and adapt quickly. Which Seijoh is... except maybe not as much now that Mad Dog-chan's here? What I'm trying to say is bring him in may be the scale that tips everything in Karasuno's favor.

[I can't stop writing about Haikyuu. Here's a write-up about some hype from last week!](http://minuteart.net/2016/02/20/building-more-than-a-wall/)

Haikyuu is similar to a lot of sci-fi and fantasy in the sense that its world is very alive. A lot of effort went into building each team as a believable entity, so much so that we almost feel like they're real life teams. It's that level of effort that makes matches like today's so exciting :)
>> ARTICLE
shit the mad dogger
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god! This is the hype! Is it just me or it's like 3 times more exciting than when I read it in manga? I guess the animation really helps. Especially that Oikawa's serve and Mad Dog's spike. Holy shit! 


Daichi's play also really strong in this episode. Such a strong receiver! Also is it the first time Noya/Asahi combination as setter and spiker works in official play? It's awesome when Seijoh was surprised by it. But godamn, seijoh even can make their other player set perfectly too. An all round team! 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! makes me so happy

Wow. Just wow.

But let's check my list from last week, shall we?

>* Tsukki to block some bitches
* Yamaguchi to do some delicious pinch serving 
* Daichi and Nishinoya to do some godlike receives
* Asahi and Oikawa to deliver some service aces
* ~~And Yachi to puke her heart out~~^^^^thatmomentwassofunnyandcute  

So, we just got one block by Tsukki in the first set until now. I am not satisfied with that. Waiting for more.

That we haven't seen Yamaguchi until now is no surprise. I expect him to step on the court at the end of the second set.

I guess we can cross "Daichi to do some godlike receives" off the list. Shit was impressive. Still waiting for Nishinoya.

Well. Oikawa's serves were fucking monsters if we got by the reactions of the characters. Still waiting for him to score with them tho and I guess Asahi got his spotlight with Nishinoya already.

The Yachi one was actually a joke but I guess her being scared of those serves is a good replacement.

We might also add

* Mad Dog-chan fucking shit up
* Mad Dog-chan working with Seijoh

to the list.

His "entrance" was just.... I actually just wanna say: Fuck that guy. He is scary as fuck.^^^^butpleasefuckKarasunooverwithyourbehavior

Can't wait for next episode!

Holy flamingos the SAKUGA this episode was insane, and two moments at that.

Do it. I played back in HS, hadn't played in 7 years, but started playing pick-up games every thursday. I'm getting in some practice time before the local league my friend is in has their signups in Sept. I'm so happy I started playing again.

Jesus that serve. Those can travel up to 120km/h yikes.

I was expecting Kyoken to join the game on second set, assuming Karasuno would take the first one and Kyoken would get mad etc. (hehi no puns intended)

It seems like it will be another three set match. I'm very excited!

Obviously every episode is great, but damn, that was a fantastic episode. The animation was so freakin' hype...

Something tells me this new guy is gonna end up fucking things up for the team since he can't work together with them - which is one of Johsai's strengths: working together.

damn this episode was so intense.

Man the animation really went a step above the usual level of amazing quality. I was actually taken aback at the sudden intensity of it all.

I'm quite looking forward to the finale of this season despite knowing the end-result just because I want to see everything get animated. The quality in this show is simply amazing.

I made some gifs of the nice animation for funsies. :3

 Wow! This was intense. I never knew volleyball could be this fun.

I don't know whether I want this game to go for three sets so I could watch more, or end 2-0 in favour or Karasuno because I don't think my heart can manage

this episode was so awesome with the jump toss and the decoys (dude hinata and tanaka certainly looked like they were gonna hit it!) and then it was all Asahi and boom!

and oikawa's explosive serve that was far too strong -- that i also wanted to try and receive! damn!

and what about that funny bit where one of seijoh's members tried to hit on (heh) dear yachi? HA!

such a good episode. can't believe we're only getting like 5 or 6 episodes left til the end of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
That trumpet, god... that ending ost. It was glorious. Please MORE!
>> ARTICLE
Mad Dog-chan be like "Move bitch get out the way!!!"

can't wait when he develops feels :D
>> ARTICLE
So generic /s
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did that serve send shivers down spines? Still recovering from this episode. WOOH!
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for Yamaguchi's jump float serve to finally work! *it will, right?*
>> ARTICLE
Oh look Oikawa's less evil now.... oh wait he isn't.

Karasuno's significantly better at receiving now.

No wait, Karasuno is significantly better overall compared to their last match with Seijou.

Kiyoko is a strong independent woman!

LMao @ Mattsun's dopey face when he's blocking Hinata.

Why do bad things always happen to Kindaichi? xD

If they're scared of Oikawa's powerful serves, how much more with Ushiwaka's spikes...
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa's serve actually made me stop breathing for a few seconds; I was in that much awe. So well animated. <3

Also, does anyone happen to know the song when Oikawa served at the beginning of the match? (Around 8:50)
>> ARTICLE
My lord... this episode has everything I love about Haikyuu. The gags, the reaction faces, the blood pumping adrenaline and Oikawa. Especially Oikawa. I've never loved an 'antagonist' in an anime so much. He's cocky, arrogant, petty, childish and acts like a complete fool, but DAMN is he a monster on the court. That new monstrously powerful and fast serve blew my fucking mind with excitement. OIKAWA YOU DAMN LOVABLE TRASH YOU
>> ARTICLE
Found the quality of the episode quite strange.

Yes there was those freaking gorgeous moments but damn it is laking a bit of quality right now and even the other episodes have a lack of the detail season 1 had.
Maybe they are putting all the money in the last episodes?

Edit: Reddit community always will be so bitter! Yeah downvote me for having a opinion.
>> ARTICLE
The *longest* buildup to one of the most satisfying hero moments in the entire series. 

Yamaguchi, nice serve!

Holding back the reserve players in the waiting area wasn't in the manga and was a brilliant touch, haha. I also think Tsukki's tiny smile when he picks up the ball was an addition, too, and one of my favourites so far.

Same, the buildup before his first serve gave me goosebumps!

The way they toned down the OST and the crowd, so we can only hear the volleyball, the squeaks of his shoes and his breathing, it really emphasized that Yamaguchi was in **THE FUCKING ZONE**. Just a perfect scene.

Oh god really?

Yes, they have *plenty* enough of time to wrap it all up.

They're running out of awesome stuff to adapt awesomely, that's all.

Not really, but what is the anime going to do when the manga is drawing out single matches to arches?
>> ARTICLE
Right, that's what I'm saying. They're running out of manga material to animate and having been doing a great job of it so far that it's better that it goes away for a couple of years till the manga catches up.

I don't think that's possible with this show.

I'm still not sure if he's angry. He could just be absurdly intense and putting literally every inch of that intensity into his hits.

An episode I was really looking forward to...[Yamaguchi's own episode!](http://i.imgur.com/Nvtl80c.jpg) (at least it felt like that)

I really wanted an episode where he can do what he didn't manage to do last time and it was even better than I expected. [This face](http://i.imgur.com/fdCrxyt.jpg) was worth the waiting! 

[The guys cheering on him](http://i.imgur.com/UJ4Ctla.jpg) were great!

[Noya and Hinata couldn't contain themselves!](http://i.imgur.com/XhP1QvR.jpg). I like how on that scene as well as [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Lgswgnw.jpg) the others had to hold them back and cover their ears :P

I love how they continue to show us Aoba Josai and how badly they also need to win this match. If they lost that 2nd round, that would be the end of their 3rd yrs' journeys, and would be just as devastated as Karasuno's 3rd yrs. And simultaneously using Oikawa's serve to both show us how far Yamaguchi has come and how far he has to go...you can't help but be strongly attached to both teams


edit: also,


hinata: yamaguchi, get 10 points! 

yamaguchi: that'd end the match... 

hinata: I'd forgive you


!!!!

This is simultaneously why I love the show and why it also breaks my heart. I love that we get the perspectives of the other characters and teams; this show makes you want to cheer for EVERYONE. And at the same time, that means that no matter who wins, you're going to be sad. Every victory is bittersweet. I really want Karasuno to win, but I also really feel for Aoba Johsai and don't want the third years to go out with a losing match. Either way, there will be tears!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, Yamaguchi almost took down Aoba Johsai *single handedly*. 
>> ARTICLE
Five points in a row versus that team, can't get any more badass than that.
>> ARTICLE
Well if he made one more they'd won the game that would be more badass in my book.

Well simple math yeah, but I imagine there is no other team that can claim to score so many points in a row against Aoba Johsai (except Shiratorizawa probably).

I feel legitimately bad for anyone not watching this show

That was an amazing episode
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching a couple weeks ago, and now I have an awesome reason to get hyped every saturday morning. It's so exciting!
>> ARTICLE
Same. They have no idea what they're missing.
>> ARTICLE
Only feel bad for the ones that just haven't come across it yet. Laughing at the ones who think sports anime are beneath them, as they continue to try and struggle to find a slice of life as feel good as Haikyuu with characters no where near as great.
>> ARTICLE
There's some pretty good slice of life(s) too. But I watch slice of life for sweet relaxing moments. I can't even breathe when I watch Haikyuu. I watch Haikyuu to get hyped. It just different genre for different feelings.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, most sports anime come from sports manga. For sports manga to be successful it usually has to have some kind of ridiculous gimmick. Just look at all of the other Shounen Jump sports manga; the ones that are successful made it into more of a battle manga. Eyeshield had the crazy battle effects to show off the moves and plays they were doing. Kuroko had made up abilities and lightning eyes. Prince of Tennis actually had a character whose tennis hits would blind people.

Haikyuu is the first Jump sports manga (to my knowledge) to find real sustained success without taking away from the realism of the sport. Most other successful sports manga are just run in different serializations and so they don't get as much publicity. Without the publicity they don't get an anime. I'm happy the long running ones are being rewarded, tho. It has made for an almost golden age of great series (Baby Steps, Daiya no A, Yowapeda, Ping Pong).
>> ARTICLE
Daiya no ace is pretty much that as well. Good characters and very realistic baseball. Sure they exaggerate hits here and there but it's essentially about as real as it gets. 
Major had the Gyroball (lol) and One outs was literally 10 different change ups pretty much despite also being great baseball anime. 
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that this isn't a generic sports anime. It's actually pretty realistic like some baseball animes. But why I love haikyuu and what's sets it apart is the way it develops characters and emotions. The manga is great but the studio has done a phenomenal job with the amazing animation, the great voice acting, and an excellent choice in music. The show is one of the best regardless of genre imo.
>> ARTICLE
People automatically put down most sports anime. I know i did until recently. Now sports is my favourite genre.
>> ARTICLE
Starting slam dunk I think sports changed for me.

I didn't like them before but slam dunk along side kuroku changed that for me.
>> ARTICLE
I thought they were pretty bad as well. Then, my friend put Kuroko on the screen cuz all of us had nothing to do after class. We got to like episode 8 in one sitting lol. 

Diamond no Ace, Kuroko no Baske, and Haikyuu are the only ones I've seen. And they're damn good.
>> ARTICLE
I got started with "Baby Steps" and Haikyuu is my second sports anime. I suppose you could count Initial D which I watched ages ago as it was airing, but I wouldn't count it.

I've tried to find others that I would genuinely enjoy using MAL but it's really hard. I should probably give Kuroko a shot, and even though I know sports anime are more about the characters than the actual sport, I still can't see myself getting into Diamond no Ace.

Even though I f****** love Haikyuu and have zero interest in volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is pretty mediocre as far as the genre goes, IMO. Well executed, but after a while kind of repeats itself and gets a little out of hand with ridiculous superpower moves.

Here's a couple of recommendations - 

* Hajime no Ippo (just an absolute classic)
* Major - not that great, but solid and consistent throughout
* Cross game
* Diamond no ace (you should really try it)
* Ookiku Furikabutte (interesting take, where the team usually plays smart with mediocre players)
>> ARTICLE
IMO the twists in Kuroko were expected but fun to watch with the animations
>> ARTICLE
Boy does being turned off by baseball limit your options when it comes to sport.
>> ARTICLE
I would never watch baseball in real life. But good anime makes it much more interesting and personal. I mean, I would never watch volleyball IRL either
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, i've watched some clips and it still feels more "in the zone" than baseball. Watching a spike setup is so exhilarating. 

>> ARTICLE
I hated baseball for the longest time. Then I got introduced to advanced metrics and now baseball is an all consuming passion that has led me to be able to name most of the players in the Mets organization down to the AA level.

Truly a 10 out of 10 season. This show is so good. I look forward to every episode.
>> ARTICLE
That was the best episode yet! Yamaguchi's moment to shine was so bright! I'm so happy for him. He talked about the difference in experience between him and Oikawa and that made me excited thinking about how good Yamaguchi would be when he became a third year. The opponents that Karasuno faces are all so likeable, but this Karasuno team is sooo damn likeable. The way they cheer each other on and celebrate each point and each personal victory is the best. It made it even better when Yamaguchi scored his first point, Karasuno was cheering so loudly while the people in the stands were asking why they were so excited about "just one point."  And let's not forget Tanaka's guidance as an upperclassman to Yamaguchi after Yamaguchi felt like down about not winning the set. Tanaka may not see himself as a capable captain next year, but him and Nishinoya are definitely the spirit of this team and will be great third years to lead the next team. Although I want Karasuno to win, I'm kinda glad that this match is going to a third set. It would have felt a bit anticlimactic(? I dunno if that's the right word) if they just beat their toughest opponent in a 2-0 sweep. I'm super hyped for the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree about Tanaka and Noshinoya being the spirit of the team! Tanaka encouraging Yamaguchi brought a tear to my eye. :') What a great senpai moment.

As a current volleyball player, this series as a whole has been a trip. Hell, this series made me motivated to join the university club team. If that doesnt show how moving this show can be, I don't know what will.

Literally every moment of this show I've experienced one way or another, and it recreates the same feelings I had on the high school volleyball team. By far my favorite anime thus far.

I cannot wait to see the final game of the match next week.

>> ARTICLE
Finally seeing Yamaguchi rule with his serves is so awesome. Also love the addition of Tsukki smiling when he was picking up the ball to hand to Yams. Fantastic episode.

Also we have [the spear](http://i.imgur.com/SeKgahW.png) which I don't remember being in the manga. Incredibly happy to see that.

[YAMAGUCHI!](http://i.imgur.com/jMpDz5P.jpg) I literally can't even!

That first serve was executed just perfectly. [The tension](http://i.imgur.com/h6fR0NW.jpg), [the silence](http://i.imgur.com/JshYbHQ.jpg), [the heartbeat](http://i.imgur.com/mtpQGIX.jpg), and then [everyone's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/YLf7tZC.jpg) was one of the most [satisfying moments](http://i.imgur.com/E2XgyrK.jpg) I've ever experienced while watching anime. In just one serve there was a story. A story of Yamaguchi's struggles, his doubts, his dedication, his hard work, [and Shimada's faith in him](http://i.imgur.com/p9OBlvF.jpg). 

Holy fuck. So much hype, so much awesome, and it's not even a finale yet!

[Only 3episodes left...](https://yametekudasaii.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ss-2014-10-09-at-12-28-32.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
My friends who are waiting to binge watch this season are saying "Ugh. Still 3 episodes left"
>> ARTICLE
Nooooooo... D:

I wasn't keeping track of that and I thought there were plenty more episodes to come...
>> ARTICLE
I've calculated that in order for there to be enough material for Season 3 of Haikyuu, it still needs 20 more chapters. 26 episodes of each season needed about 70 chapters. And there's 50 or so chapters that should be around after this season is over. So I hope the wait isn't *too* long until the 3rd season (26 episodes). 
>> ARTICLE
There are extra chapters too, they can use them. At least it's pretty sure that we'll get 3rd season.

[manga spoilers](/s "i cant wait for shiratorizawa match and fukurodani vs nekoma")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "Fukurdani vs nekoma was like 4 chapters. im pretty sure they will animate the 3rd place Tokyo match cuz it seems to be the most important match for nekoma atm(last chance for nationals). Also they have to introduce us the team that Fukurdani are going to face in the finals cuz they are favorites to win nationals and they have the best spiker in Japan.")
>> ARTICLE
Could be sort of filler, if they just make the whole match, instead of just skipping around.
>> ARTICLE
[Some serious manga spoilers](/n "Honestly they could make the Karasuno-Shiratorizawa match into a whole movie as opposed to dedicating a season and a half to it considering how long it is.")
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing. It would probably fit good into a two hour movie as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Or its own mini season 2.5. 
>> ARTICLE
Shame that Yamaguchi's epic serves didn't end up mattering for the overall result (they lost the set anyway), but it was still great seeing him shine.

Now how the hell am I supposed to wait an entire week for the start of the third set?
>> ARTICLE
It shifted the momentum of the match. Now everyone is feeling more confident.
>> ARTICLE
Besides, now Yamaguchi can come in for the 3rd set and just sweep it. Or at least get his promised ten points.
>> ARTICLE
> Shame that Yamaguchi's epic serves didn't end up mattering for the overall result

It did matter a lot though! It's so different to lose the 2nd at 28-26 from losing it at 25-18 or something. (Besides, story-wise, we all know Hinata and Kageyama too have to have their time against Daiou-sama!)
>> ARTICLE
And just 3 episodes left :( OST amazing as always.

I love the fact that the studio is faithful to the manga (except from some tweaks, but nothing big) and how they are able to transmit all the feelings perfectlly to the audience, nice Production IG!

This episode covered from chapter 136 up to chapter 139.

I sure hope the same level of hype in the OST will translate into Boku no Hero Academia.

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON.

It was AMAZING. I was screaming Yamaguchi through the entire thing. 

And holy crap what is the ost of this anime? Incredible!
>> ARTICLE
Is the ost for the new season out yet?
>> ARTICLE
Not yet, sadly. Volume 1 goes on sale March 16, and volume 2 on April 20. The [covers](http://okmusic.jp/#!/images/news/1069581) are out tho 
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved that ending of Daichi's and Oikawa's respective monologues. The Difficult opponent vs The Troublesome ones. How Seijou were meant to be out of their league and Kurasnoo beneath them yet despite everything, both are being pushed to their absolute limits. 

I'm not ready for this show to end.
>> ARTICLE
Spurs - Arsenal, Bayern - Dortmund, Karasuno - Aoba Johsai, the Nail-biting is off the charts today for me.

So great to see Yamaguchi being the hero, even if it went to the third set in the end. Didn't expect anything other than the full distance anyway.

Aoba Johsai is just such an experienced and cool team, staying calm after losing 4 points, [even the neutrals in the show can't help but want both teams to succeed.](http://i.imgur.com/2yjsalM.gif)

 
>> ARTICLE
Haha tied games everywhere. Today was an intense day.
>> ARTICLE
haha not even neutrals, they're aoba johsai fans.

(i lied, actually they're me, i want to cheer for both teams)

and they become Yamaguchi's harem after this match

The day has come where I can say this:

Yamaguchi. Nice serve.

:*)
>> ARTICLE
the best episode of this season! i've been waiting for this episode to air for a long time! 
>> ARTICLE
> But apparently We're fated to play to the fullest

I FUCKING WOULDNT HAVE IT ANY OTHER FUCKING WAY. FUCKING LETS GOOO
>> ARTICLE
Seeing the girls from Season 1 cheer for Yamaguchi was the cherry on top of that amazing serve. I've waited a year to see that serve and i'm so happy with how it turned out animated.
>> ARTICLE
The whole episode is perfect, I don't have to point out every scene that I liked since I'd end up writing the whole episode.

Remember when Yamaguchi was just Tsukki's weak-willed sidekick who makes fun of Kageyama and Hinata? Look how far he had come! 

I really liked the comparison between Yamaguchi and Oikawa' serves. It shows us how important serving is.
>> ARTICLE
Being an avid manga reader and watching this show from the very beginning I honestly hate how I get the feels from watching the first half of the episode. All the Yamaguchi action hit me so hard. I wish Karasuno had won in 2 instead of going to 3. But the comparisons from the manga to the anime are still just as amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I actually cried. YAMAGUCHIIIIII, YOU GLORIOUS BASTARD.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought they were gonna run away with the win. Nope, they play the rivals card. Nekoma is displeased.

Yamaguchi's was this episode's MVP but Tsukki was freakin amazing too. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope some of the kids that wants to play volleyball watch this anime, it really teaches a lot, maybe this episode is the best example, a guy who doesn't have so much speed, high vertical leap, or a powerful spike, but still works hard because of the sport he loves so much. Even though he only have one weapon which is serving, that doesn't stop him to be a better player. Actually, it is a great weapon because that's the only way in volleyball where you can literally win all by yourself, I mean you can score 25 straight service aces and you win. :P (btw, I hope Kazuhito Narita and Hisashi Kinoshita will have there own chance to play in a game)
>> ARTICLE
even though I already read the manga I can't help but smile and feel what their feeling this is a very well adapted anime by Production IG 3 episodes left.
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "You think they're going to go with a cliffhanger ending? Assuming they dedicate the entire next episode for the third set vs Seijoh, I don't see them finishing the BO5 vs Shiratorizawa within 2 episodes. But then again I don't know what they'd do with the last 2 episodes if they decide not to adapt the final.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "No way the final will start this season. I mean the whole match about as long as everymatch up until the win over Aoba Josei. For season 3 the final might even make up the whole first cour")

Not OP, but most likely

God damn, Yamaguchi. Almost on level of Tadokoro from Shokugeki. You beautiful bastard.
>> ARTICLE
>Almost
>> ARTICLE
Lets be real, its gonna take a lot to beat Tadokoro's qualification in the group stage
>> ARTICLE
So I was at work (night front desk at an assisted living facility) and I totally was all "hell yeah" when Yamaguchi kicked major butt. This is probably the nerdiest thing I have ever done in public.

So much fun gif potential in this episode. The show continues to be great as it heads towards the finale of the match.

Yamaguchi, I waited so long to see this episode, my baby ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi for the win! This match had me on the edge of my seat! 
>> ARTICLE
Yes!!! Yamaguchi!! Finally! This episode is such an epic moment to show his incredible jump float serve. I couldn't help but cry at that moment. Even though I have read this scene over and over again in the manga, the animation's really pull all the emotion in me. I love how quiet everything is during that first serve. The only sound was only Yamaguchi and ball's movement. What an incredible moment. 

 And as usual, the low key (no pun intended) supportive Tsukishima Kei always amazing. After all, he is the one who knows the best how many nights Yamaguchi spends practicing this serve since they usually got home together. I also love how they show the bond between Hinata and Yamaguchi. Next time, 10 points! 

Now, the last set. We definitely don't want either team lose. As Kindaichi reminds us in this episode, if Seijoh lose, this match is going to be the last match for their third years. But at same it's also going to be last one's for Karasuno's third years. Too bad Miyagi only has one team to represent their district :(

I loved how everyone on the side encouraged Yamaguchi.

Holy crap that episode hit me right in the feels. Not the sad kind though. It was some combination of fulfillment and satisfaction. What a great episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi, nice serves! I knew you had it in ya. 
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode was top notch, especially with the soundtrack ! It hyped me a little more to listen the full soundtrack and what Yki Hayashi will do for Boku No Hero Academia !!
>> ARTICLE
I am so freaking hyped!

Seriously, I am loving riding the weekly hype train with everybody here, but I am also super excited when the season ends and I binge both seasons as hard as possible.

Then the post Haikyu depression will start where I wonder what to do with my life and how quickly Season 3 might realistically come out.

Anyway, in addition to how awesome this rivals battle is, I also keep thinking how much I want to see the Battle at the Garbage Dump! But I also want Johsai to get the chance to beat Shiratorizawa!

Arrghh!!!! Haikyu! Why do you have to make me feel feelings?!
>> ARTICLE
So, did anyone else notice how Tsukki protected the back of his head when Yamaguchi went for his first serve? Like.... you actually showed that you trust him, Tsukki, why did you protect the back of your head? I am disappointed.

And wow, Yamaguchi already has 3 fangirls. Good job.
>> ARTICLE
But after Yamaguchi successful first serve, Tsukki stops putting his hand at the back of his head. I thought it was a nice subtle thing to show that Yamaguchi's not the same coward that he used to be and Tsukki fully trusts him now.

yamaguchi! ;_; everyone is so moved by his serves!

and did anyone else catch the preview for the next episode? it's got some yachi x yamaguchi goodness in it. (seriously, a coffin?!)

additionally, can someone make a full version of that amazing side-by-side of seijoh and karasuno by the end? :D

DAYUM. Never expected to tear up a bit watching a sports anime... 

Yamaguchi's first service made me so happy. The build up was not wasted at all. It was so, sooooo good to see him finally get this right. Holy shit. I was smiling like an idiot for most of the episode after that.

Never felt so much emotion in me from a sports anime my God...

Anyone know what chapter this episode is in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
What an amazing episode......Couldn't contain my tears for Yamaguchi!!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this show always anticipates my concerns before they come to anything. 

>Concern: "Their quick is great, but they need more ways to win"

Hinata realizes the same thing.

>Concern: "It would be kind of cheap if Hinata and Kageyama suddenly just got stronger without struggle"

It really takes them some time to figure themselves out.

>Concern: "What about the rest of the team though"

It shows everyone else also trying new things.

>Concern: "Tsukishima is kind of being pushed aside"

Tsukishima-based episode.
>> ARTICLE
That only means that the people behind the anime are very aware of not only the material they are adapting (not the Haikyuu Manga but manga in general) but also of how it will be seen by us viewers and what questions will be brought up by every piece of information the episode gives us, that way they can perfectly place the events in the story to keep us interested. 
This kind of ability only comes with lots of experience which means years and years of work. 


tl;dr version: The people behind this anime know their shit
>> ARTICLE
They're definitely doing a good job of getting the foreshadowing across

Don't spoil things for those that haven't read the manga. That's just incredibly shitty behavior. If you want to post manga spoilers use the spoiler tag that's why it's there.

[Dude...](/s "Tsukki became ESSENTIAL for Karasuno after his character development. He became a cornerstone in one major aspect of Karasuno's game.")
>> ARTICLE
Well I am glad to hear that!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like he will get mad and almost leave, then his brother will be like "I was sad, but I was so much more happy that I cared" or something like that and he'll be all sentimental and return to the team pretending hes not much different but reluctantly asking for help behind the scenes to improve.
>> ARTICLE
Considering we got a glimpse of the real reason he plays volleyball, I think he'll only come out of this experience loving it (because he doesn't right now) and will try to improve himself, like the rest of the team is doing.
>> ARTICLE
That would be *really pathetic*.
>> ARTICLE
Second favourite character development in the series is coming up. I'm so excited for the feels train 8D

Who has your favorite development, Kageyama?

Kageyama has definitely developed a lot, but it's actually [spoilers without going into too much detail](/s "Tsukishima again because he undergoes even more character development in the recent manga chapters").
>> ARTICLE
Thats pretty cool. I think my favorite thing about Haikyuu is that all the characters are likable. I'll probably start reading the manga here soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend reading the manga, it's fantastic. Enjoy :)
>> ARTICLE
 Is it completed?
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, I read and watched KnB before I got into Haikyuu and while it was good I felt like all the characters on Seinin except Kuroko and Kagami were just completely uninteresting. They just felt like extra characters that were there simply because you need 5 players on a bball team.

Haikyuu manages to flesh out its characters very well both those on karasuno and even on the others teams. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked Tepei and Hyouga on Serin, that being said my favorite side characters were probably on Shutoko(?) or Kise's team. I think all the characters are awesome in Haikyuu though, and that is one of the reasons I like it more than kuroko. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only person that didn't care at all about Tepei. I did like Hyouga & Riko though. I just irks me that they had so many of characters on Seirin, but there was zero to them except an occasional joke. I liked Akashi's team the best. Think they had the most interesting characters since all 5 managed to be really unique interesting characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck. Episode was aces as usual, but that jazz piano BGM when they are running up the hill. Way to step up your game, Haikyu.
>> ARTICLE
The best running-up-a-hill-after-losing-your=practice-match music that I've ever heard!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that scenes music was so on point and original
>> ARTICLE
how the hell do people get by only watching 1 episode per week. I marathoned season 1 when I first discovered it, and again last week after I found out s2 was airing. Now the wait between episodes is killing me.. especially now since Tsukishima is my favorite/the most relatable character. zzz   
If anyone reads this and also reads the manga is it worth it to just say fuck it and start reading or do you think it would be a bit ruined not seeing things for the first time in glorious animation?   
edit: started reading, when I read certain parts like "one touch" and whatnot during the games I can hear the anime VA in my head shouting the line and the soundtrack starts playing as well so I think it worked out quite nicely that I watched part of the anime beforehand lol. thanks for the help friends, glad I started reading but already getting sad that I'm close to the end of the manga :p
>> ARTICLE
nah, it's cool if you read it while watching it. it just hypes you up for what's in store for the anime. :)

my only problem with the manga is that even if there's a new one every week, i find it hard to keep track of what's currently happening. but that's probably just me. haikyuu makes for an addicting binge-reading though.
>> ARTICLE
If you start to read the manga, then you will only end up in another series of week-long waits when you reach the head of the story.
>> ARTICLE
True pain is getting one chapter a week. With 20-ish pages. Smack-bang in the middle of a match. 

Personally, there's no way I feel that a scene is in anyway ruined just because I know what's coming. If anything, it enhances the experience. 

>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be 302 by the time the Shiratorizawa match ends.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga week before last and I have to say Read it! I was worried it would take away the excitement of seeing everything animated for the first time like I've had happen with other things I've read, but it hasn't at all. I'm even more excited for each episode than I was before. Yeah you already know what's happening, but it's still as awesome. I don't regret picking it up at all. Now would also be a great time to start since this coming week is the last chapter to the current arc so you won't be catch up when it's right in the middle. 

It actually makes things better because now each week I get double Haikyuu. Friday there's a new chapter of Haikyuu & Saturday there's a new episode. 
>> ARTICLE
For me, I read the manga before the anime ever started so I was always excited to see everything come together and hear what the VAs had to offer, the soundtrack, animation, and everything else always makes me thrilled when a new episode came out. It still does and honestly the manga gets me hyped in a completely different way. 

I'd say go for it, the manga really does some great things and while you won't ever be shocked, you'll be excited and waiting for them to do your favorite parts. IE: Bokuto, Akaashi, and Kuroo are some of my favorite characters so today's episode made me super hyped to see them even though I'm sure someone that's anime only would just think they were cool dudes and not have as much of an impact. 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has a really underrated soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
Just a general recommendation to listen to Galileo Galilei's other music (they do the ED)

Since seeing their OP for anohana I looked into all their music and they are no joke my favorite band of all time now
>> ARTICLE
Yeah last week's episode had great music too, so I went and found the season one OST immediately after.
>> ARTICLE
 If you can tell me the name of the track that played when Hinata practiced with coach Ukai, that would be awesome. EDIT: Oh you said season one, nvm.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think it's underrated and that's not me saying it's not good, it's actually in my top 3 OSTs but people definitely acknowledge the soundtrack of this show and how good it is
>> ARTICLE
I *LOVE* THE SOUNDTRACK SO MUCH. I feel that along with the animation and my darling baby characters (and the plot of course) it elevates the anime by a million. One particular instance is the end of episode 17 and the soundtrack there is just *gorgeous* and perfectly encapsulates and even *elevates* the moment. (Track 23 of OST Part 2) 
:') 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's really unique as far as anime soundtracks go. 
>> ARTICLE
The jazz piano BGM was so legit.

I was slightly taken back when i heard it. It was that good.

One of my favorite moments of this arc!! I CAN'T WAIT!!
>> ARTICLE
[That moment they both realised the other is changing](http://i.imgur.com/zD5oYcq.jpg) was great!

[Asahi's aura](http://i.imgur.com/vULrLkz.jpg) was so fierce even [Hinata realised what's up](http://i.imgur.com/7fXOazL.jpg). I liked how the girls were relieved at what happened.

Yamaguchi [asking Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/0YQxQRI.jpg) was really nice. It really felt like he wanted to somehow help Tsukishima and encourage him but wasn't sure how to go about it.

Also, next time seems like we'll see [a little Tsukki](http://i.imgur.com/sENdMqY.png) <3
>> ARTICLE
Im exited for when kags and Hinata really come together again. I miss their interaction :/
>> ARTICLE
It made it so much more striking that Hinata went into his "badass eyes mode", and yet Asahi's determination was even more powerful.
>> ARTICLE
I love the whole licking his lips thing Hinata does. His primal desire is to just hit any free ball.
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of the famous [Messi is a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDsztJOgqUg) video
>> ARTICLE
ive decided the 2 things i love most about this show are the focus on practice rather than games

and the eyes. i feel like the eyes in haikyuu tell the viewer a lot of what a character is thinking or feeling 
>> ARTICLE
Tsukishima's thoughts are totally relatable. It's easy to lose motivation to do something if it feels like a waste of time and you're being overshadowed by someone else. He seems like a very externally motivated guy. Rather than seeking self-improvement, he wants results. If he thinks those results aren't going to happen even with a ton of effort, then there's no reason to put in any effort at all. Couple this with the inferiority he feels toward Hinata.

Yamaguchi still thinks Tsukishima likes volleyball though. Without that, it'd be very hard to get out of this rut.
>> ARTICLE
He has to realise he has potential as a blocker though.
>> ARTICLE
this episode felt especially short!!! all buildup, no climax :(
>> ARTICLE
I believe the term is edging 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. The moment where Azumane establishes dominance was a quiet high point. The last time I felt that flutter of excitement was seeing the picture/poster of Hinata back in episode 3. As hungry and ambitious as Hinata is, the ace can still put him in check with his presence alone. It's a pretty sharp contrast to the Azumane I'm used to seeing.
>> ARTICLE
>It's a pretty sharp contrast to the Azumane I'm used to seeing.

yep, a great reminder than hinata and kags aren't the only ones that are evolving. he's definitely not the asahi we saw in season one.
>> ARTICLE
But that just means they pay off will be all that much greater!
>> ARTICLE
And it looks like Tsukishima has more issues than just "I don't really care about volleyball that much", so I like how they took time to set up his real inner conflict.
>> ARTICLE
Damn seriously these episodes just get better and better. Tsukishima starting to develop into the fully grown crow he deserves to be. As the weeks go on I find myself enjoying these training montage episode more because they all have so much inner struggle. But when all the pieces get put together in the coming weeks be sure for an explosive ending to the season.
>> ARTICLE
The ED for this show is possibly my favorite I've ever seen. It matches the show so perfectly in tone and feels so beautifully emotional. The ended picture with Hinata soaring above the rest of the team as the song comes to a close is just so amazing, I'm sure why I love it so much but it just gets me every time. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, I get goosebumps every time it gets to the part where Hinata soars and the rest of the team looks up at him.

*Shivers*
>> ARTICLE
I actually like that they don't simply improve over night, but have to struggle to make even a bit of progress. Sometimes shows will just randomly throw new techniques seemingly out of nowhere at you. Can't wait to see it all pay off. 

[Kuroo is a damn solid blocker.](http://i.imgur.com/RVSGc07.gif)

[This scene was so well done,](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9904/10-087.0/compressed/c010-011.jpg) finally Karasuno's ace has found his will to become the ace that the team needed. Tsukishima is starting to find what he really wants, but something is pulling him down... Luckily, he has some people who want to [Help him <3](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/68/df/57/68df578d0fd8ba0f8bf5e4903f429bf6.jpg). Overall a nice amount of character development and a pretty fun episode. Next week is gonna be awesome ;).

PS: This week episode covered chapters 85, 86 and 87 up to page 16.

Thanks man, I wanted to start reading the manga after this episode.

You're in for one hell of a ride, it's my fave manga of all time

Tsukishima, literally the polar opposite foil of Hinata. Tall to Hinata's short; smart to Hinata's dumb; disinterested to Hinata's passionate; moon to Hinata's sun. Yet, like it's been said, he's essential to the team, just as Hinata is. I haven't read the manga yet, so I am very excited to see how Tsukishima develops as a character

\#1 anime this season that is making me smile all the time.

Seriously, they are a happy-go-merry squad that is COOL.

I kind of find it hilarious how all the teams except for Nekoma have an attractive female manager. Kinda puts Tanaka's Doppelganger's (I forget his name) outburst last season into context. Also Yachi OP as fucking always.

I love Kuroo. What a great character.

And can't wait for Tsukki's development!

I hadn't really paid a whole lot of attention to him before this episode, but I really like him now. The face he made when blocked Bokuto's spike was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
That climbing hill metaphor though...

Oh Tsukki...

Also a wild Akiteru appears!

EDIT: Oh my god, that motherfucking preview.

Oh my god oh my god

I seriously cannot handle this right now 
>> ARTICLE
Oh god I've waited this long for Akiteru why does it feel like I can't go another week without him
>> ARTICLE
I like the truth that they didn't perfect their training quickly makes it feel much more realistic than Kuroko no basket(still love it though), every week i forget why i was so hyped for the next episode and this show just keeps on reminding me why.
>> ARTICLE
Watch slam Dunk. Amateur MC had to literally shot 10,000 jumps shots aside from the basic skills training.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love slam dunk man, I watched long time ago though but man that was one my anime gate openers and brings me nostalgia thinking about it 
>> ARTICLE
I really love the [little things](http://i.imgur.com/1oZpndZ.jpg?1) that other characters sometimes do in the background. Obviously... Asahi needs a lot of work on his serves
>> ARTICLE
The character interactions are sooo good. I love how all the different teams talk like friends, it's so much more reasonable than what you usually get in sports anime. 

Also I'm so hype for when Karasuno pulls together (including tsukki).
>> ARTICLE
Tsukki's development is probably the longest and most extensively written and is only slight eclipsed by Kageyama and Hinata. The current arc in the manga just screams of Tsukki. Love that guy.
>> ARTICLE
Really looking forward to the beginnings of Yamaguchi's development that we'll see kick off next episode. One of my favorite characters in Haikyuu!!, and we're going to be seeing some really great scenes with him soon. 
>> ARTICLE
welcome to Tsukiyama hell everyone

I bet I could watch this whole season in an hour, since every episode feels like it's 5 min :(((

God, seeing this animated just feels more heartbreaking than reading it. Poor Tsukki. Very well done though. 

Also Asahi finally acting like an ace is so fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, this is anime is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Hinata thirsty for that [ball](http://puu.sh/llGpq.jpg) as always
>> ARTICLE
It looks like one of, if not the biggest hurdle for Tsukishima is Hinata and his growth so my guess is there is going to be some sort of parallel between Tsukishima's brother and The Little Giant which will help Tsukishima adjust and settle in better with the rest of the team.
>> ARTICLE
Really happy they are putting some development on some smaller characters in this show.
>> ARTICLE
TSUKI IS THE BEST
>> ARTICLE
Feel like we're seeing less of Daichi in terms of him trying to improve/evolve.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but Tanaka isn't really getting much either.  The most they are doing is the synchronized attack.  I think the author realized he can't spend that much time on each character and focuses on certain things. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that was a comment on Tsukishima. They even show a single shot of Tsukishima after Nekoyama's coach's comment on Karusuno's development except *one* person's.
>> ARTICLE
It was a comment on Tsukishima, but I have to agree with the above commenter about how we don't see Daichi doing anything different, really. He's a very solid player and arguably one of the most dependable on team so I don't think there's a terrible need for improvement, but he is the captain which means he has to be on the court at all times and could benefit from it. 
>> ARTICLE
Daichi's one of my favorite characters in the series, so I feel your frustrations there--I will say, as a manga reader, that he is probably the only Karasuno team member who doesn't have that focus on improving/evolving (Tanaka probably would be second in that regard). However, Daichi is set apart in that he's considered incredibly mature emotionally/mentally wise (for the most part) considering he's a high schooler. Ukai Jr often comments on how Daichi's much better with the motivating/inspiring speeches. 

Also as a manga reader/Daichi fan: I am incredibly excited for certain scenes involving Daichi in the manga to be animated. I'm not sure if they will be this season, but I cannot wait for their eventually adaptation. 

Of course, I'm talking about [Chapters](/s "117-121+, with Daichi's *mini* injury and the aftermath.") 
>> ARTICLE
It's crushing to see the team lose all their games again but damn it's fun to watch them slowly improve. I only watch the anime so it'll be nice to see tsukishima's backstory next week.
>> ARTICLE
[I really love how everything that they are trying to learn](/s "all comes into play when the official matches finally started.")

[Karasuno practically...](/s "acquired all the strengths/techniques of all the teams they've practiced with (except for Nekoma) in the training camp and incorporated it in their play style. The pay-off in their official matches was so satisfying.")

These dudes from the other prefectures will probably be shocked when they finally see each other again in the Nationals.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see a full game right now so badly. It's going to be awesome when all these improvements finally bare fruit. Why must you make me wait Haikyuu?! 
>> ARTICLE
Loved the jazz bit as they were running up the hill. Can't wait for the evolution to be completed!! And hopefully Tsukishima catches up too
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully Tsukishima will become equal to some of the other blockers we have seen. And some background on his brother and such will be pretty cool if he was part of the team with the 'Little Giant'     
So sad I have to wait a week at a time unlike when I watched the first season in a few sittings. Always one of the highlights of Saturday evening.
>> ARTICLE
can someone link that piano BGM? it was fucking sick...

Episodes with action and character development are always the best. The short glimpse of kid Tsukishima already seems like a polar opposite. gaaaaaaaahh next episode now please I wanna know why.
>> ARTICLE
next episode, we get to see a chibi!Tsukki. oh man, i can't wait.

i love how everyone and everything's slowly coming together. and that kiyoko and yachi helps out in the practice. yachi trying to smooth things out with the two is just adorable.

edit: also who else loved that watermelon seed thing? that was pretty cute. i don't know how kenma even feels about (basically) babysitting hinata and lev.
>> ARTICLE
That homage to the sharingan + sound effect. Brilliant!
>> ARTICLE
A shame there wasn't any development in their quick past Hinata hitting it with his left hand (which I thought was awesome). I'm interested in Tsukishima's character development too, but I can't help but be hyped as always to see what Hinata is going to do next.
>> ARTICLE
I just really cannot care about Tsukishima at all. His personality is bad, his attitude is bad, and he doesn't get along with any of the characters I actually like. At least Hinata and Kageyama are getting a lot of development still. 
>> ARTICLE
I hated Tsukki until his development arc in the manga. Unfortunately we probably won't get that until s3 of the anime sigh

I cannot believe that Daichi just spit that fuckin tooth out like it was no big deal. What an absolute champ.

I am continually surprised by how well Haikyuu handles all of its characters. I think it will be remembered as one of the great all time sports animes.
>> ARTICLE
Probably. It's crazy popular right now.
>> ARTICLE
Anytime I describe Haikyuu to people, I always put it as the pinnacle of what Sports anime has been up until now. I think it really is the finest combination of reasons I love Sports anime. That being said, it doesn't really have twists and turns, and there's no real original aspect to it. They just took the best parts of everything before it and brought them all to a perfect 10.

From here on out, the genre is going to need a new spin to get the same results.

Already is to me. Only competition there is is Hajime No Ippo (that's my opinion though)

Never seen Major and watched Captain Tsubasa in such a long time ago that I couldn't rate it as high or higher than those two

Cross Game is the best sports anime IMO, but it is more a mix of sports, drama and romance.

I keep hearing a lot of good things about it, I should check it out

People always forget Chihayafuru just because it isn't a physical sport :(

Yeah Chihayafuru is really good.

Or they just haven't seen it yet. It's probably my favorite, but if Haikyuu closes it's plot line and get some closure, it's gonna be my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps also gets you interested in most other characters as well. But yeah, Hajime no Ippo is amazing
>> ARTICLE
ENNOSHITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I've waited for this moment for so long. Ennoshita's so awesome. The flashback was really well done.

Also precious Yamaguchi. Tsukishima encouraging him (in his own way) was nice.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Love the whole "2 sides of cowardice" thing they had there. Seamless transition between character focus and perspective.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita Chikara... he sure lives up to his name.
>> ARTICLE
EnNOSHITa Chikara

tl note:

Chikara means strength
>> ARTICLE
lol

(on a serious note, Ennoshita means "under the floor" = "behind the scene")
>> ARTICLE
Wow. He really emulates that name. 
>> ARTICLE
*ooooh!*

is that also why the furudate also makes these silly parodies of popular movies starring the haikyuu cast as ennoshita's films? haha!

i feel like i finally get a joke after a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Ah you mean those parody posters? Maybe.  

There is a proverb "", if you're interested in checking it out yourself. :)
>> ARTICLE
i feel like the google images results with a man carrying something big and heavy overhead *means something* significant. hahaha!
>> ARTICLE
ha ha, yeah, it's supposed to illustrate someone very strong and powerful supporting "the floor" underneath for those on stage, without getting any attentions from the audience.
>> ARTICLE
so perfect for ennoshita. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
After the flashback all I could think about was how nice it was to see everyone encouraging Ennoshita when he entered the game. As soon as he calmed down He acted like a vice captain. The team respects him and the two years agree with him being the next captain. I like him so I don't mind him being the captain.

Yamaguchi coming into the game got me really excited. I've been waiting for him to shine. It was a little frustrating watching him be afraid of using his serve. Ennoshita stopping the coach from going off on Yamaguchi just adds to his captain levels. I'm not losing hope, the next time we see Yamaguchi he's going to have it ready for action.
>> ARTICLE
>  It was a little frustrating watching him be afraid of using his serve.

It's a matter of both self-confidence and his role on the team. We see him practicing his serve and in 2 actual matches. In match 1, he didn't get his serve in play and today's match saw him get lucky to have it tip over the net. His only job is to make the other team have to receive a tough serve and in his 2 game experiences he views it as a failure.  

To add to the lack of purposeful success, his lack of confidence in himself has to make him view his place within the heads of his teammates as someone that can't do their job if he doesn't put his serve into play. As Asahi admitted earlier in the show while still practicing his jump serve, he ran away much like Yamaguchi did here.  Yamaguchi doesn't get other ways to "prove his worth" to his teammates, so he rationalized that just getting the serve into play was much more worthwhile than doing his jump float serve.

Source: I play volleyball a lot and have been through this personally and with teammates
>> ARTICLE
I think the Yamaguchi stuff is pretty realistic though. I don't play volleyball, but I've had times in my first year or so of playing badminton where I served the bird out and then panicked and did the wimpiest serve, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, from a story standpoint, Yamaguchi had to suffer in this one so we could see Ennoshita is the next Daichi. The point of the episode being that Ennoshita knows what it's like to be a wrangler of over-excited wild ones, and also knows what it's like to run away when you're feeling scared.

Also lol, I can't help but feel Yamaguchi gets *such* a raw deal. I know that's the lot of a pinch server and stuff but I mean he gets 20 seconds of match experience the entire season long and then it's like 'hey go in there and score some points at this VITAL juncture', haha. Guy's got frayed nerves to start with. 
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi hasn't been shown much love as of yet. I'd be extremely pleased if in the future he saves the team big time.
>> ARTICLE
He'll have his big moment soon, don't worry! :)
>> ARTICLE
He's probably my favourite. I just really enjoy characters that start so low on their arc so they've got plenty of room to grow. And boy did they start Yamaguchi low, lol. Poor guy.

I have a feeling if Haikyuu goes long enough to see them in 3rd year, this episode will prove to be the one that has both future captains in it. Ennoshita for next year, Yamaguchi the year after. Ennoshita is basically Yamaguchi one year on.
>> ARTICLE
I'd think Tsukishima would be captain when they're third years. Maybe it's just my bias towards him, but we've seen plenty of captains that are all scheming defensive players. I think with Tsukki finally getting into it, he's going to be on top of people and will be in control of the defense by that point in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Could well be if they continue his development path. He'd have to change a hell of a lot to even want to be the captain, but that's the thing about sports anime characters, they change a lot, haha.

I've actually seen a pretty convincing argument for Tsukki/Yamaguchi taking on the role together as co-captains, too. Tsukki to kick people's asses and Yamaguchi to look after them when they're down. Because, a bit like Daichi and Suga, the only one who's allowed to put Tsukki in his place is Yamaguchi, hah. They've got some good parallels going on.
>> ARTICLE
Understandable. I just see him as being a lot like Kuroo in the future. Roughly the same height, but Tsukki definitely would need to put on muscle. Personality wise, I could easily see Tsukki being the exact same.

Of course, they could go with the Oikawa approach. Have Tsukki as captain, and have Yamaguchi play the Iwaizumi role. Just be the pillar to keep him in check.
>> ARTICLE
Hasn't he already by getting Tsukki to actually put some effort in?
>> ARTICLE
Seeing my favourite character leave was brutal but wow Ennoshita did shine in this ep.

Really wanted Yamaguchi to have his awesome moment though :(
>> ARTICLE
[With low confidence comes a low play-making ability...](http://i.imgur.com/D6b3S8L.png)
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda happy they had Tsukki trying to encourage Yamaguchi and get him to relax, its just nice seeing their friendship work both ways.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously..  I can totally respect the show for showing the struggles of players who aren't superhero talented and have to work for their place on the team, but Yamaguchi's only known suffering.
>> ARTICLE
You know, it wasn't till way after the episode ended that I realized we haven't seen Hinata/Kageyama in the spotlight for quite some time now. And I think it really speaks to the quality of the characters in a show when the watchers fail to notice and/or just don't care
>> ARTICLE
YAMAGUCHI WILL HAVE HIS MOMENT AND IT WILL BE GLORIOUS
>> ARTICLE
Its gonna come and when it does, I will be an inconsolable ball of emotions. I can feel it in me bones.
>> ARTICLE
HE BETTER!!
>> ARTICLE
If Yamaguchi hits an awesome serve and Tsukki freaks out this show will be my #1 forever
>> ARTICLE
What I loved about Ennoshita is that he didn't really come out of nowhere. They always put little hints throughout the show that he was a calming force in the team. Seeing his character get fleshed out was a classic Haikyuu moment.
>> ARTICLE
> They always put little hints throughout the show that he was a calming force in the team. 

Yeah loved how they flashed back to them :)
>> ARTICLE
Why is it I'm chopping onions when Haikyuu is on?! Dammit that whole flashback to Ennoshita was perfect and such a strong foundation for the character in the short time they had.

Also, Dammit Yamaguchi, I can see Ennoshita coming to his rescue again later in this match being he's ran before and Yamaguchi is thinking about running
>> ARTICLE
Somehow despite whatever the weather forecast, it's always raining in my face whenever I watch Haikyuu!!. And also I'm pretty sure time relativity theory works really well whenever I watch it. 20 minutes feels like 5 minuts :( 
>> ARTICLE
OMG RIGHT! Just as the ED starts I'm like "Fuck its already over?!?!"
>> ARTICLE
Damn right. That's me every time. Even though I keep checking on time stamp, but it still hit me so hard when ED starts. I was like... "Fuck, it's only 5 minutes in????" 
>> ARTICLE
It's the same when the little clips during the middle of the show play, its like "wait, we're half way through?"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah this episode was the only time I was actually surprised when the middle clip played.
>> ARTICLE
For today that break came and I said out loud "what, we're only 2 minutes in!"

Imagine my surprise when the episode actually ended 
>> ARTICLE
[I was hoping for more Tsukki so when the ED started I was like](http://i.imgur.com/I4HcSWx.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good with handling multiple plot points at once. Like in this match alone weve got Yamaguchis serve, Daichis injury, Ennoshita filling the captain spot, Tanakas stress over Daichi, Tsukki stepping his game up and all the issues with his brother, Captains battle, and actually winning the match. Like its so amazing how haikyuu handles telling a million stories all at once.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I can't wait for more Tsukki development :S")
>> ARTICLE
> [i can't wait for](/s "His roar")


>> ARTICLE
And then there are people who think Haikyuu's second season sucks because the show doesn't focus on games entirely. I pity those people.
>> ARTICLE
It's really hard to believe that people are here solely for the games. I mean most of the time it doesn't even matter who wins cause you'll be sad either way. 
>> ARTICLE
IKR? One of the reasons why I love Haikyuu is that they focus on rival teams too, and they're not shown as "enemies" to main characters (Karasuno), just volleyball dorks who wants to play volleyball, have fun, improve themselves and win.
>> ARTICLE
All of the "enemies" are just huge nerds too. There isn't a single character in this show that you can justifiably hate.
>> ARTICLE
The only character I kind of hate is Oikawa. But that's because he rubs me the wrong way. 
>> ARTICLE
How can you hate such a lovable dork
>> ARTICLE
It's only kinda. And mostly because of Aoba Johsai beating them in season 1. I'm still bitter. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Oikawa because even though he has a terrible personality (Iwa's words), I believe half of it is an act to seem cool and hide his weaknesses, he's just an alien/space nerd who likes to netflix and chill with his friends or alone
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa can be sweet too!  He takes his nephew to volleyball practice and teaches him how to play.  I love that Oikawa is s space dork.

Why does Haikyuu always make me so emotional? ;___;

I just love how in Haikyuu they flesh out all of the characters so one can only feel for them. That's probably why Haikyuu is one of my favorite series.^^^^andvolleyballismyfavoritesportbutw/e

And I also really liked Oikawa's narration. His whole explanation just got even more tense because of that superb voice acting of Daisuke Namikawa.

Side note: Am I the only who chuckles every time when Mad Dog-chan protects his head because of Oikawa's serve in the opening?

Love how Tsukki gave him sympathy.

Alright I missed out on the last thread (can't forgive myself for that. I  was waiting the entire season for that moment and I missed the fucking discussion thread *dammit*) but I'm not going to miss this one! 

**This episode adapted chapters 118 through 120.**

Thought it was [a lovely bit](http://i.imgur.com/YKi8DkC.gifv) when Kiyoko went to dab the blood from Daichi's split lip (nice timing with the animation - a second after Daichi clapped a hand to his mouth: nice indeed). 

Karasuno's [previous captain's](http://i.imgur.com/Ar2bHtr.png) name is [Hiroki Kurokawa.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FvrfkKJV2uA/U-2yZByx_3I/AAAAAAAAM58/-J67hokxPWw/s16000/007.png)

It really is Ennoshita's time to shine though. I love this (arc? game?) both because it heavily involves Daichi, my favorite character (aka "the support guy that gets outshined by everyone") and because Ennoshita is the one taking his place--one of the second-year trio who normally don't get nearly as much screentime focus as the rest of the Karasuno gang. 

Seriously though, Daichi lost a motherFUCKING tooth. And then he congratulated a guilty Tanaka on winning a point. He's my favorite for a reason.  

Oh, and also Yamaguchi! (second favorite) Gotta love Yamaguchi. I feel like some people here aren't cutting him enough slack - he knows deep down that out of the four first years he's the 'last' ranked: the other three are part of the A team. He's not. That alone is enough to give anyone confidence issues.  He's barely been on the main court - so of course he's going to be nervous his first few times on it, especially since when he *is* called it's with the expectation that he's there to earn some (emergency) points - that's a *lot* of pressure on a kid who already knows he's not as...necessary as the other first years. As Ennoshita pointed out to Ukai, Yamaguchi *knows*. He knows more than anyone else. Maybe it's because I've been there (granted, in a choral/theatre context rather than a sports one) that I can empathize with him so much..that feeling of shame, that desperate desire not to let your teammates down...I know those feelings. It's not easy.

Give him time. [](/s "It'll be worth it.")

It's finally happening! This entire season. The entire season and we're finally here. I'm excited. Expect screenshots (and gifs?) to be edited in soon.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've been there too. I am there actually, and it's really frustrating. I want to be useful. It's way more fun when you can be counted on.

Like I've learnt from Haikyuu, things become a lot more fun when you don't suck at it.
>> ARTICLE
I am happy that Daichi isn't concussed. I was worried about that. But man, how metal was him spitting out that tooth and then trying to say he can still play. It seems to be a theme, first with Kageyama and his nosebleed and now Daichi with his mouth. 

Ennoshita was my pick for captain once Daichi leaves, I'm glad that the other 2nd years agree. I also think that his experience Leaving the team then coming back had augmented his feelings for the game. 

I felt bad for Yamaguchi. It must be nerve wracking to be put in as a pinch server and to have your first serve go almost the same way as it did against Aoba Johsai. I think that he had to falter for two reasons. 1 so that he can realize that he can't be afraid, because as he said to Tsukki, what do they have besides pride. And 2 so that Ennoshita can show that he can handle the duties of being a captain. The last thing Yamaguchi needed was for Ukai to yell at him, and Ennoshita knew that and deflected it. He will make a great captain next year. 

Great episode. I'm glad it didn't end on a cliffhanger like last week did, I don't know what I would have done. This week was terrible, I was counting down the days and hours until I could get to the next episode. Once this season is over I'm definitely picking up the Manga. I can't go that long without a Haikyuu fix, that's for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
>It seems to be a theme

Characters getting injured and saying they can still play is like Trope #1 of sports anime. 
>> ARTICLE
It is true though. Everybody wants to continue playing.
>> ARTICLE
I need to watch more sports animes. I've only watched Haikyuu and the first season of Free! 
>> ARTICLE
* Hajime no Ippo
* Baby Steps
* Ace of Diamond
* Ookiku Furikabutte
* Ping Pong

Here you go.
>> ARTICLE
You need to finish free! It'll be a fun ride with friendship and crying and just watch Eternal Summer.
>> ARTICLE
I cried at the end of the first season with the relay. What a touching moment. 
>> ARTICLE
There's even more crying in eternal summer.
>> ARTICLE
Try Big Windup (AKA Ookiku Furikabutte).

It's probably one of the most serious sports manga out there since the author is a sports psychiatrist or something, but the anime has all the excitement and cuteness of Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes. Submit to the glory that is sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I started cross game but it emotionally abuses me. I still hate my friend who recommended it to me... Only sorta, because I do like it, but I can't binge it. 

Cc /u/Ander1ap 
>> ARTICLE
Try Baby Steps if you want a sports anime that's relatively light and fun. 
>> ARTICLE
Adding it to my PTW. I've been told that Kuroko no Basket and Eyeshield 21 are also good. 
>> ARTICLE
Hope you enjoy it. And yes I can fully recommend both of those. 
>> ARTICLE
Its a true thing of sports. Back in highschool football we had a player break his finger who just wrapped it up and kept on playing. Everyone tries to hide injuries. 
>> ARTICLE
Well there was an American football player named Ronnie Lott who cut off his broken finger so he wouldn't miss a game in the 70's.
>> ARTICLE
I thought I was watching OreGairu there for a second. 

Hearing the 8man VA gave me flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
he found something genuine in volleyball
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi serving stressed me out so much
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read ahead so this is all speculation (please don't spoil me) but [spec](/s "the development they are giving to Ennoshita and Yamaguchi has me worried we're heading towards another loss at the end of the season and they're setting the stage for the next year.  I'd really like to see them make it to nationals with this team but purely by an episode standpoint I don't see that happening this season.")
>> ARTICLE
Nonono [](/s "they're going to win and make it to nationals and win that too and then after the third years leave Haikyuu will keep going, following Hinata and Kageyama through their second and third years, because it's amazing and shouldn't end so that's what their development is for.") (I haven't read the manga either so I hope you're wrong)
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively [](/s "they could win the tournament and end the season there and have the 3rd season, hopefully, start as they are training for nationals :)")
>> ARTICLE
There's only 7 episodes left for this season & this game isn't even finished yet. They won't have time to fit more than one game after this one into this season.
>> ARTICLE
Either of these three things will happen.

 - They will lose now.
 - They will lose to Seijoh (don't think this will happen given last year's loss, it would be a real downer)
 - They will win versus Seijoh and the anime will end there, 3rd season starts with them preparing to the nationals.

The other option involves Seijoh losing to someone and they fighting this someone instead but highly unlikely considering the OP.
>> ARTICLE
Seijou isn't the only team they'd have to beat. They'd have to beat Shiratorizawa as well to get to nationals.
>> ARTICLE
> They'd have to beat Shiratorizawa as well to get to nationals.

I thought it would have like 2 team divisions, and both winners would go to the nationals. In that case, they would win versus Seijoh, and the 3rd season would begin with them fighting Shiratorizawa, they don't have time for both.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of what happens, I kind of hope the story continues after the current 3rd years leave since the development of the first years seem to be the main focus.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Obviously I don't want it to go on forever and drop in quality, but at the same time I love it so much I don't want it to end so soon.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Haikyuu is my favorite so I'd hate to see it go to shit. Maybe though when it does end (if he doesn't make it follow the first years after this year) it'll be like KnB and have a spin off where they're older or playing on a national team or something. 
>> ARTICLE
As long as we get more high quality Haikyuu I'm happy.
>> ARTICLE
Also speculation [](/s "the way they set up the match with Nekoma been the last with the current coach, make me believe they will at least get that far.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh god,  that was a feels overload. Definitely my favorite of the new season. Goddamn. All these characters are so complex and well-written.
>> ARTICLE
Slightly unrelated to the episode (Spotlight on my boy Enoshita was awesome!) but seeing Takeru's jump serve was amazing and I can't wait to see Oikawa's jump serve again and perhaps even better animated than in season 1. Seijoh/Oikawa's theme is probably my favourite Haikyuu OST.
>> ARTICLE
It's Ennoshita's senpai time! I also love how Furudate definitely didn't only, you know... out of no where gives the flashback for Ennoshita's character exposition. If you guys remember, Ennoshita and the other two second years mentioned about how they had quit the team to Hinata and Kageyama when they were in first training camp. It's nice that they use that information. A solid foundation. Just like Tsukki's character development, we also got a tiny glimpse before second season on how he "hates" overexcited players, how he didn't want to put an effort and keep saying "this is just a club." 

I totally forgot that we would get Yamaguchi's development too in this episode. I love how his moment gives us glimpse on how strong relationship between Yamaguchi and Tsukki. Tsukki knew from the moment Yamaguchi took second ball to serve, that Yamaguchi wouldn't try a jump float. And he silently gave him a towel. It's very nice bond between these two. 

Also Oikawa san's analysis is accurate as hell, it's scary. He's truly the orchestra master.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi... YOU BETTER BECOME A BAD ASS MOTHERFUCKER, IF YOU DON'T I WILL BEAT YOUR SHIT UP!!!
*(Yes I know I need help, why the fuck am I talking to a fictional character)*
>> ARTICLE
I really feel like gushing, but don't know what to say. Yay Ennoshita! Yay Yamaguchi! Yay Daichi not having brain damage! Yay the awesome ending music+visuals! O-k.
>> ARTICLE
Ah rain, that can only mean good things
>> ARTICLE
I think we only have Kinoshita and Narita left to go, right? I'm excited to see a lot of their flashbacks
>> ARTICLE
you know, i read the manga and all yet i never seem to remember their names.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's safe to say that the team will be in good hands when the 3rd year guys leave 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know the name of the OST that was playing when Ennoshita got the serve?
>> ARTICLE
Why can Haikyuu make me tear up so much. Like I counted like 4-5 times this episode alone. Yamaguchi's little bit hit me really hard though, he gets me.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita stepping into place and guiding the team was absolutely wonderful to watch -- especially his little step-aside at the end of his speech to have Asahi reassure Tanaka. That was super adorable/amusing -- along with how everyone was vigorously supporting him.

It'll be amazing when Yamaguchi's able to get his confidence up to the point where he can pull off the jump floater consistently in competition without tripping over himself. Can't wait to see him get there. =D

Also -- it was really weird seeing First Year Nishinoya without the streak in his hair. Just as adorable though.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the episode opens up with basically, we don't need to overplay the drama, you know Karasuno is gonna win so let's just get that fact out of the way and on with the show. 

I like the new captain, gonna be interesting to see him as the main captain next year but I wish he had more of role prior to this, it almost felt like they transplanted him back into old scenes, George Lucas style. 

I'm glad he stepped in for Yamaguchi, those moments where you mess up but you know exactly what you did really hit you hard, and having someone berate you for what you already know on top of that is painful. 

I would say slightly too many flashbacks this episode, but still a good one none the less. ~~(may have also forgot they are now playing best of 5 it caught me off guard when 2-0 wasn't a victory.)~~


>> ARTICLE
That was how I interpreted it too, until I realised that the guys in school was actually the players they played last time, not the current opponents!
>> ARTICLE
No no, still best of 3 for now. Yamaguchi took us to the end of set 1, and the little flash forward at the end showed Karasuno behind in the 2nd set.
>> ARTICLE
I swear they destroyed this team in the first set... I must be going mental.
>> ARTICLE
The episodes are being split in really thematically good places but really awkward scoreboard places, lol. Add to that the amount of flashback we had in this one, including cuts to Jozenji AND Seijoh, and yeah. I can totally get where things get blurry, lol
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't know how I got it into my head that the time out when the other team began to play better was the end of the first set... I'm an idiot.

Doesn't help that Haikyuu! airs on a Saturday night (7pm here in the UK), I always want to watch it asap but that generally means after having one too many drinks.
>> ARTICLE
Aw man. 7AM on Sunday over here in Oz. I...I don't know which I'd prefer, lol 
>> ARTICLE
Think I'd prefer the Sunday, wake up on a sunday morning, drag myself down to the place where the tea and bacon resides, then crack on some Hype Volleyball Shenanigans, sounds like a good way to start a sunday.
>> ARTICLE
Actually it is pretty awesome. I just watched the whole thing with a coffee from my machine and some peanut butter on toast and now it's only 8am, so there's a whole day to go.
>> ARTICLE
Yepp, whereas it's 9pm and I'm here like well all I've done today is my weekly shop and watched Bakuman... and no town tonight so Haikyuu! was the last thing I was looking forward to, kind of a wasted Saturday... Oh well back to Bakuman. :P
>> ARTICLE
hahahahahahahahaahhahah dat ending haha

Fuck you too, Haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that we finally saw Yamaguchi.
And I'm wondering... How long will these series last? It looks like there has to be something after this tournament, without current third-years.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really looking forward to the next episode! More focus on Enoshita and Yamaguchi is always a good thing!
>> ARTICLE
Time for the side characters to shine!
>> ARTICLE
Hypekyuu had done it again. My favorite scene is Ukai walking to Yamaguchi and yelling his name then Chikara stops him. Intense moment!
>> ARTICLE
Hello, 

So I just finished episode 11 and I'm wondering if I should keep watching or wait until it's done airing. How big is the hype right now? 
>> ARTICLE
The hype is big and constantly growing. I was sorely disappointed when I was called into work early today and therefore could not watch the sub the minute it dropped. I mean... I complained to my coworkers about it.

I have to say that riding aboard the hype train with everybody here on this thread is pretty great though, but at the same time, I much prefer marathoning shows when possible, but I just am so desperate to watch the show I can't stop myself. The show is great.
>> ARTICLE
Manga reader here. Hype will get worse with each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The hype will just keep on going so I'd say just keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Hype is definitely getting up there after this episode, and I can only see it getting bigger later on.
>> ARTICLE
What chapters does this episode adapt?
>> ARTICLE
Chapters 118-120.
>> ARTICLE
what another wonderful episode. [i can't wait for](/s "that daiyui scene to be animated this season omg!!!")
>> ARTICLE
I just went to an internet cafe and saw a dude watching this episode of Haikyuu! Haikyuu is soo popular! I'm in the Philippines btw 
>> ARTICLE
Kiyoko Wave http://gfycat.com/AdeptPoshGangesdolphin
>> ARTICLE
After a string of really great episodes, this one felt a bit weak in comparison. I was fully pumped after the last week's cliffhanger, but just didn't feel it in this episode. Idk if it was too many flashbacks, or introducing a new character or being let down that they didn't use Sugawara. I also got fooled by the first scene, confusing the previous opponents with the current ones.

Anyway, I'm sure next episode is going to be much better, because anything below great is super rare in this awesome series!
>> ARTICLE
Thought it was one of the best, the ones where characters get build-up, that's what Haikyuu excels at.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but watching Yamaguchi is so damn frustrating, I really dont like his character, yet. I assume he is going to get "his" arc, because for now, he is basically just a crybaby clinging on to Tsukishima. The rest was great, the Vice Captain seems like a pretty good fit. 

EDIT: /r/anime delivers downvotes because of what? I dont like ONE character on the show? HE IS USELESS, he has done NOTHING positive that we get to see, except motivate Tsukishima a bit during his arc. I love Haikyuu, but I can't stand Yamaguchi, YET.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah well, it's good to see flawed characters, because almost every character of Haikyuu has a flaw, which is anxiety and inferiority complex for Yama.
>> ARTICLE
He got the most annoying flaws a character can have, I would be okay if he only got 1 of them but he got both and he has both happening EVERY TIME HE IS ON THE SCREEN.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, you don't overcome in problems in one night. It wouldn't be realistic.
>> ARTICLE
But you don't show these problems whenever you're in the screen, [manga](/s "also, he overcomes these problems in the next game so this is bullshit!")
>> ARTICLE
It's not the flaw, it's the character. He's done nothing useful, all he did was go to one of the older guys and asked to be trained. 

Remember, Hinata also had "stage fright" and hit Kageyama in the head, and got over it pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Not everyone can get over something so quickly, but a moment of event can change things - we see that he may show a certain change later too from this episode, or at least he learned something the hard way. I find him necessary for Tsukki. The creator is trying to reach out many different types of characters as he thinks he needs in this show, and you see that some people can relate to Yamaguchi, even if you can't. I hope you're still enjoying the show anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi's such a pussy it actually annoys me
>> ARTICLE
He's justified imo. I used to play Baseball before and still got nervous every game even when I was a regular player. Imagine hardly ever playing in a real game and when you finally do get called in during a super important game the whole team is relying on you to get that point.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but not being able to move is kinda overkill on the nervousness department.
>> ARTICLE
I mean being able to hit a quick with your eyes closed can be seen as overkill as well but hey it's anime.
>> ARTICLE
And I'm sure that annoys some people as well
>> ARTICLE
Im pretty sure if the main ability of the main characters annoyed you, you probably wouldnt have watched this show all the way into the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed but I'm still here because it doesn't bother me. That doesn't mean Yamaguchi can't annoy me.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the guy has some pretty clear anxiety issues to start with. 

In any case, he's just a product of the needs of the story. The story being told today is that Ennoshita is a good choice for a replacement captain. So they made Yamaguchi's feet freeze so Ennoshita could lunge in and save the day, and then step in to protect Yamaguchi from the coach at the end because he knew being yelled at is the last thing that'd help. 

Ennoshita quit the team because his skills weren't up to snuff and he kept being yelled at by a Ukai. It's just showing that he knows exactly how Yamaguchi feels.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, when I played sports, before every game I got super nervous even though I had done it many times before. Also considering he messed up the previous time and then almost messed up again, its understandable for him to take a safer approach.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Sometimes when you make a mistake it messes with you causing you to make even more mistakes.
>> ARTICLE
On tilt. It's the worst :(
>> ARTICLE
Ah the pay-off is already starting, can't help but grin during those scenes.

Bokuto is great as teammate and opponent. "You taught him that" and his emo-mode were hilarious.

yachi sploosh
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was pretty goddamn adorable. Yachi is a great addition to this show, honestly not sure how they got this far without her anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad Yachi isn't introduced until later in the show's development. If they introduce her too early, she'd feel too much like the audience surrogate. That's not bad but its been done and leaves something on the table. Since we know something about the game and the team, we're now able to view her as this new comer rather than just a stand in for us, the viewers.

Yachi also gives me an interesting perspective. There are often times when I wish I could reexperience something for the first time, like watching an anime. There's something exhilarating about a first watching something for the first time. Yachi can give us that feeling again. The evolution of the Kageyama-Hinata quick is awesome but it feels like its compounded by Yachi's reaction and takes me back to the 3 on 3 match where Kageyama-Hinata and Hinata were playing for their spots in season one.

It's funny you should say that, because the two webms I posted just now are *also* my first ones.

[YES THE QUICK FINALLY HAPPENED](http://i.imgur.com/Ft4Rvhm.png). It's felt like so many episodes leading up to this :'). Now the real battle begins!
>> ARTICLE
Amazing. The scene where the new quick works is my new favourite scene from both seasons, along with the scene from the first episode when Hinata's team lost to Kageyama's. Poor bokuto, having a bad game, but still being the best <3. 

The OST was on point the whole episode and made it even better. Sadly, the episode only lasted like 2 minutes :(

This episode covered from page 12 of chapter 92, 93, 94 and up to page 9 of chapter 95. (Getting a faster pace woohoo!)
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's reaction to Hinata calling him awesome is priceless.
>> ARTICLE
You can tell that he does not know how to deal with it mentally. Haha!
>> ARTICLE
Yup best moment of the episode especially with hinatas face during that scene
>> ARTICLE
"the weirdo duo is back in action" ... I think I almost cried. The cogs all coming together is amazing, this is totally the episode weve been waiting for! Its great how much the other teams still respect Karasunos skill despite their constant losing and I'm living for the interactions between Bokuto and Akaashi. What is up with super talented players actually being total babies? (I'm looking at you Oikawa)

Also shoutout to that one scene of Daichi receiving they use atleast twice every episode.
>> ARTICLE
They also use that scene of Kageyama setting with his arms outstretched and mouth open again.
>> ARTICLE
It just keeps getting better and better, really loved how they showed everything is coming together with the cogs.
>> ARTICLE
Now all we need are the Tsukki and Yamaguchi cogs and the team will finally come together perfectly!
>> ARTICLE
You are forgetting Suga.
>> ARTICLE
And two second years.
>> ARTICLE
Youre right! Oh man and he totally had that adorable smiling scene in todays episode and everything :/
>> ARTICLE
She was the last one to acknowledge it but Yachi's encouragement when they finally nailed it was easily the best :)
>> ARTICLE
Her little happy hop and Bokuto's emo mode were the best points of this episode. Everyone showing their emotions so openly really works well in this show and makes it that much more endearing.
>> ARTICLE
That Kuroken banter... I always love it when they do their back and forths. It makes me wanna rewatch the Nekoma OVA again.

The scenes didn't really flow well and it made the episode feel disjointed, but individually it's awesome. Hinata and Kageyama successfully pulling off the new quick gave me goosebumps (especially the moments before, when time slowed ~~and soulfully gazed into each other's eyes~~). So is Nishinoya doing a libero's toss (twice!). And that synchro attack... hnngh.

Everything Fukurodani was a sight to behold animated. I fucking love Bokuto. I fucking love Akaashi. I also love their teammates that I forgot their name.
>> ARTICLE
Hold on a second, there is an OVA for Haikyuu that i didn't know about?
>> ARTICLE
[There is](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25303/Haikyuu!!:_Jump_Festa_2014_Special)! It's pretty much a more thorough introduction of Lev.

np and btw, i wasn't actually the one who made it, just for info :P
>> ARTICLE
The scene where they finally used the new quick was so well done! I loved how as Kageyama was contemplating not to give it to Hinata, Hinata speaks to him in a quiet voice and the music cuts out as well making it so much more impactful. I hadn't actually realized I was holding my breath the entire quick scene until it was over. I LOVE THIS SHOW.
>> ARTICLE
dear god that quick from hinata and kageyama was beautiful. i had tears of joy flowing

>> ARTICLE
The OST is just incredible. When Hinata and Kageyama finally did their new quick the music that played gave me goosebumps.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the music starting from when they tried the libero set and the synchro attack in this episode is the same track from the first episode where the two birds were flying at each other.  I friggin love that track, I need to find it somewhere, anyone know when the OST for season 2 comes out?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know when it's coming out but I neeed it in my life.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto is definitly my new favourite character, he's hilarious ;-;
>> ARTICLE
He was one opf the main reasons why I was so hyped for this season!
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama is weak to direct attacks eh? That's one of my favorite tropes - just, partners uninhibitedly praising one another. And after all the work Kageyama's put in, I'm so glad Hinata was unafraid to tell him he was incredible, over and over, and give credit where it was due
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really like it too. I wish people did it in real life as well. I love both giving and receiving praise in my life.

lucky Christmas season is coming up then. always gotta start somewhere ;)

Holy shit this is good
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been commenting on these threads recently because I felt like there wasn't much to say. There were some exciting moments, but they seemed to build anticipation more than fulfill it. This is the episode where it all paid off. We definitely saw the team start to show and execute their new techniques and I started to wonder if this was going to be another buildup episode. Not that I mind the build ups. Haikyuu has a way of making every episode satisfying (unlike Diamond no Ace) with some development.

The evolved version of the kageyama-hinata spike changed everything. Everything just snowballed from there. Kurasano played with abandon and threw out everything they had been practicing. It worked and the pay off was huge.

Beyond the hype, there were some quieter moments I appreciated too. The bond between Kageyama and Hinata continues to grow stronger. The look they shared before Kageyama sent him that toss speaks volumes. Even the other teams noticed it. The next time they tried that quick, it was a miss and served as a nice grounding reminder that their quick is something special and difficult.

Bokuto's development was also fun and refreshing. As his frustration built I was dreading some transformation into a rage beast and desperately hoping for something else. I'm glad he turned into a drama queen instead and loved how his team handled it. This season has felt like a slower, quieter start. It doesn't lack strength but the hype has been replaced by anticipation. In this episode, it all paid off. I can't wait for the tournament!
>> ARTICLE
But, but Diamond no Ace has that giraffe reporter who always steals the show and adds something to plot unlike Yachi.

>> ARTICLE
Hi friends. Make sure you come discuss this at /r/haikyuu with all your other nerdy volleyball obsessed friends there. It's a pretty neat place.

thanks, didn't realize Haikyuu was popular enough on /r/anime to have one!

Is it just me or ar the episodes just 2 minutes long?
>> ARTICLE
No, it is just not you.  It felt like the episode got over in an instant.  
>> ARTICLE
11 hours in, and it seems that no one is mentioning the scene where Fukurondai's setter is going over the 3 scenarios of what happens if he sets to Bokuto. With the .5 second timer going, I thought that scene was hilariously adapted well into the anime!
>> ARTICLE
This episode was awesome. Finally get to see the progress they've been building up! I love how Bokuto tilted so hard.
>> ARTICLE
I would put screenshots of all my favorite parts of this episode here, but that would be pretty much equivalent to me posting a video of the entire episode here. Suffice it to say this was the best episode yet, as all the previous episodes have also been. Especially because of Bokuto. Interested to see if he gets over his emo mode and the owls win or if the crows keep it up and win.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Akaashi are amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode, but it looks like next week might be even better since it seems like Suga might finally get some time to shine! The highlight this week is definitely between the quick working and Akaashi thinking about possible outcomes. I'm loving him, Bokuto and Kuro more and more every week. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so satisfying, and everyone's already captured the reasons why, but I just want o say that I loved the moment when Nishinoya was [celebrating](http://gfycat.com/AdolescentMildAlleycat) Tanaka's spike.
>> ARTICLE
The first of this season was absolutely well made in terms of character development. Mostly revolving around the relationship between kageyama and Hinata and massive hints of potential development for Tsuki.  #firstyearsOP
>> ARTICLE
i fucking love haikyuu!!!!

The animation is brilliantly done. The part where the ball is rotating in the ball's point of view and then stopping, amazing.

AHH I look forward to this every week!! The manga and the anime are so well made.

Few anime make me tear up cuz of how beautiful and awesome they are. This one always has me tear up with a grin on my face for 20 minutes. The OST is perfect and the epic moments could not have possibly been done better.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode was so damn awesome! Seeing everything come together made me sequel like a little girl xD
>> ARTICLE
This episode just puts a smile on my face seeing their efforts finally bearing fruit.

You could FEEL that spike. Holy shit, that was great.
>> ARTICLE
Suga is gonna shine very soon too, right? He's going to be in the spotlight any time now, right?  
^^^...right?
>> ARTICLE
Just another episode that's too short but left me incredibly happy!

So much cuteness in one episode (Yachi being oh so happy for the KageHina pair!!) and I love the part with Akaashi's calculations of Bokuto's temperament. I feel you Bokuto. I would be frustrated too.

Damn! So looking forward to their fist official matches to be animated.

Production I.G. is doing god's work in this adaptation again similar to KnB if not better.

So many friggin cute moments in this show man. Yachi being happy for hinata and kageyama, the duo landing the new quick, even the nekoma dudes just talking about hinata. I love this show so much

im assuming that's why usai taught all of them the tempo concept

Isn't the point of synchronised attack is, everyone but the setter moves ?

Love how Tsukishima really shines this episode by being proactive in strategy!
>> ARTICLE
Finally! I disliked how he seemed to disappear for long stretches as a major character this arc. He was almost a total background character these past few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukki is and always has been the best character. It's just taking some people extra time to figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
I think until he got his arc about self confidence he wasn't really fleshed out enough for people to take notice of him.
>> ARTICLE
I love how deadpan he is most of the time but then quickly flashes the smuggest grin every time he does something right. Just Tsukki doing Tsukki things. 

Seriously, there needs to be a subreddit dedicated to Tsukki's grin. Or at least a comment face here.

Almost Prince of Tennis-esque in terms of insane moves. But that is the kind of potential he has!
>> ARTICLE
That was some next level shit. 
>> ARTICLE
It seems like a pretty huge step for Hinata, too. When he started out, he was just pure athleticism, to the point where the only way they could use him effectively was to have him close his eyes to completely remove his actual skill from the equation. 

Since then, we've seen him pick up a lot of new skills. But it's always been a sort of targeted thing. "Well I'm going to learn this bit now." 

But to my knowledge this is the first time he's actually been able to actually improvise successfully. It's not just another base repetition of thing A, B, or C. It's the subtle but important distinction between Hinata being a guy who plays volleyball, and Hinata being a *volleyball player.*
>> ARTICLE
Well he did practise hitting all sorts of tosses from all sorts of setters to be able to respond to unexpected situations better. So I'd say this is a result of one of his "well I'm going to learn this bit now"s. And such an exciting result at that!
>> ARTICLE
Damn it Haikyuu, I don't want to be super happy when Mad-Dog scores, stop showing his backstory and developing his character!
>> ARTICLE
I wish they did that a little earlier in the series, so we can have Hinata pair off against him as the two players who were inspired by volleyball heroes during their youth.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, got a little emotional about Mad-Dog. Got damnit Haikyuu, got me well again! This anime literally never stops surprising me, love it :).
>> ARTICLE
>stop showing his backstory and developing his character!

I swear this happens with every single character, and I love/hate it because it actually hurts when they lose. I'm going to be a damn mess at the end of this match, whatever the outcome.
>> ARTICLE
Ace of diamond does the same thing... god damn.
>> ARTICLE
God dammit Aoba Jousai is such a likable team.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to Haikyuu!! where you love all teams and every character becomes your adopted child.
>> ARTICLE
They're my favourite team, but I'd be lying if I said Karasuno doesn't have a special place in my heart.

The end of this match will be pain
>> ARTICLE
How do you like another team more than Karasuno?
>> ARTICLE
Not the person you are asking, but Haikyuu makes pretty much every team likable, so it's hard to hate anyone. We're usually given bits of backstory, though sometimes we get a lot more insight about the team/character (like with Oikawa, for instance), and it can be enough to make you like them and feel so much more attached to them, to the point where you find yourself cheering harder for opposing team than for Karasuno.

At least that's how it was for me; that's how I ended up where I am now, cheering for Seijou and doing my best to prepare for the inevitable heartbreak since they are not the protagonist rofl.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I love every other team, but up to this point we've watched Karasuno grow for 45 episodes, it's hard to legitimately hope they lose.
>> ARTICLE
Oh don't get me wrong, I don't want Karasuno to lose, but it's just that at the same time, I don't want Seijou to lose either.
>> ARTICLE
I'm absolutely the same way.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto.

Also Kenma.
>> ARTICLE
Kemma is cool, but Bokuto is fucking annoying 90% of the time.

They all are, to me. With the exception of one fucking annoying character that has yet to show up I like each and every one of them, it's seriously weird to me.

>> ARTICLE
People have a problem with him? He's sooooo great.
>> ARTICLE
How is it possible to not like him? Great character.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no not me though, I was just trying to guess, I actually like him :x
>> ARTICLE
He's pretty annoying, but I do actually like him a lot after his backstory... just like every other character.                 

I hate his team's setter, though. Only character in the series I legitimately dislike, his attitude is so annoying.
>> ARTICLE
Akaashi is to me the most interesting character outside of Karasuno.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto too. He isn't your usual airheaded character. His relationship with Akaashi is pretty interesting. Opposites, but they get along with each other so well, and Akaashi takes care of him most of times (not a headcanon).
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about most interesting, but I definitely like him. He's also not who I was talking about before, though.
>> ARTICLE
you are talking about Shirabu, right? 


>> ARTICLE
Yes

They are great! Also, I really liked that "wooooooooaaaaaahh" (not sure how else to describe it) that the crowd kept cheering when Oikawa was serving. Was so good! His serves are exciting by themselves but this made them even better.

Haikyuu is the only sports show I have watched that has actually made me want to play the sport. There is just something so hype about it.
>> ARTICLE
I started learning Go because of Hikaru no Go years and years ago.

Kuroko always makes me go waste some time with a basketball. I used to play in middle/high school but fucking christ high school killed any love I had for the game.
>> ARTICLE
I played volleyball for a few years but my arms are so thin (muscle and bone-wise) that I had to stop playing. Breaking my arm three times (not because of volleyball) didn't help me either. :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm not that much into playing sports but i decided to watch a couple matches and have become a fan of it.
>> ARTICLE
See I'm the opposite, I enjoy playing sports but I not a fan of watching it.
>> ARTICLE
It also helps that there isn't any real bullshit anime magic involved. Like some sports anime *Cough* Kuroko *cough*
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't mind Kuroko at first but it got so ridiculous by the end.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think kuroko was trying to be realistic in any sense.
>> ARTICLE
At least in the earlier part of the show it wasn't completely batshit crazy. I mean kuroko himself always was. But it was actual basketball otherwise

Then it turned into DragonBasketBall Z

Haikyuu hasn't even approached that sort of uncanny ability yet

>> ARTICLE
> Then it turned into DragonBasketBall Z
> 

You act like that's a bad thing
>> ARTICLE
Oh it's completely fine. But as a result after about the first half of season 1 it stopped being any sort of sport anime that might interest you in the sport itself because of it's craziness.

Looking forward to the Extra Game movie when it comes out

>> ARTICLE
I picked up volleyball as a hobby exactly a year ago. A few months after I started, my buddy told me to watch Haikyuu and no jokes it's helped me improve some parts of my game.

Coincidentally I also play middle blocker, feels so nice to get them quicks in.
>> ARTICLE
If I was to play I would probably be a Libero, I'm short and don't have much jumping power. Matches look like they would be so fun though.
>> ARTICLE
I started playing casual once a week this semester because of Haikyuu. Totally worth getting into, nothing feels better than getting a solid receive straight at you. Makes you feel like Daichi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm going to look around the local area, see what is about!
>> ARTICLE
I played for years and stopped playing because my team disbanded. I might get into it again one day though it will be really depressing to learn everything again.
>> ARTICLE
Played from grade school up through college. Even coached my little sister. 

It's an awesome sport. Probably my favorite to actually play. It's tedious though. The show does an almost perfect job at relaying how isolating it can be when on the court. Another point that was dead on was when someone was subbed in and the moment you cross the line you feel all the tension and momentum that's been going on the court.

"Yeah, finally time for my boy Hinata to deliver a thorough ass-kicking!"

-episode ends-

"WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME?!"

I swear, Haikyuu possesses some kind of wonky time magic. How else could you explain the discrepancy between the timer on the video player and my mind which is telling me it's barely been 5 minutes?
>> ARTICLE
I feel you completely! I just got done catching up 2 weeks ago, and now I have to deal with antagonizing wait that the current viewer has to deal with, with the end of each episode! The hype factor is so strong, I need to cooldown after each episode.

this show is just ridiculous

for the next haikyuu release whether it's a s3 or movie, they need to release the damn thing in one full segment without weekly airing. i swear its sacrilege to wait for this show weekly
>> ARTICLE
I swear on everything holy, I check the timer thinking there's at least 10 minutes left, and there's 2 minutes and 51 seconds instead.

At this stage, we don't even need time machines. Just watch some Haikyuu if you want to travel forward in time.
>> ARTICLE
This show is going to drive me insane with suspense.
>> ARTICLE
It's really great seeing both Karasuno and Seijoh players stumble upon different ways to support the players on the court, and discover their own brand of teamwork. 


Hinata, possibly worried that Kageyama might be doubting himself in the face of Oikawa's genius, offers the [exact same cocky words of support] (https://57.media.tumblr.com/930f1a248f9b6f34f611c34e3c953c6e/tumblr_o3y4m4MMzq1tcr2fko1_540.gif) that had Kageyama given him under similar circumstances during the 1st season's Neighborhood association practice match. Tsukkishima steps up to cover for Tanaka and Noya when they need it. Yahaba whips Mad dog into shape for himself and his senpai. Oikawa is great with individuals on his team... and absolutely terrifying to his opponents
>> ARTICLE
So, I started watching *Haikyuu!!* last Saturday, watched through all of season one and got caught up just yesterday. My thoughts on the show as a whole so far: this is extreme hype. The only sports anime (if it counts) that I'd seen before is *Girls und Panzer*, and that definitely doesn't compare. I haven't been this excited about a show in a long while, and have had "Go go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!" stuck in my head lately. Wish the Crow's cheering section was a bit bigger.

Last episode was Yamaguchi's time to shine, and of all people, it seemed like this episode was Mad Dog-chan's. But Tsukishima had a few moments, and Hinata came in at the end with his "baseless courage" and downward spike. Definitely hyped for next episode.

Speaking of baseless, I have a theory that is probably way off. Feel free to correct it if so. But. I believe that the Little Giant is Sensei. This is based mainly on the similarity of their hair styles and size, plus the age is about right, and (to be honest) I just want it to be the case.

Also, thanks to /u/acrillex and /u/r_anime for recommending this show to me last week in FTF. Y'all rock.

[Stay awesome, /r/anime.](#helmetbro)

Kuroko's characters are so bland that I had a hard time caring about anything that was going on in the matches. Part of the reason Haikyuu is so amazing is that you truly want the players to succeed (whether they be on Karasuno or another team) due to *all of them* having personalities / hardships / etc which make you sympathize with them. In contrast Kuroko is basically just a bunch of boring anime archetypes vs a few nobodies + a douchebag.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta do *Chihayafuru* first, but I'll do *Kuroko no Basket* once that's done.

They are both amazing in their own ways, so u wont lose out

You are in for a whole new world regarding sports anime. A lot of them have intense tourneys and great character building and it is such an underrated genre. What I like about Haikyuu is that it moves from backstory to flashbacks to actual action so seamlessly. While stuff like Girls und Panzer was more methodical with its pacing.

That's actually a very popular theory, although many people like to debunk it by stating that Glasses Senpai had to have the very basic rules of volleyball explained to him early in season 1.  However I wouldn't be surprised if Glasses Senpai was at least related to the Little Giant in some way.
>> ARTICLE
> That's actually a very popular theory

Dang. I guess being original is impossible when you're late in joining the fandom.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think sensei is TLG, but if he somehow is, it would also be hilarious as Kamiya Hiroshi is his seiyuu...and this would make this the second "powerful little giant" he has voiced recently (After Levi).
>> ARTICLE
>Kamiya Hiroshi is his seiyuu...and this would make this the second "powerful little giant" he has voiced

Shamelessly going to count that as evidence for why Sensei **must** be TLG (aside: is that how "the Little Giant" is normally referred to by the fandom? Cool! Reminds me of HRG from *Heroes*.).
>> ARTICLE
Haha I just made up the acronym on the spot :D
>> ARTICLE
To be fair he also voices Akashi from Kuroko who also was "an all powerful little giant" (well compared to the rest of them )
>> ARTICLE
Sensei can't be the Little Giant. Sensei is 29 and the little giant is around 21, since he was in the same grade as Tanaka's sister.
>> ARTICLE
A ruse, I tell you!
>> ARTICLE
It's so weird to see a theory that Sensei is the little giant because just as I was watching the intro where Hinata and the little giant's figures sync up, it came into my mind that the little giant looked a LOT like Sensei there :P

Though to instantly debunk it, its pretty weird that he'd be having to be taught the basics of Volleyball when he just started being involved with the club...
>> ARTICLE
But sensei seems older and ryu's sister is in college so shouldnt the little giant also be a college student or someone near her age?
>> ARTICLE
> its pretty weird that he'd be having to be taught the basics of Volleyball when he just started being involved with the club...

Unless it's all a ruse! Maybe something happened, an injury to where he couldn't play anymore, but he loves the game and loves Karasuno so he can't stay away, but he also doesn't want to be remembered as a "has been" so he pretends to know nothing about the game while sponsoring the club.

I will admit it's pure speculation and there are a ton of holes in it, but I want to believe!
>> ARTICLE
Though that's still weird because they've already met people who knew the Little Giant like Ryu's sister and the Nekoma coach, and none of them have ever said anything about the sensei. So they'd all have to be in the ruse. I admit it would be cool though. What if they're not the same person but they're related?
>> ARTICLE
> they've already met people who knew the Little Giant like Ryu's sister and the Nekoma coach, and none of them have ever said anything about the sensei. So they'd all have to be in the ruse.

Not necessarily. I hardly look like I did when I was 16. If someone went through something life-changing, to where their personality/aura was different, it's not unthinkable that they wouldn't be recognized. Especially since none of them knew him closely, but only saw him play on the court.

>What if they're not the same person but they're related?

A definite possibility. Though I can admit the most likely scenario is that there's no connection between them at all.

6:55

After the clutch block by Tanaka and Tsukishima that drove Mad Dog over the edge. Coach Ukai and Advisor Takeda were cheering and she was making that face off to the side.

No one gonna talk about that Seijou guy going all 'dont you dare eff this up for my beloved senpais'? The entire dialogue from that scene starting from "sorry..but no" to throwing him against the wall and telling Mad Dog that he wouldn't let him drag dirt onto the senpai's court was incredible.

As always, an amazing episode. Loved the Mad Dog-chan stuff, makes him feel more like a character and less like a cardboard archetype cutout. The team interactions were on point as always.

" You need to face the team and have the team face you. "

Gosh, the chill that I felt when that ex national player said that quote. It's a very nice fit with the biggest struggle for Mad Dog. It's somehow a similar struggle with what Kageyama faced in first season. 

Also Tsukki's definitely the silent brain in Karasuno. He also used tactic that Sugawara taught him when they faced Seijoh in first season, the switch blocking. A very nice callback. 

The biggest problem of this series is how the episodes feel like 5 minutes every time. Even though I have read the manga, I couldn't help but feel pretty tense in this episode. 

>> ARTICLE
Fucking incredible episode, Haikyuu never fails to blow away my hype thrusters

So Haikyuu almost has me root for the opponents team again. Almost forgot Mad Dog was facing Karasuno for a while. Love how they do this

Its scenes like where Yahaba shirt fronted kyotani and shoved him against the wall that demonstrates just how much expression and life the animators give these characters.

We're finally seeing a studio being permitted to put some real love and detail into their work now and Haikyuu is a cut above the rest.

All right! Everyone's settled! Heart-tugging emotional flashbacks are executed and in place! Now I think all that's left is to duke it out. I kind of didn't realize how much I miss the dynamic duo of Hinata and Kageyama until the very end of this episode. Hinata hasn't been involved all that much up until now, and I reckon it's about time they started to rip it up and show Oikawa what they can do.

But man this was a great episode for Tanaka, Tsukki *and* Asahi. Tsukki the tactician. Tanaka smashing through points. Asahi with that killer serve! Please hurry and be next week again.

That background chant of people every time Oikawa serves is totally awesome, It's like charging up a killer move from DBZ.

Love how Tsukishima starts to shine now as he's one of my favorite characters from the series and will be way cooler in the future.

That super-awesome-accidental-didn't-mean-to last attack had a really good execution though.

I'm glad I'm not the only one, there's something so *satisfying* when they start chanting.

I looooooooooooved Kyotani's backstory. They're really good at crafting wonderful flashbacks and that was no exception. This week also sees the full-on return of Oikawa's infuriating serves which is one of my favorite aspects of Aoba Josai in general.

[Tsukki's fast thinking](http://i.imgur.com/UGTS84Y.jpg) and figuring others out was great. [Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/V7LRkd3.jpg) continues to be scary but he somehow looked even scarier and cold [when he was shown during practice](http://i.imgur.com/G44FpCM.jpg).

I still don't know how I fell so hard for a sports anime, and a sport I never even liked before. And got me to like characters originally set up as antagonists. Damn it Haikyuu. It's crazy how much I look forward to each ep but I'm also dreading the end of the season.

So as I do with every episode of Haikyuu, I watched the previous episode again (do the same shit with AoD) just to build the hype train! and in the previous episode, it seems to me like all the females are interested in Yamaguchi?! is this the thing?

Apparently it's called 'Thunder' from wikipedia

OK! Drunken Episode Recap: Tsuki does a thing where he pretty much owns dog-kun from the other team. There's a whole bunch of angry face making by the white team. Dog-Kun get a weird flash back that is not necessary and only put in for filler. The ball travels over the net causing Drama. Finally Hinata-kun hits the ball onto the white teams court using plot-armor even though he broke tradition by telling everyone how he fucked up yet still being too OP to fail. 

Predictions for next weeks episode: Kageyama enters the zone so that Hinata can hit the ball without making any noise creating a new serve "Silenced attack" only level 30 wizards can see it and you need legendary item "Antagonists ears" to hear it. Since nobody has access to Magic nothing happens and the white team is confused. 
>> ARTICLE
If you remember the reason the new quick was created was for Hinata to have time in the air to judge and guide its trajectory.

So in this quick's case, Kageyama saw it as an opportunity to give him a good ball just over the net for him to slam down with a steep angle. This, as you'll see next episode, is a new move created on-the-fly, proving that they've 'evolved'

It's not plot armor if this shit is a legal and valid technique in real volleyball

I don't really know why but that barbecue scene was like the most satisfying SOLish scene ever.
>> ARTICLE
I was just thinking that. All the different characters played off each other really well and everyone's personality really shined. There were so many great little conversations too. The managers comparing their aces, Tsukishima and Yamaguchi discussing the Kiyoko Fan Club, the captains acting like dads. They were tiny moments but it made it really feel like a group of people having fun at a barbecue.

This anime shows human relationships in a very optimistic yet real way.

I don't know how they do it, but every episode is so consistently amazing. Fantastic end to this arc and yet I'm getting somehow more hyped at what's coming up next for Karasuno.

I'm glad Tsukki had that cathartic moment with his brother. No silly continued misunderstandings, just two brothers being mature and talking.

One subtle thing I love in every opening of Haikyuu is the scene of Karasuno lined up versus other teams. You see the other teams seemingly unified with the same clothing set up and exact same pair of shoes, while Karasuno's teammates all have their own flair to them and different pairs of shoes. It's small, but it does a great job of emphasizing how each member of the Karasuno team is an individual person that when combined with the rest of the team makes up the sum of its parts. 
>> ARTICLE
one of the major themes of haikyuu is that what makes karasuno strong is not that they have a set strategy that works, but that theyre able to adapt. i think this is a visual cue pointing at that
>> ARTICLE
Last episode discussion, I commented, "Interested to see if he [Bokuto] gets over his emo mode and the owls win or if the crows keep it up and win," like somehow Fukurodani winning was dependent on Bokuto getting his act back together. But of course the show had to go and remind me that strong teams are strong not because of a single member, but the entire team. ^(especially Akaashi)

The brief scene between [Tsukishima and Akiteru](http://i.imgur.com/30CqXum.png) was probably the highlight of the episode for me. [Tsukki's rare smile](http://i.imgur.com/ZuptKct.png) being the highlight of the highlight. After Akiteru stopped being his motivation, Tsukki was just playing volleyball for some vague reason- maybe just to have something to do, maybe because Yamaguchi always urged him to- but now he's finally playing for his own reason. Tsukki's character development this season has been fantastic.

And the end of the episode, showing all the teams preparing for the official matches about to start, was so hype. Hinata and Kageyama continuing to perfect the new quick (in front of Ukai senior, with the crow-flying metaphor too...), Oikawa (presumably) working on an even more terrifying serve, Ushiwaka, and even Aone...SO HYPE!

^(shout out to the soundtrack for being epic as always)
>> ARTICLE
This show would have been my favourite piece of media ever if Tsukishima had his "moment" with a feint like hinata did. He seems like the type of character that would be fuelled by looking down on people.
>> ARTICLE
But Tsukki has already done a lot of feints like Hinata did. In fact anytime we've seen him go to spike the ball he's pretty much always done a feint. It's also not as big of a deal for Tsukki as it is for Hinata. Tsukki is already taller than most people so he naturally looks down on people. Hinata on the other hand is shorter than most everyone so it's more of a big deal to get the other team looking up at him.

Also Tsukki may be an asshole, but I'd say he gets fuel from being irritating and riling people up more than being arrogant.
>> ARTICLE
Wait... did we just get another a little bit of Tsukki development? 

God bless.
>> ARTICLE
And we are only half done yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking his development so far. I also like his snide remarks to Hinata and Kageyama, always get a chuckle outta b then
>> ARTICLE
I'mma guess that he's gonna hit some disappointment along the way, as a result of his opening up to the idea of getting involved in the competition more wholeheartedly. His brother will be his saving grace.

It's like that in real life too.I mean.Whatever you will do , at first you will get a 'punch in your face'.You will have sentiments like disappointment and frustration.It all depends on how you are able to get up and continue

More playing, fewer metaphors please!

That said, I really love how that despite being very very competitive, each of the schools cheer each other on and look out for each other - just like how Akaashi looks out for for the choking Kageyama (eat slower jeez) and all the other schools players for Yachi. They all have such a pure love for volleyball, that they want to make sure everyone has fun playing it, that I can't help but smile when I see all their interactions
>> ARTICLE
godbless there are 16 more episodes holy shit we're only 11 in wtf
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy to hear that, I love Saturdays mostly for this show
>> ARTICLE
My man between rakudai and haikyuu I cannot explain how hyped I am for next saturday.
>> ARTICLE
* As a anime-only watcher (I really need to start the manga), the new teams being introduced for the tournament gets me so hyped! Now that I like all the players from Aoba Josai, Fukurodani, Nekoma, and Ubagawa, I can't wait to see all the new people :D Tongue-piercing-kun looks interesting.

* All the managers are so cute! Red-hair-chan is my spirit animal. Onigiri are indeed delicious.

* Poor Yachi... I'd be terrified too, girl.

* AKITERU! Best onii-san is in da house! That little heart-to-heart is just what Tsukki needed, I think.

So fucking hyped for this tournament!

There can't be a single person in the world that dislikes Barbeque.

BBQ Sauce makes me so fucking sick. So i just chill around with a Potato Salad getting weird looks by everyone.

You and me both

Hm... vegans?
>> ARTICLE
Barbecued vegies and tofu are still delicious.
>> ARTICLE
I'm excited to see Yachi be excited for the first game :)
>> ARTICLE
50% of my enjoyment for this series is seeing Yachi's reactions to stuff.

[This scene](https://49.media.tumblr.com/6426bf28cddb47a058ffc87753b26aa3/tumblr_nz9jprqmZa1uh6s9xo5_r1_1280.gif) was hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
She has just been such a wonderful addition. Was hoping Hinata would save her there though!!
>> ARTICLE
I like her so much, I'm already considering who to remove on my MAL favorite characters list to make room for her, and we're not even halfway through the season yet.

How did we ever manage without Yachi? She almost makes me forget that we're 11 episodes in and haven't had an official game yet.
>> ARTICLE
Sasuke from Itachi-yama XD
>> ARTICLE
I loved the face of Ukai (old) when Hinata and Kageyama were able to successfully execute the combo. 

could someone make a gif of that [**please?**](#katoupls)
>> ARTICLE
Man this show continues to be amazing. I was actually shocked when I reached the half-way mark because I felt so satisfied at the barbecue scene that I felt like the episode could have ended.

The Kiyoko fan club was absolutely way more amazing animated. The whole scene was just a lot of fun between the characters and it was wholly satisfying.

Definitely excited for the tournament to start and see some hype volleyball action.
>> ARTICLE
Really loved the slice of life feeling that all the 2nd season episodes gave off so far. While it is quite a change of pace from the 1st season, we got to see old characters fleshed out more and new characters introduced (Yachi <3) so its a welcome change. That being said, I can't wait for next week as it seems like the series is heading back towards its original fast pace from season 1 with one intense tournament match after another.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if it'll end next episode, or is a 24 episoder?
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't make sense for them to start a new arc next week if it was going to be the last episode. Its 24 episodes. Same as last season.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how far they will take the season. Considering how much the manga draws out the spring tournament it really cannot fit into this season - the finals seems like it could take a whole season of its own :/
>> ARTICLE
I would imagine it goes until before the finals
>> ARTICLE
25 episodes I think!
>> ARTICLE
yep!!
>> ARTICLE
God damn I'm so fucking hyped to see not only Ushiwaka play, but to see how Kiryu and Sakusa look and play as well!
>> ARTICLE
I can already tell that the unknown first year they mentioned is going to be a difficult opponent. It's also kind of cool that Ushiwaka is taking Hinata seriously.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, did they imply that there are two other opponents above and beyond Shiratorizawa? The boogeyman of 35 episodes has even bigger boogeymen standing behind him? Hype as fuck to see what those guys can do.

This show keeps me so engaged week to week. I was fuckin upset that they lost today, and it was just a practice match. Go out there and win those real games next week guys! We're all behind ya! 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the other guys are more versatile? Or maybe they're on a better team overall? I'm looking forward to more information about them later in the story.
>> ARTICLE
And it starts. Chill chapter, a nice way to put an end to this arc (Bokuto :'( ). But on the bright side, we are finally going to start the tournament and got a glimpse of possible new teams that might be playing against Karasuno in the new tournament. 

This chapter covered from page 10 of chapter 95 up to chapter 97.
>> ARTICLE
where in the manga is this ep i want to start reading the manga
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 98
>> ARTICLE
thanks
>> ARTICLE
What chapter of the manga did this cover? I want to start reading from here on.
>> ARTICLE
This episode covered up to and had the more important parts of Chapter 98 so you could start at 99, but it wouldn't hurt to go back and read 98 as well.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I got to the first commercial break and thought it was over but there was more! So happy. This show is great. Look at all those new characters!

omg next is the tournament. There are SO MANY scenes I want to see animated. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!

Fun to see another barbecue scene! Can't wait to see them play some real games now

Couldn't help but to smile in the entirety of that barbecue scene :)

Very excited. Torn between waiting out week by week or just read manga.

Hyped for the tournament!

Does anyone have a gif of that spike?

I have been looking around but unable to find the answer.Can anyone tell me the name of the song being played at 10:45~ to 13:20~ .During the scene when Mary uses the new spell she has gained.Any help would be greatly appreciated as it is currently my favorite song from the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't like how they changed the scene in the BBQ where the girl was scared of everyone taller than her, in the manga it showed only 4 guys and one of them was Asahi, I found it funny how she was still scared of him but here it was different.
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt really... Meh compared to the last couple. Only interesting scene for me was the brief moment between glasses and his brother. The BBQ scenes were a bit heavy handed for me I guess. Oh well, tourney hype next week.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I felt this arc was too long with little reward
>> ARTICLE
Oh the return on investment for the first 11 episodes will be fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they consistently manage to make every other team likable with their own distinct personalities. They really know how to make characters.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of main points of this show. Almost every character seems really likable or unique to me. Even the side characters got some interesting moments. 

Creating an interest for all these characters in such a short time is brilliant work. 
>> ARTICLE
This is what I really love, I get attached to teams and just don't want anyone to lose. Why can't all the teams be happy?
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu and Ace of Diamond both do an amazing job at this.
>> ARTICLE
Woo Ace of Diamond, people need to watch it, like right now! 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for mentioning this. It's something almost no anime can do properly.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps, Yowa Pedal, PPTA, Kuroko, Ace of Diamond to name a few...
>> ARTICLE
When it comes to sports shows I don't think that's really true. In Baby Steps I felt all the competitors were well designed. In Yowamushi Petal I couldn't decide which team I wanted to win.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this. At one point, I even wanted Midosouji to win in YowaPeda...
>> ARTICLE
Also Hajime no Ippo. Like it's hard not to root for both people in the ring. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it depends I think. Like in Kuroko (S1 at least) or Prince of Tennis, a lot of times both teams just seem to hate each other and everyone is mean. Baby Steps is definitely like Haikyuu in its ability to make the opponents distinct and cool.
>> ARTICLE
That's a trope I hate in some sports anime. Sometimes they act hostile to each other even outside matches, like "you're my opponent, don't talk to me". That's why seeing the character interactions in Haikyuu is refreshing.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that kind of the point of the first season of Kuroko? The fact that the GOM became un-likeable is kind of the reason for the plot, and GOM aside most of the characters in Kaijo and Shutoku were friendly. Kasamatsu and Takao are the ones the spring to mind

Also you are forgetting Seiho in that assessment the team that used martial arts movements the were a very fun team.
>> ARTICLE
In Knb the teams become friendly after they are beaten once. Before that happens they are usually shown as very hostile while in haikyuu or baby steps the hostility that is sometimes shown feels like a normal rivalry between teams
>> ARTICLE
Well considering the fact that Seirin has a reputation as a seriously competitive upstart, team compared to Karasuno which has always held some level of respect. So it's kind of t be expected that the teams would e treated differently. Karasuno started with friendships Seirin had to make them 

The main point though is that Haikyuu and Kuroko are coming at things from completely different perspectives. Kuroko is all about strong players becoming stronger through teamwork, where as Haikyuu is the reverse. Players that already have team work becoming stronger.
>> ARTICLE
Johzenji was extremely fun to watch and I got caught up in their excitement too.
>> ARTICLE
They also look different which is great too. I feel like sometimes sports shows make the opposing team just look bland, but somehow Haikyuu is great at making characters look unique and cool but not too ridiculous looking.
>> ARTICLE
I am not so sure with that. Some of these characters look kinda similar too me sometimes. [Tanaka got a twin?](http://i.imgur.com/zUrzaWE.jpg)

I still like these characters because their personalities are different.
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 and Prince of Tennis had very likable rivals. Compared to Kuroko anyways...
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 was also great at this. All of the enemy teams had very distinctive traits
>> ARTICLE
i'm still salty about how they ended that.
>> ARTICLE
How did they end it in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Yea, the anime just fails to be as good as the manga
>> ARTICLE
Daichi-san really fits the role of a captain, even though he doesn't stand out that much, he really is the backbone of the team and I'm glad he got a bit of recognition this episode.  
Also, overall, I think haikyuu!! really is the most enjoyable anime to watch, can't wait for the Rolling..Headbutt!!
>> ARTICLE
I also really like how they contrasted Daichi's role as the "foundation" of the team against Johzenji's complete lack of structure as a team. I'm guessing something's going to change within Johzenji's team dynamics next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked how they had that focus on Daichi. Showing how Karasuno is able to play around *because* they have that strong backbone, whereas the other team falls apart a bit once they start losing.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. I almost teared up at tht. Daichi finally got him moment to shine
>> ARTICLE
Hinata is spiderman confirmed and poor Kageyama blocking the ball with his face.

That earlier exchange between Tsukishima and his brother made that face block even better

Where is the NSFW tag, two girls said "spank" in this episode how lewder can an anime get.
>> ARTICLE
Females can't say spank? 
>> ARTICLE
This aint no hentai! 
>> ARTICLE
I am pretty sure I heard Runa using the term "hentai" too.
>> ARTICLE
That word means pervert or weirdo to in Japanese 
>> ARTICLE
Although it's true that they did both say "spank" (), that wasn't the word that the boys were focused on in Japanese. The Johzenji manager, I think Hana was her name, said "ass" () and that's what they were excited about because it's kind of rough language for a Japanese girl to use. And then what Kiyoko said afterwards was "butt" () which is more polite and not as surprising as what Hana said. But since it's Kiyoko they were excited about it anyway. So what I'm trying to say is in Japanese the focal point was "ass" and "butt", not "spank".
>> ARTICLE
Amongst other things, I'm always so excited for one of the bench warmers to get a chance to shine - [this was a very cute moment to see between Narita, Ennoshita and Kinoshita](http://i.imgur.com/43969At.png).
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even know that guy existed 
>> ARTICLE
[They often just leave them out of frame completely.](http://i.imgur.com/1wYmPjD.png) It's basically the only thing I can think of in Haikyuu!! that I don't really like. Poor guys always get left out :(

Well they only show the guys that are on the field in that picture. Sugu is not there either
>> ARTICLE
True, that probably wasn't the best example. But you get what I mean :P
>> ARTICLE
Well yes, they will probably get more screentime when they become more involved. All series have backround characters, hopefully they will move out from that
>> ARTICLE
...aaaand it's over :(

Man I legit thought that the episode was only like two-thirds over when they were like "the second round really has begun".

Hmmmm I can actually see this happening! They're both third years and the manga [](/s "only just finished this tournament's final match"), so if she shows up again with Johzenji members in the near future you never know :)

Nah man, how about Karasuno's female volleyball team captain?
>> ARTICLE
A thousand times YES!
>> ARTICLE
Like her a lot too!
>> ARTICLE
Daichi and female volleyball captain is my otp

Aww, I didn't notice that. It's awesome symbolic moment :)

All the attention Sawamura got this episode was amazing. He's such an important member of he team, who rarely gets attention in and out of the show.

> Also loved this symbolic moment of Suwamura representing the Johzenji motto perfectly

Oh that's a nice touch that I didn't notice, love it <3
>> ARTICLE
I've read this chapter 3 or 4 times and never realized he was standing in front of their banner and that it described him perfectly...

Just started watching this, I know your comment is a month old, but yeah it's probably because manga isn't colored, so it's much easier to tell in the anime.

This episode covered chapters 109-113 of the manga. 

Ch. 112 cover page: ["The entirety of the court rides on these hands"](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l-IThRcLoJI/U7w7lP91dsI/AAAAAAAAxtE/pF-_DAgZ-aI/s16000/001.png) - Daichi's hands that is, as the caption and illustration refers to him. It's very fitting for this episode. 

Daichi's my favorite character, and this episode/these chapters are some of my favorites because he finally gets some of the spotlight [](/s "not to mention the upcoming chapters...!") and viewers who might not really have noticed him before hopefully now are starting to see that he's actually really useful as a player and as a captain. 

Oh, and also [Narita](http://i.imgur.com/Ip4CQVk.jpg) getting to play is certainly worthy of mention. It's nice when the 2nd year trio get their time to shine. (Nice little bit with [Ennoshita and Kinoshita](http://i.imgur.com/AoVcT0Y.jpg) sighing in relief at Narita's success, since he's essentially is representing the three of them while he's on court). 

[Yamaguchi pushing Kageyama](http://i.imgur.com/iLbTIhO.jpg) was pretty enjoyably animated. Might turn it into a Gif. 

As others said, the symbolism with [Daichi and the Johzenji banner](http://i.imgur.com/Cv2aANs.jpg) is pretty great.  They did it in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/StPYa0L.jpg) too.

The music swelling and cutting off at Daichi's little support speech was a nice touch, especially since it was accompanying his [badass pose.](http://i.imgur.com/NXZ9gL5.jpg) (You can also see the Jouzenji banner in the background). 

Oh, and good times what with Daichi getting to [spike the ball](http://i.imgur.com/7rBx8RX.jpg) and actually earn a point. It makes sense because Sugawara's the server, and he and Daichi work really well together, and we don't get to see Daichi spike the ball all that often, so it was great to see. 

(Also [Daichi and Asahi's faces](http://i.imgur.com/P5PN9hD.jpg) at Terushima's failed spike/synchronized attack were brilliant)

[Daichi save 1](http://i.imgur.com/LUQrkot.jpg) | [Save 2](http://i.imgur.com/GkADLVF.jpg) | [Save 3/earliest save](http://i.imgur.com/dqZ1W7e.jpg)

[**Well... this is /r/anime after all...**](#nocomment)

If anyone didn't understand the reference that Tsukki's brother made at the beginning, it was a joke on Shiratorizawa's ace's nickname, Ushiwaka. His actual name is **Ushi**jima **Waka**toshi. The reference was to the story of Ushiwaka and Benkei:

>Ushiwaka overcoming Benkei at the Gojo Bridge

>This triptych illustrates an episode from the life of the popular hero Yoshitsune (1159-89), who was also known as Ushiwaka-maru (young ox).

>On one of his nightly outings from the temple, 12-year-old Yoshitsune encountered Benkei on the Gojo Bridge in Kyoto. Benkei, a wild giant of a man, had been told by a sword-smith that he could forge a magic sword from the tips and cutting edges of a thousand blades. He obtained the swords by attacking samurai warriors crossing the Gojo Bridge.

>One night he saw the young Ushiwaka approaching; he was carrying what would be his one-thousandth sword. Benkei attacked him without delay, but the youth was too quick for him and managed to defeat him. Benkei was so impressed that he promised to serve and follow Ushiwaka. 

So hopefully the line "Whether it's Ushiwaka or Benkei, you can stop 'em!" makes a little more sense now.

Watching Johzenji play is a ton of fun. Just nice to see players who enjoy the game so much, even if their [attacks](http://imgur.com/z5oSFcE.gif) sometimes fail.

[Kageyama's nosebleed](http://imgur.com/GU7G3mQ.gif) was pretty funny, too and it was good to see Suga play again and Narita (for the first time really?), if only for a little while.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama, now is not the time to be emulating Hinata's face-recieving skills
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I teared up a bit during Daichi's part, we don't get to see too many moments of him so I was really happy about that.

This episode was just perfect, gosh I love Haikyuu. Is it possible to get more hype every week? I can't wait another week!
>> ARTICLE
It's also lovely for the series to highlight just how much underlying influence he has on his team and even opponents (e.g. Misaki and Terushima in this episode)!
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree! Like he said himself, he may not be able to make fancy plays, but he can give the team a solid foundation. Being able to influence not only his teammates, but also his opponents, now that's a captain. 

Oh and thanks for the screenshot of Daichi with Johzenji's banner, I didn't even notice that at first, but now I appreciate that scene even more.

Just caught up, another thing to add to the "painful weekly wait" pile.

As an unathletic person who couldn't give less of a shit about sport I never thought I'd find myself watching a sports anime, but after seeing it's steady scores all through last cour and reading nothing but good things I decided to give Haikyu a go. *Damn* the hype is real. It's so exciting and intense, and the characters are interesting and fun. Such a wholesome and refreshing anime.
>> ARTICLE
same. I also started watching kuroko's basketball after catching up to haikyuu, it's pretty fun too, give it a try!
>> ARTICLE
It's the human aspect. Even nonathletic people can attribute themselves to the way people interact under pressure/strife, and how they come to succeed, or resolve those issues.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I have read the manga multiple times, the moment Kageyama said "I'm not bleeding, I'm okay!" while the blood is still coming out from his nose, manages to make me laugh. 

Daichi.... The back of the captain! With some "wild members" on Karasuno, he's the perfect captain. 
>> ARTICLE
When I played football, I got a bleeding nose, and had precisely the same reaction. It's nothing to you, but you are still required to sit the next 5-10 minutes out, which sucks.
>> ARTICLE
So on this day a week ago I was at like... episode 4 of S1 and now that I've powered through the rest of the series and caught up with the current episode, I want to express just how much fun it was. The hype is still real and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to wait patiently on a week-to-week basis without jumping into the manga.

As for the episode itself, it was a fairly strong one (as expected) and I'm glad that team-dad Daichi's getting some of the spotlight and really emphasizing that while he doesn't stand out/doesn't get focused on muh, he's incredibly important to the dynamic of the team and their chances of success. I've come to love Karasuno so much (and so quickly) that I just want to see more and more of everyone that makes up this amazing team of dweebs.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty solid episode all around, but the fact that the pacing isn't that fast makes me think that [speculation](/s "we might be getting another sad ending :(") well, that or that the season will end abruptly.

[Huge Manga Spoilers, Don't read if you don't want to spoiled at all!](/s "So the recent chapters was released and I can guarantee you that there won't be a sad ending. Long Story Short, Karasuno beat Shiratorizawa and goes to the nationals.")

>> ARTICLE
> [Spoilers/Speculation](/s "We will get as far as the Seijoh fight, but not Shiratorizawa. So it will be a "good" ending, but I'll be sad we won't see the "final" boss for this arc. Unless, of course, they extend it another 6 or so episodes past 25... because there's not enough manga chapters past Shiratorizawa for a whole new season right now.") 


>> ARTICLE
I think I've enjoyed every Haikyuu opening. This one is just too good.
>> ARTICLE
Was expecting Kageyama to call Hinata a dumbass when he missed his serve :(
>> ARTICLE
Johzenji is definitely my favorite team so far. From the few times the stars aligned and made it happen for me I can attest that there is nothing more fun than a team full of outstanding athletes running around just on instinct and reflex with no level of coordination. The show represents that well with them pulling amazing plays out of their ass but then completely failing at the most basic things. I'd love a spinoff series of them.

This anime is way too good, episodes can end on a non-cliffhanger and I still can't wait for the next one to air. I'm hyped like Johzenji team after watching the end of Cardinals-Packers and this episode.

Huh Terushima has a tongue piercing, I don't think I've ever seen one in an anime before
>> ARTICLE
Wait... I just started this episode 5 minutes ago, what happened?

I really liked the focus on Daichi. He is one of my favourites from Karasuno. He is just so solid.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the emphasis on Daichi this episode was really well-deserved. I also loved Aone finally speaking (his friendship with Hinata is so adorable).

More importantly, I am now completely convinced of the composer's, Yuuki Hayashi's, brilliancy. The piece that starts right after 8:30 is amazing (jazz piano? I'm *in love*), as well as the one right after 17:00, and the one after that, at like ~18:10. I will be keeping an eye out for anime Hayashi does the soundtrack for from now on.

"I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete." is one of the most badass quotes from the show so far, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata showed him so hard. Gaaa, that gave me a righteous boner.
>> ARTICLE
What does "from the concrete" mean?
>> ARTICLE
Ushiwaka essentially said they were below the level of unfertile soil (as his analogy went) which Hinata vocalized as concrete. It basically means they're trash among trash.
>> ARTICLE
Also connects back to the metaphor of Karasuno being crows and crows (and cats) congregating around trash heaps. Which, well, if you remember the Karasuno-Nekoma rivalry... "Battle At The Garbage Heap."
>> ARTICLE
Since the big guy kept on talking they are the fertile soil, while Aoba Johsai is the infertile soil, it implies that Karasuno is a concrete. (Plants symbolism)

EDIT: Spelled Karasuno as 'Karasuma'
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, that makes sense
>> ARTICLE
He says "what are, we concrete?" a few lines before that "from the concrete" quote. 
>> ARTICLE
I love this metaphor because plants *can* grow through concrete but only the strongest can do so, the ones who persevere for the longest. Great metaphor for Karasuno.

I loved this episode so much! Missed Haikyuu!! more than any other anime, really.

Loved how they managed to keep that animation and camera-work style from the 1st season.

Also, OP by Spyair and ED by Galileo Galilei, what can be better!
>> ARTICLE
The Haikyuu!! fan base may be small on /r/anime (simply because /r/anime users don't give sports anime a try), but those who do follow it tend to love it and are really passionate about it.

How can some one not give sports anime a try?! Sports anime are the fucking best!
>> ARTICLE
The only sports anime I have ever watched are Haikyuu and Baby syeps, and they are both amazing. Both have little recognition here however :(
>> ARTICLE
eyeshield 21, major, cross game and one outs are a must watch

I started watching Haikyuu and it got me hooked on other sports anime. They're some of the best imo

Don't forget racing is a sport (if you did!) capeta and initiald are amazing anime.

Also there is a board game anime is freaking amazing, hikaru no go. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I didn't enjoy those. I really liked the baseball anime. Big Windup, Haikyuu and Kuroko are my top 3 sports anime, followed by Baby Steps. I like technical ones a lot 
>> ARTICLE
No yozakura pedal :(

That's not racing, that's biking :D

That's probably my 5th or 6th. Not as high because I wasn't a huge fan of the character design but I marathoned through both seasons in like 3 days
>> ARTICLE
This. I never thought I'd be into sports anime, but after a couple episodes of Haikyuu!! I was hooked.
>> ARTICLE
The only one I have some trouble with rewatching nowadays is Prince of Tennis, the super moves just get ridiculous haha. 
>> ARTICLE
There are a couple anime from each genre of sports I feel like that about.

Kuroko and basketball, capeta and gokarts, Hikaru no go and 'go', baby steps and tennis. 

If you didnt like sports/volleyball but like haikyuu, give those I listed a try.

should try baby steps if you haven't

I just finished Kuroko no Baske, and half of the VA cast works in Haikyuu. Gets confusing.

The whole time I just had this big stupid smile on my face, the wait in between was too damn long. Love the opening and looks like there's a ton of new characters and challenges this is going to be amazing.

Exactly my thoughts! I didn't realize it was airing today but it has instantly increased my mood. So hyped.

Probably the best first episode I've seen this season yet and an incredible Haikuu!! episode by itself. Set the tone of the season but was hilarious and stern at the same time. Very, very excited for the rest. Just wish I could binge this season like I did most of last season
>> ARTICLE
Hype, chillz then tears, coz episode end. Fuck this how do i endure waiting for another ones... Pls gibe me full season already ;___;
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! proved to me that sports anime wasn't always about the sport, and that sports anime has some of the best character development the medium can offer.

I love this show. I absolutely *adore* it.
>> ARTICLE
Check out capeta/initald and hikaruu no go if you haven't. 
>> ARTICLE
Major does this really damn well.
>> ARTICLE
You're absolutely right.  Major, while technically a "sports anime" always felt to me more like the life of Goro growing from a child into a man with the people around him and baseball.  Both of those aspects were incredibly important to his growth, as he wouldn't have been able to become the man that he is at the end of the series if it weren't for his friends and family or baseball.  He learned many life lessons from playing baseball and from the people around him as well, and became a better man for it.

...great, now I want to rewatch Major.

P.S.  If you haven't checked out Major yet, I strongly urge you to do so.  It may not become a favorite of yours like it did me, but I can't see very many people hating this series, as it's just a great watch.  And while Major is a longer show, I promise you that it is, unfortunately, way too easy to get through and to marathon Major.  And you'll probably be missing it once it finally ends.  It's both heartwarming and heart wrenching at times, and is just a really fantastic story about one boy's growth into a man.  If you decide to do so, I'd recommend giving it about 10 episodes or so.  This isn't because the first 10 are bad by any means, (in fact, some may argue that these are some of the best episodes in the anime, even if season 5 is probably the best all around) it's just that you start to get more of a feel for it after about episode 7 or so.
>> ARTICLE
Okay friend, come down with us in baseball hell. We've got Major, Cross Game, and Ace of Diamond to drown you!
>> ARTICLE
Hajime No Ippo is pretty good in this way as well. You'd probably like Hikaru no Go if you gave it a chance. It's about a board game but it follows the same idea (character development).
>> ARTICLE
I also really like how the entire series isn't focused just on Hinata, it does a really good job on giving character development to other characters as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched pong pong?

Edit: Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

I was put off by the arstyle at first, but it's one of the best shows i've watched.

Yeah, the context where they meet Ushikawa is different in the manga. I'll use the spoiler tag just in case, but I don't think it's any major spoiler: [Haikyuu ch. 76](/s "In the manga they are being helped to study to raise their grades so they can go to Tokyo and notice they are in the neighborhood near Shiratorizawa, and then the same happens as in the anime. Not too relevant I guess, but makes it a bit more epic, I think.")

>> ARTICLE
I love that Kageyama doesn't know how to high-five
>> ARTICLE
Wh-Whoo....
>> ARTICLE
I've been preparing for this for the past three weeks, and now, I'm ready and IT'S HERE.

The OP is amazing, and I was expecting no less from SPYAIR. [Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/BVHv4Zh.png) looks adorable, and I can't wait to meet her and [Bokuto and Akaashi](http://i.imgur.com/6K8siS4.png). I haven't read the manga, but I know that they're supposed to be awesome, so I can't wait!

The whole opening sequence (after the OP) with the team practicing was imo the best way to start the second season, reminding us of lots of characters moves from S1 (Tsukishima's feint, Noya's rolling thunder, the freak quick, Asahi's spike, and Yamaguchi's slowly-improving serve to name a few). Plus, the new soundtrack playing during it was great! The whole thing got me pumped up for the rest of the episode/season.

Then the bit with everyone getting excited for a [Nekoma](http://i.imgur.com/CdJFMw7.png) rematch: Kageyama intensely anticipating getting to see Kenma set again, and Noya ready to out-libero Yaku.

Then [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/LdUjRL3.png) (poor Hinata).

[Takeda is out. He's done.](http://i.imgur.com/abVazor.png) Gotta love his unshakable faith in the ability of his team.

Then I CAN'T EVEN I just CAN'T handle Hinata and Kageyama being the idiots they are [running up the hill](http://i.imgur.com/nm0LaAm.png) screaming the whole while. (I love Kageyama [calling Hinata a dumbass](http://i.imgur.com/86tKQlq.png) again too) And then they just HAPPEN to be near Shiratorizawa and like super casually just like [run into Ushiwaka](http://i.imgur.com/YqHCk7D.png) (JAPAN!) while he's jogging? Is this real life?

Gotta love seeing more of Hinata's [crazy eyes](http://i.imgur.com/C5XqDyN.png), and Kageyama's [proud faces at Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/ZTA5nSD.png) (after Hinata [does the thing](http://i.imgur.com/GdKISm7.png)). [This](http://i.imgur.com/WeldXXB.png) is another great shot, and I especially love the contrast between the *single* white bird (shira "white" tori "bird"- though I think it generally translates to swan) vs. the "*team*" of crows. 

And the ED is amazing, too! What are the odds that two of my favorite Japanese bands do the OP *and* the ED?

I know I just finished rewatching the first season, but I really did miss this. These volley boys are all my faves. Can't wait for next week's episode! ^(I believe in them they can pass their exams *sweats nervously*)

Edit: a word, also wanted to say I totally didn't mean to document the episode in screenshots but it kind of just happened.
>> ARTICLE
This is just what I've gathered personally about names in Japanese, and I might be wrong, but here's my thoughts on the representation of a non-swan.

While  (hakuchou) as an actual word does mean swan usually, as a name (Shiratori), it can be just seen as a combination meaning of the two kanji that create it (ie. white bird). Sure, since names don't usually have concrete meanings, people are free to think whatever they want, so I'm sure some people would think of a swan, but any other white bird is just as valid.

And of course that bird looked way more badass than a swan would.
>> ARTICLE
Who is bokuto and akaashi?
>> ARTICLE
They're members of one of the Tokyo teams. Bokuto is my favourite.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata's blushy face around Kiyoko is my one of my favorite things. Whenever they boys do anything that is typical teenage boy antics, it makes me laugh :) 

That ED was so good! I'm so pumped for this season 
>> ARTICLE
> Then the bit with everyone getting excited for a Nekoma[

Kenma loses his phone when he sneezes and Kuroo is really proud that he caught it

> I especially love the contrast between the single white bird (shira "white" tori "bird"- though I think it generally translates to swan) vs. the "team" of crows.

This explains so much, I had always heard that the shira meant swan and was confused by why they showed an eagle for Ushiwaka


I think we saw part of the OP in the second PV? Every time they showed Yachi in the opening and closing I screamed (I really wanted her to be in episode one but soooooon). I might make a post in a bit (but it is hard to take screen shots as I don't have a crunchyroll account)

And now I kinda regret not joining any sport clubs back in school... Never thought I'd think like that?! This show is def in my top 5! It's ridiculous how much it means to me now... 
>> ARTICLE
Watch it every week, more hype this way.
>> ARTICLE
I vote for simulcast.
>> ARTICLE
Why not both?
>> ARTICLE
Then you'd miss out talking with everyone and sharing the gifs,etc.
>> ARTICLE
Just gonna plug /r/haikyuu here. Come visit and chat about the anime/manga/stuff
>> ARTICLE
The opening is just as hype as it's always been. I was just giggling crazily the entire time with a huge grin on my face. How I've missed Haikyuu!
>> ARTICLE
UUUUUAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS FINALLY HERE!!! [HYPE THRUST AT MAXIMUM](https://gfycat.com/ActualFeistyBettong) THEN [HOLY SHIT THIS FUCKING PART RIGHT IN YOUR FACE!](http://imgur.com/yMdZx8x) 
>> ARTICLE
The icing on the cake for that whole sequence was [Kageyama's sneer](http://i.imgur.com/1ZzDaAT.png) after witnessing that beauty.
>> ARTICLE
Here's the [manga page](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wm4_CDgiMr4/UkBoptlxVTI/AAAAAAABJMc/nqX1nnqjqig/s16000/015.png) for this scene - just as good.
>> ARTICLE
[Hinata with that 60 inch vertical](http://gfycat.com/CheeryYoungChameleon)

The animation during their practice match had so much energy, had to rewatch again since it was so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes! This gave me everything I wanted and more. I love how Haikyuu is animated, especially compared to the inconsistent (but still really good!) Kuroko's Basketball. Also, thighs. So many thighs. (I watch this for entirely legitimate reasons, I swear!)
>> ARTICLE
No excuses needed, everyone loves Daichi's thighs.
>> ARTICLE
And Kuroo's thighs. And Nishinoya's thighs. And Hinata's ass-- I mean uh. 
>> ARTICLE
Already getting development for Ushiwaka for the inevitable match against them later in the year, and there are so many matches already teased that I feel this season will skip a lot of the teambuilding and go straight into matches which is really nice.

BTW Have we had any word on how long the season will be?
>> ARTICLE
It would be a downright sin if it was anything but a full 2-cour
>> ARTICLE
I can't imagine anything other than 2-cour.
>> ARTICLE
Gaah! I should have participated in the rewatch! I don't remember much about the main characters aside from Hinata and Kageyama.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I didn't realized how much I missed this series. The whole episode was a highlight reel. Best stuff in no particular order, Hinata's get fucked face to white bird man, running to a new district, manager/hinata scene, rolling thunder animation.
>> ARTICLE
LETS GOOOOOOOO! Ready for all the smugness my boy Tsukishima is going to bring this season.
>> ARTICLE
What a great episode to start the season! I can't wait for what is to come.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I'd forgotten how incredible the OST is, though I have to say, I did enjoy that moment it cut out for the exam talk.

I'm really excited for this season, some of my favourite moments of the manga are coming up soon. Best boy [](/s 'Bokuto') and best girl [](/s 'Saeko') are coming !
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah it's finally out

New opening is great nice to hear SPYAIR again. Definitely more hyped than I was before will be rewatching.
>> ARTICLE
That Ushiwaka standoff was soooooooo hype. I'm going to love this season so much.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched the episode yet but from the title, next week will be the start of the training arc (my absolute fav arc!)




>> ARTICLE
AND WE'RE BACK!
>> ARTICLE
HYPEEE HYPEEE HYPEEE
>> ARTICLE
Man the dilema i want to watch this right away but then again i also want to binge watch it at the end of the season. One week wait is too much for this
>> ARTICLE
I just can't shake the fact that "rolling thunder" is a quote from the Tesla Tank in RA2.
>> ARTICLE
Back for volley, god I missed this series. First episode in and we already have our first mini-boss: Exams. 
>> ARTICLE
It's finally back!

Loving how determined everyone is especially Hinata and Kageyama

Those cat eyes stare always give me chills
>> ARTICLE
Ok and so I just rewatched the episode, and noticed something I didn't notice the first time around...did Ukai just...call Takeda...[Take-chan](http://i.imgur.com/uAlKDVG.png)?? He hasn't done that before, has he? It's hilarious!
>> ARTICLE
I think that was Tanaka, only he calls him that
>> ARTICLE
Aw, man. I guess it's funny no matter who said it, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
HINATA WAS CASTING SOME MOTHERFUCKING SHADE IN THIS EPISODE!!!

I am so hyped!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how it hasn't been mentioned that their teacher's VA also voices Izaya from Durarara!! When I watched the first season of Haikyuu!!, I never noticed it. This was probably because I watched the two series at different stages, but having just watched Durarara!!x2's second cour it's glaringly obvious that they have the same VA. It might only be because his voice suits Izaya so well, but it seems like it doesn't really fit their teacher. The VA himself just has such a cheeky intonation to all his sentences that suits Izaya really well. He's pretty much the Japanese version of Joker from the Batman series, a cheeky cunt who doesn't know when to STFU. The Haikyuu!! team's teacher doesn't really fit that.
>> ARTICLE
They have the same VA?? I didn't noticed that! That blows my mind.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata and Kageyama are so fkn intense I love it. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, the op and ed are soo good. The animation. The hype. The comedy!

This is motherfucking quality. Omg, i can't even right now. Everything is TOO GOOD, fuck!
>> ARTICLE
I forgot how amazing Haikyuu's production values were.
>> ARTICLE
**HYPE BOYS**
>> ARTICLE
I can't say much besides I'm glad Haikyuu is back and that its bringing the hype. I'm looking forward to another season of the show after picking up the manga during the first season. We got a lot of epic moments to see.
>> ARTICLE
I'm super impressed by how good of a first episode this was--perfect way to start off the second season.

Don't know what I was expecting, though. Haikyuu always brings maximum hype! Welcome back, boys!
>> ARTICLE
So much hype for this show!! I'm excited to see Aobajousai again and for Bokuto and Akaashi to show up!
>> ARTICLE
anyone got a gif on hinata stare?:DDD

Still one of my favourite sports anime.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

GIVE ME MORE

God damn i've missed this show
>> ARTICLE
What an epic first episode to the season. Was very faithful to the manga. Can't wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
MY ANIME BABIES ARE BACK! AHH THEY ARE SO CUTE! But in all seriousness this was a fantastic first episode, one of the better first episodes I have seen in a while. Every aspect of this show is so clean and I am really looking forward to see how it progresses. Super excited for this season of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Picking up where we left off from last season I see. This episode was pure quality, the first scenes were enough to plaster a ridiculously stupid smile on my face.
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to all the gifs. I love this show.

Man, I wish there was a women's volleyball anime with this much animation quality :D
>> ARTICLE
I just love Hinata and Kageyama together. They went from two dudes that hated each other's guts to being bros (and rivals).
>> ARTICLE
You'll love this season then! Their relationship goes through more twists and turns.
>> ARTICLE
Ha that ending when the teacher mentioned the finals lol
>> ARTICLE
my god im so fucking pumped for this

Galileo Galilei for ED. Spyair again for OP. Hype.

Noya!!!!

just waiting to watch it, HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Fucking so pumped that first ep got me hyped as shit
>> ARTICLE
i didnt expect it today what a nice surprise
>> ARTICLE
Missed this so much
>> ARTICLE
It's weird how much attention the anime gets around here, yet I can't seem to find the manga discussion threads over at /r/manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as big, but /r/haikyuu does have some manga discussions. 
>> ARTICLE
That's where I go for it.

The reason I still want to see the /r/manga discussion is because the opinions are always very different from the ones in the dedicated subs. People at /r/manga tend to have opinions of people outside the fandoms mixed in, and it makes the discussions different.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad this anime is back! In the top 3 for sports anime definitely! 
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for Season 2 since this anime first came out. This seriously has to be one of my favorite anime out there ,s o God damn excited lol 

EDIT: Well I just finished watching the episode and damn this was perfect 
>> ARTICLE
One of the best starts to season 2 I have seen in a while. Plenty of comedy with just the right amount of season 1 backstory. It only took me 5 mins to feel like I was picking up where season 1 ended.
>> ARTICLE
Been containing my urge to read the manga since Season 1 ended back in Spring 2014, and now it all paid off. Nothing beats Production I.G.'s animation in Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny how the best players are always bakas who can barely pass exams, ex Kagami from Kuroko no Basket.

  I can barely recognize some of the other players on the team (the no namers), do they get introduced at all?
>> ARTICLE
The second years (apart from Tanaka and Nishinoya) barely got any screentime in the 1st season. I don't remember their names either.
>> ARTICLE
They don't get much screentime in the manga either, but one of them will get a more prominent role preeeetty soon.
>> ARTICLE
SIDE TAIL GIRL IN OP, FUCK YEAHHH
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or did Hinata's voice sound a little deeper than last season?
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see this season being even better than the first one after watching that first episode! It's great that they're finally actually putting some focus on Shiratorizawa, who we never really saw before and I'm so hyped to see them go up against our Karasuno boys.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is so hype and happy fuck I missed this show so much don't wanna wait 1 week between episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Good to see Hinata back!
>> ARTICLE
they just kick-started the whole training arc with this episode! i'm so excited!

(it honestly moved so fast like we didn't even get a break from season 1, that's how it felt like.)
>> ARTICLE
First episode definitely living up to my hype, god this show is so enjoyable. I think I was grinning non-stop, everything was so perfect! Can't wait for the next few episodes with the introductions of Yachi, Saeko, and the Fukurodani players.
>> ARTICLE
"I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete." soooo SICK. I'm watching a large majority of the fall lineup of anime, and a few have started already, but Haikyuu started the best. Great pace, badass vibe, great buildup. Super hyped. 
>> ARTICLE
They cant expect us to wait a week for the next Episode man, not after that Hinata jump.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this first episode so much how am I going to survive until next week I'm not sure yet.

ANYWAY on to actually talking about the episode:

First off, who said it was okay to start an anime with [DEVASTATED HINATA FACE](http://i.imgur.com/FyPvmxE.jpg). I don't think it's okay at all how dare you. But I think they made up for it with [this line](http://i.imgur.com/Gh0XHpp.jpg) and [the ray of sunshine on Kageyama's face](http://i.imgur.com/pwvmrS6.jpg) lighting him up like the [love interest](http://i.imgur.com/59hg0tq.jpg) he really is (can we get any more obvious help my dirty fujoshi feelings are showing up).

But that OP tho I've missed the feel good vibe of Haikyuu's OPs they're just so inspirational and almost makes me want to go outside and play (emphasis on **almost**)

I love when Hinata snaps. [That face he makes](http://i.imgur.com/hkYtcYF.jpg) is precious and so is [Kagayama's proud smirk](http://i.imgur.com/LK8F0op.jpg) when he performs his [ridiculously high jump](http://i.imgur.com/LK8F0op.jpg). 

[Can't wait for Karasuno kick Shirotori's ass.](http://i.imgur.com/u9wmeYg.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I'd almost forgotten how much I love Shimizu.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is too badass and there is no need for guns or explosions to do that. Sooo much hype and yandere Hinata face FTW!
>> ARTICLE
Best opening episode for me this season so far.

CAN'T CONTAIN... HYPE!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering what shows I would watch this season and completely forgot this was starting again. Easy addiction to the rotation.
>> ARTICLE
It's finally here! so excited about this new season! I just have to point out how amazing the soundtrack of this series is, the song playing while Hinata states they're gonna defeat Shiratorizawa is just perfect, all the bgm helps to set up the mood incredibly. I'm on board of the hype train!
>> ARTICLE
Hype thrusters are reaching capacity. I miss that cold stare that Hinata does when he gets serious. This is going to be a great season
>> ARTICLE
Best Anime.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't stop smiling and laughing through the entire episode, so many badass moments and characters introduced...definitely one of the best opening episodes of a second season.
>> ARTICLE
The world building is incredible. I never would've expected this out of a sports anime until I watched Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
****
>> ARTICLE
I did a video review of the episode : https://youtu.be/rYhcMo57TVA check it out if you want ;)

can someone tell me where I can watch it that isn't Crunchyroll please?

I would legit suck a dick for a CR pass right now....

>Tanaka looks good with a banana.

Ah, what an unexpected... development.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as she thought of that, [Kageyama reacted.](http://i.imgur.com/vZuyzla.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
That translation was a little weird. "A banana suits Tanaka well" would have been better, implying that he looks like an ape.
>> ARTICLE
The scene after that with kageyama wouldn't make much sense then.
>> ARTICLE
She didn't say it out loud so there's zero connection regardless of how it's translated..
>> ARTICLE
It is for the viewer's delight.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. It's from the manga where it more correctly translated as [this](https://41.media.tumblr.com/be560e187c5df8f2f493238312930139/tumblr_inline_nzmhyz6ew81qiwb0x_540.png). She wasn't complimenting him.
>> ARTICLE
You make me sad.

*lowers OTP flag*
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, but hey it's at least funny.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame because now Tumblr is aflame with "Kyouko is a fujoshi!" posts 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, that is pretty much what I got from it
>> ARTICLE
That's the correct translation actually.
>> ARTICLE
An entire episode with Yachi bouncing up and down and raising her arms in happiness like a child is a good one.

Yachi best girl whooop

Considering the success of SnK, I wouldn't be surprised if that was intentional.

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
[Ryu was hilarious before the match started](http://imgur.com/1kisvFB.gifv) and I like how Kageyama gave him a little acknowledging bow at the end.
 
Kinda expecting Hinata to struggle a bit at first in the next match.
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka is my favorite. Loved those moments and his faces. What I also like is how he's such a bro and his laugh,
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama was always respectful to his seniors. He's an arrogant c*nt, but he knows respect.
>> ARTICLE
I've always liked how they try to give even the random fodder teams their own backstory and development. 
>> ARTICLE
They did more than just try.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta say this has been my favorite thing about Haikyuu you actually kind of feel for the other team. Though I'm kind of a sucker for that stuff, especially considering my favorite part of the first season was the whole segment that was from the perspective of the "loser" teams during the tournament.


>> ARTICLE
Kageyama looks good with a banana too
>> ARTICLE
[Tanakas faces](http://i.imgur.com/1kisvFB.gifv) fcking killed me

this is me in ranked matchmaking haha.

His faces are always the best

>> ARTICLE
Ugh, Haikyuu really has the best characters. You can't help but love even the most minor ones. Captain Rooster-head is awesome and needs a hug ;-;

Also, baby Asahi with the shorter hair is fucking adorable.
>> ARTICLE
Captain Rooster hair reminded me of a pokemon. Can't put my finger on which one though.

[Petilil](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Petilil_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)), maybe?

Getting that last point was so intense!!
>> ARTICLE
I think it looks a lot better and more frightening in the anime. 

Thanks for the comparison.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because there's more detail on the eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
You are probably right, it seems to be the only bigger difference.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata looks like a kid lot more in the manga version, no wonder people keep thinking he is a middle schooler.
>> ARTICLE
From that image above, you can see that the manga Hinata has a wider face and rounder cheeks; definitely makes him look like a kid.
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka really is a monkey..
These episodes just keep getting shorter and shorter it seems like. I just can't wait to see the current manga arc animated!
>> ARTICLE
How many source material is out there? Will the second season cover everything that is released so far?
>> ARTICLE
The manga still has a while to go
>> ARTICLE
No I highly doubt that. This episode covered chapters 99, 100, 101 and a part of 102. The last chapter released is chapter 187.
I would guess it might end with [Manga spoilers](/s "them beating Aoba Johsai before tackling Shiratorizawa")
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering where they were going to end too, but [Manga Spoilers](/s "after I finished reading the Seijou match, I figured that would be a perfect place to end this season.  It would make a good parallel.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that seems more likely.. It will still be pretty hype for that to happen, but I just want more Tsukishima scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope Haikyuu never ends and will fill the hole Hunter x Hunter left T_T
>> ARTICLE
Yachi's quiet "Yeah" was a game breaker.
>> ARTICLE
This and the last play of the match were the best moments of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Let us all take a moment to appreciate [sad baby Asahi and his short hair](http://i.imgur.com/Hguyhxk.png).

And then, while [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/tVJS1Dk.png) (seriously what even is his hair) was [motivating his team](http://i.imgur.com/NEfq8tk.png), the soundtrack that was playing, which was one we had heard before, played a part of the track that we *hadn't* yet heard and it was magnificent. From around ~18:50 to ~19:05. ^(I love Haikyuu!!'s entire soundtrack so much)

And [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/90fcbdc94fb05aec4acc021ce9e756b8/tumblr_n63lf6MZP71ruabdjo2_500.jpg) turns into [this](http://i.imgur.com/OelpCcH.png), which just was a fantastically weird/funny scene, but I loved it. Silly Hinata. In particular, [Kageyama's reaction to Hinata was perf](http://i.imgur.com/G5LPxxi.png). He's thinking, like, "why would you even be scared? I'm here, so you're gonna be invincible."

me: *dies at how Hinata and Kageyama support one another*

Excited now that we're seeing Karasuno actually competing! Now to wait another week...
>> ARTICLE
Do you know what the song/ost is called that plays at that time?
Around 17:50 to 19:20 ??? I really want to know so I can play it!! n_n
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, the OST for Haikyuu!! Second Season hasn't yet been released, so it could be a little while before we know what the songs are called.
>> ARTICLE
That guy looks like [this.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/9/91/255Torchic.png/250px-255Torchic.png)

or [this](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/c/ca/650Chespin.png/250px-650Chespin.png)
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Captain Akki, but I couldn't take him 100% seriously because his hair is god damn distracting.

Also, the team in green that Karasuno are about to play against gives me the Date Tech vibe.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like a big difference between Date Tech and this new team is going to be that while Date Tech relied on all of its team members to create a giant, imposing wall, Kakugawa (the new green team) will show how one individual can make a huge (pun sort of intended) difference.
>> ARTICLE
GO GO RET'S GO RET'S GO DATEKO
>> ARTICLE
I knew that guy from the other school was going to redeem himself and dive for that final ball, but it still gave me chills!

I'm getting burnt out on Anime but Haikyuu is one of the only shows that I still love watching.

>> ARTICLE
My eyes were getting a little teary when he thanked his former captain. I love how even the side characters in this show are really relatable and have fairly unique character designs. (dat captain hair style though...)
>> ARTICLE
Best animated show of the season and maybe the year.
>> ARTICLE
yep, except for one punch man haha
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of which, the first few episodes of this season of Haikyuu had a crazy amount of animation. I really hope they didn't blow their budget/effort on those.
>> ARTICLE
The animation this episode was amazing, like every scene was so fluid and pretty and conveyed all the right messages.
>> ARTICLE
the broad attack animation is damn fluid
>> ARTICLE
Loving the tournament already! I'm almost as hyped [as](http://i.imgur.com/MOCp39u.jpg).[them](http://i.imgur.com/5Wxdwxb.jpg)!

A [serious Hinata face](http://i.imgur.com/WlQ4mGq.jpg) appears! Really like it when this happens. [Tanaka's usual zen stance](http://i.imgur.com/kIJJZi7.jpg) was hilarious, he even [thanked Kageyama with it!](http://i.imgur.com/2Gu1XXr.jpg)

Really liked the [challenge accepted](http://i.imgur.com/hI42ZjJ.jpg) part and how they value their opponents no matter how ahead they are in points.  

Really not sure [what's up with Kiyoko and her fascination with banana Tanaka](http://i.imgur.com/kHCLp83.jpg), but somehow it made the scene more laid back and funny.  
  
[Yachi mingled in with the kids too well](http://i.imgur.com/J4r5ZaU.jpg)...and [her and Hinata's reactions to the tall opponents](http://i.imgur.com/uimtDIX.jpg) were great, as usual. 

[Can't wait for the next one!](http://i.imgur.com/Uuqc3cT.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if you've seen it or not, but someone above provided a better translation for what Kiyoko said about Tanaka and bananas. It's better as "That banana suits Tanaka well," referring to how he's a monkey. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes much more sense...though it doesn't feel as random as the no context banana Tanaka fascination :P
>> ARTICLE
> he even thanked Kageyama with it!

I love how, in response to that, Kageyama seemed to do a mini-bow himself and didn't really know how to react. Kageyama is adorable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, loved that part, too! It's like they don't even find it odd for Tanaka to act like that, they just go along with it.
>> ARTICLE
And the tournament finally begins.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking love tournament arcs. I'll actually be pretty sad if they make this height thing that big of a plot point. Go go lets go lets go Dateko guy was already almost 2 meters if I remember correctly. I just don't feel like it would make that much sense to make Hinata "scared" here.
>> ARTICLE
the dateko guy is 1,91
>> ARTICLE
This anime handles so well other teams damn it! I wanted them to win...

I have a question: Why does the best regional team needs to win the Spring Tournament to go to the nationals when they already won the previous Tournament?? Or they are just competing just for the sake of competing? 
>> ARTICLE
They are competing in their own region. It is similar to a state (USA), or province (Canada). This can also be called a "qualifier", where the champion of the region is named, and will go on to compete in the nationals for the title of best team in all of Japan, against all the other regional champions who won their respective regional spring tournaments.
>> ARTICLE
That badass intro followed by them being silly. That's my Haikyuu :)

Feels so good to see them win a real game! And that double reaction from Yachi and Hinata <3


>> ARTICLE
I really love how this show doesn't try tomake a team that we should hate for their methods. It feels so natural.. 
>> ARTICLE
["I...want to combine with that shark."](http://i.imgur.com/1EFkbF7.jpg) - *Hinata Shouyou*

Some nice animation in this episode, for sure. Like when the rising captain (I think?) of the opposing team [crashed into the equipment](http://i.imgur.com/6Sjun3I.gif) in order to save the ball, and when Captain Akki in the flashback [dove to save](http://i.imgur.com/6Sjun3I.gif) the ball (and failed). 

They always know what music tracks to use when. As soon as I heard the jazz track I smiled. Great choice. 

I don't watch sports anime normally, but I do appreciate that Haikyuu!! makes an effort to empathize with the opponent teams, even the 'one-shot teams' we don't see much of (as opposed to Nekoma or Aobajoushai). I have no idea to what extent the other big name sports anime do this, but I feel that Haikyuu!! at least does it well. 

Some good group shots from this episode. For those interested: [Waiting to play,](http://i.imgur.com/zLsk7vw.jpg) [Let's go!,](http://i.imgur.com/01DHabN.jpg) [Awe from the sidelines,](http://i.imgur.com/MSbMjM6.jpg) [Victory,](http://i.imgur.com/e76GfnS.jpg) [intimidation.](http://i.imgur.com/P7ozGER.jpg)

The shot of the [main Karasuno lineup](http://i.imgur.com/sNV8Zlr.jpg) was pretty neat (nice angle too). I don't think we've seen them standing in their starting positions, all orderly and professional before. At least, I don't recall one from either season one or the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
The tournament begins! I absolutely love how every team has a story and we get to see the conflict there. What makes the teams fight and what makes them strong/weak is so thrilling
>> ARTICLE
a high schooler over 2meters tall, wow, can't wait to see if hinata's training can beat that
>> ARTICLE
Thats pretty normal.
>> ARTICLE
Where is that normal? 
>> ARTICLE
middle-east.

Edit: I was 184 when I was in 8th grade. didn't increase much after 9th grade now at 194 (if not a bit higher). there were a few people taller than me.
>> ARTICLE
My dad's ~198cm, more than 50 years old, and has only met a few people taller than him in his entire life, just to give another perspective.
>> ARTICLE
Statistics would argue that someone over 2 meters tall is not normal at all.  
>> ARTICLE
How is someone being almost 6 foot 7 normal?
>> ARTICLE
Not in Japan
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode. I like the little drabbles about the other teams Karasuno plays, it really fleshes out the world and appeals to the part of me that likes the amount of empathy sports anime usually has. 

I realized while watching Yachi by herself up there that we haven't really had the Neighborhood Association as commentators. I miss 'em.
>> ARTICLE
Don't be too sad about the loss but happy about gaining Yachi as a cast member.

Hinata is such a badass.

Im sorry, but that comb hairstyle on that captain was ridiculous. Its provoking me. Otherwise awesome episode as always
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. Always liked how haikyuu gives the opponents some development.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished 1st season, how does this compare to the first?

liked it!
>> ARTICLE
Just as good so far IMO but mostly we have only seen team development and are just starting to get into games (which is a good thing in my mind personally).
>> ARTICLE
Yachi is too adorable!

...also, Tanaka looks good with a banana. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked how much sway Captain Turkey-hair had over his tough-looking kouhais as a wimpy-looking guy, but having seen a lot of sports anime, I knew what would happen.

I want more of Yachi.

Hey guys, can somebody do/post a gif with hinatas amazing quick in
11:24 to 11:31? 
This is some awesome crazy animation going on there. I am loving it so much.

no one cares about that tekachu? I found that funny.

Karasuno, Fight! Finally the tournament starts, but the first menace of the tournament will arrive next episode. The voice of the former captain of Ohgi Minami was just like I imagined when I read the manga, nice choice for the seiyuu! 

This episode covered from chapter 99 up to page 6 of chapter 102.
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes will be there for this season, I can't get enough of this show!
>> ARTICLE
According to [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28891/Haikyuu!!_Second_Season), 25 episodes.

this was epic man that save was insane. I feel like this is where hinata's feint will work against that tall dude.

I'm so invested into this show, it's kinda bad.
>> ARTICLE
What is the name of the song when karasuno wins?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of others already pointed this out, but I just have to say how much I enjoy the fact that they also show a little bit of background story for every team the play against, it's nice to give the acknowlegment that with every winner, comes a loser that is just as sad and frustrated as Karasuno was when they lost. It makes it so hard to be happy for Karasuno thought, a part of me is always crying for their adversary XD

Does anyone know what chapter in the manga the spring tournament starts at?

98 or 99, I think

Quick question, is the spring tournament over in the manga? It's getting really hard to wait week to week for episodes.

40+ chapters and counting.  Mangaka is simply dragging it.
>> ARTICLE
It's being dragged needlessly by the author... Even at Chapter 192. The match point of....
>> ARTICLE
It didn't make it to Chapter 192, according to the site I used. 
>> ARTICLE
I just found out that the site i am using is erroneously labeling it as 192. 188 is the latest.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why but that episode felt short. Guess I was just used to the jam packed training camp episodes. Looking forward to see the giant play next week.
>> ARTICLE
The episode was good as always but I found the backstory on the other team to be pretty boring. Sure it's nice if the other teams get some exposition but I dont think its really necessary for EVERY team.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to /r/anime where downvote seems to be a disagreement button.  Downvoting to oblivion just for stating one's opinion seems to be a norm here.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way, but only because I'm watching while it's airing. If I were binging, I'd love the fact that they took time to give some characterization to this random team that Karasuno beat so easily. But since I'm so anxious to get to the crazy intense matches, it was hard to get invested in this team's story. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's really interesting since you wouldn't get a glimpse on how teams feel, if they are completely overpowered/frustrated and how they can overcome it.

edit: I don't know why you get downvoted so much for just stating your opinion, though.
>> ARTICLE
Meat meat meat!! Meat is God!

That was pretty much the best thing ever.

[That "umbrella" trio](http://i.imgur.com/66R6ZJ0.jpg) and the meat dance were hilarious!

I really like these practice episodes (especially when they practice along with the other teams), but I can't wait for a match episode. I'm really hoping everything works out with what they learnt and it ends up awesome!

Also, Kageyama changes reactions so fast. From [this](http://i.imgur.com/rHzjSLy.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/4CATOO7.jpg) then [this](http://i.imgur.com/9WB40TU.jpg) in like a minute.
>> ARTICLE
That umbrella scene was easily my favorite of the episode 
>> ARTICLE
I love how all the teams are interacting with each other for practice as well. Its not only adorable but also way more realistic than the usual sports anime that treat rival teams like warring countries.
>> ARTICLE
Totally. And it's not like in Kuroko where practice game is them trying to demolish each other. Rivalry rah, rah, rah. 

They're super friendly with each other. 
They actually help each other improve just because it'll make things more interesting in the official games. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean Kuroko had the friendly practice games with Shuutoku that one time.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they're all friendly with Seirin after [Kuroko spoiler?](/s "they get beat by Seirin"), but before then it really looks as if they hate each other with passion.

I can't wait to see them use everything they've learned, it's going to be so amazing.

I've said it before but wow Yachi adds SO much to this show. I can't imagine her not being there, she just fits in so perfectly!!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like she's what would happen if you inserted the viewers into the show. Yachi sees all the drama behind the scenes and really understands that the team DESERVES to win. Also she's adorable and hilarious and just lovely over all. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I initially figured she was the plug and play female interest character but she turned out to be a super good character and really gives transparency to the story so the other characters can be themselves and not have to explain everything.
>> ARTICLE
Nice and fun episode. Hinata and Bokuto <3 getting along and learning from each other, and next week we're going to see the best and the most hyped match of the training arc, Hinata's new secret weapon :o and more importantly: [the BBQ!](https://gyazo.com/8c46317ed4d9f18931ee8571cd8d88d9) 

This episode covered from chapter 90 up to page 11 of chapter 92. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Haikyuu as much as anyone here, but I definitely noticed the deliberate change in plot pacing this season. The first season covered up to 70 chapters or thereabouts, whereas we've just reached chapter 92 with this episode.

On one hand... this insinuates the studio's desire to continue with an additional season, most likely. I can't complain about more Haikyuu! Seeing the actions animated definitely bring out a certain level of more "oomph" than the manga itself at times.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they have covered very few chapters per episode, but thats because this part is mostly development rather than matches. Once the training arc ends, i think they will start adapting more chapters once the tournament starts. Plus, there is not enough material (assuming the scans are on par with Japan) to rush over the chapters. If they start covering around 3-4 chapters per episode, this season will end with [Spoilers](/s "The rematch against Aobajosai, and then season 3 (hopefully) will start with the match against Shiratorizawa")
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Hinata interacting is the best thing ever hahaha

Every character in this anime is awesome. There is not a single one I dislike!

I dislike the volleyball character that doesn't go where it scores Karasuno points till they win championships.

DID EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD SIMULTANEOUSLY FORGET TO COMMENT ON [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/OHrx5mg.png) MOMENT?? BECAUSE I'M STILL DYING OF LAUGHTER.

Ahem ok this episode was a good one. Pretty much every episode this season has been the best episode yet. I love how with Haikyuu!!, nothing much can happen in an episode, and it can still be totally engaging and go by in like 3.7 seconds. Some screenshots:

[Kuroo](http://i.imgur.com/A38wkV3.png) was especially cute this episode. How does his hair even work? I will refrain from posting a gratuitous amount of pics of him here though.

[Hinata and Lev](http://i.imgur.com/XMESneo.png) being total spazzes and overly excited is adorable. Especially when you [add Bokuto's craziness](http://i.imgur.com/G1gvqPv.png) into [the mix](http://i.imgur.com/xNvAKwj.png) and can compare [all of their faces to Akaashi, Kuroo, and Tsukki's](http://i.imgur.com/1dVzyHU.png). Like, [Lev, what are you even doing?](http://i.imgur.com/rtW17mJ.png). I love Bokuto so much though he is my precious baby owl.

Ah yes, [Kuroo "Nice Person" Tetsurou bathed in the light of the volley gods.](http://i.imgur.com/ciqMbam.png) Then [Hinata and Tsukki's faces...](http://i.imgur.com/t90Qnjc.png)

[Someday, Lev will learn.](http://i.imgur.com/OPnAsZC.png)

I can't take a [king who is that adorable](http://i.imgur.com/MOFg70M.png) seriously. He's really rockin' the cape, though.

Here's a [team shot](http://i.imgur.com/a3hrXml.jpg) from right before the episode ended.  

Aaaaand now we wait another week.

Here are the screenshots of [King Hinata](http://imgur.com/HJv7oOf) and the [whole team](http://imgur.com/zcM2Kjo) in 1080p, for what they're worth.

The Kuroo "nice person" moment was awesome
>> ARTICLE
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE WEEK!~~~ SO MUCH HYPE

So glad I had Haikyuu!! to look forward to after Black Friday weekend work.
>> ARTICLE
> IT'S THAT TIME OF THE WEEK!~~~ SO MUCH HYPE

Definitely. It's the only show this season that I watch immediately when it's released.
>> ARTICLE
I will just sit and refresh the new page until this thread pops up and I know the new episode is out. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I got Sonarr+Plex. It *tells* me when it has a new episode ready. Get a notification on my phone and everything.
>> ARTICLE
Wait.... They didn't know that Kuroo is a nice person? Oh come on now.

And the next episode looks fucking hype.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Bokuto pronounces Akashi. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually his name is Akaashi. Bokuto's not pronouncing it in a special way. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, you're right. I thought that was just a typo in the subs.

Now I'm wondering if I didn't notice other characters saying Akaashi's name. Well, whatever. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong, but with romanji/writing out Japanese in English letters 'doubling' vowels is a way to show that you're supposed to emphasize/elongate them when you say the words out loud. So for Akaashi, the 'aa' means you're supposed to hold the sound longer than you would normally. 

That being said, Bokuto's tone was pretty funny. It sounded like he was sulking or pouting (e.g. *Akaashi*, don't be cruel), like anyone of us might do in real life. Nice delivery all around. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Bokuto's VA gives Bokuto a very distinctive voice, too, which adds to the uniqueness of how he says Akaashi.

^(Also the "hey hey hey"s kill me every time)
>> ARTICLE
[Hinata's yelling in the background intensifies] (http://i.imgur.com/gBYPG3Q.jpg)

Yachi is basically the audience personified. I don't how we got through season 1 without her adorableness.
>> ARTICLE
We didn't realize we needed it back then. Now we know what we were missing.
>> ARTICLE
hahaha, oh god I'm done. Kagayama awkwardly trying to do the meat is god dance.
>> ARTICLE
Just when I thought this episode was already great, they throw in that montage at the end and bring up to 11. Looks like next episode we're gonna get a full game with all these new skills which will be fun to watch.

This episode also reminded me of my cross country training camp I went to when I was in high school. I met a lot of people from a lot of different schools and it was really fun.
>> ARTICLE
This was a great episode. Yachi is also a really good addition to the show.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode but I hope the whole "Yachi explains character reactions" bit doesn't become a thing. Kinda makes it feel like they're slapping you in the face with it. Although it *was* hilarious when the ball flew at her in the middle of her monologue.
>> ARTICLE
The explanations are not for the viewer, its about her continuing learning experience with the players.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I feel like most of the things Yachi explains are things the viewers can figure out by themselves. The opening monologue was pretty good though.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't. At least not in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
They played 65 matches in the course of 4 days? 5 days? (can't remember) Either way that must be tiring as hell...
>> ARTICLE
Each match was one set instead of the typical 2-3. Either way, 65 sets in 4-5 days is still ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
I'd hope they were rotating players in and out
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuuck that cockblock ending.
>> ARTICLE
gaahh... i really wanted to see that quick. I kept hoping for it not to end then it started summarizing all their learnings.. oh well. hype for next week!
>> ARTICLE
Who else would ship Hinata and Yachi? They're so cute lol
>> ARTICLE
I said to myself I would let the series build up some episodes before watching them but I cannot resist this damn show!

What on earth are you babbling about? I think this week's episode has been one of the best Haikyuu has seen so far.

Then again, I tend to think that every week...
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but like, IT hasn't happened. Every week I'm just waiting for them all to click and then I get to be hype as fuck!

I think I've been like "Man... can't wait for the next Haikyuu" for the past 3 weeks and it's still not there, I want them to fusion into a perfect being.

HYPED!!!!
>> ARTICLE
End just made me so happy. PROGRESSION! & MEATU!! <3

This show is so good at building up the hype with showing Karasuno's true skills little by little, can't wait until it pays off.

And now to wait until next Sunday ; - ;
>> ARTICLE
what chapter is this episode in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Covered Chapters 90 & 91, and pages 1-12 of Chapter 92. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol at Tsukki shielding the back of his head when Asahi serves and Kageyama's awkward dancing
>> ARTICLE
Mff mmmm mrrrf
>> ARTICLE
They are so close to a breakthrough I can almost taste it. Once they click they are going to be unstoppable!
>> ARTICLE
this episode has so much cuteness! i'm so hyped for the fukurodani vs karasuno match for next week.

hinata has to be everyone's favorite kouhai regardless of what team they're on by now.

also, whenever kiyoko san speaks... my heart just goes doki-doki and it reminds me of how perfect her voice actress is for her. (more shimizu speaking screentime please!)
>> ARTICLE
Hinata [stuffing his face](http://gfycat.com/ElementaryHiddenKentrosaurus) was absolutely hilarious, as was Bokuto's [enthusiastic pride](http://gfycat.com/FrigidEvergreenLark) in Hinata's spiking. Actually's all of Boluto's [reactions](http://gfycat.com/AstonishingElderlyHeterodontosaurus) are priceless.

I think Yachi stole this particular episode, though. [Her expressions](http://gfycat.com/PalatableApprehensiveGordonsetter) are just too much.

Screenshot album [here](http://imgur.com/a/DcZGk).
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Hinata are so great together. The airhead and the idiot! I love them. Much more enjoyable than last week's snoozefest due to much less Tsukki, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Last weeks episode was my favourite this season, it's kind of surprising to me that you didn't enjoy it. Are you just not a big Tsukki fan? Or more into the sports side of the show? 
>> ARTICLE
I just really don't like Tsukki. At all. I *love* Hinata and Kageyama and Bokuto though. (I was like super pissed that Kageyama wasn't in last week's episode *at all* since he's the most relatable character for me.)
>> ARTICLE
Eh I guess you cant really force yourself to like a character. I totally agree with you about Hinata and Kags tho, Ive really been missing their interaction as a duo.
>> ARTICLE
Their fight a few weeks ago is still my favorite bit from this season so far, actually. I understand this is a necessary period for them both to grow (especially Kageyama), but I miss them being stupid idiots together. 
>> ARTICLE
literally nothing happens
>> ARTICLE
Huh? What episode were you watching? Things definitely happened, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice how they put the [mark on Daichi's](http://imgur.com/mYB7vIg) face in the OP? I'm pretty sad to see Date Tech go but at the same time I can't wait to see Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai. I want that sweet sweet revenge from them losing last season.
>> ARTICLE
Its gonna be a hell of a 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed but I had to go back and make sure. Gotta love it when shows add in details like that to their OP or ED
>> ARTICLE
> Did anyone else notice how they put the mark on Daichi'sface in the OP?

I did. I just kinda assumed that it had always been there without me ever noticing it, but that's a pretty nice touch.

Yeah same here, I had to go check the previous episodes to see if it was there as well.

The flashbacks were painful though, poor Yamaguchi especially...

Anyway the Hype is stronger than ever, can't wait for the rematch and to see what the mad dog can do.

>> ARTICLE
Damn this episode just made me even more hyped for the next one! Especially since it's against Oikawa...[can't wait for the match](http://i.imgur.com/NGGq8IO.jpg)!

Enjoyed watching this match even if it didn't involve Karasuno. Once again the show makes you care about the other teams and their progress. I really like [the random reactions](http://i.imgur.com/iehFHCs.jpg) not from just the [players](http://i.imgur.com/6lFqAjb.jpg) but [the rest](http://i.imgur.com/e80VUxl.jpg), as well, not to mention their [interactions](http://i.imgur.com/eAVbUn4.jpg). 

Also, [Yachi, I thought you were an expert](http://i.imgur.com/bh8Z75W.jpg) and you'd help [poor Yamaguchi!](http://i.imgur.com/m0qwCKG.jpg) Which reminds me I really want to see Yamaguchi get a good chance next time and use it...I've been waiting for that for too long >.<

It better happen in this next match, guy deserves it!!

I finally made it. I started watching Haikyuu!! 2 weeks ago, and I just caught up, so this is my first time watching it as it airs. Pretty exciting.

I did expect an episode mostly focused on this one match, and it was pretty fun. Started off strong with the best chant in the show, and that new member of the Iron Wall was pretty interesting.

Can't wait for next week when Karasuno starts to put Oikawa and Seijoh in their place. _There's no way they can lose to them twice, right?_
>> ARTICLE
I caught up today too! It really hurts not to be able to watch the next episode right away. I'm so hyped for this next match.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome!

Hope you enjoy the rest of this season as much as you enjoyed all the other earlier episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to volleyball hell.
>> ARTICLE
At least it'll be fun once a week.
>> ARTICLE
For six more weeks, that is.
>> ARTICLE
> There's no way they can lose to them twice, right?

If there's anything Baby Steps and Diamond no Ace have taught me it's that the protagonists can get shat on over and over again in a sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I have to watch Diamond no Ace now.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you're ready for some fuckin baseball, because the first season is 75 episodes long, and the second season is about to end its fourth cour.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know anything about baseball btw, does it explain the sport well enough?
>> ARTICLE
I only knew the very basics of baseball when I started watching it (hit the ball, run around plates) and still got into it. Been watching it since it aired and still don't understand why it isn't very popular.
>> ARTICLE
I've been sucked into the Diamond No Ace hole myself. I think the biggest complaint most people have is the pacing is overall much slower than most sports anime imo.

Also although I know it's an unfair comparison the actual animation isn't nearly as good as other shows such as Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it explains the significance of pretty much everything happening.
>> ARTICLE
[Welcome!](http://i.imgur.com/BoKqhff.gif)

I hope they will win but I'm sure the match will be exciting either way! Really looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they redeem yamaguchi's character this match, I mean he suffered long enough. I just want him to feel part of the team 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, from the standpoint of sport psychology (full disclosure, I am in now way an expert... I'm just sort of assuming that is probably very much a thing actually), wouldn't being called in as a pinch server three times and three times failing do major damage to his self-esteem? At that point, I would guess the coach has to seriously consider if he can continue to rely on the player.

From a writing standpoint, if you want to continue with the character, he HAS to succeed next time he goes in or it just feels really, really forced.
>> ARTICLE
It's more of a gambling mentality where you have to take some drastic action in order to change the flow of the game, even if you don't immediately improve standings you use that chance to buy yourself a ticket into the remaining rounds. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same here. It's sad seeing him suffer like that all this time, too.
>> ARTICLE
Was an all around great episodes. It established Tateko's team with its new players and it was just really fun to watch.

Also the end to the episode really annoyed me; I really don't want to wait for an entire week to see this clash of giants (and one of them is little ;) )

Also, I can already imagine /u/AmethystItalian being really down because of her favourite team chant being out of the show now (poor [Dateko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFinIXw5j_0)).
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Dateko is expected to come back down the line. Aone pretty much swore revenge against Hinata there. He has to be back for another contest between those two.
>> ARTICLE
Necessary sacrifice :(

Luckily I got to hear it a lot this ep :)
>> ARTICLE
At least the episode started with a long string of it. I actually had a hard time paying attention to the dialogue, I was so caught up in the chant.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad we're stuck with the far worse chant for the next game :(
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Yachi will come up with the best chant (even better than Dateko), and it'll give Karasuno a huge confidence boost, and they'll shut out Seijoh.
>> ARTICLE
Let's just hope there will be another season next year or in 2, and we get to see them again, with the same good ol' chant.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those few anime that makes you keep track of every minute that passes wishing you've been born in alternate universe where 20 minutes lasts for a whole day.  

Also, did anyone notice how Kageyama acquired the only insult that he knows from constantly hearing Iwaizumi using it ?  

>> ARTICLE
The main problem with Haikyuu!! is how fun it is that we can't help but feeling despair with how one episode is only 20 minutes-ish. 

And yes!! I definitely notice that. The scene that Kageyama was talking about was the scene when Oikawa almost lost it and almost hit Kageyama before Iwa-chan stopped him, right? I remember Iwa-chan keep saying how stupid/dumbass Oikawa was and Oikawa even commented that how can his insult vocabulary is limited in one word. Oh well, tiny Kageyama is adsorbing everything, lol
>> ARTICLE
I love that Oikawa is such a [monster](http://i.imgur.com/YmeXjSq.jpg) that he can set his opponents on edge, but he's also a total goofball. Not just whining to Iwaizumi all the time, but being genuinely [cute](http://i.imgur.com/kGBmdsD.jpg). There are so many characters in this great show, and it's really satisfying that not a single one is a one-dimensional caricature.

[anime_irl](http://i.imgur.com/9l9hTOw.jpg)

I never get tired of these awesome [group shots](http://i.imgur.com/1e2mMqc.jpg). They really accentuate the hype we're all feeling for the revenge arc.

EDIT: Put the [group shot](http://imgur.com/5G6cQYD) through waifu2x.

Yes, that's one of the reasons I really love Oikawa! He has so many different faucets to his personality and it's really interesting.

Ah, yes. [So many faucets.](https://www.google.nl/search?tbm=isch&q=faucets)

Typo aside I totally agree. One of the reasons Oikawa's my favorite. <3

Looking back at when I first started watching this show, judging it unfairly as "a bad attempt at imitating KnB" I can't believe how much of an idiot I was. 

It struck me today that Haikyuu has consistently been an amazing show, episode per episode. There are other shows I enjoy as well but for example I sometimes get frustrated or bored if I have to sit through their "build up" episodes. Haikyuu on the other hand is always enjoyable. Every moment and every scene feels like it has a clear purpose and the entire ride as a whole has been nothing short of an amazing experience for me. 

There are other shows that I really enjoyed, perhaps during certain moments I have even enjoyed them more than Haikyuu, but none of them have kept such a high and consistent level of engagement as this show has done. It's a little bit depressing to know I might never find another sports anime as good as this. 
>> ARTICLE
> judging it unfairly as "a bad attempt at imitating KnB"

Anytime I've ever heard some one say they didn't like Haikyuu that's the reason they've always given. I think a lot of people expect it to be like KnB for some reason despite the fact that it's not at all.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo and Diamond no Ace are quality sports anime.  More similar to Haikyuu than KnB.
>> ARTICLE
KnB stopped being a sports anime and became a super-powered battle shounen 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it's a *great* super-powered battle shounen.

It's just that's a different category of sports to Haikyuu/Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying it's a bad thing, just you'll enjoy KnB a lot more if you approach it as if watching HxH or YYH
>> ARTICLE
Alright so are they in the semis now? And has it been all one day?

Yes, they are in the semis.
>> ARTICLE
Here's hoping they make finals for Yui!
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite moment of the episode was when Aone said "Opponents that are hard to stop aren't always big or strong."

Because we have this story about the new setter/blocker for the whole episode, and all it takes to bridge that story into the team's story or another player's (Aone's) story is one sentence and a shift of perspective from a guy who's just starting to an experienced player who has his own focus for his determination.

I liked it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, at the beginning I expected this match to be more on the funny side but oh boy, that got intense really fast.

Nothing else to say, really. I thought it was pretty obvious that Aoba wins, it was just a question how.

And now I am ready for:

* Tsukki to block some bitches
* Yamaguchi to do some delicious pinch serving 
* Daichi and Nishinoya to do some godlike receives
* Asahi and Oikawa to deliver some service aces
* ~~And Yachi to puke her heart out~~^^^^thatmomentwassofunnyandcute  
>> ARTICLE
Was actually sad they chose to animate Aone and Hinata simply walking by one another in the hallway without acknowledgment. I was sure in the manga they were both really bummed they wouldn't get to play against each other? Their strange friendship is one of my favorite things about Date Tech.

This was a cool episode otherwise though. Loved seeing Iwa get all intense and show off his ace skills. Oikawa is the brains but Iwa-chan is the muscle.

Also that scene between Yamaguchi and Yachi was incredibly sweet. 
>> ARTICLE
> Was actually sad they chose to animate Aone and Hinata simply walking by one another in the hallway without acknowledgment. I was sure in the manga they were both really bummed they wouldn't get to play against each other? Their strange friendship is one of my favorite things about Date Tech.

Didn't you notice that Aone steps into a shadow as soon as he walks by Hinata as if Hinata casted the shadow even though he's shorter? And just before that he says "Opponents that are hard to stop are not always big or strong".

I thought that was ingenious.
>> ARTICLE
I meant conversationally. Dialogue between them rather than the sort of cold shoulder they gave each other. 
>> ARTICLE
it wasn't much of a cold shoulder, more of them acknowledging each other's strength and how the way the past few episodes have played out, they have the same exact thoughts in mind, and they know what each other is thinking

hinata: "Let's play again, and every time i will overcome you."

Aone: "I will defend against you next time."

They both respect each other's drive as rivals. In that sense, there's nothign to say

That flashback still hurts

It hurt so much :'(

I started Haikyuu 4 days back. Now on ep 18 of S2 and chapter 165 in manga.

I seriously wish that  this anime gets more love from r/anime. Majority of people ignore sports genre thinking it would be monotonous (I used to think same).

But damn, this anime is so good, that I will run out of vocabulary to describe my opinion.

Edit: spelling

Goddamnit. I didn't want to see Dateko to lose. They are a very interesting team and I would really love to see a rematch between [Aone and Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/Xsf44aS.jpg). But oh well.

I'm really hoping that Dateko takes down Karasuno at the next tourney. I think it'll make sense with Karasuno losing the 3rd years and Dateko meshing as a team. Plus I'm sure Aone will take down Hinata's quick. He's been so focused on it.

The episode was pretty great, definitely felt like cool down from last week. I'm sooooooo excited for this rematch though. The last Seijoh game was so good and I can't wait for this one.

Ive always wondered what Haikyuu would be like if there wasnt really a main team and everyone received equal attention plotwise. I mean heres a game that doesnt even involve the main cast and I'm still fully committed to it. I cry after every game because I want everyone to win.

I feel like I might not even root for Karasuno if every team recieved equal screentime. Id probably root for Nekoma because of their team dynamic or Aoba Josai because I honestly adore Oikawa as a character.

I honestly don't think I could really root for a team [that](http://i.imgur.com/FHyNMEs.png) [doesn't](http://i.imgur.com/mxsl5cF.jpg) [have](http://i.imgur.com/4B32tOm.jpg) [Tsukki](http://i.imgur.com/TfaOVYz.png).

God dammit I hope they beat Aoba and get to the nationals. 
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but knowing that Daichi is in his last year and that the mc is in his first... The anime can keep going without Daichi

This episode solidifies my favorite animation sequence in Haikyuu!! The animation of Iron Wall when Dateko did their blocking. It's just really awesome. With new setter, the movement when the third wall is added into already solid two walls, is really great. And when Iwaizumi's spike get through it, its just glorious! 

>> ARTICLE
When Aone walked past Hinata, it was pretty well done.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, the rematch we've all been waiting for. HYPE!!!
>> ARTICLE
One question for the people that read the manga. Is it worth it ?
I allways have the feeling that with sports anime its not a good idea to spoiler myself with the manga because its not so good because its more about the action and not about the story.
And do you know what chapter in the manga is episode 19 in the anime ? 
Thanks alot

Edit: Found the manga chapter.
>> ARTICLE
Just so we're all aware, this has all been the same day, since the first match.
>> ARTICLE
Nice match, interesting new rookie setter for Dateko. They have sick potential.

Yamaguchi x Yachi <3 
I'll be so sad if Yamaguchi fails again. Want to see him and Tsukki succeed.
>> ARTICLE
Aww that Koga/Saku team was so cute why do we only get them for one episode?

I suppose it offered some small hope for a Dateko victory, but considering the big rival is Seijo it was a slim hope
>> ARTICLE
Anyone mind telling me what chapter in the manga this episode ends on?

End of 128, start on 129 if you wanna read from the this point onwards

We're up to 193 in the manga

Iunno, there will be a good 50+ chapters by the time this season ends

If the new season premieres in like a year (2017 spring/summer) there would be 100+ chapters to adapt

The popularity is there for a season 3 for sure
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time experiencing an episode largely focused on a non-Karasuno team/match as it airs. I gotta say, I appreciated them more back when I could immediately go to the next one. Now, for as good of an episode as it was, it feels like I waited all week just for the sake of building even more anticipation for the next episode.

If only I'd stayed strong and waited until it all aired. But it's too damn good.
>> ARTICLE
When he was doing his nails, cringe.... I hate that sound so much :S
>> ARTICLE
anyone know how much source material would be left over after this season to pull from, i took a pause from the manga around the 113 during the boot camp iirc, curious if they could start straight backup for s3 late this year or early next
>> ARTICLE
Enough for half a season? Depends on how long [manga spoiler](/s "the match against Shiratorizawa takes. It's 5 full sets.")
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they'll wait until [manga spoiler](/s "Until the manga finishes Nekoma vs Fukorodani before making Season 3? Because then, if they're planning for a next season, Season 4 will be the Nationals!")

I believe it's something like 45/46 chapters since this season should end near 147/148

How popular is Haikyuu in Japan, does anyone know?  Can this series go on for like a million episodes like One Piece, please?
>> ARTICLE
i assume it must be pretty popular since it has spawned a stage play so far. (and dear god there's tons of merch for it!) 

personally, i think it's going down the yowamushi pedal route, i.e. 2 seasons and a third one on the way with lots and lots stage plays so there's a whole load of stories to be told there.
>> ARTICLE
Theoretically they have almost infinite material, the problem is highschool/college transition. Can they make it work?

They could prolong and make every season about one particular matchup, and have an entire tournament last several seasons, but then the pacing might turn off a large majority of viewer.

Thing about fantasy shounen like Naruto, One Peace, Bleach, etc. they have unlimited material which they can pace at whatever the hell they want to, without worry about transition. The main issue they face is making characters too strong, and then progression becomes insignificant. i.e. Dragonball, when they were already able to blow up entire planets, it's like... Well w/e man, you leveled and can still blow up an entire planet.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know about how much material but I am visiting Japan currently and Haikyuu has SO much advertisement around. There are stores I visited with half of it with just Haikyuu merchandise in Tokyo. I had no idea it was so popular until coming here. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh perfect question for me I just came back from 3 weeks in Japan recently. Yeah Haikyuu is super popular right now. Last time i was there all the merchandise revolved around Shingeki no Kyojin and this time it was all about Haikyuu. I actually didn't even know about Haikyuu until my recent visit to Japan.
>> ARTICLE
It's very popular, it was the [#5 best selling manga series](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-31/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-series-2015/.88770) in Japan this year. I don't think the BD's for season 2 have gone on sale yet, but season 1 averaged 24,884 units per volume, which is excellent as well. Season 2 moved to a late night time slot instead of the earlier one that the season 1 had so we'll have to wait and see how that affects sales. There's a ton of merchandise around, which is also a good sign of how popular it is.

My guess is that it'll end up like Kuroko. It does well and fans love it so I.G. will keep making it as long as there's source material to adapt. Personally, I don't want several hundred episodes of Haikyuu because I don't think the story can sustain itself that long, but I will gladly take a couple more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, usually the episodes feel longer, but this one felt like it was over in an instant. I haven't felt the hype/tension in these past two episodes mostly because we pretty much know that theyre going to win, but I guess they're used to show off how much they improved. I just cant wait for when we have games that are spanned out into 5 episodes, and you dont know who's going to win. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I'd watch a show with even just one of these characters.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy we get Haikyuu for another fucking 12 episodes! I fucking love this show to death. 
Can't wait for the new OP/ED.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Tanaka whistling Imagination at the end when Daichi glared at him and Nishinoya.
>> ARTICLE
I checked and it was actually Nishinoya whistling, but yeah, good catch, didn't noticed it the 1st time.
>> ARTICLE
Ah you're right! Yeah I had to replay that scene a couple of times to double check what I was hearing but I was just listening to that part, not watching.
>> ARTICLE
One of those five minute episodes again...
>> ARTICLE
Kiyoko-san is so cute! I never thought I'd be this invested in a anime about volleyball... why can't the manga and anime release new chapters and episodes every day?!?!
>> ARTICLE
So for those of you who play volleyball just like me, I am just sitting her like how is Kageyama's super quick shoot set not called for a two touch?

Also based on the preview that serve seemed like Yamaguchi's!
>> ARTICLE
Some refs do call a double touch for a spinning ball, but they are wrong to do that.  It's a common misconception. It should only be called a double if they can actually see both hands not hitting the ball simultaneously.  Some good info about spin and double contacts here:

Ah! Thanks for the clear up I play high school and high school club so it can be dodgy at times >.<

Nothing fills the Baby Steps void like Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
i liked yachi in the manga but seeing her animated just endeared me so much to her. and who else doesn't get a bit distracted whenever kiyoko speaks? like damn, she should get more lines because that voice just *suits* her so well!

yet another great episode. for haikyuu anime-only watchers, if you're thinking of reading the manga, now is pretty much the best time!

someone on tumblr pointed out that the kids who accompanied ukai sr. to the game looks like aoba johsai players and i cannot unsee it ever since.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu threads are the post positive place on the Internet. This show has so much power over the people who watch it, it's amazing! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm worried this was the last episode with the current OP... :'(

Goddamn Hyakuzawa is freaky tall. That's not even fair.

I fucking love this soundtrack so so so so so much. Can I preorder like a dozen copies of it? Also, does anyone know when it will be released??

[Dumbass Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/SOJECtJ.png).

I loved all the shots this episodes that contrasted tall-kun and Hinata's heights.

I am so in love with this show and every single character in it that it actually kinda pains me every week when the episode ends.
>> ARTICLE
>Goddamn Hyakuzawa is freaky tall.

He wouldn't seem as tall if he was surrounded by North American people. 

>I fucking love this soundtrack so so so so so much.

Me too. Me too. The soundtracks released before this season are some of my most listened-to soundtracks from anything, and this season's are just as great.

>I am so in love with this show and every single character in it

My favourite parts are just their little gestures and interactions, bringing out a sense of personality that you don't get in many other shows. For example, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ybgcu/spoilers_haikyuu_second_season_episode_13/cycbt3x).
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love Daichi putting Nishinoya and Tanaka in their places a few times this episode.
*Whistle
>> ARTICLE
Nice to know this series is far from over... well halfway but you guys get my point. The team is looking really good making it through the prelims and Hinata's doggy face gonna be nice reaction gif

Man, I didn't the music could get any more awesome than "the Ultimate Quick Attack." But man, this was an eargasm from beginning to end. I dub the new version of the song "The Supreme Quick Attack"

They're doing well. Thanks for asking.

The blond guy with the tongue piercing? He was shown towards the end of episode 11. I don't think anime-only viewers have been properly introduced to him and his school yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Have this funny feeling that the guy hitting on Kiyoko was talking BS about reaching semifinals 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, the OST of this anime is so awesome! I thought that [this BGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSf3myqb3gs) is already awesome for Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick but damn, just as their quick attack evolved, the BGM for their signature quick also leveled up!
>> ARTICLE
ahhhhhh Haikyuu is so good. It's a feels good anime that makes me smile the whole time but with tons of emotion behind it as well. 
I found out about Haikyuu like a week ago, binge watch up til season2 ep.12 then I binge read the manga til the current chapter. SO GOOD.
>> ARTICLE
I swear the mid-episode card comes faster and faster every episode. Like Shimizu did her underhand serve I yelled "NO!!!" at the screen because I knew we were at the halfway point. How come these episodes are 8 minutes long? 
>> ARTICLE
s2 episode 13 @ 17:20: it's a "four consecutive contacts" fault!
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, A block isn't counted as a hit/touch anymore.
>> ARTICLE
my biggest question is why hasn't Hinata learned to serve better?
>> ARTICLE
He's been practicing quicks, etc. The main issue facing age-gated sports is time. You only have so much time to devote to particular things. It's why most hardcore amateur sports have in-house dorms which are probably mandatory, so they can practice nearly 100% of their non-school hours.

If he practiced serves, would he have perfected his quick in time to score the points they needed to win at this regional? Who knows.
>> ARTICLE
who knows I'm just confused why that wasn't one of the things he worked on seeing as how he wasn't a decent server and it seems like he could be a great one because he is a high jumper and very fast with good sense of seeing openings. 
>> ARTICLE
It also requires power, which he has none of. 
>> ARTICLE
if he's very accurate it can still be a good thing. you would think a spiker should be a power hitter but like you said he isn't that powerful
>> ARTICLE
Though, he isn't very accurate either, he is just fast. The main issue of receiving most serves is the power behind it. They are afraid of the overhand serves, precisely because they cannot receive it properly. This leads to issues setting up the attack. It also makes it easier to read where the return will come from, because a botched receive has less options than a perfectly received ball.
>> ARTICLE
Did I just see Kuroo in the previews? Is he watching the Karasuni matches? Is that Oikawa and Iwaizumi bullying somebody? And there's Ushijims too! Next episode is going to be loaded!
>> ARTICLE
Every episode that comes out reminds that the anime is one step closer to getting close to where the anime is 

30 chapters for 1 match the dream

>> ARTICLE
Awesome episode, loved how they built up the hype all the way through. 
>> ARTICLE
You're so right. The last part when the duo shows their quick attack is like 100x better than the manga. So many shivers and the anime does so well to build up to it.
>> ARTICLE
One thing I appreciate in this anime: body proportions that don't look ridiculous. None of the schoolgirls have bangin' double D's. Always a good thing. Animation and art style is my favourite thing about this show.
>> ARTICLE
And they always have clothes on. :) 
>> ARTICLE
It's sad for this to be noticeable and be as refreshing as it is. Really love Haikyuu's character designs.
>> ARTICLE
I also like how they are starting to focus on the girls too. Love it.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to break it to you but apart from this little time they get here, they will not be getting a lot more attention.
>> ARTICLE
That is okay! This is an anime about the boys volleyball team. I just like how they add small snipets of the girls. 
>> ARTICLE
thank god
>> ARTICLE
I also really like how they portray faces in the series, it just looks cool.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...like Hinata's murder-face in the practice match against Nekoma. The emotion they're able to fit into character's faces is actually incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the show made fun of itself when Hinata started doing the typical sports shonen hype speech at some random guy.

While the build up was amusing and hyped up the match I thought it took too long. Last episode was basically a build up episode, dedicating another 18 minutes to it seemed rather excessive.
>> ARTICLE
The build up makes me impatient but the increases in anticipation are present in sports. It's their first tournament and Hinata's first real match. Dedicating a healthy amount of time to setting the stage with a wide scope seems appropriate. As long as they don't make a habit of weighing down every tournament round with this much foreplay it fits.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, I was kind of just annoyed until they finally started playing. Good ending to the episode at least.
>> ARTICLE
I love Haikyuu.

But I kind of now want a female-version volleyball anime.

[We'll](/s "be getting a little bit of that next episode.") Honestly episode 16 will have one of my favorite little character arcs in the whole manga.

Fan service :3

There's always [Attack No.1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1550/Attack_No.1) for that.
>> ARTICLE
There's always ''[Beach Stars](http://myanimelist.net/manga/1730/Beach_Stars)'' (   )
>> ARTICLE
There is the manga Crimson Hero. . . It's got a lot of shojo daily life/romance to it but when they actually play it's awesome. Thinking about it now, it and Chihayafuru play out in a similar style. It's neat; it follows girls' and boys' team. 
>> ARTICLE
I read that as well! Really enjoyed it but didn't like the ending so much :)
>> ARTICLE
I was reading the english releases but it was dropped after v. 14. Maybe I'll read the fan translations when Haikyuu is done.  
>> ARTICLE
The thing is I want a female version of this anime, but little to no fanservice. Just some girls playing volleyball and trying to win, having fun along the way. 
>> ARTICLE
I would honestly like any kind of non-fanservice female sports anime that are along the lines of HQ or Kuroko. It seems like there hasn't been one in a long time.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I am a girl and sometimes I just wanna watch realistic girl characters play sports like how I did in High School. It would be a lot more relatable.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think there is a single unlike-able character in this whole show. They're all so weird and funny, it's amazing. I mean, even "Tsukki" ain't that bad now, since he's the archetypal brooding type.

Brooding? No, no, that's Kageyama! Tsukki is the asshole of the team :3

That was probably the best episode until now.

Laughed so much, and the hype building up during those three first points, wow, i'm even more in love with I.G now !

And the new opening is so great , reminds me of one the FMA Brotherhood one ( I guess it's from the same band).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you got that right, the band of the OP for FMA and Haikyuu is Nico Touches the Wall.
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love sports anime, my favorite genre, this episode just proved that even if I didn't, I would like this series nonetheless. Go Karasuno.
>> ARTICLE
No one's mentioned Yowamushi Pedal, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the 38 episodes of it this far and can't wait for Season 2 in the Fall!

EDIT: I commented under the wrong comment...should be one sub comment lower
>> ARTICLE
What other sports anime would you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
Major is probably still my favorite. I think effect will be noticeably diminished because all episodes are available and there is no "long term relationship", that I feel show have built when show was originally airing, but for me, no 1.
>> ARTICLE
Ookiku Furikabutte (aka. The Big Windup), Chihayafuru, Cross Game, H2, Kuroko no Basuke. 
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps and Ace of Diamond are both running right now. Both are pretty good.

Hajime no Ippo is a great boxing anime with lots of humor.
Kuroko no Basuke is a REALLY good basketball anime. The second seasons animation was awesome.

Prince of Tennis was good but like others have said it dragged on.

Slamdunk! is an older anime. It's on Crunchyroll and it's hilarious. It's got the whole 80s tough street kids thing going on along with the basketball. I definitely would recommend it. 


>> ARTICLE
Not the person you replied to but I'm a lover of sports anime as well.

Baby Steps is a pretty awesome Tennis one that doesn't start out with an OP main character. Very good character building. MC's hair is dumb though.

Ace of Diamond is awesome, but I'm a lover of baseball. It's also one of the only things I've ever watched to make my cry. One Outs is another great baseball anime with an interesting twist.

Prince of Tennis is fun, but drags on. 100+ episodes and OVAs. 

I hear Kuroko no Basket is really good but I haven't watched it myself.

Hajime no Ippo! The original series is near the top of my favorites

It was one of my most enjoyed anime. I'm not saying it was the best anime I watched, but for me the settings, characters and story were very intriguing. Definitely worth a watch for a 12 episode anime imo

It's interesting, don't bother with the manga though, it's bad. Just pretend the anime is a standalone and not a prequel.

i appreciate the humor and timing and even the sounds during the show.

I don't get why am I so interested in this even though I hate sports. I am really excited about every episode I get to see. 
The characters are really lovable, everyone has a little back story of their own and you can really feel different mindsets. Maybe they are the reason why I get so excited about these series. 
>> ARTICLE
What i love about this episode is that the other teams were acknowledging Karasunos players, up until this point we've seen some wimpy presentation of some of the players, but having other teams fear/concern about Karasuno is pretty cool.

With all the new summer anime i thought I would put this on hold but nope im still interested in this!

Everyone of /r/anime, a while back I made /r/haikyuu just for this show. It's pretty quiet right now, but if you like the Haikyuu anime, manga, or even just volleyball, then I think you can have a lot of fun there. So why don't you come check it out and let me know what you think

Holy Moley, that's Kuroko no Basket level of hype for this tournament.

okay so some people felt that too much time was "wasted" before the game, but I felt that all to be valuable pre-hype. If you hadn't heard what everyone thought about Karasuno their "flight" wouldn't have been nearly as impressive. I rewatched the last 10 minutes like eleven times and my heart is still pounding FUCK THIS SHOW IS SO HELLA
>> ARTICLE
This episode was amazing! Funny and cool! I love Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I like the fact I was hyped the whole ep as well as laughing on the bits. What a truly great sports anime, nothing too fancy like superpowers and such but it gets the job done. 10/10

Goddamn I love Karasuno's black and orange uniforms. They're just amazingly designed. So many hilarious points to the episode.

i'd like to see how the development of the female team goes, or if that even continues in the show

Did no one catch the Gundam reference? 'Even my Coach has never beaten me'
>> ARTICLE
THAT EPISODE WAS SO GOOD. JESUS.

And when did Hinata learn how to do middle quicks??? Amazing :3
>> ARTICLE
Youre a little (very) late. Hinata is middle so naturally he can do quicks anywhere.
Unless youre being sarcastic in which case, heehee
>> ARTICLE
Well, up until this episode Hinata has been doing slide hits in games, no? He goes for the middle approach but then dashes to the right-side, and that's why Kageyama back sets to him.

Unless I missed it in earlier episodes I don't think Hinata hit any middle quicks in games...
>> ARTICLE
Sure he's been doing slides but its natural for a middle blocker to be able to do middle quicks.

I play volleyball as a middle/opposite hitter. (Or wing spiker as Haikyuu calls it.)
>> ARTICLE
I thought the original problem was that Hinata would get blocked easily if he hit from the middle regardless of what types of hits he did, but I see what you're saying.

And I've played as a setter, power, and offside hitter ;) So I have some idea of what Middles do.
>> ARTICLE
That Asahi spike was so gratifying.
>> ARTICLE
Was holding my breath the whole time...

That flashback that they have used too much kinda ruined it for me.

Every big kill in this series makes me want to roar with the team. How high can these guys fly?

Definitely top 3 moments that I love in the anime. The first being when Asahi finally asked (shouted?) for the ball in the practice match. I was in tears then. I was choked up here though.

There's a couple more moments I'm looking forward too even more. But yeah that's definitely in the top 5.

You either cry, or laugh. Its not something for you to control ;D
>> ARTICLE
Well, no but yea , but no, but seriously yea. Dont know
>> ARTICLE
i was laughing with glee
>> ARTICLE
Its nice to see a sports anime that doesn't show a team completely shutting down the other team even when they play well (i.e. Dateko was conceding points even though they were dominating the defense at the start of the match) unlike many other sports anime *cough* *Prince of Tennis* where when a side plays well they will get 100% of the points. Really brings out the realistic-ness of the sport.

That being said, just love this anime from the get go. So much feels
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has done a really good job of reinforcing the concept that, at a certain level/point, any team has a shot to upset a favored opponent. Like coach said, even their freak quick isn't completely invincible. A strong team still needs to take care of business.
>> ARTICLE
That moment at the end is why I watch sport anime

this episode wasnt lacking in anything. there was nothing else they could have done to make it better.

You could take every Haikyuu episode from CR, and there would be many worse mistakes. Such as last episode where the names were switched around etc.

Oh, I couldn't care less about the mistake. I'm just happy for the subs. It just made me chuckle is all. :)

[This](http://imgur.com/AqV3Qzi) scene made me chuckle cause Kageyama just looks so creepily happy haha :D

I dont really understand why but i found myself on the verge of crying several times during this ep. And i'm not one who cries easily.
>> ARTICLE
Exact same here. Haikyuu and Space Bros are the only ones that have managed to do it to me, but they do it so easily (and often).
>> ARTICLE
I cry easily and I cry weekly
>> ARTICLE
Yes! I rarely cry as well, and this show puts me on the verge of tears at least once an episode it's really bizarre. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here! I don't know what it is with this anime but I always cry tears of joy when epic moments happen in this anime.

Literally fist pumping every time Karasuno scores. That Hinata decoy for Asahi's spike was amazing.

Didn't hear much "Go, Go, Let's Go, Let's Go, Dateko!" that much from the crowd either :D!

[Made a gif by taking parts of the episode.](http://www.gfycat.com/MeagerTerribleAfricanbushviper)

Such an underrated show. The soundtrack is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
That was just brilliant. It wasn't fast paced, it was done at a speed that broke down the entire story. When I saw that formation I knew it would be Ashi and that was just pure art

Also, shoutout once again to the visual styles of the show, with Ashi being in front of the iron wall at first, and then when the task was made harder they put the entire team fighting the iron wall. Its the little touches that makes this brilliant.........Until Kageyama broke the 4th wall
>> ARTICLE
When did he break the wall? I think I was too excited to notice.
>> ARTICLE
He said "commercial break" at one point, I think.
>> ARTICLE
He mentioned that it was about time for a commercial break
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that too. Are you sure it wasn't the text that said "commercial break" during those little clips, instead of Kageyama saying it?
>> ARTICLE
I dont think Kageyama was saying it, vut I was just saying what this guy was referring to
>> ARTICLE
That was just the subs. He didn't actually say it
>> ARTICLE
"Commercial break" was just Crunchyroll's high-quality subs. Kageyama didn't actually say it.
>> ARTICLE
so many amazing moments this episode

-Hinata an kageyamas first quick 

-that backwards toss

-the asahi spike

I also love the fact the crowd is focused on Hinata. I'm getting some Kurobas vibes from it y'know. "The darker the shadow the brighter the light" or whatever it was.
>> ARTICLE
The animation and the sound is just incredible, I just get a complete sense of energy and speed from just watching this anime, the feels especially when courts are opened up and a tunnel of light shines the path, and the speed and the air shockwave when Asahi hits the ball is just incredible.

dat epic moment when everyone including entire audience said  "......that #10"
>> ARTICLE
Had to punch a wall to regain my manliness after that episode

10/10

Karasuno's ace has taken flight :')
>> ARTICLE
*iron wall
>> ARTICLE
The scene composition/cinematography/animation for Asahi's spike after Hinata's decoy jump was absolutely breathtaking. That's one of the few times I've gotten actual chills from watching anything.
>> ARTICLE
Another excelent episode... Fuck! Haikyuu matches always get my blood pumping. 
>> ARTICLE
i had goosebumps the entire time this episode was the best so far damn
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised how little comments Haikyuu! gets when it's so amazing! Quite the hidden gem!
>> ARTICLE
Such an amazing show, I simply can't wait for next week :)
>> ARTICLE
Agreed with others that this was probably the best episode of the season so far -- it had everything from game play to moments of comedy (I really enjoy that they do this with both teams), and then ends on a dramatic note.  It's also easy to get into a lull in matches that other shows tend to do, but the pacing here is spot on.  
>> ARTICLE
Oh my feels. I love the way Haikyuu captures the excitement and drama that's inherent in sports without the injection of "special" techniques or super human powers. Yes, we have the freak quick but there's a difference between talent and secret-special attack of the month. The pacing also keeps things fresh and avoids getting bogged down in every little play while keeping the intensity of the match.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu proves sports anime can give you such intense emotions, the show starts off kind of slow but when it gets going then holy fuck is it amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I knew what was coming as someone who has read manga, I just love love love how Asahi was so overshadowed in the middle of it all that the spike at the end felt so rewarding. 


I felt tears coming when he said "Ah yes, this is the view," and just the whole scene where everyone is so fucking happy that his attack went through. Especially Sugawara by the bench, fucking fist pumping by himself. Dammit you! Now I'm crying!!!
>> ARTICLE
pure wow. im always so happy when sunday mornings come along and i get to watch some more art. i never fails, always gets better.

;_; so goooood.
>> ARTICLE
"SO COOOOOL!" Was basically what I was saying throughout this episode.
>> ARTICLE
ever time Hinata spikes I get mad chills!
>> ARTICLE
I can't lie the opening of Asahi remembering the iron wall last time got me emotional, just because you saw how determined NIshinoya was to play and make sure this time he won't let down his Ace. And I couldn't help but to cry when Asahi finally saw the view over the wall, just the definition of gratifying. I love how Hinata after that last play felt incredible about it even tho he didn't score, that's the great perk about being a team, even tho you aren't the one to score the point, you still feel that rush in your blood when YOUR team does. This show makes my Sundays. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, first time I've felt a show has 2 true Best Girls. If only the Volly Best Girl sticks around. :/
>> ARTICLE
Honestly this is the best episode so far... by far!...Soooooo good!
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend you guys to play the episode again and this time instead of watch you listen to the show. The music direction is brilliant in building the hype throughout the back and forth.
>> ARTICLE
KARASUNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Asahi's spike was my favorite moment in the anime, holy fuck that felt incredible to watch
>> ARTICLE
I found myself tearing and cheering throughout the entire episode, god damn this match is hype.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome episode. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is just unbelievably good.  I can't help but have a good time every time I watch it.
>> ARTICLE
When Asahi spiked that ball... got goosebumps everywhere. Almost teared up. Who knew a sports anime would get me like this? I hardly feel any emotion while watching anime but Haikyuu!! really gets me. 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO HYPE AND THE DECOY WORKED AND THE THE TOSS WENT UP and then my computer locked up and I missed the spike so my hype died. It's like that video with the build up, and the missing the drop.
>> ARTICLE
Even though Kurasuno was the team to root for, Aone from Dateko got me hype
>> ARTICLE
I just gotta say, as a manga reader this match is animated beautifully. Actually seeing the match in motion makes it seem so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god this episode had me screaming like a little girl. When Hinata and Asahi hit their spikes I was screaming along
>> ARTICLE
Just when I thought I was not going to tear at this episode.. That decoy really caught me off guard. ASAHI! T^T
>> ARTICLE
This episode was amazing!!!

I had to pause the video after the backwards toss to freakspike because i was laughing so hard! And i was so hyped when he was so focused on #10 so Asahi could do his thing. 

That BGM though. When the pulsing bass starts playing you KNOW you are in for a treat. SO good~

The way you phrased that makes it seem like you're hinting at a spoiler...I hope that's just my head though...

It's too bad you felt that way, I personally loved the moments with the girls team.

Glad you're back into it though. This show is so much fun.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going be honest... I got some feels.

Things like this are just hitting my soft spot repeatedly...
>> ARTICLE
That last half got me tearing up, I didn't cry but I was close. That was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't had these kinds of feels since Space Bros.
>> ARTICLE
You aren't alone :') That last spike was beautiful T_T
>> ARTICLE
Damn ninjas cutting onions :/ Especially in the last moment when he called for a toss. Damn it man. 
>> ARTICLE
It looks like it's beginning to rain.
>> ARTICLE
That SUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA brought a tear to my eye, you can see all the senpai rejoice and about to be in tears because their team is fixed.
>> ARTICLE
the tears man the tears.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first sports anime and I absolutely feel in love with it.
>> ARTICLE
Man and the manga is just... so good too, I look forward to the rest of the anime and (I can dream) maybe season 2. I can't get enough of Haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
pssst watch kuroko's basketball : ^ )
>> ARTICLE
Ill give it a try thanks
>> ARTICLE
Glad you started off on good footing for this genre :)

If you ever feel like branching out to other sports anime, I'd recommend Hajime no Ippo, Chihayafuru, Kuruko no Basket, and Cross Game.  Hajime no Ippo is more of a realism side of sports anime that is a bundle of fun though it is rather long story about boxing.  Chihayafuru is about a card game but its formula still makes it a sports anime and it is a favorite of many, even those who typically dislike the genre.  Kuroko no Basket is about basketball and gives all its star characters various unrealistic basketball moves while still keeping it action packed and suspenseful.  Finally, Cross Game is less of a sports anime as it is an anime that simply has its story based in baseball though I would highly recommend it regardless.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree with Kurko one of my favorites. Also been really enjoying Ace of Diamond.
>> ARTICLE
Another good recommendation is Slam Dunk, which is just hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, it is sort of weird the amount of sports I play irl and I never felt I wanted to watch this genre until now. I think I'm a sucker for the motivational/Comeback scenes like the whole "King of the court" story.
>> ARTICLE
If you love motivational and comebacks, you gotta watch Kuroko no Basket. Rooting for the underdogs and watching them succeed is so satisfying!
>> ARTICLE
Fenril's list is a really good list.
>> ARTICLE
Sports movies/anime rule. I don't even care for sports that much, aside from hockey, but I love watching sports films. Moneyball is one of my favorite movies, and I haven't watched a baseball broadcast in years. 
>> ARTICLE
I know I said this a lot, but I still think it hasn't been said enough. 
THE OST IS FUCKING AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, whenever you get a spyair OP you know they are going to be picking good music for the rest of the show as well
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong & Haikyuu!! #sportsfeels2014
>> ARTICLE
Personally I avoid ping pong since nothing can beat the '96 classic 'Ping Pong Club'. Such glorious fun.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen that one, but I really do recommend you watch Ping Pong. Forget being the best sports anime, it's one of the best anime series this year, if not the best.
>> ARTICLE
Then youre missing something amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Not tearing up at Nishinoya's speech. Nope.

Love the shit outta this anime. Didn't get the same feels from the manga!
>> ARTICLE
The performances and the music are both really great, and add a lot to the show. 
>> ARTICLE
these VAs are pretty tops
>> ARTICLE
Kiyoko best serve. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish she had more screentime so we can hear her voice :(
>> ARTICLE
Me 9 episodes ago: "How can a volleyball show be as intense as a basketball anime?"

I AM SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU HAIKYUU WILL YOU FORGIVE ME

*the feels are real*
>> ARTICLE
yea but when is sports anime not intense? I bet if they wanted they could make chess or pool pretty nervewrecking too
>> ARTICLE
Of all things, Anime has made *Karuta* intense before with **Chihayafuru**. Anime could make thumb wrestling or paper, rock, scizzors intense if they needed to. (NGNL has already done the latter).
>> ARTICLE
I would kill for a bowling anime.
>> ARTICLE
Anime made a pretty boring board game like [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_\(game\)) intense as hell in [Hikaru no Go](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=912), I have long accepted that anime can make anything interesting.  This was confirmed yet again in Chihayafuru, it's a memorization card game involving some old-ass Japanese poems.  A show about this can't be interesting amirite~!?
>> ARTICLE
Kaiji spend around 7-8 episodes on RPS, it was intense as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
a chess anime with light yagami, lelouch, shiro/sora
>> ARTICLE
Do not forget Kaiba :^). In all seriousness, if it came down to it, Lelouch would probably win. _ would lose the fastest because the Death Note would just kill them while Light stalls every move. Geass would make it pretty easy for him to manipulate the moves of _ as well. Geass is probably simpler to use and according to the theory about Lelouch being immortal, the death note would not work on him.

Basically w/ powers Lelouch > Light > _

W/O powers ( but where would the fun be in that), _ > Light/Lelouch. 
>> ARTICLE
screw the rules I have money
>> ARTICLE
did you forget that _ cant loose
>> ARTICLE
but they can die, so there's that
>> ARTICLE
>Anime could make thumb wrestling or **paper, rock, scizzors** intense if they needed to.

Hunter X Hunter anyone?

>> ARTICLE
haha, dont think that really counts though :(
>> ARTICLE
No game no life 
>> ARTICLE
I really like the occasional use of ravens (atleast i think they're ravens) for example when Asahi was sitting outside thinking there were some in the background. Also the guy with glasses who got the coach (i forgot his name ;_;) was soo cute in this episode
>> ARTICLE
They're crows. Karasuno is japanese for Crow.
>> ARTICLE
right, i got it wrong cuz they sub i watched said ravens :/
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: Karasu can mean both Raven and Crow.
>> ARTICLE
well ravens technically are crows so yeah it makes sense
>> ARTICLE
Ravens are a [kind of crow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_\(genus\)).
>> ARTICLE
Hate to be that guy but 'Karasu' is Japanese for crow. Their school is called Kurasuno, but it's obvious why they are the crows.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for clearing that up!
>> ARTICLE
I swear, this show has some of the [silliest](http://i.imgur.com/rKVRwz2.jpg) [facial](http://i.imgur.com/4ut9RRe.jpg) [expressions](http://i.imgur.com/thlV6nZ.jpg) [ever](http://i.imgur.com/pHtrTRW.jpg).

He was so happy because he was just waiting for him to be blown away by Hinata's spike and it finally happened. That's why this show is great, all the characters are so fun and nice

THAT WAS THE ONE I FORGOT ABOUT! Thank you very much :)

He is like 

"Nee, nee, sugoi desho?"

Holy shit, I love anime.

HELP GUYS I CAN'T CONTROL THE FEELS THEY WONT STAHP PLS SEND HELP
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I'm not tearing up at Asahi finally figuring it all out, not tearing up....not......DAMMIT THE FEELS
>> ARTICLE
Damn sad that this only gets like 30 upvotes when I vote this in my top 5 this season probably. 
>> ARTICLE
It's still young, give it time. But yeah it could probably do with a bit more love, it's one of the better sports anime i have watched [](/s "which isn't much")
>> ARTICLE
Feel like Ace of Diamond is falling into the same issues, but much worse. 2 really good shows that don't seem to get the love for some reason, even though this shows got such damn beautiful art to it.
>> ARTICLE
the animation on Asahi's spike was unreal
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell do people in sports' anime get PTSD from playing?!
>> ARTICLE
It's actually a thing though.  When you participate in a sport and repeatedly lose, it gets to you.  Whole teams undergo overhauls because the current roster does not have a 'winning culture' in the locker room.  This is why sports psychologists exist, and have been proven to be really effective for some athletes.
>> ARTICLE
I know that happens, but I don't think it's to the level of flashbacks and "oh my god I can't hit the ball!"
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Why is everyone forgetting my mention of the flashbacks?
>> ARTICLE
Well its anime after all
>> ARTICLE
You see, tackling the angle of the team's mentality being off in a subtle way would be interesting, regardless of the medium. I just think that trying to make it so over-dramatic in that the players get flashbacks and are unable to hit the ball is ridiculous and has been done enough already.

It is anime though, and for something that's trying to set up the characters as of now I think it works in accelerating the pace.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean, but the thing is, that showing them being unable to hit the ball its dramatic and easy to the viewer to see whats going on.. more than just them thinking " I dont have confidence enoguh to keep playing " or something like that.

>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite episode BY FAR!
>> ARTICLE
I got goosebumps throughout the entire episode. This is probably the best side character development i've seen in ages. P.S the feels are strong in this one
>> ARTICLE
Seeing the dynamic of the old team and the way they still support each other... My heart feels like it's in my throat, ready to burst. After this episode I'm so high on this series I don't even know where it's going to go from here. Is there anything this fluffy bromance won't be able to overcome?
>> ARTICLE
This is when a sports anime is at its best, when the feels and lessons they try to  convey are universal.


>> ARTICLE
Nishonoya is truly awesome.
>> ARTICLE
;_;
>> ARTICLE
Damn......... i'm left speechless. Can't wait to see the the rest of this match, the practice camp and the game against Neko. This anime is too amazing :D The wait for next episode is going to kill me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just loving this so much. This show has a perfect balance between emotional moments, humor, and the classic sports anime badassary. If it manages to stay as strong as it currently is all the way through it might become one of the best of its genre or maybe even all anime. With the way it's looking it's definitely going to be one of my personal favourites 
>> ARTICLE
How the hell is anyone supposed to pick a favorite character when every character is amazing, I mean, only a couple characters *aren't* my favorite
>> ARTICLE
Asahi is definitely best senpai of the season.
>> ARTICLE
OMG this anime is SO FUCKING GOOD I just can't handle myself.

The characters drip personality, everyone has a reason to be important because the sport (volleyball) allows a much better division of roles, the teachers are also amazing and everything seems a lot more set in reality.

I really like Kuroko, but in my opinion this show wipes the floor with it.
>> ARTICLE
It's because Haikyuu feels so authentic and it has no bullshit superpowers (I still like KnB tho)
>> ARTICLE
Great and touching episode. So many feels.

The new coach Ukai.

Noya's great speech.

The ace Asahi is finally back~
>> ARTICLE
That frame before the credits, holy shitsu! 
>> ARTICLE
Amazing. Everything. Every fucking part of this anime is amazing. I'm pretty happy about it because the manga deserves it, I love it so much...  
Trust me guys, it'll improve endlessly, episode by episode. 
>> ARTICLE
i really like this show, and i know that this is an unpopular opinion, but i felt that this episode was kinda reaching. like, it wasnt able to pull me in and feel for the characters, cause the level of emotion didnt feel real.

normally this wouldnt be a complaint, its only cause its but nothing but stellar so far. i just felt like this episode i felt like i was watching the show and not experiencing along with the characters

i had similar feelings towards the end of sakupet
>> ARTICLE
[Just this scene killed me](http://imgur.com/kCVxg7O)
>> ARTICLE
Everything with Ukai was hilarious, especially with Yachi. "Blonde hair and pierced ears! To think that he's a fan too... I'm gonna get killed!" 
>> ARTICLE
The scenes with Yachi and Ukai were anime original scenes too. Pretty damn hilarious! 
>> ARTICLE
I think the fact that I had a silly grin on my face the whole time speaks enough about my feelings towards this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Why last season and probably this season are 10/10 for me. I can't help but just be entertained the entire episode. Makes me feel so happy
>> ARTICLE
I was about to write this too. Literally had a smile for 23 minutes, this show is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
> "She's pretty. The mole by her mouth is sexy too. So pretty."

New girl understands.
>> ARTICLE
Best girl conflictions
>> ARTICLE
I think they've shown Yachi as an introvert pretty well. Especially when she was totally spent after being exposed to Hinata's outgoing self for a while.

Very warm and pleasant episode + first few minutes = gold.

Wonder why they've made it only 5 minutes though.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata is a bright ray of light. I'm surprised no-one's gotten sunburn from being around him too long. 
>> ARTICLE
If I recall correctly, 'Hinata' means to face the sun, or a sunny place.
>> ARTICLE
How an Anime about people playing volleyball can capture my attention every week and make my laugh/smile consistently.... I will never quite understand.

>> ARTICLE
You should watch Hajime No Ippo. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh. I'm after he loses his championship match to the old guy. Then it got redundant. Oh, tough guy with weird technique, let's adapt. Oh hard fight, almost lose, but we win. Yay.
>> ARTICLE
I understand how you feel, but I believe that all the matches after the Ippo vs Date match are some of the best episodes of the entire anime series (or of any sports anime series, for that matter). The Takamura world title match in the Hajime No Ippo: The New Challenger season, and the main Ippo match in the Hajime No Ippo: Rising season, are especially high quality. It's not just the matches themselves are really good, but the character development of the main cast and the opposing fighters are really well done. I'm not going to lie though, some of the animation in the newer episodes (Rising) are not as good as the older episodes, but that's dependent on personal taste.
>> ARTICLE
Add Cross Game to that list.  
>> ARTICLE
My brother likes to call this show "the dancing show"
mainly cause he walked in during this [part](https://youtu.be/BuIvu24RCnA?t=34)
>> ARTICLE
and Baby Steps. more people need to know about this godly anime
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps is okay. It's a little too focused on the tennis though. There aren't many funny scenes and the side characters aren't really that involved. 
>> ARTICLE
But baby steps has one of the best romantic sub plot compared to sports anime genre.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that was kinda the charm of Baby Steps. It took a realistic approach to the sports anime genre, which isn't too popular, it seems. Or at least, from the few I've seen/head of. I like all the technical mumbo-jumbo and his technical thought of "How do I get out of this situation" was interesting since it was a change from the teamwork/willpower kinda thing.

That's coming from someone who LOVED Kuroko too. I enjoyed the different approach.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, there have been some tears while watching and reading Haikyuu.

Still don't quite know how, but I love it.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I'm gonna cry during every episode. There's just so much hopefulness and hard work from everybody and I just love that shit 
>> ARTICLE
They were just eating food wtf I hardly ever cry even for sad stuff. ;_;

This episode is full of giggles. I love it.

You know what, I'm kinda happy that the people who are pretentious enough to think they are above sports animes will miss out on this since Haikyuu is exactly full of all the best type of characters and comedy they yearn for in slice of lifes.

As for the everyone else who just hasn't stumbled across this yet, I really think this season of Haikyuu is gonna hit really big and by its conclusion will have hopefully really grown in popularity.

I really like the new girl, Yachi, wasn't it. She really fits well into the cast. And she seems to be getting along really well with Hinata. Also their reaction to Hinata's English test was solid gold.

As a non-native-English speaker I won't make those mistakes that often. At least I hope so <.<

Yeah, I pounded out the first season real quick before this started and boy, I'm gonna have to get used to not watching it when I need it
>> ARTICLE
Her misjudgment of people and then feeling super guilty later was my favourite. It's a hard thing introducing a new character when we already have an established team of extremely likable characters without messing that chemistry up but I'm really looking forward to her becoming a part of the gang. Especially if it means more lines and screen time for kiyoko.
>> ARTICLE
[*"I judged someone by their appearance again!"*](https://imgur.com/l1XUAYU)

Yeah i like the way they made use of the exams, to introduce her rather than just having it as a standard road block. 
More than that though, im happy that she hasn't just been thrown is as a love interest, AKA they are treating her as a human, not just motivational eye candy
>> ARTICLE
>No! I don't want to wait another week for another episode. Please give me another one now ;_;

The true suffering will start once they start playing.

I actually dropped the manga for a couple months because it was in the middle of a match and I wanted to be 100% sure it was finished before reading it again.

Do not worry my friend, do not do that. Get hyped for the next episode ;D

If she's there for the practice match in the next episode, she's bound to see it.

Besides, didn't he block the shot that would've hit her face?

He did, but that just proves he is quick on his feet. I want her to see him the way others have seen him in s1. Flying upwards before the net to score.

[Yesssss](http://i.imgur.com/1BHaUVp.png). They did Yachi's awkward and paranoid personality perfectly. She's such a laugh. I can't wait for more of her!!!

Also, [Tanaka and Noya tryin' to *physically* run away from their problems](http://i.imgur.com/ZDjegja.png) is the best thing. I kinda wish Ennoshita didn't round them up. I would've loved to see where they were going.

[Everyone](http://i.imgur.com/aQnex9W.png) reacting to news of tomorrow's practice match is adorable. Also Kageyama in navy blue *swoons* I am so weak

The soundtrack at 20:23 (it played in S2 EP1 as well) is *AMAZING* I love it so much already. (seems like it'll be played during intense volleyball-playing moments)

While this episode was significantly less hype than last week's, it was still absolutely amazing and showed how entertaining the slice-of-life side of Haikyuu!! is. I can't wait for next week's episode! (no, like really, I **can't** wait *someone help me pls*)

new girl is awesome. is it me or has the haikyuu gotten a lot more fun now in the 2nd season
>> ARTICLE
I like to point out that kiyoko spoke more in this episode than the first season

>> ARTICLE
I wish episodes weren't 5 minutes long... ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaaand villager B makes her appearence! The OST is perfect, especially when Yachi thinks Hinata is a manager. 

The pace is good, ~2 manga chapters per anime chapter. With this pace, the season will probably end with [Manga Spoilers](/s "The beginning of the Aoba Jousai rematch, Damn...  Welp Season 3 Hype!")

Edit: Words 
>> ARTICLE
The OST when Yachi thinks Hinata is a manager is called "Chemical Change" and it is from S1 and it is possibly my *favorite* soundtrack from S1 (it memorably plays during a great montage in one of the earlier episodes) and the *entire* Haikyuu!! soundtrack is so amazing and underappreciated. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure episodes involving matches will do through more manga chapters, since they usually have less dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I was just calculating with that pace without counting the chapters with matches on them. Hopefully we get to see that full match animated.
>> ARTICLE
But also Natsu, guys. Natsu made an appearance and we are all so #blessed  
>> ARTICLE
Yachi completes me. Shes too adorable for her own good. 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is such a wonder for me. Nowadays I usually read whatever becomes anime before it does so when it ends up being animated I can't help but skip some parts yet I re-read Haikyuu several times and still watch the episodes as if they're fresh new. So good.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, next episode will be super hype! I just can't wait to see the scene [spoiler](/s "where Hinata will deliver his line where he convinces Yachi to finally join Karasuno as Karasuno's manager") animated in its full glory! It's one of my most favorite scene in the story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm already shipping hinata and yachi. When they both jumped together in the gym... I just can't. 
>> ARTICLE
Love Yachi already. Her goofy and paranoid personality is really entertaining, and seeing her grow in confidence alongside the rest of the time will definitely be a joy to watch. Fantastic episode, had a massive stupid grin plastered over my face the whole time. Can't wait for Yachi to see Hinata and Kageyama's freak quick. Next week can't come soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
NANTEKOTO!
>> ARTICLE
This anime is getting  better and  better with each episode. 
definitely my favorite sports anime so far
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad this show is back! I was smiling the whole episode and can't wait for more. I genuinely love pretty much everything about this show. :D It's by far one of if not the best sports anime I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god the beginning of this episode had me crying from laughter. I'm so glad this is back but the week to week wait is killing me!
>> ARTICLE
Finally, manager Isabelle makes her appearance. 
>> ARTICLE
This anime is too good. I was smiling through the entire episode.

Yachi is adorable. The humor is, as always, on point. It's actually one of my favorite things in haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was hilarious, well paced, and we have an "OMG BEST GIRL". All in all, it was a good day.
>> ARTICLE
i hope we get to the volleyball soon. i need more scenes like last week's episode where he just stares into that guys eyes and says he'll crush him. need more hype scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode was fantastic; had a smile on my face the whole damn time. This most certainly looks like it'll be a step up from the first season!
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or was the scene where hinata and kageyama walking towards yachi animated really really well? cause woah o-o
>> ARTICLE
All I've heard from my mate who has read the manga is about how best girl could finally show up this week....well... Yachi best girl! 
>> ARTICLE
I love it. More focus on the women! The only thing I missed from S1 was more development on Shimizu. Good thing it's already going! =)

I can't be the only one seeing Hinata & Yachi boarding the ship of love?
>> ARTICLE
The only things on Hinata's mind are balls. 



Of the volleying variety.

Yamaguchi for sure! He seems to already have a crush on her and he doesn't get any love in the series.

"Yeah nah" - Hinata

Inb4 "dug deep backed ourselves full credits to the boys."

does anyone know what chapter of the manga this episode covers?
>> ARTICLE
I made a thread about this episode on MAL but the f.cking Stark700 bot just deleted it bc nobody allowed to make episode discussion on that site only him the bot.Somebody needs to ban the OCD freak.
>> ARTICLE
I always appreciate how this show avoids hyping up the match for next episode and leaves you high and dry for another week. They give you just enough to feel like you got a good amount of action and leave you excited for next week. 

Also, the best way to fool your enemies is to fool your allies. 
>> ARTICLE
[This](http://i.imgur.com/MsnCeqR.jpg) reaction was even funnier when I thought that Asahi's open mouth was his tongue sticking out.
>> ARTICLE
That scene had me in stitches.
>> ARTICLE
I loved that final scene, and while I feel sorry for Asahi (as he's my fav character), this shot was priceless. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I'm not getting the ending on Crunchyroll.
>> ARTICLE
Same. I had to watch the last five minutes on some random streaming site. 
>> ARTICLE
HEY! That random streaming site has a name you know. 
>> ARTICLE
Came here to say that, I could of sworn it was his tongue he was sticking out. Even still it was a great moment and a great way to end the episode
>> ARTICLE
Cackled when I saw this. Poor Asahi, no pipe for you!
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was gonna bite his tongue XD
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting Kageyama to dump it either, well played though.
>> ARTICLE
That ending was just amazing, it's the first sport anime I seriously watch and I'm speechless with how much I feel involved into the match.

Also ,seeing Oikawa mad felt so good. I'm 100% picking up the manga as soon as the anime is over.
>> ARTICLE
Give Kuroko no Basuke a go as well, you'll love it :)!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i've been told to watch Kuroko multiple times , but I've also heard it's going a bit too much in the "super power" thing that would kinda break the realistic aspect that Haikyuu got.

But I'll give it a try :)
>> ARTICLE
While slightly off topic, I hope you give Ping Pong a go as well
>> ARTICLE
Give Baby Steps a try if your looking for a realistic anime that has to do with sports. Its about Tennis. Also Diamond No Ace for Baseball 
>> ARTICLE
The super power thing gets more and more annoying as the series goes on, the current match in the manga is the worst sadly. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. At first I love the anime, but as it goes on, it gets to the point I can't stop myself from raising an eyebrow for every power-ups they got.
>> ARTICLE
If you want realistic, Chihayafuru is pretty amazing. Sure Karuta is not a traditional type of a sport, but when it comes to the tournaments, Chihayafuru gives the same feeling as Haikyuu does. Though, it does go a bit into the shoujo genre.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is technically a josei. I thought it felt kind of like a mix between a shounen and a shoujo though.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko no Basuke is currently the 4th best selling manga in Japan. It's immensely popular I'll give you that.

Compared to Haikyuu, its much more fast paced but less realistic.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Hajime No Ippo, you won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
If people with knowledge about the industry are to believed, *Haikyuu!!* should be around in anime for a long time to come.
>> ARTICLE
It currently has 29,000 sales per volume average, which all things considered is pretty fucking great. Granted it will probably drop after the first couple volumes, but I don't expect it to drop below 20,000.
>> ARTICLE
This year has been such a great year for the sports genre. Although nothing still comes close to KnB in terms of popularity, Haikyuu and Baby Steps are still great followups to add to the genre.
>> ARTICLE
Honesly I don't get with Kuroko no Basket popularity. If I have to rank Basket anime/manga, Kuroko is probably 3rd at best. With Slam Dunk at 1st and Harlem Beat 2nd. I followed the manga but stopped after a while.

I loved Baby Step, after Prince of Tennis, it was a breath of fresh air. a "normal" protagonist whose super power is OCD and hardwork. I felt the same with Haikyuu, the protagonist do have some kind of "power" but at least they're still sort of "human".

>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Hajime no Ippo? It's absolutely amazing and it isn't about super powers either, all hard-work and dedication.
>> ARTICLE
Ofc, it's one of few anime that I don't mind having multiple seasons. It's long because it **needs** to be long. Though the Dempsey roll is kind of over the top though :D.
>> ARTICLE
I'd agree that Kuroko is over rated. It's not a bad show but it feels like there are so many better sports, even basketball, series out there. I like the attention it brings to the genre but the amount of spot light it takes gets me a little rustled.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of in the same boat.  I have always avoided sports anime/manga, because quite honestly I don't give two shits about sports.  But, during the last season there was a lot of sports shows starting to air and I was bored.

So, on a whim I watched this show.  Now, it's in my top 3 for watching every week.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly was never the biggest fan of sports. Never really played them after a young age. Nor do I watch them at all, but I watch almost all sports anime for the camaraderie and the feeling of watching the players overcome their inner struggles and their opponents.
>> ARTICLE
Try watching Kuroko no Basket, it feels alot like this :)
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko no Basket is a bit better simply because the excitement of sports action translating into anime works a lot better with basketball. with that said, I love Haikyuu!! and Diamond No Ace as well. Free is probably the lowest one on my list. Honestly, swimming isn't that exciting in an action anime.
>> ARTICLE
The appeal of Free isn't really in the swimming (though the gorgeous water animation is enough to give any discerning eye an art boner). It's got much stronger themes of camaraderie, friendship, past v. future, and so on. It's more like a coming of age story centered around guys who swim than it is a sports anime about swimming.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is probably the best sports anime that I've seen that translates the emotions and actions of the court to the screen. Maybe it's because I've only played basketball for fun, but Haikyuu is fantastic to watch with background knowledge in volleyball, it really makes you see a bunch of techniques in a new light.
>> ARTICLE
There are only so many synonyms for "fucking amazing". And Haikyuu wants you to use them all every episode.
>> ARTICLE
THESE [SENPAIS](http://i.imgur.com/qN0mS0k.png) ARE SO ADORABLE. The Tanaka and Noya bromance is strong.

I just love the little inserts the anime adds that aren't included in the manga!


Also, nothing beats the catchiness of Go! Go! Let's Go! Let's Go, Datekou!
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, agreed! That stupid Dateko chant is stuck in my head :(
>> ARTICLE
That Kageyama setter dump was wonderfully executed and topped off with a snarky remark.

edit: [Haikyuu!! Episode 19 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/haikyuu-episode-19.html)
>> ARTICLE
Very well done, a good read. That's one thing I love about Haikyuu!! Some of the cinematography/scene composition is absolutely flawless. There was a similar cinematographic set piece done for Asahi's pipe spike against Dateko. It was just such a brilliant spectacle of animation technique.

Edit: [Here's the scene. I've got chills from watchng that whole sequence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8b5oH3XWRg&t=17m6s)
>> ARTICLE
I've literally watched that scene from that exact moment well past 10 times by now. Almost watched it daily even after episode 18 came out. If I had to rate any scene a 10/10 this would be one of them. The music in that scene is just perfect as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Haikyuu!!, Hunter X Hunter and Aldnoah.Zero have my favourite soundtracks from shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
Id be lying if I didn't watch that and nishinoyas incredible save at least 6 times.
>> ARTICLE
Love [Hinata & Nishinoya's](http://i.imgur.com/ZG5D10P.jpg?1) reactions. I understand how they feel though. In my late 20's and I still get carded for rated R-movies! Sigh...
>> ARTICLE
Still 20, get carded for ma 15+movies. I'm not even that short for an asian. Australians are just all freakishly tall
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't just a bluff, *or* a double bluff.

That was a freaking **triple bluff**.

This series always has something incredible, every episode.
>> ARTICLE
He was given a lot of options, and he decided to take on the line himself and came away with the result. As a playmaker the best thing you want is to have tonnes of options to choose from
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I just can't get into the OP as much as the old one. It just doesn't bring the same level of hype as before. :( Still a good song, just not as hype. Hope next one is more hype.
>> ARTICLE
I skip the opening now, yeah. The last one really made my adrenaline pump and this one doesn't. I also skip the second ED, while the first wasn't too great it was a real ear worm for me and I loved the accompanying animation.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea if Haikyuu!! will get a second season?
>> ARTICLE
Nothing confirmed but so far the first volume have sold almost 30,000 BD/DVDs. Also the anime boosted manga sales. So unless the show's production committee hates money, it will most likely get a second season. 
>> ARTICLE
But if there was a second season, how close would the anime be to the manga?
>> ARTICLE
the manga seems pretty far in, probably enough for a second season adaptation. so about as close as this season is.
>> ARTICLE
fuk yee

Sorry, bout Aoba Josai's fight song is nowhere near as good as Dateko's. Let's go, let's go, let's go DATEKO!!!

Aoba Josai's fight song is a carbon copy of Iwatobi's one anyway...

I noticed that, and I was wondering if perhaps it was just a conventional sports chant in Japan? It sounds like it could basically work for any sport.

I was expecting Oikawa to notice Asahi and manage to block him just to show how next level he was, but Kageyama just tipping it over the net was amazing. I'm really hoping Kageyama surpasses his senpai this match.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu episodes are like watching a marathon, everyone paces themselves so it starts off slow but then near the end it suddenly spreads up until the climax that is the ending. The ending of every episode lately has been so good.

Well, you could say, they **set** it up pretty well.

I mean, you *could* say that. If you [must...](http://stat.profile.ameba.jp/profile_images/20140724/08/38/s5/j/o064003601406156626444.jpg) 

^well ^played ^though ^^ha

This shit is so much better at getting my adrenaline pumping than anything else this season. Fucking AOTS for me, no question.
>> ARTICLE
I've waited forever for this match..... It's going to be so good :D Karasuno Fight!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
Ah cool, good to know that this matchup is gonna be good, I was thinking that this should have been more down across the tournament, like in the semi finals or something, i would have loved to see Seijoh fight against the nekoma or cat people. 

Question, do you think this fight is gonna take the rest of the season, or will there be one more?
>> ARTICLE
This show has 25 episodes, why would the match last 6 episodes? lol
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that we'll see an episode or 2 after this match maybe 3..... But i'm not quite sure... Don't cut my throat off if i'm mistaken :)
>> ARTICLE
Too late, you're already on my list. 
>> ARTICLE
wow. i dont read the manga so i thought kageyama was going to do a fake out and the spike the ball to win the match/set next episode like how oikawa did for the first point but this ending as infinitely better.

haikyuu!! so good, so great.
>> ARTICLE
The dump and the taunt afterwards. Just perfect!
>> ARTICLE
I went into this episode thinking it'd be a little slower, a stop gap between two matches. Even the build up episodes are so full of hype! Maybe it's just how much I love this show, but every episode takes me for an emotional ride. This week I could feel Karasuno's determination as if it were my own. The sound track really plays in to driving the tone. I don't know if its always been this good but I really keyed into it this week.

As for Kageyama... He is one bad, bad man with some serious ice in his veins. Next week can't come soon enough.

Damn, I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
Plaid pants with a shirt and tie? Oikawa's clothing choice is questionable

I have a really hard time getting hyped up by either the OP or ED now. I'm not saying they're bad, I just don't feel the hype like the old ones. On the other hand, the show itself still makes me hype as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree. From hype opening its gone to nostalgic look-back sounding opening. I miss my IMAGINATION.
>> ARTICLE
Yes YES YES! I've been waiting for these chapters to be animated.


The part about the side characters was the reason why I fell in love with Haikyuu. Making me love all the characters with their mini backstories and character development. That scene was so good, with the fucking ost and all, damn, I'm in tears. I just love their line: "I got to play volleyball too."  


AND GOOD GOD, DID THEY DELIVER WITH THAT NOYA SCENE! I've been holding myself back for the sake of non-manga readers BUT DAMMIT I LOVE THAT SCENE WHERE NOYA IS SUCH A FUCKING SENPAI. CAN HE PLEASE BE MY SENPAI? PLEASE NOYA, BE MY SENPAI. (sorry, could not contain). 

But seriously, Noya is so awesome. [Chapter 41, p. 19](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/153023/haikyuu_ch41_by_casanova/19) is forever engraved in my heart #noyapls

>> ARTICLE
That whole team montage made me cry my eyes. That was so fucking beautiful. It's now my #1 sports anime right now because of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
We're already on chapter 41? Damn.
>> ARTICLE
It really is easy to underestimate how fast we go through chapters. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what I was thinking...
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how many of you have played volleyball but as a former high school player the one thing this show absolutely nails is the emotion that every player feels while playing. Right from the start with Hinata falling in love with the game. Then the intensity during matches. But this episode left me in tears. It brought back all the emotions I had after my last match (we came up 3 points short in a match in which we were heavy underdogs). This show perfectly captures the sadness of knowing that you'll never step on a court again or get another chance to win. But even then, in the end it's all ok because at least you got to play volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
I played high school ultimate Frisbee (sort of the same underrated sport) and this ep had me in tears. My team won states and gradually got further in westerns (nationals was split into east and west US) and we ended up ranking top 10 in the nation. Losing at that level and knowing I wouldn't play with some of my teammates who I'd known since elementary school was a really hard transition. Knowing we made it that far together is one of my most cherished memories and this episode hit me hard. Sports are fucking heartbreaking and incredible
>> ARTICLE
I'm basically reliving my high school years right now :') all those early morning and late afternoon practices...

Makes me wish I trained hard enough to try out for varsity in University.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I was actually wondering how realistic the basic structure of the tournament was. Like, in every sport I ever played, a season-long tournament would be a round robin, and there'd also be additional day-long/weekend-long tournaments. So, a loss would suck, but you'd know that you'd get to play again pretty soon. 

Here, it seemed that, if you lost, you were done for the season... and it was only the beginning of the season.  
>> ARTICLE
For me it was a lot of regular season games, 2 tournaments during the season, and then districts with 8 pools of 4-5 teams with the top 2 of each pool advancing to the state tournament, so we'd have roughly 30 games in a season. I would go crazy if we only had 2 or 3 practice games and then a do-or-die tournament.
>> ARTICLE
[That expression](http://i.gyazo.com/2fbe446fdaf9484180d421a2828f0430.gif)
>> ARTICLE
"If all this were a work of fiction...(*well I mean*) the guys who go to Nationals would be the protagonists, (*boy have I got news for you buckaroo*) and the rest of us would just be extras" (*uncomfortable laughter*).

So, yeah. This episode was good, Noya senpai best senpai, and I love that this show continues to avert those sports tropes (the whole "couldn't instantly become a strong team through power of will and/or friendship and/or friendship with dudes named Will" thing) like a boss. 

Wins and losses are meaningful, no one is vilified (even No Brows got some development at the end there!), and basically 8/10 would have feels attack in hallway while accosting my childhood friend again.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad that this focus on tertiary characters was done right; it could have ruined the progression of the plot. Ikejiri and Yui basically acted as stopgaps to highlight how determined the current Karasuno team is. We get cool moments, like Noya being best senpai, and follow-up on the whole ruthless iron-wall storyline that ties together with the next match. [HYPE, HYPE, HYPE!](http://i.imgur.com/6IjYKvr.gif) 

Also, that [face.](http://i.imgur.com/u1l1dBv.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
THANK YOU that face was so unnerving and it just lingered to the point that I thought my stream had frozen there. I actually probably made that face at my screen after awhile, now that I think about it.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love the match cuts done between the girls' and the boys' game. That was really done well. It expressed the theme of resiliency in two different settings while maintaining continuity. 

When it comes to the more emotional moments, this show shines at a technical level.

Holy crap the feels in the half of this episode. That little part right before the half about the "backing cast" was brilliant. This Anime just gets better and better, and now we're finally into the tournament for real now

Kageyama's smile was CREEPY 
>> ARTICLE
Did any body else notice that when the coach was helping them receive before dateko that he was spiking balls that weren't being thrown up?
>> ARTICLE
The receivers obviously bounce the ball back to him. It's basicly a cycle of one ball being spiked to the receiver, received, and bounced back to the spiker by the receiver.

The feels :(

You didn't find this episode interesting? I honestly think this might be the best episode yet. I was so emotionally attached in the first half and felt pure hype in the second. This could quite easily be my favourite episode of any sports anime to be honest.

im not ready for these feels man
>> ARTICLE
Arrrggg next week isn't here already!?!? exited for the match
>> ARTICLE
I liked how the two matches ended with same score. 25-14. 
>> ARTICLE
I like how this show can make you cheer for the other team. 
>> ARTICLE
Sports anime get me so fucking hyped.

I think Haikyuu is one of my favorites alongside OoFuri. They're really similar, actually. The characters, and even the supporting characters, are all so charismatic. It's really the draw of sports anime in the first place. Having the focus be on side characters for awhile is great, ~~because~~ but it adds that confusing feeling of crushing defeat and happiness when my favorite characters win.

 I also think the pacing is wonderful. Maybe I just love slow-paced shows, or maybe it's actually faster paced than I think, but, damn, it's building that hype up so well. ~~And making me cry. Fuck you, Haikyuu.~~

I cant get tired of saying the same thing, this anime is fucking good.

Does anyone know what the soundtrack is at the 9:00 minute mark?
>> ARTICLE
This was a great episode, Noya is the best
>> ARTICLE
Dis gun be good :D !
>> ARTICLE
This episode was sooo good. The emotional scenes hit as hard as they did because of some genius directing choices (the game was going the same for both underdog teams, showing the connection between ALL volleyball players). When Hinata stopped to look back at the player he defeated you know it's because he saw himself on the losing side. This moment that appeared casual hit even harder because of the Hinatas moment of shock that he actually won. Just super good stuff over all 
>> ARTICLE
that beyond the fourth wall dialogue though

Edit: Also did anyone else notice that when they were doing receive practice, he was spiking balls that came from the sky?

Shizmizu didn't even throw any balls up, she was holding onto one the entire time
>> ARTICLE
Predictable but still a really good episode. Definitely was emotional the first half (but even then I would say I felt more emotional during yesterday's Diamond no Ace episode) and very hyped for the game because of the 2nd half. Can't wait for next week. Also like others have said I definitely still prefer the first opening and ending.

Man this show is getting better and better.

This getting more and more than what expect for i really love how they portrait that losing is part of the game and a start of a new beginning. 

dem feels 

I don't read the manga so is it enough to make season 2?
>> ARTICLE
They are getting there, so yes, maybe in some months (2015~)
>> ARTICLE
This show man... Just a little something special for my Sunday mornings. Great anime!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that first half,... BREAK MY HEART, WHY DON'T YOU? 

I found myself rooting for everybody. I like how this show showed all the teams that lost, those that would never play again because they were third-years and stuff. I also love how Ikejiri mentioned that in fiction, usually, the ones winning were the protagonists while the ones losing were the extras. I realized I don't see a single character here as an extra. That's how good this show is. They all have their personalities and goals and struggles and you feel for them.

Funny comment I found recently

>what the fuck is sports anime. today a guy threw another guy a ball and i almost started crying.
>> ARTICLE
Hilarious because it's true. I cannot remember the amount of times I was in years because of Haikyuu or the Kuroko manga. It is literally just people throwing balls at each other but damn, it's so emotional.
>> ARTICLE
For most other genres it takes something pretty heavy or exciting to get a reaction from me.  Sports anime I'll feel like that 2-3 times an episode and feel like crying when it ends.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty true though.
>> ARTICLE
Nishinoya seems to get on with everybody [so well](https://38.media.tumblr.com/40488d96c4e69609cfbbcbeb2f824804/tumblr_nasycnUX441sq9yswo1_r1_500.gif) :3

Well, would you hit your guardian angel, especially when he's cool like [this](http://i.imgur.com/RW5kxmc.gif)? 
>> ARTICLE
I wish he would get more moments like these!
>> ARTICLE
Do you really think this match is going to end without Nishinoya going god mode on one of Oikawa's serves?
>> ARTICLE
Not anymore!
>> ARTICLE
I like how they balance and give each player a time to shine, especially for Mr. Refreshing. [Even](http://i.imgur.com/iAxbsvU.jpg) [benchwarmer-san](http://i.imgur.com/eGBny8a.jpg) gets to motivate!

Ennoshita-san is cute
>> ARTICLE
IT HAS A NAME?!
>> ARTICLE
Azumane's spike through the blocker at the end was so fulfilling! Suguwara really showed his place on the team this week, I can't wait to see Kageyama go ape-shit on Aoba Josai next week.
>> ARTICLE
Next week seems so far away =(
>> ARTICLE
I know, and the episodes go by so damn quickly T_T 
>> ARTICLE
[Sugawara...](http://i.imgur.com/XKVCViy.jpg?1) 

I really loved the dynamic of this episode. It's nice to see how Sugawara changes the team in his own way.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool to have another attack strategy as well. Setters really control the pace of the game so being able to switch out the setter on the fly is really useful 
>> ARTICLE
[Whats up with Kageyama's face in this part before the second set?](http://puu.sh/b5RcC.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, a penny!
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's walking onto the court to play, but he was still benched and it looked like he forgot for a second 
>> ARTICLE
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THIS SHOW ARE SO GREAT. EVEN OIKAWA IS GREAT. I LOVE THIS SHOW 
>> ARTICLE
I think that's what I like the most about this anime. The message in the show, where volleyball is all about your team and not you, is conveyed through the characters. The show does not act like it has a singular main character. Everyone seems like a main character.
>> ARTICLE
I think you mean, especially. 
>> ARTICLE
I just put even because he is the current antagonist, but he's great 
>> ARTICLE
You'll like him even more in Season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully the show's sales are good so we get a season 2. This show is too good 
>> ARTICLE
I really like to believe that Kuroko no Basket opened the path for more good sports anime like this. And as someone who CONSUMED the manga of Haikyuu, I can ensure that the storytelling/pacing, characters, action and dialogues just get better.
>> ARTICLE
The Haikyuu manga, damn. It was at around chapter 60 when I started and I lost sleep over that shit. So good. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a lot of other sports show use the side characters as comedic relief or as a foil that reacts to (i.e. camera cuts to shocked/awed facial expression and choking-on-tongue sound effect) or explains something cool the main character does (e.g. every goddamn episode of One Outs), which makes it kind of hard to care about the rest of the cast. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh Sugawara, the true heart of the team. He really knows how to tie everyone together and bring out their best. Last week someone mentioned Suga would probably play a lot like Oikawa and that analysis is spot on. He doesn't have the talent but he's got heart.

I love these characters. I love this team. I frickin love this series.

Fly!
>> ARTICLE
Slower episode overall but pretty heartwarming with all these expressions made by two karasuno setters. Looking forward to the next episode and the kageyama-hinata crazy duo combo :D
>> ARTICLE
I was really hoping they ended the episode with one of the freak quicks just to get us pumped up for next week 
>> ARTICLE
The Ace's break through was so much better as the cliffhanger for this week. Every break has its place.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I'd love to see another one of Hinata's flashy spikes like [this](http://youtu.be/BHc9EJU-LAU?t=1m32s) one, gave me goosebumps the first time I seen it.
>> ARTICLE
>  to see another one of Hinata's flashy spikes like thi

It still gives me goosebumps
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, Sugawara's the best.
>> ARTICLE
ARGH WHY ARE THE EPISODES SO SHORT!!! I swear to god they finish episodes in simultaneously both the most satisfying and unsatisfying way possible. There's always a concluding point but you just want more.
>> ARTICLE
Just enjoy them while you can. There are only four episodes left this season.
>> ARTICLE
....only four episodes left ((  ))
>> ARTICLE
omg no
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, the series is selling insanely and with the pace the manga is coming out, there should be enough source materiel for a new season fairly soon, so expect a second season in say a year or a year and a half.
>> ARTICLE
Wow Sugawara, attacks everyone and has the cutest high-gives with Nishinoya.

Happy to see Kageyama set himself straight, gonna be a killer next episode - Hinata's gonna shine!
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll usually has good translations, but some of their teams are *really* sketchy. Haikyuu has consistently been one of their worst translated series.

In the final scene today, when Sugawara was about to say "Yoshi, Ka--" and he cuts himself off and the scribbly text shows up, that should be translated something like "Go win". But he realizes he's separating himself from the team and the team's victory, and corrects himself: "Let's win this" or "We're gonna win this."

Crunchyroll instead goes full retard and translates both of these as "Let's win", completely missing the point. They make similar mistakes (and simple translation errors) several times every episode, it's maddening, and I really pity people who are literally missing half of the best moments in the series due to the language barrier. 
>> ARTICLE
And thats why we have reddit.
>> ARTICLE
We finally got Suga's moment, which was brilliant and heartwarming. Its amazing how this show is able to bring out the emotions of everyone watching it
>> ARTICLE
I loved that moment of mutual respect between Daichi and Oikawa when he returned his serve.

Suga was simply amazing, I really want to see him play more, he even managed to get tsuki fired up
>> ARTICLE
YES! This is what I also was thinking. Tsukishima was probably a bit irritated by the praise, but you could definitely feel that Suga got him motivated, too.

AACCCKKKK I love this show!!
>> ARTICLE
This show just has a way of highlighting characters in a very gratifying way. 

Sugawara is definitely better at being a glue for the team and seeing the bigger picture but Kageyama gives them intensity and edge. Kageyama can get overwhelmed mentally while with Sugawara it's physically/athletically. I like how the show presented these differences.
>> ARTICLE
At the end, can someone explain why Suga changed the way he said let's win? My japanese isn't that good...

what was written looked like "katteyo" but he hesitated and said what sounded like "katsuzou." What's the difference?
>> ARTICLE
Suga was about to say  (kate yo), which is the imperative form of the verb  (katsu = to win). An English translation for this would be something like "Go win this!" It's what you would say to someone else, imploring others to achieve victory. As a bystander, stuck on the sidelines.

But Suga changed his mind, stopping himself, and instead chose to say  (katsu zo). This could be translated as "Let's win this!" with the implication being that Suga now finally feels like he's part of the team again, even if he's not active on the court himself.

Not sure if the subs managed to convey this character development.
>> ARTICLE
It did not. Crunchyroll's Haikyuu translation team has been basically consistently awful, which is a pity since they do have decent groups producing decent translation on other series. They translated both instances as "Let's win", completely missing the point.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, I'm fucking tearing up. Goddamnit Haikyuu, why are you so fucking amazing?
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. This was the episode I've been waiting for. It had me cheering through the whole thing
>> ARTICLE
The scene when Kageyama and Suga have their monologue at the same time about wanting to play. So many feels >.<
>> ARTICLE
Nice episode. This anime always warms up my sundays :D
>> ARTICLE
Suga is such a mom, seriously. Hahaha


Also, that Asahi spike for Suga. Ugh, I'm tearing up agaaaaain
>> ARTICLE
Okay okay i almost teared up. Sugawara  is best
>> ARTICLE
This show manages to bring out all of my emotions all at once. I don't think I've ever cared for an entire team in a sport anime as much as a care about Karasuno and I definitely havnt ever liked about or cared for the entire opposing side.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, this anime gets me too damn emotional. Teared up like 3 times... 
>> ARTICLE
This is how you write good characters. Especially Kageyama. I hated him at the beginning. The way he has changed over the course of the season is so dramatic.
>> ARTICLE
I was really surprised that people didn't like him in the beginning. Maybe I just have a soft spot for the ones who are really passionate and determined, and Kageyama showed plenty of positive traits within the very first episode. Sure he has communication issues, but it never bothered me.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of dislike him at the beginning too. But a lot of happenings going on this match made you realize that he wasn't that bad when he was nicknamed "King of the Court". He was just fighting a lone battle because he got too powerful as a setter. It's like Aomine in KnB.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how many episodes we're getting? Cause I think they should either end this season in a few episodes, or keep going until it basically catches up to the manga
>> ARTICLE
25 episodes
>> ARTICLE
and then second season later?
>> ARTICLE
season 2 when!?
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh~ This episode was a little slower, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  Take some time to give Suga his limelight, he's certainly proved he's an asset to the team.  We've only got a couple episodes until season end, so I expect we're not gonna get a break from the intensity from here on out.
>> ARTICLE
Every Haikyuu!! episode has left me like this () , simply beccause i want more of the series T_T
>> ARTICLE
The feels in this episode just didn't stop flowing
>> ARTICLE
My favorite thing about this anime (and the manga) is that they don't just magically win everything through friendship. They work their butts off constantly to improve, AND THEN THEY STILL DON'T MAGICALLY WIN EVERYTHING EASILY. 
>> ARTICLE
And on that day, the Iron Wall of Dateko received a grim reminder.
>> ARTICLE
Crows don't care about walls.
>> ARTICLE
That we live in permanent fear of small giants
>> ARTICLE
NISHINOYA'S KICK TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY WAS AWEESSOOMMEE. These last 2 episodes were the honestly the best,
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking they would lose the second set all the time, but when I saw that scene I had to replay it three times just to make sure I wasn't seeing things and because it was that awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Just the two of them? I had a break from watching Haikyuu!! every week. I watched 4 episodes last saturday/sunday and it was the most fun I've had watching anime in a while! 

And the emotion in Nishinoyas eyes when Asahi went for the spike was such wonderfull moment.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying that the past episodes weren't good but these past 2 episodes were crazy. 3 episodes ago, I felt like we didn't  really get a backstory to the karasuno girls. Although I still did feel sorry for them. Just wish we got more of a story with them. Then again there's only 25 episodes so you can't do much.these past 2 episodes I'm glad that  Hinata is getting the massive recognition he deserved. The scene where they put wings on him was super awesome. And this episode where asahi prevailed and beat the wall was outstanding. Oh yeah, and the teamwork as well.
>> ARTICLE
[Girls Team Spoiler](/s "There is nothing else really in the manga about the girls team unfortunately.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree pretty much on the girls volleyball team. But that you are saying there's only 25 episodes? You're saying they wont get their [revenge?](http://i.imgur.com/oaoAIRq.jpg)

I haven't read the manga, but I would love another season of Haikyuu!!
>> ARTICLE
I would to see a second season as well. This anime to me, is better than kuroko no basket because it's not dragging out and it's very realistic. Also I feel as if everyone is putting in a significant amount of teamwork. Even sugawara on the bench is very motivational. I'm trying to get my friend to watch this, but he won't believe when I say it's better than kuroko because he loves that anime haha
>> ARTICLE
Last time I saw, the anime is selling ridiculously well (like over 10k per volume) so a second season is very likely.
>> ARTICLE
I had to google it if it was legal (and it is) so i was really surprised by that move.
>> ARTICLE
Reminded me of the 1st ep where Hinata's team mate from the football team kicked the ball during the match
>> ARTICLE
It is but it's totally a last resort in volleyball, and you'll rarely if at all see it in high levels of play, it's impossible to control and normally if you can reach it with your feet you can reach it with your hands by diving for it. Coaches normally get mad when you do it because its seen as lazy and uncommited to the play. Unless you're nishinoya because then you're freaking awesome and have the reaction speed to analyse the play as the ball is being spiked
>> ARTICLE
My players have to do 10 push-ups everytime they kick the ball when they had the possibility to play it otherwise. It is fairly effective, since some played football before volleyball and they like kicking it a lot...
>> ARTICLE
Heh, in highschool every time they tried to make us play voleyball it would en up being Footvolley. Eventually they gave up and we just played soccer.
>> ARTICLE
Loved the episode, but i'd like it if this anime could stop making me cry.
>> ARTICLE
Those feels! From Nishinoya's foot save to the final kill I couldn't sit down.  I let loose a roar of my own somewhere in that sequence. My room mates didn't it appreciate it at 4am but it was worth it. All these emotions just can't be contained!
>> ARTICLE
I swear I get at least a little teary in every episode! How does this anime do this?! D: 
>> ARTICLE
It's the voice acting! Such a intense, high emotion sports anime. It's inspiring as fk.
>> ARTICLE
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH, the final toss & spike and the cheers behind it was amazing.

"Go, Go, Let's Go, Let's Go, Dateko!" made its return again!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome episode!! I especially loved the part where eyebrowless blocker wanted to shake Hinata's hand, oh god his face :(...
>> ARTICLE
A sports anime where the main team doesn't lose until the last 2 minutes? <3 Haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
But they definitely kept the vice of impending doom
>> ARTICLE
So glad I picked this anime up a week ago. For such a poor spring lineup, why wasn't this show more talked about!? 
>> ARTICLE
Because the darling of the Spring Season was a show that transcends the sports genre, making the slow start of Haikyuu looks like child's play. Having said that this second half is going pretty great
>> ARTICLE
that's what we all want to know. Everyone I know who's watched it has loved it and yet it has no hype on this subreddit. Must be because it's sports anime which is just severely under appreciated in general.
>> ARTICLE
[Yosshaaaaa!!](http://i.imgur.com/54OhgPT.jpg) - I hope I get to watch Sugawara in action soon! It'd be nice to see how that would change the team.
>> ARTICLE
Nishinoya is a ninja. What an epic save!
>> ARTICLE
Btw [this](http://gfycat.com/AmusedAccomplishedChital) is probably how the oddball strike would look in real life

if hinata was a 7 footer that is
>> ARTICLE
Now imagine that player is 5'6" and hinata's jumping is borderline magical
>> ARTICLE
Okay but can we talk about [this](http://i.imgur.com/FybAZGX.png); like, Daichi is being papa of the team and reassuring Hinata, but Kags is ready to pummel him into the ground for missing that serve.

Also, [here](http://i.imgur.com/Aafb4P6.png), where we see Nishinoya-senpai and Tanaka killing Oikawa with their death glares for all the girls that he has cheering for him.

I really love this show for the little character interactions like those. For other reasons, too, of course, but I love seeing a contrast between the teammates acting super cool saying grandiose, cheesy lines ("As long as I'm here, you're invincible!" "All of you, keep your eyes forward. Because you have me guarding your backs!" "I'm the ace, but you guys are heroes.") and them acting like total idiots and fighting with each other.
>> ARTICLE
Aone's character is so simple yet so good; hoping they will eventually have that rematch in the future. This is easily my favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the metaphor that Tsukishima made when Hinata was the sun and his job was to make sure the Sun always shines. Glad to see Tsuki get some more time on the screen. 
  
  OMG Asahi's post-game speech was so cute! The look on Hinata and Kageyama's face made it that much more amazing. And Nishinoya's love for Asahi as both a player and a friend is so precious! 
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll translators [fuck up again](http://i.imgur.com/NZfAX6j.jpg). I mean, how hard is it to position the team names correctly on the scoreboard? This isn't the first time this has happened.
>> ARTICLE
i came when nishinoya saved those balls
>> ARTICLE
That final point was brilliant! A great climax to a personal story on the show!
>> ARTICLE
I love this show for a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is its focus on the opposing team. No ones a clear cut villain, they're all just some kids who enjoy playing volleyball. This episodes dialogue between Dateko's first and second years was adorable and also very real. 

Combined with the lack of friendship power and the fact no team has ever just completely fell flat, this is the most realistic sports anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
This is the best way to start Sunday in the history of ways to start Sunday. Goddamn. This episode was so *satisfying.* Character development. A victory that felt earned. Vaguely hilarious off-model moment with the coach towards the end. Beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love how hyped up i get watching this every week, its 430am and now im wide awake again D:
>> ARTICLE
"I am the ace, but you guys are the heros" will go down as one of the most epic quote in the history of sport animes. Asahi is really a beast, GOD DAMN!
>> ARTICLE
Nishinoya is the definition of "wild" though :P

>> ARTICLE
Yeah that save with his leg was pretty epic XD
>> ARTICLE
That save with the foot was incredible, nice job.
>> ARTICLE
Damn great episode. They superbly manage to set up the perfect atmosphere and relay the goddam emotions. The music was glove fit as well. I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
Brilliant episode!

Dat foot save by Nishinoya was awesome, and finally ace brings victory. I don't know why but sports anime like this are soo good and easily make it to top.
>> ARTICLE
I am so ready for the upcoming King showdown.
>> ARTICLE
And in that moment, Asahi was a Titan blasting through the Wall.
>> ARTICLE
That OST that played in the last spike of both episode 17 and 18 makes me so damn fucking HYPED.


ALSO, NISHINOYA SERIOUSLY, PLS BE MY SENPAI. 
(The first time I read that, I had to search if it was legal and ended up watching a lot of volleyball games in youtube lol)


DAT ASAHI ROAR TOO. Damn, hype.


I think I know which part of the manga this will end at AND I SWEAR, I'M GONNA BE SO FUCKING MAD IF THEY DON'T GIVE US A SEASON 2. 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit i cried a manly tear at that match point..... The feelings in this show is too strong :')
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, the preview with Kiyoko was absolutely hilarious.  

Looking forward to what seems like a really funny episode next week.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, shed a tear twice this episode. Nishinoya was a badass with his two receives and Sugawara shouting "ONE MORE!" was just so awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know guys, but to me this is the best anime i've seen in a freakin long while. The characters, the animation, the music. It's all spot on.
Can't wait for next weekend.
>> ARTICLE
Literally gave me goosebumps at the end.
>> ARTICLE
This is my feel good anime. I always have this big goofy smile on my face while watching it and I got excited as if I was watching an ongoing volleyball game. These past two episodes have been SO good.
>> ARTICLE
That nishinoya kick! That was some dhalsim stretch move right there.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... This is probably gonna be my aoty at this rate.
>> ARTICLE
this episode was amazing. the animation and the soundtrack are too perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
That awesome feeling when the episode is so good you skip past the intro and the mid break because you can't stand to wait for those extra seconds between the action
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone notice that there are three middles in play around 10:43? Tsukki serves and Dateko hits it back. Asahi passes it and next to him is Nishinoya. Then Hinata calls for a set. Either they skipped some stuff, or the animators messed up. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see the aceuu got that point
>> ARTICLE
haven't been able to watch the anime after reading the manga :-(
>> ARTICLE
I liked how Kageyama memorized all of the signs just by looking at that paper, while Hinata is studying them for days and still having trouble.

And damn, Shimizu's "do your best" was adorable.
>> ARTICLE
The Kageyama scene had me laughing so hard I had to pause the episode. Hinata's face afterwords was just priceless
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Daichi's lady friend has his jersey number as a key-chain.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see more of her but I doubt we will see her much :(.
>> ARTICLE
But wouldn't that be because she'd have Number 1 as well, considering she's the captain for her team?
>> ARTICLE
That's most likely right. Ship sunk.
>> ARTICLE
Let a man hope.

Oh trust me, I pretty much ship anything that breaths in shows.

Very interesting episode. I gotta say it feels weird not seeing the usual Hinata / Kageyama practicing together, especially when they keep getting emphasis on being one of the scariest duos if they can manage to perfect their synergy. 

ALSO MY FEELS FOR HINATA WANTING TO WIN ;-;

edit: The opening sounds really good, I think it's something I'll get addicted to like the first opening.

I didn't even realize that was the new opening lol. Sounds pretty good after i hear it a few times I am sure I will also get addicted to it.

how's this anime? is it like Kuroko? thanks
>> ARTICLE
Its great the people who make this understand the sport it also has funny moments i think if u like sport anime u will really enjoy it, and if u dont like sports anime then its a good one to get you started :D
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of similarities even beyond the common sports anime tropes, but a key difference is that Haikyuu!! Doesn't incorporate all of those crazy powerups and stuff.

Besides that, Haikyuu!! Plays the high school part of the show faithfully. The main characters do make mistakes at times, unlike Kuroko where every match showcased would actually be a game between buffed NBA all stars.
>> ARTICLE
Its great, similar with the awesome bromance but less of how Kuroko went super powerish.

>> ARTICLE
It's somewhat like Kuroko, but no one really has any "super powers". The animation and art style are very good and personally I enjoy the cast of this show much more, since they seem to have a lot more personality and chemistry with one another, especially between Hinata and Kageyama . There hasn't been a "real" match yet and there has only been two practice games, but both were very enjoyable and gave me the same excrement I got from watching Kuroko.  It looks like the first "serious" match of the series will be next episode and I am definitely looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
thanks  

also i think you mean excitement not excrement?
>> ARTICLE
No, he meant excrement...
>> ARTICLE
This anime is like kuroko by the fact it contains two duos trying to be the best. It also has a lot of humor & moments where you can really feel for the main characters.

However, it's realistic and it doesn't try to step out of the bounds of the sport like kuroko does at times, and it isn't as flashy with the plays as kuroko. Most people, like me, find this to be a good thing.

I think if you liked the humor and the character development between the duo of kuroko you will certainly enjoy this.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think it's much better than Kuroko because of the realism and its honor to the actual sport. 
>> ARTICLE
Really high quality animation for a non-action episode. Lots of movement, very dynamic, expressions change freely, etc.
>> ARTICLE
You know, that conversation between the two captains has me wishing we could see some matches that the girls volleyball clubs have with each other.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe a spinoff?
>> ARTICLE
I can't stop smiling. I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone make the crying into a GIF?
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to believe that Kiyoko is the true ace of the team :')
>> ARTICLE
I can  always make time for this every week. It too perfect, the pacing is just right that you dont need to focus too hard, Its really chill.
>> ARTICLE
How many more episodes are left before the season ends? The way the Inter-High  bracket came out each game seems like it could be an episode or two with the personal back stories of each team. 
>> ARTICLE
There are 25 episodes; 11 remain.
>> ARTICLE
Since it's 12~13 left i'm guessing 3 matches?
>> ARTICLE
Shimizu's scene was so precious    
Edit: the new ED is super good too
>> ARTICLE
It felt like a season ending type montage, was pretty weird. Still, I liked it more as it went on.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like we're finally out of the team building phase. I love this show, but if I had one gripe with it it'd be the characterization and development often not being very efficient. 14 episodes to primarily establish characters is really a bit much.

Fortunately, it never felt like it dragged thanks in part to the great animation and soundtrack, but it's primarily because we're watching it week by week. I think marathoning this show would expose the snail's pace it is moving at in a hurry. When you really think about how much we know about the characters and how much has actually happened so far relative to the time spent establishing those things it's actually kind of baffling.

I am very much looking forward to seeing what happens next now that we're done with that. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know Inugami San was part of the Karasuno female volleyball club lol (there's a brunette girl during the pep rally that looks just like her).
>> ARTICLE
I don't watch many sport animes, the only other ones I have watched being Captain Tsubasa amd Yowapeda. After Yowapeda was over I decided to give this one a shot and this was entertaining beyond my imagination. I can't believe I missed the AOTS, well... The whole season. But I had a bunch of episodes to watch without much wait. I caught up though, so... To wait week after week now ;v; (I watched Chaika, NGNL, and Wixoss too, so it wasn't a bad season).
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka getting scolded by Suga at the speech was hilarious.

Oooohh, a pure cold open. Seems like they're cooking up a new opening song.

I know some of you might hate pop songs (or Nicki Minaj), but [this song](http://youtu.be/3n71KUiWn1I?t=25s) was honestly the first thing that came to my mind when they showed the "Fly" poster :3
>> ARTICLE
What I love about this show is that even if you know what will happen (manga reader, spoilers on internet) it still manages to get you completely pumped up and on the edge of your seat. Best episode so far. [Also, I know that pain.](http://i.imgur.com/bpnl3uH.png?1)
>> ARTICLE
the stinging in your hand after spiking a ball for a point was an amazing feeling back when I played. the adrenaline kept it from hurting too much but not enough so that you're still able to feel your all go into every shot (hurts like a bitch during practice tho)
>> ARTICLE
Same, I expected to give up after a couple minutes on the first episode but damn this show has so much more substance than any sports anime I've watched recently.
>> ARTICLE
The soundtrack is lovely.
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode.

Love the Hinata/Kageyama teamwork. So truly heartwarming.

So funny when Hinata screwed up XD

The oddball strike is here~!
>> ARTICLE
No headshots but a comedic match nonetheless.

Must resist reading the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Hm? The king guy got at least one headshot on shorty.
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to Tsookie but nice catch.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukki has even more male tsundere material than Kageyama.
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying this a lot more than Kuroko for some reason, probably because Hinata actually has a personality lol.

Also I love the art style, this show and Isshuukan Friends have a rather european fairy tale style to them that I just love.
>> ARTICLE
That bromance 
>> ARTICLE
Man, Tsukishima gives off some pretty serious Murasakibara vibes with the whole "It doesn't matter how much effort you put in" deal. I wonder how it'll work with him being on the team instead of being an opponent like in Kuroko's.
>> ARTICLE
There's one of those characters in every shonen anime.
>> ARTICLE
who chose to make the nets transparent when the mcs faces are behind them. WTF. It looks awfull.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it will go the same way like the lines on the necks of the characters in kuroko no basket. At first, those things really annoyed me but after a few eps I didnt really notice them anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I coulden't stop myself from noticing too, kinda annoyed me the rest of the episode
>> ARTICLE
As if you don't mentally remove them if there's net blocking their faces
>> ARTICLE
This is turning out to be an amazing anime, perhaps best of the season? The progression shown here is great. I thought after the last episode we got the bonding of Hinata and Kageyama, but this week just sealed the deal.

And can we give a shoutout to this amazing soundtrack! Its just amazing and when Hinata finally got over the summit, the piano part fitted just perfectly
>> ARTICLE
AHHHH. The way they time everything, music, animation, dialogue, shots, it's all fitting together so perfectly. I think my experience is enhanced watching the anime.

This is one of those shows where if you enjoy the manga, you'll definitely enjoy the anime.
>> ARTICLE
What I like about Haikyuu as a sports anime so far is that people still make mistakes. In other anime it seems like if the main character figures out one cool strategy, they can always use it unless their opponent figures out how to stop them. But in this anime, the main characters also have to worry about their own growing skills and if they can consistently pull off ridiculous moves.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea what the instrumental playing behind the epic "view over the summit" moment near the end is called?
>> ARTICLE
Edit: I'm a moron, and didn't read the 'al' at the end of instrumental

No clue what it is, maybe an original score by the sound producer, should be on the OST
>> ARTICLE
them. my manly tears again. i told them to stop it. but wow. So freaking good.. best duo

>> ARTICLE
This is by far my favorite anime of the season. Great episode!
>> ARTICLE
Super awesome episode.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show, definitely my favorite of this season so far.
>> ARTICLE
Them laughs, them feels, and them soundtracks doe!
>> ARTICLE
All i was thinking when Hinata was getting blocked was tip the damn ball or hit line, but man did i shut up once the kings sets started
>> ARTICLE
Even though I have read the manga, I cannot stop loving every one of these episodes. I just get so excited for every episode.
>> ARTICLE
I can't get over how awesome this anime is. It makes me laugh, and it gets me super pumped up. Even if it's pretty predictable, it is always enjoyable, and I love their attitudes. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was a great episode. It's no longer the egocentric King's toss, it's a toss designed for the best spiker. Perfect
>> ARTICLE
On this episode of Naruto Volleyball, Naruto and Sasuke start the team examinations. Naruto convinces Sasuke he will be there to spike any ball tossed to him. Sakura makes two brief appearances. 

Jokes aside (if funny or not) that was some great progress between them. Gonna be interesting to see where they go with the remaining 21 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Even though i knew the Hinata and Kageyama pair would be amazing, this episode still amazed me. I freaking loved everything about this episode !! Can't wait for more :D
>> ARTICLE
that little song they had there before the ed was pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Such a wonderful delight to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode ruled... Can't wait till we get to the first game where they play with blonde :)
>> ARTICLE
Simple, high-energy stuff. This show wears its heart on its sleeve. I totally dig it.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love the sound fx used when Hinata spikes, it's just so satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
So can someone who has read the manga tell me if the pace of this show is on line with it catching up in 25 episodes? If there isn't a second season, that seems awfully short to me for a sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
As of this episode we have covered through chapter 8 of the manga, so with the amount of episodes planned for this season there is no way they will completely catch up to the manga. That being said there are two excellent stopping points that they could very easily get to this season. The anime will likely cover up to either chapter 49 or somewhere around chapter 69 out of 107 total current chapters depending on the pacing they use during the matches.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is like 107 chapters in right now and going by this show's pacing I don't think they'll catch up in 25 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT SPIKE TO GET ANIMATED FOR SO LONG! and ooooh did it feel good
>> ARTICLE
I'm not usually a fan of sports anime. But I'm totally hooked! :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of disappointed. They hyped up this match for the past 2 episodes. I thought it was going to be real intense with the risk of losing the setter position but I feel like it was too care-free.
>> ARTICLE
It's better if it's care free if you ask me because it's only the first match and its a paractice match, you can't just go around making every single match intense as shit. I take this from Slam Dunk and one thing I found annoying about it, the first match of the entire series takes 7 fucking episodes, that's ridiculous, that also has to do a lot with the pacing but you get the idea I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, in the end, it is just a practice match between teammates. And getting all that baggage out now and figuring stuff out is exactly what the captain has wanted this whole time, so it's not as if he'll stop it from happening. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. The conditions which have been given by Captain are here in order to pump them up and to actually try working together. So the main point of this battle isn't a flashy technique or something, but Hinata and Kageyama realizing what a powerful duo they can be if they can put aside their rivalry. At least that's how I understand it as I haven't read manga. 
>> ARTICLE
A little too much humor for an anime that's four episodes in, however still shaping well. As someone who doesn't know the rules for volleyball, they didnt explain much of the match, seemed more like a ball throwing contest.  Nobody really seemed bothered about the score. I cant wait for a more serious match.
>> ARTICLE
If the anime sticks closely to the manga, there will be scenes where some of the rules of volleyball are explained. 
>> ARTICLE
Usually mid-game.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's first to 23? And best of three games?

Been a long time since we played it for PE.
>> ARTICLE
25 
>> ARTICLE
I had to go search what introverted meant in the middle of the episode...
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit Hinata is so one-dimensional that he gets one man blocked
>> ARTICLE
Too many monologues and speeches crammed into one episode which undermined Sugawara's characterization. I feel like that was an excessive amount of set-up just to initiate the chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata.
>> ARTICLE
The series is cool, really liking the feel to it but can't get over the cheesy dialogue, a lot of monologues and seems like they try to force some unecessary drama with the king and the glasses dude, even with the white hair guy, several flashbacks and what not. Hope it gets better tho.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call sledging from "the glasses dude" as drama.
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean sledging?
>> ARTICLE
Smart trashtalking to tick people off. It's not insults, but other things that work even better.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see, but I wasn't exactly referring to that but what that lead to, which was that back and forth between them with cheesy dialogue (imo) and especially the inner monologues and/or flashbacks, like how he was the king and he did shit but he needs to change and what not, he's not the same he used to be, and then Hinata's flashbacks, he's no longer the same, he might not be tall but he can do it with support of the king, etc, etc....oh and the white haired dude couldn't miss on that emotion shit and drama about how he's jelly of the king's abilities and that he wasn't born with talent and what not.

Overall I just think they did a lot of stuff like that which I found unecessary and annoying.

Breaking news: people are shorter than Hinata

"Make sure you call him senpai when you first meet him"

Welp

Gonna guess that tanaka will get jealous
>> ARTICLE
tanaka-*senpai* is probably the best comic relief tbh
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka + Hinata is the ultimate duo. Whenever Hinata mimics him I crack up every time hahaha.
>> ARTICLE
seriously, Hinata is such a cutie though aw.
>> ARTICLE
That [stare](http://i.imgur.com/YzWTv6O.jpg) before spiking the ball was amazing, especially since he usually closes his eyes.

Hinata said, "sit the fuck down."
>> ARTICLE
Did they change that from the manga? I swear he never opens his eyes during a quick.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed too. I was surprised that he had his eyes open. Also in Episode 12 against Nekoma, he opens his eyes and everyone shits themselves, but when he did it here against Seijoh no one even cared. 
>> ARTICLE
i didnt even finish the episode yet but i already watched that sequence at-least 4 times now and i wanted to come here and comment on it because GOD DAYYYYUM
>> ARTICLE
I reapeat that scene too, the way they made him dash WHILE the other guy was talking caught me off guard!
>> ARTICLE
Sit Down!

Come oooooon

I really love the ost

It's fucking amazing!

should check out spyair, they're really good

[Seriously guys, dont downvote the guy who actually knows what he's talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDIUyyQqQ_M)

This show and Samurai Flamenco has made me realize I need more spyair in my life. 

The ending incidentally is done by Nico Touches the Wall, who despite being pretty good and having done an OP for FMA:B, have only done songs for 4 shows including this one.

Oh... OH WOW I didn't not connect this band to the one that did Samumenco.

This was the highlight of this ep for me, looked really nice:

[gfycat mirror](http://www.gfycat.com/GoodnaturedTidyAcornweevil)
>> ARTICLE
It was less refined than Hinata's spike in episode one. I'd love it if they could use that style more often.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, when he heard that was where Kageyama got his serve from we knew it would be amazing and they made sure the animation lived up to it
>> ARTICLE
S-senpai is shorter than me!
>> ARTICLE
My little senpai can't be this cute!
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love those Tanaka expressions
>> ARTICLE
New guy looks beast as fuck. And he's shorter than ranga-kun, goddamn.
>> ARTICLE
The animation in this show is so consistently impressive. Oikawa's serve was just beautiful, and you can really tell how it's something Kageyama tries to emulate. 
>> ARTICLE
That OP gets me every time, it's a masterpiece!
>> ARTICLE
This is still the best anime of the season for me by far
>> ARTICLE
If there was no JoJo, this and NGNL would me my favs this season... but JoJo man...
>> ARTICLE
Idk man...NGNL is a huge contender. Even though I love this manga to death and this adaptation being amazing NGNL is still in the back of my mind.
>> ARTICLE
NGNL is good. No doubt about it. But this does things that nothing else this season does.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's this season being so dry, and this one being so good.
>> ARTICLE
Chaika?
>> ARTICLE
Yes Chaika!
>> ARTICLE
Chaika.
>> ARTICLE
Chaika!!
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought this was a pretty solid season. I mean, nothing super great, but a lot of pretty solid shows. Though I think its hard to top last season, or whatever Season had Magi rolling in it.
>> ARTICLE
Dry season with Ping Pong, Sidonia, Isshukan, and Nanana?
>> ARTICLE
don't forget ngnl and jojo
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong's animation turned me off to it. I watched the live action movie from years ago and loved it. I should probably try the second episode and see what I'm missing out on. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is really, really good. I seriously recommend it. It's on track to becoming one of my favourite sports anime!
>> ARTICLE
I`m guessing you mean the art? Yeah that takes a little getting used to. I was the same way with Kill La Kill last season. You should definitely get back to it and at least use the 3 episode rule. Even if I`m watching something like Daimidaler, I at least give it three episodes. I try to apply the concept of maybe dropping a show that could end up being the next Steins;Gate or Madoka. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope you watched ep4 of daimidaler, because that was something else
>> ARTICLE
same here! First sports anime i've picked up and only one besides NGNL that i watch asap each week.
>> ARTICLE
There's more shows than you would think in the genre that are legitimately great.
>> ARTICLE
[...cough...](http://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo)
>> ARTICLE
You should watch Kuroko no Basket
>> ARTICLE
i think i might have to, already took up Diamond and YosPedal as well. 
>> ARTICLE
You should totally watch it! The animation for the 2nd season is amazing~
>> ARTICLE
I've been liking baby steps quite a bit as well. YosPedal and Haikyuu!! are still the best though.
>> ARTICLE
It was the first sports anime I've seen. Went into it with very low expectations and was blown away. I don't even like sports IRL. Haikyuu and Yowa Pedal are the only other ones that have done it for me, and KnB is my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
well i'm sure glad tomorrow is a holiday, because i don't think i'll be sleeping tonight. 
>> ARTICLE
Might as well watch everything then -- add Baby Steps and that'll be all the sports shows for the season.
>> ARTICLE
SO BELIEEEEEVE IN YOURSELF~
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong too god tier to be considered as mere sports show?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, not sure why I forgot about it -- I guess because it's not really about the sports in Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they have very smooth animation even in the comedy parts, and it's really starting to get going now that we're getting glimpses of the monster duo. The rest of the team is looking strong too though, can't wait for their improvement and training to show. Karasuno fighting ~ 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see the new coach in action!
>> ARTICLE
The chemistry between Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka is great. Their interactions remind me of Ippo, Takmura, Aoki and Kimura.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until the libero finally gets speaking time. He's just as awesome as the rest of them, haha.
>> ARTICLE
So far Haikyuu!! and No Game No Life are last anime standing for this season for me. The animation, music and characters are all too good. The comedy hits me the most! HAHA call me Tanaka-Senpai! HAHA
>> ARTICLE
yoo-hoo~
>> ARTICLE
remember kids, it is REMOVED SAVED FOR NEXT WEEK? not sure if I should have kept the position there

I felt like they introduced him pretty quick compared to the manga, but I can see then wanting to get to the important stuff earlier. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually they haven't skipped anything so far in this adaptation. It's pretty amazing. They're just churning through these chapters, this one ending at 16.
>> ARTICLE
Mmmmmm Can you taste that, it taste like sweet victory :D Hinata in that last spike were amazing :O I knew this show would be good, but holy potato this is golden !!! I just want more :D
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode.

Aobajohsai's captain Dai-Ou Oikawa. 
Woah, his beasty serve.

Karasuno won. 

Libero Nishinoya, finally!

Next ep.: Karasuno's ace appears.
>> ARTICLE
i've never been a fan of sports anime

but this is one that i look forward to watching EVERY SINGLE WEEK
>> ARTICLE
If you think this is that good, you should try Kuroko no Basket. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they're both from SJ, and they're both animated by Production IG. Though Haikyuu is much more realistic with the skill sets that these main characters have. KnB is a little radical in that sense, especially with the Generation of Miracles.
>> ARTICLE
That stare down with the last spike was intense, god damn I love this show. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is really something special.  There are so many monstrously good shows this season it really surprised me that this little sports anime has been able to hold its own.

The show just exudes a type of quiet confidence in itself. It knows exactly what it is and plays to its strengths.  It also doesn't hurt that the production value is out of this world.
>> ARTICLE
I was really wondering how they were going to improve without a coach at first.  

I don't think I've ever seen a sports show *not* have one before.

Manager-chan should get some more lines.
>> ARTICLE
That was a awsome game!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
oh man, that fuyukai desu
>> ARTICLE
I dislike how similiar the character designs are but everything else is pretty much A-ok atm. Great episode, wondering who the receiver guy is going to replace on the main team. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally caught up! Never before have I fell in love with a series this fast. I've actually lost track how many times I've rewatched the first 19 episodes this past week because I couldn't handle the wait for this episode. Great art and animation, amazing music(the one with brass is Oikawa's theme, right?), likable characters(even Tsukishima! I wouldn't mind getting trashed-talked by this guy.. probably helps that he has glasses and the VA also voiced Natsuki from Tsuritama and Hiro from Barakamon..), tons of laughs, and lots of holy-shit-that-was-fucking-awesome moments and damnit-show-what-are-you-doing-with-my-feels moments. There's also no shounen villain character(I'm looking at you with disgust and contempt, Midousuji), and the Karasuno-Nekoma friendly rivalry is just beautiful. And there's the little details that really elevates the show, like that moment where Coach Ukai mentioned Asahi being the ace or something, then Asahi wrinkled his nose, and *then* Nishinoya glanced at him, or when Daichi and Michimiya were talking and they were blocking the door to the classroom and a student(Kiyoko?) excused herself to pass through. They were pretty inconsequential, and most probably wouldn't have bothered animating it, but the little things really help make the world seem alive.

Also, I think this series really handles their match cliffhangers well. Instead of stopping right before the awesome thing happening, they end with the awesome thing. Like Asahi breaking through the blockers in the Neigborhood Association practice match, or Hinata's first spike in the Tokonami match, or Asahi doing the pipe for the first time in the Dateko match, or Kageyama copying Oikawa doing that setter dump. Well, at the very least it's tons better than YowaPeda's cliffhangers(yes I'm complaing about YowaPeda again, sorry).

I'm also a sucker for the way they use motifs, like the one with Kageyama with the flashing red cape, or Nekoma watching and analyzing Karasuno like a cat(with cat eye's in the background and the scene lit that made the player eyes prominent), or the flapping of the crow's wings synchronizing with Hinata's jump in ep15,  or the opening of the Iron Wall with Asahi's winning spike against Dateko.

EDIT: Just watched the episode because region restrictions and whatnot. Anyway.

Wooooo Sugawara's playing! The expression on his face was awesome. Very resolute. Poor Kageyama though, he's panicking. I'd imagine Sugawara's playstyle is somewhat similar to Oikawa, with the knowing which sets are good for each spiker thing. It'd be interesting to see for sure! Well, here goes waiting one more week..
>> ARTICLE
Same here, i really liked the series so i could not wait for the next episode and so i ended up watching [Kuroko no Basket](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket/) i really like it i say more then haikyuu but maybe that because i grow up watching, going to basketball games, and playing it to.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I wasn't expecting an episode that felt "dark" but finally we get to see what Karasuno are like when they are deflated. I expected Sugi getting subbed in, was a sharp way to end the episode
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love Oikawa, finally an opponent in sports who isn't difficult because they're a 'genius' but just because they work extra hard and are 100% a team player. Quite refreshing.

I love Sugawara and I'm glad he finally has his chance to shine :D
>> ARTICLE
He's just so good. The mental struggles in this anime almost surpasses the physical limitations. This is a *sports* anime for crying out loud and the character development is just too good. such details, many wow.
>> ARTICLE
if theres a second season, its only going to get better
>> ARTICLE
The sports anime genre has some of the best character development, camaraderie and genuine struggles out there. It's just a matter of picking the right shows.

We're lucky that we have three really solid sports series airing right now (we even had four when Ping Pong was airing!)
>> ARTICLE
I actually audibly said "yeah bitch" when Sugawara was coming in. Kageyama was going hardcore edgy middle schooler and bringing in Sugawara was the best thing to do. Though it looks like he's only getting an episode to set because in the preview it shows Kageyama coming back in. Oh well, but I think it's the best thing to do. Plus I'm getting mad hype. Also, [slaps] (http://imgur.com/80UOOgs) make you better at [sports] (http://imgur.com/EmzChWn). Plus possible [best Hinata face?] (http://imgur.com/LuuQe0T)
>> ARTICLE
I missed that face when I was watching the episode, but it looks like Hinata's been spending too much time with Tanaka-senpai.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so I forgot the name of the guy who's learning the float serve, but I'd love to see it in play this match or the next. He's just being slightly irrelevant now, and I feel like he's feeling the same way, like people his year are outclassing him.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi. And i was hoping Ukai would put him in as a pinch server during the Dateko match. Although it wouldnt make much of a difference if they put him in during the Seijoh match because theyre all around good players.
>> ARTICLE
LMAO at Hinatas [face](http://i.imgur.com/Vf91iPe.png) XD And finally we have Sugawara on the court :D
>> ARTICLE
This should be a Twitch emote.
>> ARTICLE
It's like Germany vs. Argentina, efficiency vs. talent.
>> ARTICLE
I know its 4 month later and stuff, but Argentina was way more efficient, they made it to the final with just the 7th most goals... 
>> ARTICLE
As soon as I saw Kageyama starting to break down mentally, I knew Sugawara was going to come in. I'm pretty sure Sugawara and Asahi are going to do amazing things next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted the coach to pull Kageyama after that failed dump or after that first accelerated serve to Asahi. He forgot he's part of a team. Pull him until he gets his head on straight.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kind of excited to see Sugawara in play now, he seems surprisingly confident. 

Edit: little things like how Hinata can go from [this](http://imgur.com/rgRBdeP) to [this](http://imgur.com/p4LqvUd) in a split second make me enjoy this show that much more.
>> ARTICLE
I think he has conflinting emotions about wanting to play and replacing Kageyama when he's down
>> ARTICLE
Good episode. I was pretty tense! It's tough to watch Kageyama struggle like that. I imagine he'll be back in shortly though. In the meantime, we'll get a little Suga play, while Kageyama regains his composure. 

The show also does likable villains very well. 
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka-senpai best girl
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka-senpai is a treasure and an insipiration (and I'm very happy he got to shine a little in today's episode!)

And I also have to mention how much I liked the title of the episode, "Oikawa Toru is not a Genius". It has a certain ring to it.

>> ARTICLE
It pains me I have to wait a week to see Suga on the court. Also Tanaka is an inspiration.

Kageyama started using "I" instead of "we" and that's when I started getting worried. I'm guessing that next episode Hinata will say something refreshing and innocent to him about needing to be a team player and he'll snap out of his funk. I hope. o_o
>> ARTICLE
Based on the preview for the next episode it won't take long for Kageyama to break out of his funk.
>> ARTICLE
Sugawara! I am so happy he is going to play.
>> ARTICLE
A tiny part of me wishes that I had waited for the whole show to air so that I could just marathon it, but honestly I don't think I'd be able to wait. This episode was great and I loved the comment about it being hard to change his ways after only two months. I mean sure his friendship skills have improved, but it's not surprising that he would revert to his old ways under pressure.

I'm super hyped for nex episode, because I want to see how the team functions without its demon duo (I hope it's excellent). I mean the one thing that the previous setter has over kageyama is a stronger connection with his team which is also what the great king is currently beating him on as well. I'm super pumped to see where this goes.

(Also I loved "Baldie" this episode because he was just not taking any of the opposing teams shit. Loved it.)
>> ARTICLE
> I'm super hyped for nex episode

This is me every week ._.

Man I really hope this show gets licensed. This is the most fun I've had watching a show in a very long time.
>> ARTICLE
Me too! I'm positive my sister would love it, but I'm having a hard time getting her to watch it because subs. 
>> ARTICLE
it sucks that sports anime tends not to get licensed. Where is Kuroko, Free or Hajime no Ippo localisation? 

What really confuses me is that sports anime seem really popular in the west too, any con i've been to is overflowing with Kuroko and Free merch
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad more people are getting into this anime now. I've honestly been telling everyone I know that watches anime that they need to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Ep17 is the first time I can truly call this series as awesome after a fantastic ep1. Face it, ep2~16 aren't really all that amazing compare to those episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I usually stay away from sports anime/books that revolve around sports - they just don't interest me, especially when they get all technical and I can't follow them.
Having said that, there's so much more to Haikyu than just the sport of volleyball or even the team spirit trope that usually accompanies a sports anime. I love the characters - even the minor characters are depicted beautifully, something I *really* didn't expect out of a sports anime. The world is developed realistically, and its both funny and dark at times.

Now I wish I hadn't got to know of it till some months later. I just watched all 20 episodes yesterday in one sitting and going mad with waiting for ep 21. Especially because it was such a cliffhanger.

I guess Ukai switched Suga and Kageyama because he wanted to talk to Kageyama and had already used his two time-outs (I was guessing he'd do something like that) and Kageyama is quite visibly panicking. Still, it'll be interesting to see Sugawara finally play - the previews show Kageyama will be coming back, but I think Suga is a better match against Oikawa. Well, it'll be interesting to see Kageyama overcome his fear of losing. He's made progress throughout the series, and this may just be the final push he needs.
>> ARTICLE
The best sports series for the most part are the ones that take the time to develop their characters, their history and their relationships with each other. Which isn't to say that pure sports series aren't bad, there are some real gems out there that are just games/matches but the best of them do right by their characters.

Try Ping Pong The Animation (anime)  
H2 (Manga)  
Cross Game (anime)  
Baby Steps (manga)  
Slam Dunk (manga)  
Hajime no Ippo (anime)  

if you're looking some more quality sports series.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with that. Its hard for a series to maintain my attention if the characters aren't well-developed, no matter how interesting the premise might be. 

Thank you for the rec list :) I've actually started actively searching out sports anime and was watching Baby Steps today (though so far I'm only 3 episodes in). Since our criteria for choosing anime seem to coincide, may I ask you if you thought *Kuroko no Basuke*, *Ace of Diamond* and/or *Oikoku Furikabatte* were any good? I've watched the first episode of all three, and so far I'm not as impressed as I was with, say, *Haikyuu!!* with any of them (which is alright with me since *Haikyuu!* is one of the very few anime that have dazzled me from the very first episode), though they have their merits. As such I was looking to get a second opinion on them before I decide to either pick or drop them. That, and I can't seem to find a review site that matches my criteria. Sorry if I sound bothersome :(
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko's Basketball is a great series. It has a more fantastical bent than Haikuuu! But it's pacing is damn near flawless. There are two complete seasons currently out, and from what I can tell the manga is about to wrap up which is likely one more season. It's done by the same animation company that does Haikyuu and is of the same quality.

Ace of Diamond is another good series, but it starts with a very slow burn, so as you're aware. I would recommend across Game over it and then come back when the series is done.

The third I'm not familiar with so I can't help you there, sorry.

The Baby Steps anime suffers from a low budget, but the story is first rate. It's almost finished so you should probably watch that and then tag over to the manga.

The quality took a dive this episode. Maybe running out of time. The last few episodes will probably bring us back to the high quality of animation that the show's had for most of its run.
>> ARTICLE
The numbers mason, what do they mean!?

what's going to happen next episode? is kageyama gonna get replaced, oh ma gurd.

Alright, a bit of a Tsukishima focus! Kageyama trying to be nice is so hilarious ahahaha

Also Iwa-chan is super cool.

kageyama thanking tsuki was so hilarious.. nuff.. knife.... nice!

The point when Kageyama pulled Tsuki's shirt. Omg.

Why isn't this a 50 episode+ series ; (
>> ARTICLE
Just watch kuroko's basketball while you wait :)
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm doing, lol. It doesn't feel the same as Haikyuu (I actually enjoy the fact that Haikyuu is fairly realistic), but still enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The anime has sold very well so far, volume 2 was just released and sold over 10,000 copies, and the anime boosted the manga sales significantly. Merchandise seems to be popular as well. Production I.G. has produced multiple seasons of Kuroko's Basketball in the past proving they're willing to make sequels for popular sports anime based on Shonen Jump properties. All signs are pointing towards more Haikyuu!! in the future, though we may have to wait until I.G. finishes up Kuroko next year.
>> ARTICLE
Do not despair! The manga is well loved so the chances of a season two are high! :D (And there's enough content too) 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! ...? Yeah! ...? - He's asking for a high five, you idiot! YEAH!

Only 3 episodes left? NOOOOOOOO PLEASE. GIVE US A SECOND SEASON.

It's very likely that we will get a second season.

As soon as possible please.

Awkward Kageyama is the best Kageyama.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at the first half of an episode, and then nearly pissed myself with excitement in the second half. Hats off, pants off, everything off to you Haikyuu. Simply amazing show.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukishima's face[ here](http://i.4cdn.org/a/1409481565477.png) made me burst out laughing. He's the least expressive of the team so it's nice to see him getting a share of the comical animation :D
>> ARTICLE
He looks like Cartman
>> ARTICLE
I said it before and I'll say it again. The anime needs a second fucking season. The manga has gotten far enough for it.
>> ARTICLE
Love how Nishinoya-senpai respected Oikawa's serve.
>> ARTICLE
The reactions to Kageyama being complimentary were funny. Chemistry between the characters is the best aspect of this show.

That Oikawa flashback was awkwardly inserted. Probably would've worked if done in between sets or during a timeout.
>> ARTICLE
Loved it. BUt BUT i wanted more time with the perfect decoy :( The decent king will arrive at last>!?!?!?!?1
>> ARTICLE
So, Crunchyroll's Haikyuu team has consistently translated "naisu kii" () as "nice kill." Today (Episode 22, 16:33), they decided it's going to be "nice key".

Of course, both make zero fucking sense. The "kii" is short for "kiipu", which is how "keep" is pronounced in Japanese. "Nice keep", as in "good job keeping the serve."

I wonder what their thought process was? "Nice kill doesn't really make much sense in the context of volleyball... Japanese people are weird." (20 episodes later) "Maybe it's actually not nice kill... maybe it's nice key?"

Unbelievable.

Edit: Just watched the ending. The toss to center would have been "better" (betaa, ), not "cliche" (beta, ). Why would anyone describe a volleyball play as cliche? But yeah, despite the toss to center being the better play (probably because it's strictly faster and has more freedom to aim at the whole court), Kageyama realized Oikawa would fall back to someone he trusts more (Iwaizumi) rather than the safer, better play.

Edit2: I stand corrected. Kill is actually a thing. Excuse me while I hang my head in shame.

>> ARTICLE
 means cliche? I've never heard that before, interesting. Also just thought I'd say, if you have enough grasp on Japanese, you can actually turn off the subtitles on Crunchyroll. Just right-click the video player, and then "no subtitles".
>> ARTICLE
Erm, whoops, katakana. But yeah, for example,  can be used to describe an overdone plot, or "a cliche story."

Yeah, I keep the subtitles on for those lines I would miss the first time. It really does help with having a smoother experience. 

Also, note that I'm wrong on the "Kill" part. It's actually used in Volleyball, it seems. 
>> ARTICLE
I kept on making excuses and kept the subtitles on, but I've found that every time I looked at them, I forgot to stop. So good on you if you can avoid that, for me it's pretty much all or nothing when it comes to using subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
Kill actually does make sense in volleyball, it's what scored spikes are called. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I have a lot to learn, it seems.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, no problem. You're right that key doesn't make sense (at least as far as I know), and you're right that the translation has been iffy

Man, this was the fastest episode yet. I need moooore

Haikyuu!! Why you so good? I can't even right now. I just... Too good. Everything too good.

On a related note, feel free to come discuss it over at [r/haikyuu](http://www.reddit.com/r/haikyuu)

the next episode is hands down one of my favorite set of chapters in the manga
>> ARTICLE
That was a decent ep imo. The next ep should be prob the end of this match.. I expect a really good episode next :D
>> ARTICLE
Are they going to be able to finish the tournament in time? It's just this match and then Nekoma right? I suppose half of the next episode for Seijoh, half for Nekoma, and 2 more for Nekoma should do right?

Oh man, 3 episodes left means were gonna get some massive feels for the ending

I honestly though i would hate Haikyuu!! but i am 22 episodes and eagerly await each week for the next.

The only thing I dislike about this sport anime is that they have plot armor to win until they reach nationals

This is obviously a spoiler but if you're interested in a manga/anime where this doesn't happen check out [MM! Ep. 10](/s "Diamond no Ace")
>> ARTICLE
You can't even say that about this show. Every sports show, hell every show has some sort of plot armor to help the MC succeed in some way.

Karasono hasn't just won easily. Just these last few episodes they won a set by a point or 2. Before that they were losing practice matches. Instead of saying plot armor is helping them, I'd argue that legit teamwork and rapid maturity is what's helping them win. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...[Somewhat spoiler](/s "If thats your only problem, you'll love it  sooner or later")

>> ARTICLE
[prediction but ill spolier it just in case] (/s "they lose this match, dont they?, i have had this feeling that they wont win this season since a few episodes ago")
>> ARTICLE
Man, why did they need to drag this match out again(kinda disapointed that they added a flashback in the middle of the point)... I doubt that this season will be enough to finish the whole tournament... Oh well... Until next week, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
in the manga this match goes on for almost 20 chapters 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... I've been trying to not spoil anything with the manga so I read up to where the episode finishes. When the season finishes I'll catch up with the manga.

[Me when Hinata hit Kageyama](http://charlyshades.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/laughing.gif)

Besides that, wanted to point out how noticeable it was that the character's faces show through the volleyball net in the scenes and that manager girl totally killed Hinata before the match, even I would be dying from the pressure after that.
>> ARTICLE
At one point I thought the guy's face went through the net and to the other side. It's really distracting and I have no idea why they do that.
>> ARTICLE
It's how it was done in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Probably so it's easier to see their facial expressions. It does end up looking really weird though.
>> ARTICLE
That might be the reason but it's retarded, see for yourself, [the lines are too thin to affect the faces at all and the possible expressions](http://i.imgur.com/m8v9Ntd.jpg), I think they made a bad call and that and should just stop doing it.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think it looks better with the net in the way.
>> ARTICLE
Of course it does, because that's how it should be and is IRL, it just looks weird and stand outs without adding anything good to the show or the scenes.

Is many of it anime original then? Six episodes for 13 chapters is an awful lot.

not really, about normal tbh, each chapter is ~20 pages so it feels right compared to others that are ~50

Really? Guess I don't have a feeling for that kind of thing then.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
best episode by far.
>> ARTICLE
I laughed the whole episode. It's good to see them having fun rather than take this practise match too seriously. I feel bad for Hinata though for constantly being bullied. I wish the manager gets more screen time. Best episode so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you mean about the manager, but I think she falls very heavily into the category of a character that doesn't really serve a purpose. Well I dunno about later but she hasn't really done anything so there hasn't been a need to give her any screen time.
>> ARTICLE
Agree, she probably won't.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she's a bad character, she isn't your typical female character which I think makes the show come off a lot better. I assume she will just hold some form of motivation within the team.
>> ARTICLE
She is pretty irrelevant in the manga too, except maybe one time. Not sure if they'll give her more screentime in this adaptation, hopefully they do!
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka is awesome, probably my favorite character from Haikyuu now.

His laugh when people call him senpai is hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
That next set's going to be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, i love this anime.

Amazing episode. That whole Tsukishima-Kageyama banter(if I can call it that heh) as well as Kageyama-Hinata scenes were the funniest stuff I watched all week.

Haikyuu, continue being amazing.

Great and fun ep. 

Practice match vs Aobajousai. 

Hinata screwing up. He even bumped into the referee seat XD

That headserve XD That must have hurt.

Captain Oikawa.

When Kageyama was walking up to Hinata after he served into the back of his head, he should've just kissed him there. I'm not sure how much longer Kageyama is going to be able to hide is love for Hinata

That smile from Hinata gave me the chills
http://i.imgur.com/ZeCK24W.jpg
Such a fun episode.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of the most unintentionally disturbing/hilarious things I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious if it was unintentional. The other characters reaction was supposed to be "WTF?" since everyone expected him to be down and upset, so it did a good job of making the viewer see Hinata as a crazy person because he was making such an unexpected face.

Or they just made the eye and smile ratio weird and made Hinata look like an axe murderer.
>> ARTICLE
It's totally intentional, Hinata tends to scare people when he gets serious/excited

It's how it was done in the manga as well [intentional](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/144325/haikyuu_ch30_by_casanova/11) I'm prety sure.

A someone who trains volleyball i am loving this anime so much i like the story and the characters and it just keeps getting better from one episode to the other

It makes it that much more enjoyable since I can tell whoever made this knows what they are talking about.

So far it's been only skills that's pretty realistic unlike other sports anime where it goes completely off the walls. Looking at you Kuroko.

What do you mean? Being able to infallibly make shots from physically impossibly angles is a totally legit strategy. Obviously you are just jealous that you weren't part of a middle school team with a group of kids that as soon as they were of high school age were feared throughout Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps I did let the jealousy get the better of me. I lost a basketball tournament with my team when this insane Japanese kid came out of nowhere and was able to shoot it full court as soon as he got the ball on his side. I had bad flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I think I heard about that. Was there an American with a hangtime of 12 seconds + commercial break + flashback to when he was learning from his ex-WNBA playing coach who has real bad enrish?

Those eyes man. THOSE EYES. It's like he goes super saiyan when those eyes are activated.

If Hinata keeps those crazy eyes up he will definitely be the one that is feared most by the other team.

I'm really fucking curious, can we have a prequel for the Little Giant guy?

I've always loved that "People search for a way to fly" line. I kept thinking of it whenever I watched Ping Pong :P

Man, I really want to know who this Little Giant is. They keep referring to him very vaguely. 
>> ARTICLE
Hinata really reminds me of gon from Hunter x Hunter for some weird reason.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it's that natural instinctive personality trait both characters have. Both characters instinctively know that they are strong or can become really strong if they train, but unlike most characters they don't show it in a 'cocky' kind of way. Also, they are both pretty gullible and easily swayed.
>> ARTICLE
it's the eyes too
>> ARTICLE
This show gives the best feels. 
>> ARTICLE
At this pace I feel like this series should be 6 cour or something. Hopefully this is a sign that it's going to start really picking up.
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it now. In the final episode of this anime, for the last point they score. It's going to be the classic toss to Hinata with the blind hit. Simply because he's starting to move away from it and get better, what better way to end it than how it started.
>> ARTICLE
This is a seriously well balanced sports anime, this episode did well to portray the manga. Gods Hinata's attitude pumps me up. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll need a season 2 after the 25 episodes from this season
>> ARTICLE
I'm not that well versed in volleyball but is Hinata's curved spike something  volleyball players use in real life?

This is probably the only anime this season that I can't wait for the next episode after watching each episode!

>> ARTICLE
Definitely! Rather than a curved spike they're just changing the angle in which they're hitting the ball, don't know if there's an actual name for this move :/
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if one season is good enough. Kuroko's Basketball isn't as near as good as Haikyuu!!

I loved the few lines the [Neighborhood Association](http://i.imgur.com/bQxiK5n.jpg) got. Oh, Kageyama and Nishinoya.

Also, don't forget to watch the credits for a short clip!

Ohh [Tanaka-senpai](http://i.imgur.com/xEpCKUZ.jpg) You can always make me laugh :D

I can't wait to see the training camp. And hopefully Suga and Hinata can learn to play together as well :D Although that would make Kageyama less of a genius.

Totally, I usually avoid sports anime like the plague, but Yowa Pedal had me more open to it this season and I ended up super into Haikyuu!! I never expected I'd be going 'Awww!' as often to to this as I do to Ishuukan Friends.

>> ARTICLE
I don't know much about volleyball but can they do rotations during a game? Let's say that Hinata and Kageyama is worn out, couldn't Suga step in? Also with the Ace being in the starting line up, I guess Tanaka-senpai is out, but if Hinata is gone, I guess Tanaka-senpai could step in.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well yes, but Hinata will probably get tired out. He can't become the decoy for the whole entirety of the game without tiring himself out. What happens when Kageyama gets a bit tired and his serves is a little off point and hit Hinata in the face instead of his palm? That's when you put in Suga and Tanaka-senpai. They aren't completely useless and they only lost against that Iron-Wall team. Their attack is fine and Tanaka has been practicing a bunch lately. Even if it's for a little while, it's okay, you don't have to win every point.
>> ARTICLE
Well these are all the things that Ukai has to consider. That's why he was saying it's really hard to be the one picking players because all of them are so good
>> ARTICLE
This is my prediction for starting line-up from what I've seen in the anime:

Setter: Kageyama / Middles: Hinata and Tsukishima / Powers(Right Side): Tanaka and Asahi / Offside: Daichi / Libero: Nishinoya

Does anyone know if Daichi actually hits offside? I'm just assuming at this point. And I feel like Kageyama is the obvious choice for setter just because at this point Suga hasn't been shown to have any special talents, aside from synergy with Asahi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was also thinking about that. I'm predicting that Suga will eventually have to set to Hinata at one point in future episodes. 

Hinata is also relying a lot on Kageyama's perfect sets, so I feel like he'll have to learn to be versatile with the sets that he's given.
>> ARTICLE
The thing with Suga is that he has synergy with other players, so when Kageyama isn't playing I'd assume that neither will Hinata. Thats when they sub him out, don't know how would it be if Kageyama is injured 
>> ARTICLE
It's also possible that hinata will still work as a decoy since the other team might still mark him if he scored while Kageyama was setting 
>> ARTICLE
It's shows like this that make me wish more people watched sports anime. It's just so fun to watch and I want everyone to feel this joy 
>> ARTICLE
Which is a shame because a lot of people won't give a sports anime a try just because it is sports. Sports is now one of my favorite anime genres and the feeling I get watching them are just amazing. ^(would like to mention that Bakuman gives me the same feeling as sports anime do so if you have not watched  it then give it a try).
>> ARTICLE
I don't really have anything special to input. I just really love this show and it makes me sad that I have to wait another week before I can watch the new episode.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. Haikyuu is currently the show that I am most eager to watch.

Have more than 1 show in a week! it breaks it up, i have GoT tommorow, and wednesday i will have Yes, Chaika, and Hunter x Hunter.

Hunter x hunter is on Tuesdays(I guess depending on where you live) and yeah having at-least 1 show a day for 4 or so days a week is a good way make time fly for next week.

Awwww... the bromance :3

Hinata and Kageyama really are an amazing combo!

Yep..... Hinata got KO-ed lol. That ball to the face!

Hinata had doubts but that was all resolved.

I love Asahi's advice to Hinata. Daichi and Asahi are such bros.

Nekoma at the end of the credits!

**LOL at the preview:**

Noya: Under the same roof with Kiyoko-san... Ryuuu.

Tanaka: Noya-san.

Noya: Ryuuuu.

Tanaka: Noyaaaa-saaaan.

Hinata: Wh-what's going on?

Kiyoko: Just ignore them.

25 or 26 i believe

Oh good! I'm glad it's not just a twelver

And If we're lucky they'll make a season 2 like with KnB. I haven't read the manga so I dont know how much material there is but from what i've gathered there a re 100+ chapters
>> ARTICLE
That first year that was running the scores, can't remember his name, is getting the shortest straw every time lol.

Will he ever get any time to shine?
>> ARTICLE
Is he that interested in Volleyball? So far in the series it seems that he only joined the club to be with Tsukki who is his friend. 


>> ARTICLE
He kinda does just stick around Tsukki but there's been some hints that he'll get his time to shine soon in the manga for quite some time.
>> ARTICLE
He seemed really interested in that float serve thing.  Maybe he learns that?
>> ARTICLE
This was a pretty chill and fun episode, I died when Hinata got nailed in the face tho
>> ARTICLE
Their reactions had me in stitches.
>> ARTICLE
omg this show has almost as good expressions as nisekoi
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know exactly what are the managers role, and if they help the volley club exclusively? Because I find it strange for a school club to have people who only take care of the paper work and score managing, without ever playing. I mean, they aren't being paid for these activities, is it that common for clubs to have such people? The anime didn't focus their job in any way, I think.

Edit: grammar.
>> ARTICLE
paid*
>> ARTICLE
I remember back in highschool I was friends with quiet a few managers for different sports clubs. It's almost always the case that they're the opposite sex of the club and just enjoy the sport and want to be part of it. 

For my football team she just kept score during practice, grabbed us water, helped tape up people and just came with us to our games. She was just a super nice person and just genuinely liked football. 

For the wrestling team I had a different friend who was their manager and she didn't really care about the sport all that much at first but was best friends with one of the players and just kinda decided to be the manager one day because she quit her other club.

And then I had a friend who was the manager for the girls volleyball team and he did that because 1.) he liked volleyball, and 2.) the girls on the volleyball team were hot and I totally wish I was the girls volleyball team manager after hearing some of his stories.


>> ARTICLE
I imagine what are the anime's manager reason then. She looks like a serious person, and there was a scene which she threw the ball and succeeded to hit the empty bottle ( a "back from the commercials" scene), thus she is good at the sport. So maybe she just enjoys it and Karasuno has no girls' volley team? As your friend's case.

Obvious obligatory question: could you please share some of those stories you talked about? :3
>> ARTICLE
Well my friend would go into detail about what kind of spandex they wore while practicing and how he would help with their stretches. All of his stories were pretty much about the girls themselves and not much about the actual sport lol.

But you do make a good point, If she's decent at the sport why doesn't she just play on the girls volleyball team? Girls volleyball is way more popular than guys so I doubt the school doesn't have its own team. Maybe she's on the team for all that hot guy action

I believe Nishinoya was training with the girl's volleyball team when he was suspended.

Great episode! The interaction between hinata and kageyama was really well done!

I wonder what the use of Kiyoko is so far. I wonder if she would become Momoi-chan like in Kuroko, or something. So far, the work she does hasn't really been anything stand out, so maybe she's  scouter or something. I believe this anime is too good to put a girl in the team for the sake of a girl in the team.
>> ARTICLE
In the Manga, Kiyoko doesn't really have an important. She is really just a side character which hangs around as a manager.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, sad.
>> ARTICLE
She still does some stuff on the manga, nothing like Momoi from KnB does for her team tho
>> ARTICLE
This anime is brilliant, after recently watching Kuroko no basket I was pretty open towards sports themed animes. This episode almost had me grinning throughout the whole time I was watching!

just watched all of this series today. really enjoying it. reminds me a lot of kuroko no basket.

PHEWF. I thought it was only 12 episodes.

Just checked MAL, it's 25 episodes.

What chapter is it on now?

It currently has 108 chapters. This episode covered chapters 17-18. 


There's also a small bit on the last page of chap 18 that wasn't included in the anime, just in case you wanted to know :P) 
>> ARTICLE
Aha, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

Haikyuu!! is back with another strong, brilliant episode in which it succeeded to combine comedy, emotions, action, character development and story progression. Seriously, Haikyuu!! is well on its way to becoming the strongest sport show in the industry.

"It's the [ace](http://imgur.com/WwUyWmh) that [inspires](http://imgur.com/kJPHw3C) you." Right on the spot, and the damn perfect portrayal of those emotions is visually handled splendidly. From [episode](http://imgur.com/McvZR2e) [one](http://imgur.com/W6do6eZ) to [episode four](http://imgur.com/fq6hIUb) to [episode eight](http://imgur.com/sJBsjnf), Haikyuu has visually been a very, *very* solid and smart show.

*"Who cares if it is flashy or not. If your actions help the ace score, then it's just as important."  
"I know you want a technical coach, but what you're really after is the illustrious name of "Ukai", isn't it?"  
"If I played the match and we win, it would be proof we can do without Asahi-san. I don't like that."  
"I can no longer imagine spiking past the blocks in front of me"* in particular.

Production I.G. might be pulling out everything the show can offer, but Furudate Haruichi's writing is splendid as well, and the show wouldn't feel as engaging without that. It's what I've realized in many other sport shows, Kuroko no Basketball in particular. The screen is filled but  feels empty. 
Haikyuu!! doesn't have that. Its rich cast with characters that all have a role besides 'teammate' turn the show into something much better than an ordinary sport anime.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love Haikyuu for the reasons you gave, I feel Kuroko no Basketball does the same thing imo. Every person of their team has a role that they fill and push them towards victory. They make a big point to highlight that they all have their roles to fill and would fall apart without them all.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Kagami is their ace but they all play to their strengths. I suggest reading the manga for Kuroko because their current game is exactly that.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, Kuroko's teammates are there to support their ace duo. Something that is clearly shown in the first match versus the blonde guy's school.

I feel that with Haikyuu the team isn't going to rely on the Kageyama/Hinata combo as much. Yes, it's very strong but they have Sawamura as captain, "The Guardian God" and their former ace Asahi.

Maybe it's just how I perceive it, but Haikyuu has much better fleshed out characters (Kuroko literally had a guy who didn't say anything, how lazy can it get?) which in turn makes the show able to fill the screen with scenes that aren't matches.
>> ARTICLE
I came to this school... because of the girls' uniform!

They just had to throw in those feels right at the end didn't they? Loved the episode though, great introduction to the remaining members of the team and the story of getting them all back together

Asahi looks so damn cute like wowy! Nishinoya-senpai is so adorable telling Hinata that he's getting him 2 whole ice creams! I really love how Karasuno is coming along.

Can't get enough of this anime!

Nishinoya is such a great character!

Hey guys I just wanted to clear something up, this is the best anime of the season in case you didn't know. Yes NGNL is good and all, but this... This is what anime is all about.

NGNL isn't even anywhere near my favorite

Its all about Isshuukan Friends

Close call, but it's Ping Pong

The team is slowly coming together!! :D The guy who voices Nishinoya is also my favourite VA ^_^

the team is finally coming together. this anime adapts so well
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching this show. I've never watched a sports anime before (never really had an interest) but I took a look at this one when I found out it was about volleyball (I played travel in High School and currently college club, and there are never any good shows/movies about volleyball) I'm loving this series so far! I thought I might be a biased audience, but I'm happy to see it seems like a lot of people enjoy it. 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! is just your typical shounen sport anime..and i absolutely love every second of it.
>> ARTICLE
I hate these kinds of episodes when it's just buildup cuz I have to wait a whole week for the next ep but at the same time I love it cuz I get to hype up for next week
>> ARTICLE
Senpai notice me!

Kouhai noticed me!!!

2 new characters that are likely to join the team have appeared and both look interesting. Nishin has looked cool since I saw him in the ED, and made the Libero look badass. Asahi I'm hoping when he does play will look crazy badass if he is the Ace. Besides that two good characters, the teacher is just getting on my nerves since hes the kinda character that says, "Oh, I'm bad at everything, oh please cover for me." That stuff just personally gets on my nerves and it felt like hes been saying it too much over the past couple episodes.
>> ARTICLE
That was a nice and laid back team building episode.

I also like that the show rarely resorts to character stills with just moving mouths during dialogues. There's always little body language animation the makes the characters feel alive. 
>> ARTICLE
FAIRY TAIL ANIMATORS PLEASE TAKE NOTES!
>> ARTICLE
They definately have it down pat. 

Kuroko's Basketball was the same way, they're excellent at keeping things in motion rather than getting bogged down in the details.

And the comedy never feels too hammy.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata no Volley

Both shows really do have similarities in tone and characters.  The captain reminds me of Teppei and we have the female manager as well.  Granted, many sports shows share certain features, I think it's more pronounced here.  Should be interesting to see what kind of 'super' abilities the opponents have -- though I'm guessing that'll be a while from now.
>> ARTICLE
Serialized in the same magazine too.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's true that they have some similarities, but in terms of differences, they have ALOT. Like for instance, Haikyuu is way more realistic than Knb. And most of opponets from haikyuu don't have special abilities like Knb does.
>> ARTICLE
Aw, no one man super blocker whose wingspan can cover the entire net or a snake serve that twists around?

Honestly, I don't mind whatever it is -- I've been entertained by all manners of shows, whether that's realistic, in between, or prince of tennis levels.
>> ARTICLE
Riko is a coach not a manager. Not to nitpick or anything but that is a MAJOR difference. Momoi is a manager though and she's just as skilled, if not better depending on your opinion, so I guess that kinda disproves my point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's still a good point to make regardless of their skill sets -- it's easy to incorrectly assume the two like I implied.  Also, Shimizu* doesn't seem anywhere near as involved as Riko was -- at least so far.
>> ARTICLE
I hope she does become involved though. Something about her seems, for lack of a better word, "knowledgeable" about the sport.
>> ARTICLE
Same -- manager or coach, you always need some kind of outside perspective in order to improve the team that the players themselves can't see.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the cook from the restaurant they stopped at shows up in some capacity, given his prominence in the OP, probably as a coach since they've made a point of showing they don.'to have one.

It's just short of Ping Pong for me but both are great in their own ways

In both shows, all the match so far are about the players and their own inner demons. It's not about special abilities to one up opposition, but to get over their own mental hurdles.

Am I the only one that thinks all the character designs make them look like elves? They all have pointy ears, sharp faces and slanted eyes.

I can't get enough of this anime! Hinata and Kageyama working as a team is great. But its the humour that I loved in this episode, really shows the pressure that Hinata is putting on himself

Also, a shout out to that great little 60 seconds explaining the positions. I wish a lot more Sport anime had this.

Between this and Ping Pong, I can't make my mind up on anime of the season, tough call for me: The sport I love to play vs the anime giving me the best entertainment on a Sunday
>> ARTICLE
I loved how they explained the positions. I don't remember them explaining it like they did in the manga but it was great how they used the advisor who doesn't know much about volleyball to be the audience's character (someone that needs explaining in the anime so it's not just explained between other experienced players in the sport). It felt way more organic than the way they explain things in other anime, or TV shows for that matter.  
  
But anyways, they're missing one position! Nudge nudge hint hint :D Can't believe this anime is happening, one of my favorite sports manga ever.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love Hinata and his affinity for throwing up.

I decided to give it a shot, since I thought it might not be good, but I thought the same thing about Kuroko no Basket, but I ended up giving that a shot, so I gave this one a shot too.

and I love it, there's something about it that's so captivating and I enjoy watching both the struggles and the triumphs, and hell it's only 5 episodes so far

shimizu number one ;~;

please cut me off from internet access for a year so i can catch up to the manga/anime again
>> ARTICLE
Wow I can't believe they got Hiroshi Kamiya to be Takeda Sensei, this episode really shown how limited Kamiya's acting range is. 
>> ARTICLE
I was just talking to a friend about this but we came to the conclusion that although he doesn't fit sensei that well at least now they won't use Kamiya for any of the other players. 
>> ARTICLE
I was super surprised when I heard his voice come up - I knew it was incredibly familiar. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea, his voice range isn't that big and it basically goes from Levi to Izaya and everything in between. A lot of male seiyuus are kinda that way too. It's really the "acting" part in voice acting that sets them apart. Araragi and Izaya was greatly acted for example, lines delivered perfectly and their voices are entertaining. Which reminds me of Tom Cruise in a way. In every movie, he is Tom Cruise, be it Tom Cruise in space or Tom Cruise the lawyer or Tom Cruise as a father. It's Tom Cruise, but he's pretty good at acting.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I was totally not expecting any nerves of Hinata's to be this bad. Good episode though, I snickered aloud a few times.
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode was just great as usual, and I loved the way they did Hinata [freaking out.](http://imgur.com/a/HettL)

Haha, hilarious episode~

Hinata/Kageyama won.

Takeda's seiyuu is Kamiyaaaan~

Hinata with the manju was too cute XD
lol @ the reaction of the others.

He was so nervous that he used the jacket as pants.
He even wore Tanaka's pants instead XD

Some scenes were added. Hinata's sister :3

Best part was when Hinata threw up. Poor Tanaka LOL

Practice match against Aobajousai starts next ep. Can't wait.

I really love this show so far. The op is also great. Nice seeing Hinata and Kagayama working so well together. Definitely keeping this on my weekly anime to-watch list.

Nishinoya and Tanaka's celebration after he scored may have been my favorite one second this entire season. Though his scene with Tanaka's rival on Nekoma was pretty great. All the rivals scenes were really good. Despite this episode only being about half playtime, it may have been my favorite all season. Plus it did a really good job of giving pretty much all of Nekoma's team character. Can't wait for a rematch!
>> ARTICLE
Felt like a last episode, definitely could have been with that conclusion and everything, so happy it continues.  
One of my all time favourite anime.
>> ARTICLE
(Not just for this episode but for the whole series so far) So I play volleyball competitively, and surprisingly, the studio got most of the technique correct. I am quite impressed with that aspect so far. The weird part for me is what they call each aspect of the game, whether it be the positions, ball handling, or names of actions(I.e. What they call a Spiker is referred to as Outside Hitter for me, and what they call the toss, we call a set) Maybe the terms are based on the region or got mixed up in subbing. Still I'm very much enjoying this series so far :)
>> ARTICLE
We call it outside too but I've seen a lot of videos and coaches referring to them as wing spiker as well, it really just depends. The 'toss' is just lost in translation as I'm 100% sure everyone else calls them sets.

As for the technical part there's still many problems that I noticed, such as the lack of an opposite hitter, Kageyama facing the wrong way and that time the bishounen setter took the first touch on a freeball. But then again many sports anime don't follow the usual rules otherwise it'll be too boring.
>> ARTICLE
What bishounen setter are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
Very true. I was impressed with the fact that the studio got the approach to hit correct, the passing form correct, and the pancake/dive correct. I agree that they are required to make the show more interesting, which causes a few discrepancies between the show and real life.
>> ARTICLE
You guys have to remember it is in Japan and their are differences. When the hitters are calling for the ball you can hear them some times say "Ta-su" which is literally the Japanese version of the english word "Toss". Also, they play a 5-1 and when Kageyama is in the front row the third hitter is eliminated.

As for the setter taking the first touch on a freeball what is wrong with that? (other than not being advised).
 
I'm mostly asking questions because I think everything they've done has been spot on, especially the feeling behind matches or match points.
>> ARTICLE
A pipe for the opposite hitter is an extremely common set. 

Also there is just so many things wrong with the setter taking the first touch on a freeball. A team's offense always runs through their setter, he is the heart of the team and you can't just expect some hitter to come in and set. They're not going to be able to do quicks and instead just set it high to the outside/opposite because if a hitter sets you're taking away an attacking option and also the fact that they don't have the ability to do quick sets/pipes.
>> ARTICLE
Some times it is necessary for the setter to take the first ball, in which case the libero (for teams that I have played on at least) would become the setter for the play). The setter taking the first ball is unadvised but sometimes necessary, especially if his/her teammates do not react fast enough. And for most high level teams, most players can pass, set, and hit well enough to continue the play. Sometimes it is inevitable, and players that would normally hit might set, or setters might hit. It just seems to happen that way.

>> ARTICLE
we're talking about a freeball here

also I mentioned that if someone else comes in and set there's not going to be a quick attack (as far as I see no one does them without the setter), meaning that it'll be a high set and the hitter will face a three man block which is not want you want on offense
>> ARTICLE
True, setters should never take a free ball. For teams I have played on, quick sets have come from other players other than the setter, so it's not guaranteed to be a high set. I do see your point in that it is not common at all, in fact, as you probably know,  it would be very rare for this to occur, and I do agree that anyone who sets but the setter limits the offense's capability. Essentially, what I'm getting at is that it's possible, but quite rare.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they don't change these perfect OP and ED anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
It's sad but they'll probably change OP & ED next episode.
>> ARTICLE
It'll be hard to match something as awesome as Spyair and Nico Touches the Wall.

Although according to the myanimelist page, the new opening is to be sung by Sukima Switch who sang the [3rd OP of FMA:B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4muUuu8UtSo) among other things, and the ending is to be done by tacica who's only work I can find is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxMW3uifD04#t=17)

So to me at least, this episode was flawless. It was fast paced and the drama wasn't forced/lengthened. The comedy was on point and so were the character interactions. I loved how everyone had someone just like them on the rival team. They all behaved like real highschoolers and not like they were in a war zone (like some sports anime make it seem like). 

Honestly I just love this show so much. It's not artistic or though provoking but god damn it's fun and that's all I really want from my anime.

I love how this show takes away all the tension I may have built up. It takes away your thought from worries and manages to entertain really well. I am not a sports fan, but I can appreciate these series anyway. I'm glad I stumbled upon these series, big thanks goes to /r/anime! 
>> ARTICLE
Match was a good watch (Karasuno's loss seemed predictable part way through though). It did provide a good idea of the potential the team has together as a whole, since I"m hoping its not gonna be just random Hinata/Kageyama combos in the future. 

Besides the match, really enjoyed seeing both of the teams interact with each other after the match. Some bonded and others built tension. It was nice for me and felt like the better half of the episode since we got to see more character development from both sides. Volleyball is fun, but you're not gonna see two guys crying over their inability to communicate with the attractive female manager :P


>> ARTICLE
I think shoyo is gonna meet the little giant someday  :D
>> ARTICLE
Dude this show. This show has got feeling! something that is lacking in Baby Steps right now. My excitement level watching Haikyuu is so much higher than watching Baby Steps and I think it's cause this has much more feels.
>> ARTICLE
This show is great. The characters' personalities are a little over the top (at least compared to other sport animes, most of the time all characters are really serious dudes, here's closer to slice of life shows) but that makes me like this show even more.

I thoroughly enjoyed the awesome levels of sass in this episode. AW YISSSSSSSSSSSS

God the OST is great, subtle and emotional.

I love the attention they put for a small detail : [Hinata's face](http://i.imgur.com/boJdp4D.jpg), and Tanaka never changes

Great and hilarious episode.

Kenma, Kuroo and the other Nekoma members appear.

They added extra scenes, but it was awesome!

Loved imouto cameo. Loved Tanaka & Noya's revival. and the Asahi horror part XD

Karasuno vs Nekoma is next~
>> ARTICLE
The scenes they included really added to the benched subplot, I agree. Plus the addition of Asahi in the scary scene was hilarious! I like how they made it so serious in the beginning of that scene, it made it so much more funny. Can't wait for the next episode!

Liked this chill kinda episode, good story developement. Does that cat guy look forward to the match cuz he wants to see hinata play? And was Hintata getting blocked in the preview D:

I love this anime, its so chill to watch, compared to Kuroko No Basket from last season, this sports anime is a great change of pace, a lot more humor but still entertaining. No wonder its that last anime i kept watching along with NGNL.

the extras got character development! now that's going the extra mile on your story. hyped for neko vs karasuno match :>

Right!? How many animes give adequate screen time and VA to literal no-names that aren't even worthy of being called side characters?

Too good.

Good training episode. It shows how you get picked as a starter, allowing the senior to play in the last year or get benched when a junior outclasses you and that joining the club for fun/casually doesn't work that well.

Daichi-san's so tough-motherly it's hilarious. Everyone's so afraid of him, even Asahi.

i so want to watch slam dunk all over again because of this anime. soooo good!

I feel there's been too many practice episodes. Some good, some just okay but it does get a bit monotonous. I think a change of scenery and activity while maintaining the volleyball-centric story would be a good palette cleanser.

I liked that they did 4 days of training camp in one episode. Lots of character development and they kept it funny and quick.

I don't know... Wouldn't Ukai recognize him at least? He's not that much older, right?

Take-Chan's far too old to be the Little Giant, sadly. Despite how young he looks he's actually 29 (for reference Ukai is 26). It wouldn't surprise me if it ended up being his younger brother though.
>> ARTICLE
Next week's episode is gonna be soo good 
>> ARTICLE
Meh episode overall. Not much plot progression, and overall slow pace.

Not bad by any means, but not a great episode either. So far this show really evokes "Ookiku Furikabutte" for me, and its kind of annoying how similar they are. I really want Haikyuu to go to a different route or really do something different cause right now, despite not being bad at all, it really has the feel of "been there done that" to it.

>> ARTICLE
The scene with Kiyoko was an original as well iirc. Also, I might be the only one but I'm not a huge fan of the art style during Kageyama's serve and Hinata's spike in ep 1. I think it's too gritty when the rest of the anime has clean and crisp lines. The art style is still epic looking but imo it doesn't match with the rest of the show. It'll grow on me as the anime goes on but for now it looks weird. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn [this](https://24.media.tumblr.com/2c7d3b3a492dac67e54f2fd6cb42dd58/tumblr_n3yz7qQUyj1qa3t7wo1_r1_500.gif) was epic, I hope there's more of this. I'm a sucker for overlaying the source material animation with their typical animation.


>> ARTICLE
Theres something about the energy and enthusiasm of this show that makes it so enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Men, I can't believe how Hyped i get for these both playing together. I love Sport Duos like the guys From [Ookiku Furikabutte](http://i.imgur.com/PUCcOCe.jpg)

Can't wait for next week.

Oofuri is the best! I'd love a season 3 but I know it's never going to happen. D:

we can dream! DREAM ON!

if possible, can i get a GIF of the guy closing the door after the girl walked inside of the gym. that face was just too good to not see again.

thank you. its perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking this show but I'm not sure what CR did with the translation.
Several lines are mistimed, either ending too early or starting too late.

Also, why do they subtitle "osu". It's uncommon for CR to do that and it makes me think of osu! the game every time.
>> ARTICLE
There is no real translation for osu - it's basically a utility word used in the military/dojo setting that means whatever the speaker intends it to mean.
>> ARTICLE
I'm aware of that but having "osu" there is just odd if you're not going to translate it. I'd rather have them put nothing or something like roger. I guess it's personal preference.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember they subtitled "osu" as well for the Hunter x Hunter series.
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see how they do in the 3v3
>> ARTICLE
Neither can I. I hope to see more of those awesomely animated jump-shots!
>> ARTICLE
damn kageyama's speech really touched me as a setter

when i started playing volleyball i wanted to play libero (i was 165cm) but was forced to play setter since everyone else wanted to be a hitter and we had no setters. Then i started watching videos of professional setters and how they made perfect connections with their hitters and i started doing some fancy sets and orchestrating our team's offense. It feels so good when you watch your sets connect with your hitter and they hit it down hard, you just feel like you're the centre of the team. Being a setter is an amazing feeling out there on the court.
>> ARTICLE
Last week I'd never heard of this show. Then it ended up being my most anticipated show all week. Really good episode, I like all of the characters and they had great chemistry. i laughed quite a lot this whole episode, which is nice.
>> ARTICLE
This show has an AMAZING soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading the manga but even without the element of surprise, Tanaka still cracks me up!
>> ARTICLE
This ep. was so funny. Dat wig XD

I like it how they added Kiyoko's appearance.
LOL at Suga's derp face and Hinata blushing XD

It's also nice that they use different break/return cuts. First ep. was Hinata, now it's Kageyama.
>> ARTICLE
The adaptation of the detailed manga art in some scenes is exceptional, and i love those mini-scenes with the king cape, crows flying behind the captain and what not. I am looking forward for the real matches to come, it looks really good.
>> ARTICLE
Getting that same excitement feeling as from KNB.

This is gonna be great.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. Still, unlike KnB where they had 294382+ characters with very average personalities/roles, this one seems to pull me in everytime someone says the smallest thing :)
>> ARTICLE
That was a great episode! really looking forward to the next one!
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good. quite possibly my favourite this season!
>> ARTICLE
Fucking love the casting for Tanaka's VA, its almost exactly how I imagined his voice. 
>> ARTICLE
Loved the first episode. This episode felt like it was being dragged on longer than it needed to be. Definitely can't wait for the next episode though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm super curious how they're going to display the games! I hope it's going to try to be original and not have those special moves and exaggerated effects like Kuroko or Ippo. I'm getting tired of seeing that in sports anime. 

I don't want it to be too realistic either though.
>> ARTICLE
It was a really good episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone laugh their ass off when the captain gave the stare of death
>> ARTICLE
113 upvotes but only 34 (+ this) comments as of this comment.

Like in all other sports anime, 20 minutes is not enough and the anticipation is killing me!
>> ARTICLE
That manager is hot...does she get with any1?
>> ARTICLE
not really
>> ARTICLE
can u spoil me on why not really
>> ARTICLE
there's just not any romance yet
>> ARTICLE
Rather than not really, there is no romance involving the girl. 
>> ARTICLE
Because it's a sports anime and they wanna focus on the sports. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck
>> ARTICLE
Came here looking for this
>> ARTICLE
Damn
>> ARTICLE
OHHH NOOOO!!!
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GAWD!! 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT!!!!
>> ARTICLE
SONUVABIIIIIITCH!!
>> ARTICLE
Shit
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, that meal at the end was very solemn.

Also, during that final quick, I didn't realize I was holding my breath until the ball hit the ground
>> ARTICLE
I just stopped watching before the credits finished..I didn't know that there was a final scene.  Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
that scene was amazing. I know that feeling all too well, that you don't deserve to eat, you just want to be alone, that if you did this move instead of the other you could have won. It's very heartbreaking but the way they executed it was nothing short of brilliant. 
>> ARTICLE
the biggest thing i got out of that is his speech, he wasnt really just talking about food, he was talking about the idea that, after failiure, you work your hardest and become stronger.
>> ARTICLE
They're feasting on their own tears to grow stronger.
>> ARTICLE
First anime to make me cry in a very long time and I even knew it was coming too... I know the main complaint people had with Haikyuu!! was about Karasuno having plot armor but I guess all of those complaints must be gone now. 

 If you need me I'll be crying while waiting for the last episode and the S2 announcement... 
>> ARTICLE
Even the Devil Bats got eliminated a few times before finally gets up and win the big prize. It's certainly not a surprise, but the decision to finish the season on a loss is a n interesting choice
>> ARTICLE
Interesting but not incredibly surprising imo. Assuming the final episode adapts the next couple chapters of the manga as similarly to how accurate the rest of the anime adaptation has been, I believe there will be some very heavy hints to S2 (but that might just be wishful thinking haha)! 
>> ARTICLE
This is a cash cow for them. They just need to wait for more material before resuming
>> ARTICLE
If they make season 2 I'll actually consider buying the BDs when they come out. This is my aoty so far by far.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, Tsukishima was the only one *not* crying.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think crying would really suit his character that well since he is always much more reserved with his expression of emotions than the others.
>> ARTICLE
Very well said. [Somewhat Manga spoiler](/s "You'll love him, when season 2 strikes")
>> ARTICLE
Well, he's not a BITCH like the others. Tsuki best girl.
>> ARTICLE
He was also the only one [not bowing.](http://i.imgur.com/ADujHVc.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that as well, but when the scene cuts back to him, he is. Weird. 
>> ARTICLE
heh. i think he is the type of person who holds all the frustrations quitely inside and gets back to them next time
>> ARTICLE
I see him being a character for next season, if there is one, having to break down walls to be apart of the team.
>> ARTICLE
The chants for all the opposition teams have been pretty good, it's the little things that make this so fun. :)
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like Seijoh's other chant during the deuce.
>> ARTICLE
It was alright, not at Dateko level. Still good imo
>> ARTICLE
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

Dateko's is such a catchy chant.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah, I even found myself criticizing Seijoh's cause it didn't sound as cool, lol. 
>> ARTICLE
Dateko's was good, but Seijoh's was the one that got stuck in my head, and I personally liked it more. But it's the little things ya know? The fact that the chants are decent at all makes me happy! It just adds to the overall feeling.
>> ARTICLE
I find it amusing that I'm sitting here discussing a fictional sports team cheering crew where I don't even look at the cheerleaders of a real life team. 
>> ARTICLE
I love the "ooooooooohhhhhh *SMACK* " every time Oikawa served. That shit was serious 
>> ARTICLE
I stayed up to cry like a little bitch, but it was so worth it. I knew it was coming, but still...
>> ARTICLE
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS COMING. IMAGINE HOW MUCH I CRIED. FUCK.

T_______________________T
>> ARTICLE
Getting your heart ripped out from the front hurts just as much as having it ripped out from the back. At least you aren't alone in staying up or crying like a little bitch. ;)
>> ARTICLE
This episode, after so much has happened for this one match, ending with a loss. Seeing Seijoh return the ball as it slowly fell down made you think, "someones gonna get that right? This is when the comeback starts, right?"Then the ball drops and this empty feeling takes over. 

Everything about this episode felt great from the end of the match to the food and tears shed. I wish I knew more about the Japanese school season and what happens next for Karasuno. Time to pick up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
You were supposed to go to nationals!! You were supposed to win!! You were supposed to fuck them up man! TO fucking fly and compete with your rivals. WHY?? WHY??? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck 
>> ARTICLE
have you ever seen a sports anime before? The protagonists generally always lose their first tournament, so they can win the second, more prestigious one
>> ARTICLE
Not Makunouchi Ippo. But he's an anomaly, and Hajime No Ippo is the greatest sports anime of all time, so it's also an anomaly.
>> ARTICLE
good point. It happens more if there is a team(usually in school), rather than an individual sport, like boxing. 
>> ARTICLE
It's rarer for a series to do so and lose all the third years, but on the upside most series that do so tend to be really good.
>> ARTICLE
Yes but still i beleived that wont be the case. I mean they evolved greatly and in the next tournament the 3rd years wont be able to play. So it will be a different team! Also if you think that they played with the rivals and they said "Meet you in nationals" you would expect them to go to nationals and play against them. The plot was pointing out to winning , not losing.
>> ARTICLE
> in the next tournament the 3rd years wont be able to play

Looking at the [latest chapters](/s "the third years are still playing, probably training for the next tournament"). 
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoilers] (/s "yeah but they kinda sacrificing their studies before univesity to keep playing, all the teachers told them they should stop and focus on getting good mark for collage") 
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "Considering all the teams Karasuno have in their way after Shirotori, I still think they'll lose in nationals at some point and have a new team next year. Why else would it have so much emphasis on the next captain recently?")

Dammit [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/YEeRZS4.jpg).... no matter how much i had prepared my self i couldn't stop that single tear


>> ARTICLE
Amen. T_T
>> ARTICLE
Even as a manga reader, I was not prepared ;-;
>> ARTICLE
The talk with Takeda and the meal were delicately well handled. They were those scenes that let the moment speak for itself and let the audience absorb what's happening.

edit: [Haikyuu!! Episode 24 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-24.html)
>> ARTICLE
Very cool read.
>> ARTICLE
Anxiously starting this episode now. It's been a hell of a ride and I don't want it to end. Let us stand on the court a little longer.
>> ARTICLE
Just...damn man. That stung. 
>> ARTICLE
When Nishinoya saved the ball towards the end when Seijoh were leading, I  saw the desperation on his face, almost shed a tear.

Amazing series, excited for next episode and hopefully for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Why is the high school men's volleyball anime making me cry the most out of everything that's airing
>> ARTICLE
This. 
>> ARTICLE
Because you never expected to be able to cry about men's high school volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
I want to cry :'(
>> ARTICLE
Want to? I did.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that happened.

I'll see you all in the pit of despair.
>> ARTICLE
Just one more episode. There better be a second season. :|
>> ARTICLE
Sales are currently 29k for the second volume, so there will most definitely be a second season unless IG hates money.
>> ARTICLE
It will take a little while until that. The manga, original source, is relatively close to the ending of the anime and since it's IG they aren't going to make fillers and so, see Kuroko, so it will probably get that treatment and gets a second season after one year if they maintain the high ranking/sales.
>> ARTICLE
But if this covered chapter 69ish and there's 121 chapters, there's still not close to enough material for another season? That's only 20 chapters from being on equal footing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's not really much material, they can do it, but it would be cutting too close, which they decided to not do with Kuroko and, now, Haikyuu. Also, again, it's done by the same team who made Kuroko no Basket, so they probably are using their resources to do it now, and then, when that finishes, they can come back with haikyuu with more chapters to animate. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking we'll get the season 2 announcement in a year at the latest?
>> ARTICLE
How many chapters does this season cover?
>> ARTICLE
it covers 69 plus a few extra, but without spoiling the manga, suffice it to say the next plot arc can probably be condensed to 4-6 episodes, they couldn't get a full season out of it most likely, so its likely to get the kuroro treatment.
>> ARTICLE
69 probably a little more since there's still one more episode
>> ARTICLE
This episode. I can't even. I'm pretty sure this is what perfection is in anime form.
>> ARTICLE
Man, today has been a feel trip, marathoning Anohana and now this...
>> ARTICLE
You should watch the Anohana movie too. It uses scenes from the series spliced together as flashbacks with new scenes. It's by no means just a compilation movie, though. It shows them a tiny bit older and more mature.
>> ARTICLE
are there fansubs out? i tried to watch it a few months ago but couldnt find subs
>> ARTICLE
I found it somewhere to stream. Can't point you anywhere since it's against the sub's rules, but it's out there.
>> ARTICLE
I really want to see it now, I guess it's time to continue the marathon! Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Haha, you should! No worries. Anohana always brings the feels. Menma is one of the cutest characters I've ever seen. The opening scene from the first episode of the series is hilarious when Jintan's trying to ignore her existence, thinking he's seeing things.
>> ARTICLE
welcome to sports animes where one guy passes the ball to another and you start crying
>> ARTICLE
If you were ever put into a sky-high state of tension, hope, and anticipation and then suplexed down off of it, then this would be it.

I wanted them to win so badly, damn it!
>> ARTICLE
So tense, so sad.
>> ARTICLE
The meal scene was so goddamn powerful. 

I didn't think I'd tear up. 

Shit. 

I want a season 2 so bad now...
>> ARTICLE
Since everyone else has pretty much summed up the emotions felt from watching this episode, I'm actually quite excited for next week's episode! Announcement of the new captain maybe?
>> ARTICLE
nishioya is still gonna there right? He should definitely be captain
>> ARTICLE
Probably, but I could see Tanaka being captain too, both of them are just too alike in terms of personality.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe, but a libero comes on and off the court a lot.  Having a captain who is almost always on the court may be seen as a positive.
>> ARTICLE
geez I love when you get to these big moments in the show..I've read the manga but being able to watch it in motion with music and the whole panning of shots...it adds so much emotion to it. I always tear up at these big moments... love this episode...

edit: are there others who just tear up watching this show??? like the team effort they put in in and everything is just really moving to me :/
>> ARTICLE
They did a really good  job of bringing alive the raw emotions
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck 
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna miss this show so much, the anime is so well done so I think I'm gonna wait for the S2 to be confirmed in the coming year rather than read the manga. PLEASE. DON'T STOP MAKING THIS.
>> ARTICLE
Man, the nostalgia for me with this anime. I used to compete in sport and the feeling of coming to the last point, the entire tournament place around these last point were the greatest feelings. I have experience the joy of the victor and the sadness of the defeated. The last scene hit me all in the right place. This is seriously and underrated anime, I have to say this is even better than SAO
>> ARTICLE
I know the feeling. Haikyuu, more than any sports anime I've seen so far, really resonates with my memories of high school and even collegiate intramural sports. It hits all the right notes. It gives personality to the opponents. Even the filler episodes seem to carry purpose.
>> ARTICLE
I actually feel bad for not crying. My heart stopped however. I did actually tear up reading these comments for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
I almost forgot the basic rules on every sports anime you have to lose before you win. I didn't expect that on this anime dem feels looking forward to season 2 hopefully next year.
>> ARTICLE
welp I cried this episode and I'm gonna cry next episode. There's no "next game" for our third years...
>> ARTICLE
Start reading the manga boys, its even better
>> ARTICLE
What chapter do I start on?
>> ARTICLE
chapter 1 if you wanna relive the entire experience 
>> ARTICLE
i think this episode was between chapters 69-72 but im not sure
>> ARTICLE
I love volleyball and will now read the manga after next ep. Thanks to the this thread I know which chapter to start from now.   
>> ARTICLE
I think it won't be like *tokyo ghoul better* where the manga is amazeballs compared to the anime. Cuz this anime is freaking amazeballs already, cant wait to start on the manga! :)
>> ARTICLE
One almost final shameless plugin for /r/haikyuu 
>> ARTICLE
This was the exact part of the manga I got up to when I started losing a little bit of enthusiasm. I hate seeing win after win after win come out of sports teams, then bam this comes along and my eyes widen and I stay up the rest of the night to fully catch up. Catch up on the manga folks, it's great :D
>> ARTICLE
Oh my...
>> ARTICLE
Well, fuck. Will cry in room and await season 2. Need to stay in this court.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know anymore. Something already felt heavy inside of me after watching Barakamon, and now this episode...
>> ARTICLE
That was great.  Such an intense scene with the perfect music playing in the background.
>> ARTICLE
Oh the sniffles, I got the sniffles. 
>> ARTICLE
wow... almost teared up there... that was NOT the ending i was expecting but it was a good ending. Every team loses now and again. really sad that it has one more ep now :(
>> ARTICLE
I love this show its easily my favorite sports anime
>> ARTICLE
Why you do this to me!
>> ARTICLE
As a spectator, if my team has to bow out of a tournament, this is the best way to do so. They showed plenty of heart, courage, determination, and desire, and just got pipped by the better team after a long match down to the wire. It's not that they didn't give it the 110% and backed themselves, but the opponents is just better on the day.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT.

I literally don't know how so few people watch the anime (guessing from the very few comments every week here) but damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, i cried, i smiled and in the end im just dying to get S2 announcement. I can safely say that this is the best anime i've watched since a long time. Amazing
>> ARTICLE
150 score and 100 comments certainly isn't few

man fuck this show.

In a good way?

In an I'm-upset-the-outcome-didn't-go-the-way-I-wanted-to way.

Damn, this is a GOOD SHOW!
>> ARTICLE
That's it i quit. I'm done!
>> ARTICLE
I yelled "FUCK OIKAWA" and threw shit on the ground. Then I was in tears at the ending. Goddamn this is an emotional show. One of the most powerful mix of the emotions I've ever experiences is losing by 1 to a formidable team, and the solemn and inevitable journey to get back on your feet. This show is beautiful.

Well, see you all at the next discussion for season 2!

FLY KARASUNO!

Have you watched Slam Dunk? Its like Haikyuu but focused on basket. Its one of my favourite shows ever and Haikyuu gave me the same vibes! Take a look yourself

If you haven't watched it yet, you should watch Kuroko no Basuke, as well. A third season is coming out in 2015.
>> ARTICLE
Is season 2 confirmed?
>> ARTICLE
Has some of the highest sales this season, I'd be shocked if they didn't do season 2 at some point.
>> ARTICLE
we should expect one atleast. both the manga and anime have a huge following i'd be a big surprise if they didnt have a season 2. plus the story is far from over.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the fact that the anime sold like crazy. The only way there wouldn't be a season 2 is if the production companies hate money.
>> ARTICLE
See you at spring tournament
>> ARTICLE
Lovely use of [eyeline match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) in this [sequence](http://imgur.com/a/M9S2k). First we see Tanaka looking out the window. The reflection of the crows makes it obvious what's he's looking at. Then it cuts to the crows themselves. Next cut is Daichi looking up at the same crows. A nice flowing continuity from one shot to another that also creates a sense of connection between the two characters.

>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if this show was popular enough to DEFINITELY get a second season?  I really enjoyed this series way more than I thought I would.  I just watched the first episode on a whim and I was hooked.  Probably because I played volleyball in high school so I may be biased but still, it's a good show.
>> ARTICLE
The second season is even better than the first, or will be. The second half of the manga is better than the first IMO.
>> ARTICLE
You're getting my hopes reallllly high. I absolutely loved the first half. 
>> ARTICLE
It's selling at 29k last time I checked, so it's definitely getting a second season as soon as the manga gets enough new material.
>> ARTICLE
it's highly popular, but there's not enough chapters atm
>> ARTICLE
The anime ends around chapter 71, and there's 122 chapters out right now. I think they could do a 2nd season soon. 
>> ARTICLE
you need at least 6 months, and a bit more to buffer for potential S3, so I'd say at least a year.
>> ARTICLE
I have never really seen the appeal of sports anime, since I'm not really interested in sports IRL, so i have never really watched a sports anime before, but now after Yowamushi Pedal and this, I'm definitely going to start looking out for more sports anime to watch.

Anyway a great ending to an amazing anime, really going to miss it. Hopefully we will get another season in a couple of years.

>> ARTICLE
I have to, as suggested, really advise you to pick up Hajime no Ippo. Its got a lot of episodes out so you have something to kill quite a bit of time. As well, its probably one of the greatest stories I've ever read. The Anime covers maybe just over half the manga content out (I think the latest chapter is something like 1071) and its all grade A material.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo, hands down my favorite sports anime.

One Outs, an amazing and unique take on sports anime.

Eyeshield 21, hands down my favorite sports manga, and one of the best mangas I've ever read. Don't even think of touching its anime adaption... it doesn't do this series any justice... not at all ;~;
>> ARTICLE
I have heard a lot of good things about Hajime no Ippo. The only thing that turns me off it, is that there are so many episodes and i don't really have the time for it. There are like 100+ and i could watch 4-6+ other anime series in that time. It's a hard decision on whether or not to make that commitment to it or not.
>> ARTICLE
That's fair, but the pacing in Ippo is near perfect.

There are maybe four series I've ever seen that have pacing even close to Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
Give the first 20 episodes a try, if you like those then continue with the series... Believe me, you won't regret it! The better fights come later though!

I used to be put-off with long series myself, but I'm glad I commited myself with Hunter x Hunter and Hajime no Ippo. They're my third and fourth favorite anime, respectively.
>> ARTICLE
I've never gotten the knock on long shows. I mean, if you love it it means you have something to watch for quite awhile. If you don't then length matters not.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly! And you can take a break every now and then and watch other shows if you really want to... That is what I did with One Piece :p
>> ARTICLE
I'm in much the same boat, I don't follow sports much outside of the various tennis Opens and the Olympics when it rolls round, but good sports series get me real good. If you're looking for something to watch during the next season to get your sports fix take a look at this.

If you're looking for things along the same vein as Haikyuu!! try one of these:

Chihayafuru (anime)  
Cross Game (anime)  
Ping Pong the Animation (anime)  
Hajime no Ippo (anime)  
H2 (manga)  
Touch (manga)  
Slam Dunk (manga)  

All feature a solid mix of comraderie, sports and character development.

If you're looking for something equally good, but with more of a focus on the spectacular, check out one of these:

Kuroko's Basketball (anime)  
Initial D (anime)  
Eyeshield 21 (manga)  
>> ARTICLE
> the Olympics when it rolls round

I don't no why but i love the Olympics. It's really the only time i sit down and watch sports all day.

Thanks for the recommendations, I think i might check out Chihayafuru and Kuroko's Basketball. I actually downloaded Kuroko's Basketball the other day so i will get onto that one soon.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand the link with Ping Pong the animation. It's a fantastic anime and manga but it's totally different. Ping Pong is more directed on the philosophy and the evolution of characters than the sport.
>> ARTICLE
When I said they were in the same vein as Haikyuu!! I was referring to quality, rather than thematic similarities.

I do agree with what you're saying though.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, up early, lets do this

edit 1: Aw man that intro scene was powerful. Seeing them all in the aftermath and how they're taking it was brutal.

edit 2: Man the silence this episode is killing me. no screaming, no cheering, no music, just them at school.

edit 3: Watching Hinata and Kageyama run around the gym like mad put a smile on my face. sometimes its best to just scream it out.

edit 4: And the show ends with the same monologue that started it. I love when shows go full circle like that. I'll miss this show after today, assuming there is no season 2. It sold really well from what I heard so we can hope.

[Nice final endcard.](http://i.imgur.com/2QqV8Ii.png)
>> ARTICLE
The whole first half of the episode where they try to readjust to post tournament life and relive their shortcomings in their heads hit pretty hard. Talk about regrets. They really took the dagger to the heart from last week and gave it a twist. Its an all too familiar feeling in anything competitive.

Kageyama and Hinata's meltdown in the gym had me smiling to but it was a pretty sad one. Ugh... Them feels.
>> ARTICLE
Best parts about a tragedy is not the tragic moments, but seeing how people pick themselves up and rise again from it. There were regret, there were anger, there were sadness. Yet at the same time there's also determination, ambition, and hope.

Karasuno didn't let themselves to get burnt out from the defeat, instead they shall use this painful feeling as motivation and fly even higher next time.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is currently my favorite anime from this year, basically making it AOTY for me. Can't wait for the 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
This last episode, this whole season can't really be done justice with words. It was an amazing ride, but I truly wish we got to stand on the court a little longer.

See you all at the spring tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, I cried like a baby when this ended. Why do I like this so much? I hate sports in real life. I can't deal with this and then HxH on Tuesday. I'll be a broken man this week. This is the first anime where I actually cried when it was over.
>> ARTICLE
How did you cry over this and not HxH?! 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't cry during the latest HxH episode cause I was smiling instead, I did cry during episode 135 and probably will during the one today. As for why I cried during this anime, I have no idea why I enjoyed this that much, like I said. 
>> ARTICLE
And so, the long wait for season 2 begins. 
>> ARTICLE
This better gets a 2nd season. But until then there's a special coming up in November at least.
>> ARTICLE
This season was just so well done. I don't even play sports but it's so easy for someone like me to be able to relate to the characters. On to the manga!
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't stop smiling all through that episode
>> ARTICLE
Man, after being hit with the doozy that is the Aldnoah.Zero season finale, this was a very, very refreshing and uplifting finale.
>> ARTICLE
My god those ending credits were the best :') I really enjoyed this series as a hole. Definetly top 3 in my favorite sports animes, if not of all animes. 

Unfortunately I have a feeling that it will take some time for season 2 to start, if they are planning one that is. 

If only they released manga chapters once every day with the same quality xD but oh well Haikyuu is what it is because the author have putten so much work into it. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god someone please tell me there's a second season. The manga is even better than the anime so far and it it has just enough to get a second season, even if it's only one cour.
>> ARTICLE
I went ahead and caught with the manga in the last week, and I can't wait for season 2. It gets so much better. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll surely have a hard time accepting that it's over and/or nary a clue if there will be a 2nd season. :'(
>> ARTICLE
It was probably the best sports anime since I've watched Chihayafuru. Kuroko was good but not good like this. I guess i'll go into the manga since I can't wait for the season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu gives me so many feels. I love the characters. The matches were always so intense! Season 2 when?
>> ARTICLE
End of an era. That was beautiful, time to go read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I am going to miss this anime so much.
Fly Karasuno, FLY!!
>> ARTICLE
Well gentlemen, it was a pleasure watching Haikyuu!! with you. Shall we enjoy a second season when enough material is out together again : ).
>> ARTICLE
Im so hyped for the second season i know they will announce one
>> ARTICLE
if you can believe it, the spring tournament arc for haikyuu is even better than this one
>> ARTICLE
Can any1 tell me the name of the song at the end and who performs it ? Thanks in advance
>> ARTICLE
The song's "leo" by tacica.

>> ARTICLE
> leo" by tacica

Thanks a lot u helped a ton :D 
>> ARTICLE
Such a good anime, I was really surprised. Every episode was consistently enjoyable. Looking forward to S2.
>> ARTICLE
This is out of spite and really childish, but i am glad seijoh got crushed by aoba josai! Fuck yes. 

I hope we get a second season!

edit: [also this moment ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/db14Pzc.png)
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong, but I though Aoba Josai and Seijoh were the same thing. Seijoh got beaten by Shiratorizawa
>> ARTICLE
I think 'Seijo' is a different way to read the kanji for Aoba, but I can't say for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
'sei' is another reading of the kanji for 'ao', so we get a compound 'Seijoh'  using the first kanji of each part in 'Aoba Johsai'  . At least that's my assumption; the Haikyuu wiki doesn't say anything. But Japan does like those kind of abbreviated compounds.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps has over 300 chapters of material compared to Haikyuu's 120 or so chapters, and I believe both series covered around 70 chapters with their first seasons. So yeah, Baby Steps has more than enough material to work with while Haikyuu needs to wait a bit to have enough.
>> ARTICLE
The next arc is a training one, where they train with other teams and it was amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
As for Karasuno beating a #1 team, it's definitely possible. Seijoh only lost by 2 that second game. In volleyball, that pretty much means they're even teams. Seijoh might have missed some serves, had a few calls go against them, got there blocks tooled. A 2 point win could've easily gone the other way. Karasuno also went 3 against Seijoh, so they're basically even as well.
>> ARTICLE
Seijoh lost by 2 points in the second set and I assumed in that cut it meant that it was over in two sets. In other words, Seijoh didn't even win a single set. That's pretty far out to say Karasuno would be even with Shiratorizawa. 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently there's barely enough for a season 2, and with that ending I'm guessing they're planning on continuing
>> ARTICLE
I'm beyond stoked after watching this show. It is one of the prime examples of how good the writing in a shonen can really be, even if it's always about strength of will, venting your emotions and giving it your all, there's always room for a full fledged story about growing up, overcoming your weaknesses and, over everything, spending time with your friends.

Never give up Karasuno, one more time, fly...

PS: which chapter did the show end at? I'm certainly picking this up asap.
>> ARTICLE
O god I'm gonna miss this show! Anime of the year by far. Season 2 come soon please!
>> ARTICLE
This might be the best sports anime I've ever watched. It's kept up the excitement without being unrealistic and the team had great chemistry. I'm definitely looking forward to its next season and might start reading the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Great ending and hell it made me tear up. From just the opening of the boys just looking so defeated the very next day in class, made my eyes water. 

  Takeda's speech to the 3rd years hit home really fast for me; adults trying to tell teenagers that you shouldn't really spend all your time on your hobbies and what makes you happy because you will fall behind everyone and won't have a "normal life" if you don't study, just made me rethink my life a bit. 

  I fucking love how Hinata and Kageyama got their anger and emotions out, just pure raw built up and perfectly projected in their actions. 

  All I can hope now is that Season 2 comes out for the Spring and I can get ready to feel more feels with all of you. Top 5 ATOY right here.
>> ARTICLE
So much feels.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 when? 
>> ARTICLE
I've never felt strongly enough about a show to want to pick up the manga, but I think this one finally did it. Does anyone know a good place to read it online? I have no idea where to start looking

Quick shoutout to how perfect that soundtrack was. An amazing episode.
>> ARTICLE
This was a really amazing ride. The characters and writing make this show. As someone who is kind of a sports junkie and actually played volleyball competitively, I really enjoyed the relatively realistic side to the show. No superpowers, no 20 minutes of talking before anybody does anything, no crazy powerups mid game. I can't wait for the inevitable season 2! 

Sidenote, did Hinata jump 20 feet or something since he was able to grab onto the railing of the freakin second story!
>> ARTICLE
Fly!
>> ARTICLE
Go! Go! Lets go! Let's go! Season 2! Let's go!


>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. These sustained feels when they were letting it out in the gym. Fuckin a.
>> ARTICLE
Can season 2 episode 1 be release tomorrow? PLEASE!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Any chance someone could enlighten me to the name of the song that opened the episode? I've re-watched it about 5 times thanks to its beauty.
>> ARTICLE
This is by far one of the best anime I've seen in quite some time and I look forward to a potential second season.
>> ARTICLE
I love [this picture!](http://imgur.com/xESBhkI)

I hope there will be a second season!
>> ARTICLE
If season 2 does happen when do you think it will be released? :D any time soon if they do decide to make another season?   '3'

Easily anime of the year for me 

Can't wait for season 2

I've only watched the first 6 episodes and found the anime kind of cheesy. Is it worth watching? I enjoyed Kuroko's Basketball a lot and that's what people like to compare this to.  (I'm only going to look at replies in my inbox so I dont see spoilers). 
>> ARTICLE
its pretty different from kuroko but definitely watch it


>> ARTICLE
Better ending then god damn Aldnoah, I am glad I watched this final episode after that one.
>> ARTICLE
Oh guys.. I don't even know how to put this anime in words, it's literally a rollercoaster of emotions, the small things like the team-chants, or the rivalry between some of these characters, the amount of enthusiams they give these characters.. it's amazing, it's breathtaking. I can safely say that this has been my favourite anime since Fate/Zero.

I'm atually considering reading the manga, but the anime is just too good i don't know if i really want to spoil me that fun.

Hopefully we'll be able to talk about Haiykuu soon again, my fellow watchers!
FLY!!!

[Tanaka you are not a third year what are you talking about.](http://i.imgur.com/CPepoCq.png)

Take a shot every time Hinata says he is small but he can jump/he will be the next ace, you won't die but it is at least two shot an episode. 

[Baby Daichi](http://i.imgur.com/t0UOOy2.png) vs [terrifying Daichi](http://i.imgur.com/9YHcP6r.png).

And the best part of the episode is Suga's door closing skills. [Look at this face.](http://i.imgur.com/WUS6Opl.png) [Look.] (http://i.imgur.com/uImSz1E.png)There is probably a GIF of this out there.  [A less terrifying door close ](http://i.imgur.com/cTqhAPc.png) which means he probably also did it [here](http://i.imgur.com/8ahvKuG.png) as well. 

Also this little [sight gag (hearing gag?)](http://i.imgur.com/L0iaYjf.png) cause at the bottom of Tanaka's wiki page is [this](http://i.imgur.com/5EdNbYk.png)
>> ARTICLE
the Tanaka saying he's a third year always confused me in the beginning! but now I know that he was prolly just tryna intimidate u feel 
what a dork
>> ARTICLE
Could it also have been a translation mistake? Like could he have been saying something more akin to upper year, like a seniority thing?
>> ARTICLE
lol yeah could be, but I like to think that he was just tryna seem cool like the nerd he is
>> ARTICLE
It seems more like he was telling Suga (a third year) that he should be making a better / more intimidating first impression than "Wow, you're tall". 

Crunchyroll lumped him in there as well; there are some pretty awkward translation goofs throughout their simulcast. Some series are fine, but Haikyuu's made me cringe.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa! Really? Are there any other instances that come to mind? I'm so curious now!
>> ARTICLE

equivalent of asking a girl out... :'(
>> ARTICLE
hahaaha i loved Suga's door closing scene!  
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to jump in this. I'll catch up.
>> ARTICLE
Please do! We're only an episode in so catching up is easy. 
>> ARTICLE
So I gave this a try because of the first discussion thread and have not stopped watching.
For me, this is like on the level of Eyeshield 21 and Hajjime no Ippo.
So if you haven't heard from me send help... lol
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I didn't think any football (*American* football, that is) anime existed. Also, here's hoping you don't get sucked into Haikyuu!!-marathoning too badly.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, you'll love Eyeshield 21.
I'm currently on Ep18 on Haikyuu lol....
>> ARTICLE
If I really like football, is Eyeshield worth watching? I've been putting it off because of the massive amount of episodes. How quickly does it get going?
>> ARTICLE
The anime is alright, but the animation is nothing special and the manga is way better, and the anime doesn't cover all of it. I found it hard to suspend disbelief for all the narration that takes place in the anime to lead up to a 3 yard gain.
>> ARTICLE
It is a prince of Tennis type anime. All the characters have super power moves. It is a great comedy, but I wouldn't call it a good sports anime. I don't think Prince of Tennis is either though.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this. Although characters have supernatural moves the anime still sticks to the rules of the game in real life. So you would see neat tricks that you can do in a real game incorporated in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
For me, it gets going right at the get go. 
If you like football and anime, Eyeshield 21 is a definite mush-watch for you.

>> ARTICLE
Uh guys my bad i started today but im already at half the episode mark because it was so goddamn good. I humbly apologize for it

In episode 2 i found hilarious the banter between the two mains not to mention the "certain incident". I really like how well this series uses comedy, it really makes it flow well with the more serious games
>> ARTICLE
Sports anime in general are pretty good at sucking you in (i.e. making you want to marathon them) but Haikyuu!! is imo especially good at it. Hope you'll check in with the daily threads occasionally anyway.
>> ARTICLE
yeah ill try to contribute as much as i can even though i have memory of a fish
>> ARTICLE
Well, that girl is... wow. For some reason, I was under the impression that this show was kind of homoerotic like Free!, but color me pleasantly surprised!

I'm really digging this show so far! I like the dynamic between the two mains, and the end of both episodes so far has left me excited to see the next one.
>> ARTICLE
It's really not homoerotic at all. The fandom would make you think otherwise... but I really dig the lack of subtext and how the sport is just as important as the relationship between the players. 
>> ARTICLE
~~cries because I have no time to rewatch~~

It's really nice to see other people getting into Haikyuu. The sports genre gets such a bad rap, but Haikyuu is easily one of my favorite series ever. Have fun for me, everyone!
>> ARTICLE
The comedy in Haikyuu is one of my favorite things in the anime. It never feels forced (like Kuroko), and it's always hilarious. 

This anime just does everything right for me haha
>> ARTICLE
I liked this episode quite a bit the humor was odd, but it wasn't really dumb. Like trying to be first in the door was getting there, but it got its point across about the two of them.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, just wow, this 2 episodes are really funny.

I feel like watching a modern age Slam Dunk, with some really strong comedy, and very cool sports scene.

I'm loving it!!!!

This one is actually gonna be hard to control myself, and not just watch it in a day, beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
This is the second sports anime I'm deciding to watch. Not much for me to say about episode two here, as I'm still watching episode 1.

Most Production I.G. shows that I've watched have been great for me, and Haikyu will hopefully be the same. Maybe this studio would be talked about more around here if sports anime were more popular on reddit, since they've also made Kuroko no Basket.
>> ARTICLE
Lots to love in this episode:

Those hilarious faces

Tanaka-Senpai appears on the scene

Kageyama's speech about the setter role

The fact that with both Hinata and Kageyama will cause Karasuno's potential to expand explosively. 

Next episode: The first appearance of the other two first-years. 

Can't wait!
>> ARTICLE
Decided to jump in on this, and I can already see how this is going to be great! Can't wait!!
>> ARTICLE
there had better be a season 2 in the makings for haikyuu

the manga is so fucking good
>> ARTICLE
Fucking yea!!! Finally a fucking anime that keeps me on the cheering mood during ALL the episode. It shows how tired everyone is, how everyone wants to win, its not just one team , its not about who is stronger , its about trying your best. Then the climax and the perfect ending!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
This is Chihayafuru all over again for me, the emotions, tiredness, effort, little strategies to overcome an obstacle and dynamics of the game that always change in a drop of a hat. I love this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Actually speaking of Chihayafuru, the character animation and colouring is quite similar to Haikyuu!! Are they the same animation studio? I think Haikyuu!! might have the best (or just my favourite) animation of any cartoon I've ever seen.

Speaking of which, anyone know any other good shows by the same studio?
>> ARTICLE
No, they're different studios. Production I.G. is the name of the animation studio, at least I think, and they did things like Ghost in the Shell and just many more things. You can look them up on Wiki or MAL and see the work that they do. The closest thing to Haikyuu!! is probably Kuroko no Basket. Great animations, dragonball-Z basketball anime.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, Madhouse does Chihayafuru. Studio IG does Haikyuu. I think  IG did Kuroko's Basketball. I think.
>> ARTICLE
That's weird, the art style for Kuroko No Basuke and Haikyuu!! is so different. :O
>> ARTICLE
Is it a recommendable anime? :o
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. I'd never even heard of Karuta before I watched Chihayafuru, and I blitzed both seasons of it in about a week. It's an amazing anime, it's got such a serene atmosphere. It's like someone distilled passion and turned it into an anime. All the characters are solid, particularly the main character Chihaya, and her "love interest" if you can call him that.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend Chihayafuru, it is like Haikyuu mixed with a little romance and karuta instead of volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
I wholeheartedly recommend it, if it's not for you, I won't have a problem with that. Karuta is not an appealing subject in general, but it is my favorite sports anime and I can see Haikyuu! being second when all of this is done.
>> ARTICLE
everyone is sleeping and im just sitting here watching haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
Everyone? Fucking hype every sunday morning, man! And if, by some wizardry, I fell asleep, I've five alarms for sunday morning earlier than I get up normally on the week just to make sure to watch this show as soon as it is release and when it ends I can't sleep until the adrenaline sets down.
>> ARTICLE
Sunday around midnight for me, I got school the next morning but Haikyuu always come first!
>> ARTICLE
its always worth it.

>> ARTICLE
Gotta love [Yamaguchi's nervousness](https://imgur.com/a/GJp0y#pBuNMHY) coming into a game for the first time. Like me, I'm pretty sure every whose played on a recreational/school sports team has felt this.

Also, the [one-hand set](https://imgur.com/a/ez4B8#CvfsFUt) was beautifully done. Wonderful art direction and symbolism. I love how this show evokes emotion through the sport, something I particularly enjoy about this sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I was so happy for Yamaguchi when Daichi said "next time".
>> ARTICLE
Who needs sleep when you've got Haikyuu!! I'd totally join the [Karasuno cheerleaders](http://i.imgur.com/cXerLlO.jpg).

you sir, mad my day. <3
>> ARTICLE
I swear to god it felt like this episode only went for 10 mins.

Nishinoya's handstand on Yamaguchi's back when Hinita scored that point was pretty on point.
>> ARTICLE
Final set is here!

EDIT: Oh look, a creepy Hinata face

Also I just noticed that glasses-Sensei sounds like Natsume and Akashi. o_o

And Nishinoya just has the most ridiculous poses when they score, ahaha.

Oh my god, Yamaguchi in the court?!(nooo Yamaguchi ;A;)

>> ARTICLE
Such a great episode but that should be redundant for this series at this point. I can't get enough. The strategy is great and I love how every character got a spotlight this match (everything isn't reliant on one character, Hinata and Kageyama are definitely the forefront but they wouldn't be able to get anywhere without their other teammates and they still have some growing to do), even though Tamaguchi missed his serve, he still tried and gave Karasuno momentum to keep pushing. Hinata has come so far, he didn't even want to become a decoy at first but now he's such a great decoy, he's even drawing in Kageyama. At the same time, Seijoh isn't giving up either, they keep pulling ahead but Karsuno is catching up. You can almost feel the tension and how much each team wants to win. That OST is also putting in work, I'm not going to be able to resist downloading that.

>> ARTICLE
The concept of Hinata being so convincing that his own setter feels like the ball HAS TO go to him is so radical to me. Cool stuff all over the place in this episode (but that's nothing new).
>> ARTICLE
Okay you know what? This show is my favourite this season. I know how this sub feels about sports anime, but I'm over it. Haikyuu gives me what every other show this season has failed to. Multiple emotions. Some shows make me laugh, some make me cry, some put me on the edge of my seat, but ony haikyuu gives me everything. I adore it. This is also the only show where I care for ALL of the characters. They're all realistic and likeable. There's no op moves and no characters that exist just to be badass. I understand that this show didn't technically air this season, but even if I completely ignore the first half, Haikyuu would still be my favourite. If these last two episodes hold strong (99% chance they will) this is going straight into my top ten of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been trying to tell everyone since last season that this was the best anime of the season. People really just need to give it a chance, and they'll be addicted

[How does Nishinoya even do these things](http://i1353.photobucket.com/albums/q661/TweekTweak/wtf_zps238fcdba.png)? :D

lot of QUALITY this episode but I guess they're saving up for the final episode

I watch Haikyu after Baby Steps. It really makes it seem quality instead of QUALITY. Because there's no more QUALITY anime than Baby Steps, though I really love the stories and characters.

I caught up with the anime and manga last week and I have to say I am loving this series.Every character is really well done and the OST is amazing. There are only 2 more episodes left :( . Season 2 when??
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 will be so good ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone explain to me about the rules of substitution of a pinch server?
>> ARTICLE
Okay, here is where we get into the funky rules of libero substitution. A libero is a "free" substitution. You can sub them in at any time for any player in the back row. However, when they leave the court they MUST switch with the person who they swapped out for. 

The substitution between Hinata and Yamaguchi was a normal substitution, of which there are a limited number in the match but you can switch them in at any position. However, once one of these substitutions is made you are somewhat "locked in".

That is to say, if Hinata were injured and needed to be taken off the court and he were in the front row, Yamaguchi would HAVE to sub in for him, as that first sub pairs them off. This prevents a coach from shuffling players around too much.

Does this answer your question?
>> ARTICLE
Not 100% sure on it so please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like it's basically a normal substitution except only for as long as its that player's serve. 

i.e. Kurasano told the judge's hey Yamaguchi is subbing in for Hinata, but once it's no longer his turn to serve we're gonna rotate Nishinoya into that position(as our libero) and while Yamaguchi and Hinata are both in the warm-up area we're gonna sub Hinata back in for Yamaguchi.
>> ARTICLE
I never was so caught up in a show before. The tension inside this episode is huge.
>> ARTICLE
I have never been one for sports anime but.... Haikyuu is just so... so.. wow
>> ARTICLE
One hand toss!
>> ARTICLE
I did something similar to that bout half an hour ago, probably not the same thing though
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, Yamaguchi. My heart goes out for the guy.
>> ARTICLE
Man was that ever great!

Probably the first time in awhile that I've said out loud "You gotta be fucking joking" because it ended right before the climax.

>> ARTICLE
OMG haikyuu ending soon :(, and can't wait for next episode even being a manga reader!!
>> ARTICLE
ahh, so much hype. No exaggeration, this was one of the greatest episodes in a sports anime I've ever seen. This was Ippo vs Sendo levels of hype.


>> ARTICLE
Feel sorry for pinch server boy. Would be crazy if hes brought out again for Hinata serve next episode to get the match point. Anyways, the end of this episode fighting for those last points was a god damn edge of the seat roller coaster ride of feeling that is trademark sports anime. WHY DID IT HAVE TO END SO QUICKLY?!?!!?
>> ARTICLE
the last fucking one hand toss damn i was so hyped i was like fuckkkkkkk yeah 

and now another week to wait 
>> ARTICLE
I love this anime so much, I just wish /r/haikyuu had more people
>> ARTICLE
Holy fucking shit! This episode got me so stoked! Between this show and Free! I'm overflowing of sports feels this season.
>> ARTICLE
That one handed toss!  It's been a while since I've been this excited.

Wish more people would watch this. It is an awesome anime! Just found it recently and i'm loving it
>> ARTICLE
This is insanely engaging.   What a show!  I just wanna get out and run untill my lungs burst right now!
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, now I have a hype for Haikyuu, time to re-read the manga for the third time
>> ARTICLE
brb getting the ost

I don't even know why I bother going on any of the Haikyuu!! discussion threads anymore because the only thing I can think of is to say is 'great episode'. Every episode. But the show just constantly has great episodes. I have no way to get around that. 

>> ARTICLE
I don't know who these girls are, but they're being used very well for purposes of exposition.

Also, that "catching up" thing going through the episode, I thought, was well done.
>> ARTICLE
Like I'm feeling down and negative. Watch Haikyuu! and all of a sudden I'm way above positive, feeling energetic and excited. I don't even think there is an anime that's currently airing that can do that to me. I'm seriously thinking this may be one of my top 3 anime of the year(Not including the fall season yet)But I wouldn't doubt it.
>> ARTICLE
This anime gets me pumped up for stuff
>> ARTICLE
GOOOOOOSEBUMPS!!!
>> ARTICLE
The metaphor sequence where the hand grabs the Seijoh universe -- god damn. That one single sound effect when the hands grabs, goosebumps.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing lacking for this series is that  Karasuno doesn't have a catchy cheer going for them like Seijoh... Anyways, Karusuno... FIGHT!
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, was screeching in excitement for the last 20 seconds of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Cant wait to see those final few points next week
>> ARTICLE
The one handed toss to Hinata was just awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
I was on the edge of my seat for the entire episode. I swear this is almost TTGL level of excitement. God i love this series.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was intense with both teams not budging an inch but next week is going to be freaking epic.
>> ARTICLE
Everything about this show gets me pumped up. This was my introduction to sports anime and legit had me on the edge of my seat the entire ride! Super stoked for the second season! LET'S GET READY FOR SOME VOLLEYBALLLLLLLLL (   )
>> ARTICLE
If you're new to sports anime and want some more sweet sweaty anime goodyness, I recommend Hajime no Ippo for that edge of your seat hype.

And for something more calm but endearing Yowamushi Pedal and Baby Steps are two great shows.
>> ARTICLE
These are all already on my PTW list. Unfortunately, it's a rather long list, so I'll get to them eventually XD

I thought I would never like sports anime, but things like Kuroko no Basuke, Chihayafuru, Hajime no Ippo, Major and lastly Haikyuu changed my perspective.

Haikyuu being the best one of them all. I seriously love this series.
>> ARTICLE
You should try watching Diamond no Ace! It's not as good as Haikyuu I think, because Haikyuu's animation and soundtrack really blow it out of the water, but part of what is great about Haikyuu is the *characters*. and God damn I love the daiya characters and their relationships with one another <3 it is long though, but!!
(*haikyuu still holds the number 1 spot in my heart though, it was the first sports anime I watched!*)
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is also great and you should check it out
>> ARTICLE
As a sports anime veteran, may I also suggest Ookiku Furikabutte? It's got a very similar feeling to Haikyuu in a lot of ways imo, and I love them both dearly. 
>> ARTICLE
thank you, will watch!:)

>> ARTICLE
Completely forgot that this re-watch started today, this is one I've been looking forward to. Haven't watched much for sports anime, but volleyball is one of my favorite sports to play casually, so I've been meaning to check Haikyuu out. First episode did a good set-up job, looking forward to continuing this one!
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know there was a rewatch scheduled.  Watching it for the first time now (on episode 15).  So see ya'll in 10 days!

Episode 1 thoughts: So sad Hinata couldn't do much in his first match after trying to get a team started for all of Junior High
>> ARTICLE
I got excited and didn't see the rewatch label. :(

I can't wait for the next season!
>> ARTICLE
Never watched a sports anime before but I've heard great things about this one. I think how this rewatch is scheduled is perfect. One episode a day feels way too slow, but two a day is hard to keep up with if you're watching currently airing shows, I like the mix.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know this was scheduled and coincidentally started rewatching yesterday. 

Anyway, I was bored and started making gifs while rewatching, so I will post an album some time before S2 starts.

One of my favorite shows and I hope the people who watch it for the first time will enjoy it just as much.

It's sad that sports anime in general don't get a lot of attention, they seem to have some of the most relatable character/moments in all of anime.

I've been waiting for an excuse to pick this show back up after dropping it for no reason way back and this rewatch is just the excuse I was looking for.  

Onto the actual episode, which was fantastic, some really cool scenes in this one, that first spike was done brilliantly, specially the music which really pumps you up, the animation is fast during the match but never feels outlandish.

 I already know fair bit about the characters so I'm not gonna comment because I don't want to spoil anything for first time viewers. Overall really good first episode on all fronts.

>> ARTICLE
yey rewatch! :) TBH, I was never a fan of volleyball but after watching this anime. I have a learned a lot of how the game plays, the important roles each player plays and basically appreciate volleyball in general. I am super excited for Season 2. :)

Anyway, Haikyuu episode 1 is definitely one of my favorite episodes of the series. I love the extra adding they did on Kageyama's kingly aura. It sets up perfectly on the Hinata and Kageyama difference from the start.

I love Haikyuu! I've never really liked volleyball in middleschool ^^^becauseiwasscaredoftheball After watching Haikyuu I've come to like volleyball a lot more and am now on my school's team! 

This rewatch was exactly what I needed to get hype for the second season. I've always loved how they made Kageyama look as the ["king"](https://i.gyazo.com/25810ad4f8873a8b9479827e84e72ed1.png). I also thought it was super motivating at the [end](https://i.gyazo.com/1294ea57867e8b33699b0762e903f69a.png) [as](https://i.gyazo.com/c288d33661a2ae48f1792ec33fe5d870.png) [well](https://i.gyazo.com/39c26035584bcf74e0b0f6874e192b5f.png). The end was hilarious as well, the ED is dope too looking back at it.

Guysss I love this anime so much. SO MUCH. Hinata is just such positive character. And I have never watched an anime that made me want to go running/work out like Haikyuu!! does. I listen to the soundtrack and OP/EDs and just run for like hours^orminutes 
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time I've participating this and first time watching this show also. I gotta say that I'm really impressed! The introduction of the characters are really nice and I really enjoyed the whole soundtrack (especially the ED song). Looking forward to the next episode tomorrow:)
>> ARTICLE
I knew there was a rewatch but didn't think I would be able to catch it. I can't wait for season 2!! [Who can say no to this face](http://i.imgur.com/WZZ0eDO.png). [spoilers for character names I guess?] (/s "Tanaka") for best sempai(http://i.imgur.com/cXddijh.png) I love the [intense kind of scary face](http://i.imgur.com/TF10QP5.png) as the author of the manga used to do a horror manga called Kiben Gakuha, Yotsuya Senpai no Kaidan so creepy faces keep popping up
>> ARTICLE
Damn, just started Haikyuu!! a few days ago, wasn't aware of the Rewatch. I'm at episode 15 right now, but it is literally impossible for me to wait for you guys xD. Have fun and get HYPED.
>> ARTICLE
This is the First Sports anime I've watched and it seems quite interesting, hope it lives up to what everyone says about it.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching this, and I have to say so far I really enjoyed the first episode at least.  I have not really watched much sports anime, in fact the only other one I have watched is Free if you include swimming as a sport, lol, but I actually enjoyed it too.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished rewatching this episode! It's nice noticing different things the second time around. When you're watching for the first time you're still getting accustomed to all the new characters vs second time around i'm just screaming "MY PRECIOUS SONS" the entire episode 
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GOSH SAME. Precious baby Hinata and trash baby Kageyama.
>> ARTICLE
Considering how this anime goes throughout the season, I don't think they could have made a better first episode to grab the viewers attention. I was seriously impressed the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
Already seen the first half of this series but it's still so sad seeing happy little Hinata losing the game when he had worked so hard and kept up a good attitude even when his team wasn't good enough. :( 
>> ARTICLE
This is definitely one of my favorite shows. I absolutely love the amount of heart in it, even from the very first episode. Plus, the soundtrack is wonderful. Absolutely love the fact that the view from the top plays as Hinata arrives at Karasuno.

Can't wait to watch episode 2 tomorrow!
>> ARTICLE
Actually am ten episodes in after deciding to watch it when my friend said he would watch Terror in Resonance if I watch this.

For everyone who is looking for something like Ping Pong, this show isn't that similar. I still love it, but for different reasons. This show is more hype, and has some "anime-y" things (ex. chibi outbursts). Ping Pong is more realistic and thoughtful.
>> ARTICLE
I just rewatched this two weeks ago :( If I knew I wouldve joined you guys.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't wait and rewatched it a few days ago :(

I'm on the verge of watching it a third time though haha Such a good anime. Instantly became one of my favorites when I first saw it. Hinata is one of my favorite characters ever. He is just so lovable, my god. Everyone in this anime is tbh

The first episode is amazing, from beginning to end. I want to advice everyone watching it for the first time to pay attention to the soundtrack. It's outstanding. I used to listen it everyday (now I do it just a few times each week)
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching this, I was literally thinking about watching it during school then I saw this rewatch thread and decided now is the best time.  

First Impressions: It seems promising to me. It's not my intro sports anime(Kuroko No Basuke was), but KnB got me interested in sports anime, so I thought I'd try this out since it's second season is coming.
>> ARTICLE
Well, this will not only be my first time through Haikyuu, but also my first sports anime that isn't Ping Pong.

First episode seemed pretty good! It started a little slowly, but I started getting pretty into it toward the end. Look forward to watching this with you guys!
