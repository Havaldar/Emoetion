Quick explanation on what's going on with the differences between Episode 23 original and Episode 23 B (Divergence): [](/s "So after Okabe accidentally stabs Kurisu, he and Suzuha go back to Daru and Mayuri and he feels terrible and refuses to use the time machine again. In the normal version, Mayuri slaps him and gives him a pep talk and then Suzuha tells him to watch that video he recently received from future Okabe. This motivates him to use the time machine again and save the day. In the S;G zero version (the one we're waiting on), there is no future Okabe to make that video so he doesn't receive a video from the future. He goes on being miserable until he figures out how he can go back and save Kurisu and he eventually becomes future Okabe who, after 15 years, builds the time machine and sends the video back to present Okabe.")


>> ARTICLE
I understand this but why would Mayuri not slap him the first time then slap him the second time if everything was exactly the same?
>> ARTICLE
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey, stuff.
>> ARTICLE
It's not exactly the same. [](/s "This worldline is similar but still different from the Steins;Gate worldline because there's no video. Without the video you have a desperate Suzuha who has no other way to convince Okabe to time travel so she ends up trying to slap Okabe before Mayuri can think of doing the same. Since Suzuha is seemingly forcing Okabe into being miserable through time travel, Mayuri's desire to protect Okabe comes before she can think of slapping some sense back into him.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Why is there no video though? Surely future Okabe still exists to send it? Otherwise, who built the time machine? Unless the time machine has the ability to jump across world lines (was never too clear on that), it wouldn't exist if no future Okabe exists in that world line. And if it does, doesn't it stand to reason that it's depriving an Okabe in a different world line of the ability to go back? Or does it not matter? The only other possibility I could see would be a future Okabe that builds the time machine but doesn't make the video, which seems odd to me. This timey wimey nonsense is confusing.")
>> ARTICLE
had to go back and watch a little of the series to answer this properly.

But I think that that future okabe the one your talking about (not Zero Okabe) was from a timeline where Cristina died by her father and not by okabe.  So it stands to reason why he didnt have a video ready to send to his past self as to  him it didn't happen.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think we were ever shown such a world line.  Even in episode 1 we hear Okabe scream in anguish, and Kurisu in episode 1 had already met post-Alpha attractor field Okabe, which is what caused her to pull pre-Alpha Okabe out of the lecture.  
>> ARTICLE
Remember that this is a worldline where WWIII happens due to the time travel arms race.  This time machine was built in an effort to prevent WWIII.  The video was likely sent through D-Mail completely separately, so the time traveling machine and the time traveling video don't need to coexist.  

Episode 23 happens on a worldline where Okabe kills Kurisu and then obsessively finds a way to prevent that from happening without moving to the Alpha attractor field.  Episode 23 happens on a worldline where Okabe receives a video D-mail from a future Okabe, providing the means for him to break away to the Steins;Gate worldline.

It only makes sense because of attractor field theory.  Both worldlines, while divergent in ways that seem significant to the viewers, ultimately lead to the same future where time travel machines are invented and WWIII happens.  It's only in the events after episode 23 that a path to an unknown future opens up.
>> ARTICLE
I guess the biggest part I'm hung up on then, is whether the fact Okabe received the D-Mail in episode 1 is non-canon in the 23 worldine? Assuming that is the case, how did that Okabe end up in such a world line where he didn't receive a D-Mail from his future self? Are we just supposed to accept that's a world line that exists for some reason? If so, how? According to [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/QcVN6eR.jpg) I found some time ago, in all the beta worldines, Okabe sent the D-Mail back from the future. Any thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "The time machine exists in this worldline because Kurisu's father stole her research materials after Okabe accidentally kills her. Russia ends up building a time machine (causing WWIII) so now Okabe tries to build one too so Suzuha can help him save Kurisu. No video exists in the other wordline because Okabe had given up on trying to save her.") I hope this helps, I'm not sure if that answers your question or not.
>> ARTICLE
He can't change "his" worldline. What he can do is change the others. But once something happens and he sees it it is set in stone for **that** worldline. So he can't send the video to himself in his worldine because paradox. But he can send it to his other selves in other worldines whose worldines can be changed.

**I THINK**
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how S;G0 will end. Hopefully it will be like that one doujin where [](/s "after sending the video, he shifts to the S;G worldline at the same age he is in the video. In the S;G worldline that would be a couple years after the end of episode 24, where he's probably married to Kurisu and all his friends/family are there.")

>> ARTICLE
A happy ending would be great! Though I doubt it'll happen, there'll always be the original ending to jump back to and console ourselves :)
>> ARTICLE
Source on this doujin?
>> ARTICLE
It's like 3/5ths hardcore hentai, but it's called Forget Me Not.

There was... That much plot in a hentai doujin?
>> ARTICLE
[In the Alpha worldline,](/s "Okabe becomes the leader of the Resistance (he has no choice in the matter), while Kurisu is forced to develop a time machine for SERN. Okabe is killed in 2025, and never sees Kurisu after he escapes from SERN captivity in 2011, and Kurisu is executed sometime between 2034 and 2036.")

No, what's more likely [is that](/s "The end of Steins;Gate Zero (at least the anime ending) is that Okabe sends the video mail and the events of the True Ending happen.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait, what? So all the work Okabe put to get the True End was [](/s "useless? :( Or is Alpha another timeline from True end/Steins Gate one? Grrr, i need a rewatch.") 
>> ARTICLE
So basically [the source material for Zero,](/s "the Epigraph Trilogy, is a series of three light novels that take place in the worldline where Okabe failed to save Kurisu (but after Suzuha arrived from 2036 in the Beta worldline), but does not receive the video mail from his future self that inspires him to try again.")

(Zero takes place on the Beta worldline)

[As a result of his traumatic experiences,](/s "Okabe gets PTSD, but ends up helping the researchers that Kurisu was working with to create Amadeus, an artificial intelligence based off of Kurisu. Eventually, the time limit for travelling back to July 28th, 2010 passes by due to lack of fuel for Suzuha's C204 Time Machine, but eventually Okabe regains the passion that he needed, and becomes a time travel researcher after World War Three starts because of the Nakabachi Paper (being Kurisu's thesis).")

[He then](/s "devises the way to save both Mayuri and Kurisu, and creates the video mail, sending it to himself on July 28th, 2010 but dies shortly after defending Mayuri from robbers.")

The rest is as it happens in the True Ending. In a sense, the entirety of Steins;Gate Zero takes place in the [seconds between](/s  "Okabe returning from failing to save Kurisu, and viewing the video mail.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm 23 days too late, or I would have explained that. Anyway, just a small reminder that THE HYPE IS REAL.
>> ARTICLE
How come Okabe got sent the video in episode 1 then? I know it wasn't playable for whatever reason (can't remember if that was explained) but beta Okabe couldn't have sent that to himself, right?
>> ARTICLE
So basically the difference between Divergence and S;G0 is that [](/s "In Divergence he I guess kind of gets over her(?) and in S;G 0 he doesn't? Does WW3 happen in both of these timelines?")

[Also..](/s "Why is there no future Okabe in S;G0?")

It's been ages since I watched Steins;Gate so I'm kind of lost.
>> ARTICLE
The main difference in S;G and S;G0 is [](/s "Okabe tries to move on from accidentally killing Kurisu instead of going back again and saving her. Mainly because there's no video from future Okabe to motivate him to go back and trick himself into thinking she's dead. The lack of video is really the key between the two timelines. Also WWIII happens in the S;G0 worldline but not the one where Kurisu lives.")

I phrased that awkwardly in my original post. There is a future Okabe but the one that sends the video doesn't exist yet [](/s "that's what S;G 0 is about. How our Okabe becomes the future Okabe who creates the video to send to his past self.")

I think I got it. Hopefully.

novikov principle of time travel, self consistency.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle

"According to the consistency conjecture, any complex interpersonal interactions must work themselves out self-consistently so that there is no paradox. That is the resolution. This means, if taken literally, that if time machines exist, there can be no free will. You cannot will yourself to kill your younger self if you travel back in time. You can coexist, take yourself out for a beer, celebrate your birthday together, but somehow circumstances will dictate that you cannot behave in a way that leads to a paradox in time. Novikov supports this point of view with another argument: physics already restricts your free will every day. You may will yourself to fly or to walk through a concrete wall, but gravity and condensed-matter physics dictate that you cannot. Why, Novikov asks, is the consistency restriction placed on a time traveler any different?[9]" *from the wikipedia article.

What this means is that, in every version of the story this always happens, okabe is in a closed loop which always ends the same way - every move he makes are "stepping stones" towards the eventual conclusion which to us is the "final timeline"

"In trying to alter your future, you end up fulfilling your role in creating it in short."

 I strongly believe that Steins;gate operates under this assumption for time travel.

Oher movies, or shows that do the same is probably most notably 12 Monkeys.
>> ARTICLE
Not quite.  Steins;Gate avoids paradoxes through a similar setup as the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) in that divergence in events simply leads to a different world line.  There *are* similarities since Steins;Gate's attractor field theory does force *con*vergence of all world lines at certain important points of history, but that only affects people tied to those events.

For example:  Mayuri's death in the Alpha attractor field and Kurisu's in the Beta are strongly tied to the development of time travel, so there was no way to avoid those deaths within any worldlines on those attractor fields.  But Faris's dad is actually saved through a D-mail, an event that caused massive changes in the worldline that act moved Okabe to.  Because he wasn't important to the Alpha attractor field's convergence event, his death or life is mutable through time travel.

So do I get this right? [](/s "There is literally only a single timeline where okabe doesn't receive the future video so Kurisu ends up dying and he ends up making the original video? I assume that the Okabe we see in the original ep 23 (not the future self) will just make the same video to send to his past self since he already saved Kurisu so does that mean that only one Okabe gets the suffering we are going to see in SG:0? Hope that made sense it's kinda difficulty to explain my thoughts when everyone I'm reffering to is the same person :P ")  (People downvoting because I'm no expert in time travel and decided to ask a question)
>> ARTICLE
(I'm not gonna spoiler tag because nobody should be reading this who hasn't seen the original series or this episode)

No, your time travel theory is different than what's used in the show, which is the different world line theory. The Okabe who lives after episode 24 (Steins Gate world line) doesn't have to send a video back to his past self. The Okabe who has to send the message back is the one who failed to save Kurisu (Beta world line), so the one who we see in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
That's a bit odd though. I thought that time paradoxes were prevented in Steins;gate due to attractor field convergence. Meaning, it's less "Suzuha went back in time in 2025". It's more similar to "Suzuha appears in 2010". It's kind of like a reversal of cause and effect. Because of this, there is no "Okabe sends a video back in time." Okabe only receives it, because that's what was supposed to happen along the timeline.
>> ARTICLE
Ehm you're right, it's been a few years since I've watched the show so I don't remember the small details about how time travel works there. But still that detail wasn't my main point, what I wanted to know mostly is [](/s "the part about the Okabe on beta world line being the only one who has to go through Kurisu's death which from what you've said I assume is correct anyway")
>> ARTICLE
All the Okabe's went through her death, it's just that because  Okabe made the video on the phone, the  Okabe(and i assume others maybe) went back a second time and were able to save Kurisu. 

Beta is the only version that did not go back.
>> ARTICLE
Yes obviously, I meant went through her actual death where she doesn't get saved later.
>> ARTICLE
So all the Okabe's experienced her death but then all EXCEPT the beta Okabe went back to save her a second time which gave us the ending of Steins; Gate. However this episode was showing where that single beta timeline Okabe didn't go back to save her a second time because he didn't have a video from future Okabe, that correct?

Also any particular reason he didn't get the video from his future self? Or is it just because he's the unlucky soul who has to be the one to deal with WW3 and send the video back?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, this okabe, "Beta Okabe" since he lives through the beta worldline, is the unlucky one who has to deal with ww3 and make the video.
>> ARTICLE
It's been like 3 years since I watched this shit; how does this Beta Okabe send stuff to Alpha Okabe? Is d-mail allowed to go across worldline boundaries? Or more logically the creation of d-mail cause a split in world lines? Ulgh, I might need to re-read the recap
>> ARTICLE
Creation of D mail creates a split in world lines, as does sending of each individual d-man
>> ARTICLE
You might want to replay/watch the VN/anime. I'm doing just that now as I wait for English translations.
>> ARTICLE
~~It's been a year for me, I have no idea where this episode came from.~~

Never mind, HOLY SHIT
>> ARTICLE
The d-mails literally creates alternate timelines. The logic of this universe is always the same, and it only follows one rule. When something is changed in the past, that change creates an alternate timeline. Every single d-mail and time-leap create an alternate universe, one where the change happened, and one where it did not.

He's not sending the d-mails to an alternate universe. He's sending it to the past in his own world line, to create a world line where he doesn't make the same mistakes he did before.

There's a lot of inconsistencies though, all of which bother me quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I always found it depressing to think that when Okabe in this timeline from S;G 0 sends the D-Mail to Okabe in the original series, then Okabe in S;G 0 would have his consciousness move over and overwrite the consciousness of Okabe in the Steins Gate worldline.

That's what happens every time a D-Mail is sent.
>> ARTICLE
What? No, that's the time leap, not the d-mail.
>> ARTICLE
Whenever Okabe sends a D-mail, what is happening is he's sending instructions to the past for himself to follow. If his past self that he sends it to both follows the instructions and the effects are 'significant' then Reading Steiner activates and Okabe switches timelines. The Okabe that receives the D-mail gets his memories overwritten by the Okabe that sent the D-Mail.

That's the same thing that's happening with the video D-Mail. Okabe of S;G 0 in 2025 sends Okabe of the original series a D-Mail which is video form, but it is still a D-Mail. Okabe of the original series then follows the instructions in the D-Mail which causes himself to shift onto the Steins Gate worldline (1.048596).

The idea is that Okabe of the original series will live happily on the Steins Gate worldline until 2025 when the Okabe from the S;G 0 timeline switches over and overwrites S;G Okabe's memories.

This is what happened every other time a D-Mail is sent, so there is no reason why it would be different just because a different Okabe is sending the D-Mail.
>> ARTICLE
The Okabe that receives the D-Mail doesn't get his memories overwritten because those memories haven't been formed yet. The Okabe that received the D-Mail video message doesn't know what the future holds other than what he was told in the D-Mail. 

The future Okabe's memories will be overwritten when current Okabe receives the D-Mail since that message will change the events that led to him dying in the first place (whatever that may be).  Future Okabe probably remembers events up to his death in 2025 because of his Reading Steiner but wakes up in 2036 (when the D-Mail is actually sent) with no knowledge of what happens between 2025 and 2036 in any timeline or what happens to Steins Gate Okabe from 2010 to 2036.

[I created a short paint sketch of what I'm talking about here.](http://i.imgur.com/NlPlinT.png)
>> ARTICLE
One of the main theories is that, since 0kabe knew he was destined to die in 2025 and that the time machine wouldn't be ready until 2036, he had his video D Mail automated to send after he died, so there'd be no consciousness to overwrite the SGWL Okabe.
>> ARTICLE
I like this idea. There are a few other ideas I thought could also work, like that Okabe has a lot of time to work out how to make it not happen, so spends some of his time researching that, or maybe he just loses the power of Reading Steiner. Either way, works of fiction spawning theories is always a good thing!

First I don't know why everyone is spoiler tagging here, If you don't want to be spoiled you don't go into a discussion thread with "Spoiler" in the title, also since it says Episode 23, Nobody who hasn't watched it and plans to should enter here either.

If you're talking about the time machine in this specific episode, then it was probably the same as the one in the original episode 23, Okabe + Daru. And there is a future Okabe, the Okabe we see here is the one who made the time machine with Daru, the Okabe in the ominous video **should** be the one who appeared here, since he already had failed once like him just now

Something that doesn't add up to me that much is that since this Okabe is the one from the future and we basically see the key difference in both episodes, After he comes back the first time in one episode he gets slapped by Mayuri and watches the ominous video, in the other that doesn't happen at all, Because of that it's kinda safe to assume that the Suzu from this episode didn't have any idea about any video at all (Doesn't mention it at all) meaning there was no such deep plan to begin with, which then doesn't make sense since the future Okabe from the original series failed **once** and made this plan based on that failure just like the one here should be doing, but there is no video since Suzuha just gives up too easily (If there was some sort of plan to make him fail once on purpose you'd imagine that she'd do more than try to slap him once to convince him).

A very simple explanation for the incoherences in this is that, both episodes are just slightly different world lines, now, what triggered that? I personally think that the Okabe from this episode, after going through whatever S;G 0 is about, he then sends a "D-mail" probably a "2.0" version of it since he sends a video to the past (heavy file?) to when episode 1 happened and that triggered the slight change in world-line, and then from there they sent Suzuha to the past with the plan in mind. 
Although all that I said is nothing but my own assumptions and guesses
>> ARTICLE
I think there's a difference between spoiling the contents of Episode 23 Beta, vs. spoilering other plot details of S;0.  Plus it never hurts to play it safe.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not like we can actually spoil details of S;0 since it hasn't even released, like most of what I said is nothing but speculation, even the VN itself releases in a week or so, I guess it does no harm to play it safe but whoever comes into this thread and gets spoiled of anything that can be spoiled like the original from the 25 episodes/movie/this episode it's for the most part their own fault
>> ARTICLE
There's source manga (*Epigraph* Trilogy) that S;0 is based on; so a lot of the spoiler comments aren't just speculation.

I'm not saying that you needed to spoiler any of your post if it is speculation; but you asked "why is everyones spoiler tagging", and that's why.
>> ARTICLE
There's kind of 3 versions of the guy.

1. Okabe who was ignorant, witnessed SERN dystopia, died, Daru or Kurisu or some combination thereof finished the time machine.  Suzu goes back in FG-204.  We've basically never met this Okabe (maybe the first half of ep 1?) but we did meet that Suzu (who can't recognize her dad) and experience other bits of fallout over eps 1-22.
2. Okabe who met #1's Suzu, sent a bunch of d-mails, went to save Kurisu, failed, witnessed WW3, [speculation](/s "and finally, sent himself a d-mail when he finished the time machine C-204").  Suzu goes back in C-204, calls her dad on the phone, etc.  This is the post-credits of 22, 23 beta and s;g zero.
3. Okabe who met #2's Suzu, sent a bunch of d-mails, went to save Kurisu, failed, got a d-mail, tried again, reached Steins;Gate.  This is seen in the post credits of 22, ep 23 and 24.

Actually, the naming of the time machine in ep 23-Beta isn't certain.  It might not be C-204 because I think it's mentioned in the d-mail that Okabe hasn't seen.

Would make sense if it was C-204, since he probably would [spoilers](/s "name it after Kurisu, AKA Christina")

>> ARTICLE
>I love how he ditched the lab coat and the Hououin Kyouma persona as shown afterwards when he's talking on the phone

But he didn't!

Hououin Kyouma is a personality he created to help save Mayuri from her depression after her grandmother died. She doesn't need a mad scientist to hold her hostage any more, not after his breakdown; she needs to see happy Okarin. So he plays that role for her in the park. The moment he turns away, as she's waving goodbye, he's having flashbacks to all the times she died and we see that the more mature blend of Okabe and Hououin that he became during the time loop still exists, the mad scientist broken by his continual failures to save his friend and then to find a way to save the woman he fell in love with. And that after credits scene... Hououin still exists. Hououin, not Okarin, invented a time machine by accident, and now he will do it again intentionally in order to reach the Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
*chills*
>> ARTICLE
See, I read it a little differently, and I'm glad to read this because I think there's so much nuance here.

I read it as his PTSD making him try to throw away the things that had hurt him before - his "mad science" and work with the lab led him to the talk which led him to kill Kurisu, so he has to take off the jacket and leave them behind and pretend to live another life in order to move on beyond it, because clearly it's hopeless. (There's such a visual contrast to it too, which I think is a great reminder that "this is not Okabe as you know him".)

But seeing Kurisu again, even in Amadeus, gives him the hope to pick those pieces back up, and thus Hououin Kyouma must be called upon again.
>> ARTICLE
He appears to still be wearing a lab coat, it's just black. I figured he changed that to show he's in mourning for Kurisu. Still a lab coat, though, because for him that's the only thing to wear (his first act after inducting Kurisu to the lab was giving her a lab coat) and as a reminder of who he is and what he's been through. I don't think he left the crazy mad scientist behind, he's just downplaying it for a bit to pretend to Mayuri and maybe himself that he's okay. I do agree that seeing Amadeus clearly shocked him straight back into Hououin though, that was fantastic to see.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely brilliant. I am so hyped for this series.

The PTSD scene gave me legit chills, and that was some superb voice-acting. 

0kabe is quite different from Okabe as we can see after he recovers past the summer and is in college, will be interesting to see how he progresses through the Beta timeline until the eventuality that is of sending the video message for Okabe to reach S;G.

Kurisu as an AI in the post-credit scene too! This was the project she was working on at her university that involved the backup of memories, the technology used in the Time Leap Machine.

The Amadeus technology also shows up in Robotics;Notes, and was indeed already in existence around 2010.

Remind me what Amadeus did in R;N? I probably should rewatch all of Science Adventures, but anime watching time is precious nowadays for me and Gundam IBO is sucking up a lot of it in the best way possible. 

God, that image of 0kabe in the dark, staring blankly at the ceiling, so close yet so far to things that matter to him (the panda plush, the mad scientist coat), hearing nothing but his regrets. I literally gasped, paused, and went "oh my god, that's what depression looks like".

I think the worst part of that scene was that he was so close to her spatially, but not temporally.

I like the 0kabe nickname - it seems like the kind of thing that'll end up becoming standard.

The PTSD scene was the most authentic scene depicting mental illness I've seen since NGE. It was absolutely chilling and perfect.

I'm really excited to see super depressed Okabe and how different he is from our loveable Hououin Kyouma. The few minutes we saw of him pretending to be happy for Mayuri really made me miss old Okabe so I can't imagine how I'll feel by the end of this.

The concept of Zero is absolutely fascinating, and a retelling of episode 23 is exactly what I imagined the beginning of Zero to be. This was really great and I'm even more hyped for Zero now. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah,Steins gate is so damn amazing.I hope the sequel delievers ,and I'm sure it will
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying not to get too excited for it in case it doesn't meet my expectations.

Best way to put it, really. Freshly baked, with that new car smell.

0kabe goes to mixers. The Beta Attractor Field really does have the darkest world lines.

edit: On a more serious note, does anyone know if this episode is likely to ever be released physically? It's not an OVA/ONA, so what would it be classified as?
>> ARTICLE
As a "Special" most likely. I'd expect that if it's commercially available at all, it'll be as a BD extra to S;G:0 when it comes out.
>> ARTICLE
> The Beta Attractor Field really does have the darkest world lines.

I'll have to disagree, the Gamma Attractor Field is much more depressing for people who know the characters. Gamma!Okabe is just depressing to see.
>> ARTICLE
Is the Gamma world line the one from the [S;G VN](/s "Faris ending")?
>> ARTICLE
No, it only appears in the drama CDs. [S;G Drama CDs](/s "In the worldlines of the Gamma Attractor Field, Okabe works for SERN as the dictator of Japan after world-conquest and enslavement of humanity by the Committee of 300, and is known as Hououin Kyouma. Basically, Mayuri dies, Daru dies, Kurisu dies, Okabe is evil and the world is the dystopia from the Alpha Attractor Field.")
>> ARTICLE
Does that... make any more sense in context? i don't see it happening, especially to him.
>> ARTICLE
That's why it's only in the Drama CDs.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Gamma is definitely dark and hellish. But at least it doesn't have mixers. *shudders*
>> ARTICLE
This was every bit as amazing as I hoped it would be!

Before we get to the new stuff, I just gotta say, the part at the beginning of Episode 23 where Suzuha says her mission is to reach the Steins Gate never fails to give me goosebumps.

Watching Okabe come back from his attempt to save Kurisu [crying](http://i.imgur.com/8KbmRHk.jpg), wtih no video d-mail, is heartwrenching. His [PTSD](http://i.imgur.com/KgR6k2U.jpg) scenes following hurt just as much.

But most of all, the [forced smiles and general fake attitude](http://i.imgur.com/A5xOgBD.jpg) of Okabe as he decides discard Hououin Kyouma and try leading on a normal life is just so depressing to see. 

Cue the credits! [Now with a hidden](http://i.imgur.com/RxyBDvb.jpg) [silhouette](/s "Maho")! Can't wait to see her animated properly when Steins;Gate 0 airs.

That transition from [ED Kurisu](http://i.imgur.com/I5nZNdN.jpg) to [the ~~real~~](http://i.imgur.com/m0ZR0PG.jpg)... erm, [Amadeus Kurisu](http://i.imgur.com/QfGWftT.jpg) was way too good! [The expression of Okabe's face as he meets her...](http://i.imgur.com/xETb2E6.jpg) and as [he starts regaining his determination to fight!](http://i.imgur.com/JqotBFQ.jpg) Just perfect!

I'm so damn hyped for Steins;Gate 0, and this was the best way to "start" it. 
>> ARTICLE
the "now with Hidden X", Her identity might be spoilers so maybe block that part out.  I have no idea who that is. =P
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler tagged it since you asked, but don't worry about having read it, it wasn't really any spoilers!
>> ARTICLE
What I found really interesting about the episode was that, if I hadn't seen the end of the series, I'd totally be behind Mayuri 100%. Asking someone to go through more mentally scarring death just for an INCREDIBLY slim chance of changing things is a terrible idea no matter what is at stake.

...Of course, I have seen the end of the original series, so instead I was mentally screaming.
>> ARTICLE
The only reason we can't say that Mayuri indirectly caused WW3 is because, even if she had slapped 0kabe like in the original version, there was still no message from Future Okabe telling him *how* he could succeed.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, if you really want to, we can still blame her for WW3 because she absentmindedly dropped the metal Upa, which saved the paper for Dr. Nakabachi.
>> ARTICLE
But if we start diving down that rabbit-hole, Kurisu shouldn't've written the paper. Plus [*Epigraph*](/s " in the particular Beta world line that this story takes place in, it's not the metal Upa's fault. It's Moeka's.")

Come to think of it, once Steins;Gate 0 is out, you could probably have a friend watch the original show but swap out 23 for 23 beta. Then you could have them watch all of S;G 0 before finally getting their happy ending. 
>> ARTICLE
My friends have never seen Steins;Gate even after telling them several times to do so. Now I will make them watch it like this and they'll never know... ^^^^Muahahahaha
>> ARTICLE
That is exactly how I am going to rewatch it with my friends once all of S;G 0 is done airing
>> ARTICLE
This is how Okabe watched it >:D
>> ARTICLE
You son of a bitch. 

>> ARTICLE
Obviously we have to wait until the anime for *S;G0* is out, but I like the cut of your jib. This should totally go in the Watch Order wiki.
>> ARTICLE
It would make two generations of S;G fans: The Pre-Zeroes and Zeroes. It'd make for a totally different experience.

>> ARTICLE
it'll probably be the best way to watch it too. it makes that last episode feel much less cheap.
>> ARTICLE
S-so good... Holy shit, I thought nothing about Steins;Gate could rip my heart apart anymore, but I was so wrong... That fucking PTSD scene, and the lab coat on the floor... So well done... I also appreciated the subtle Maho.

The optimal way of doing things would have been to rewatch the entire series up to ep.22 and then this, but unfortunately I don't have enough time for that these days, and the void I would've felt after that would probably have killed me anyway.
>> ARTICLE
[Maho scene](http://i.imgur.com/Co7x8UP.png), for those that missed it.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what percentage of /r/anime peeps will know who Maho even is, at this point in time. I want to know this, because she's sure to win Best Girl 2017.
>> ARTICLE
I'd reckon a good majority. I doubt most watchers here have kept up with the S;G happenings in the last few months.

I was having some sick EP9 flashbacks near the "end", and damn that's some wicked PTSD.

You're talking about the fans right?

The sentence, the way he said it plus the ending music kicking in.

I haven't read anything about 0 or watched it yet, but i'm hyped like a mother fucker.

But a part of me doesn't want to watch it either.

You have to watch it. It is the choice of Steins;Gate!

[**S;G HYPE TIME**] (#icanteven)

I'm so excited to see how they pull this off! 

Also, I encourage everyone who is not afraid of spoiling the early part of the Epigraph story to check out [the manga](http://img.bato.to/forums/uploads/1f3eb6f0cab031d3e4e450bb12d23561.jpg)! You can read the translated chapters on Reading Steiner's blog. Just a warning, the manga switches artists and chapters had to be redrawn as well. I still recommend reading the initial version though, Tadasu's art is wonderful. :)
>> ARTICLE
watched it live ;)
>> ARTICLE
I watched the original episode 23 earlier today to prepare and the second the scene diverged in this beta episode, I noticed it and it was so satisfying. It's almost like rewatching a show and imagining it ending a different way...only this time it actually happened.

watched it pseudo-live ;)

[A WITCH!](https://youtu.be/k3jt5ibfRzw?t=35s)

*A Witch!!Burn Her!!*
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't been following the news for this at all and it's been quite a while since I watched the show, so this came pretty much as a complete surprise for me. I definitely was not prepared to go through this again but I absolutely loved it.  
I had goosebumps throughout the whole episode, just hearing the intro alone was enough to do that and I was really on edge the whole time, especially during the later part that was changed.

So, everything is the same up to the point where he doesn't go back a second time. The only thing that really changed is Mayuri's reaction where she doesn't get Okabe to go back a second time.

I have to say though, as much as I like the original one, I find this behaviour of Mayuri kind of better. Of course the old one is needed to save Kurisu and everything but this one seems like a bit like a more reasonable reaction than what originally happened.  
Then what came afterwards, especially Okabe's behaviour, was really well done in a heart-wrenching way.  
On the other hand, that post credits scene is very confusing to say the least. No idea what to say about it but at least it did look like Okabe might go back to his old self after seeing Kurisu again on tv.

Also, while I do miss the lab coat, [that new outfit suits him actually pretty well.](http://imgur.com/syIQjoD)

Overall, it was just great to watch Steins;Gate again.

Imagine if this was the last episode of the original version, our souls would be crushed into the void.

~~Wait, hang on, where did this episode come from?~~

~~I thought the anime was finished?~~

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD

I've been hearing this, but who is Amadeus?
>> ARTICLE
> who is Amadeus?

From what I gathered by reading various spoilers on this thread, [](/s "Amadeus is a system which scans memories and makes an AI out of them. The Kurisu we see at the end is just an AI who possesses the real Kurisu's memories")
>> ARTICLE
How the fuck does that work? [](/s "isn't she dead?")

Sorry for the profanities, this episode simultaneously makes both sense and no sense at all.

>> ARTICLE
Yes, She is dead, But [](/s "basically, she (and someone else, Dont really remember the name. You could read the spoilers yourself for her partner's name) made Amadeus before she met Okabe. That's why she (Or it, whichever one you prefer) said "Hajimemashite" to Okabe.")

[](/s "didn't know that technology was that advanced for the tech levels displayed in the anime")

Interesting. Thank you.

If they can find a way to make a time machine, I think they can make  an AI. You know, Just saying.

i didn't see your spoiler, but how can you (and the other people in this thread) know anything of S;G0 if the VN and the anime adaptation arent released yet.

Sorry maybe is a dumb question and i will get downvoted but i really dont know.
>> ARTICLE
As /u/ghostpants said, much of the VN is going to be based on the *Epigraph* trilogy and the Beta Drama CDs. Plus, a lot of details and "gameplay trailers" have been strategically released/leaked to increase hype in Japan, and our beloved fan translator ReadingSteiner has translated most of those.
>> ARTICLE
There's some [light novels and manga](http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Epigraph_of_the_Closed_Curve) that cover this

Like the title says, an alternate version of ep. 23 that switches into a different world-line.
>> ARTICLE
It is the replacement for Episode 23. This is the prologue for S;G 0, read ShaKings post.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any news about when the anime is coming? or if a english release of the VN is announced?
>> ARTICLE
No and no. 

I hopefully believe the *latest* S;G0 anime will be Winter 2017 (so 4 seasons time), but hoping for Summer or Fall 2016 - which lines up nicely with the beginning start dates of Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
I almost cried but then I remembered it's December already and that's 8-12 months and not ~24.
>> ARTICLE
What's this episode 23 beta? I read the gist of what happens in this episode but is this a teaser for something or what? Because this just came out of nowhere
>> ARTICLE
> to promote the upcoming Steins;Gate 0 VN release, they streamed an alternate version of episode 23 () that diverges into the 0 story line.
>> ARTICLE
I see so it diverges into the Okabe that sends the original video?
>> ARTICLE
Something like that. If I understood correctly the entire S;G 0 takes place before 24 since the 24 episode will be the conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I don't check the sub this much so I'm a bit clueless.
Is this just a one-episode thing or will there be more for the other eps in hype for S;G 0 (or as a matter of fact, have there been "divergence" eps already that I'm completely unaware of)? Thanks for the help in advance!
>> ARTICLE
I forgot how much I loved this series.
>> ARTICLE
So Okabe meets the Amadeus Kurisu at some random point afterwards? We can't tell at what point in time yet from the after-credits scene, can we?
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda just like a preview of what's to come, so nope.
>> ARTICLE
Ever since the twist from when the website teased Kurisu's death on her birthday back in July, I've been waiting for more 0 news. Totally didn't expect an actual alternate episode to tease it though!  

If the anime production crew is already working on things, we might see an adaptation sooner than we think next year!


>> ARTICLE
In confused here.  So is there just one alt. episode that is out, or will there be more episodes besides this alternative one?
>> ARTICLE
Just one alt episode. It's basically there to hype up the *S;G0* VN, which releases in Japan next week. The anime adaptation of that VN is coming, but no date has been set yet (Fall 2016 is a good estimate, though). So just one episode for now, but then a whole new series in a year.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, I actually like this outcome more than the original. 
>> ARTICLE
Well this isn't actually an alternative outcome =P both things happened so I'll just say that I liked both!
>> ARTICLE
Are you one of the plebians that prefers the episode 22 ending over the original too? :P
>> ARTICLE
[Maybe](#thoughtful "Yes")
>> ARTICLE
You should play the original VN. The despair there is 10x more, and some of the endings (and scenes that were cut) are just depression incarnate.
>> ARTICLE
I should, but unfortunately I take a long ass time to read VNs (I'm still stuck reading Grisaia). That and I'm super behind on reading LNs.
>> ARTICLE
If you get around playing steins gate you might want a guide because route choices are confusing
>> ARTICLE
I second this. It is almost impossible to get the true ending without help.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, even if you've seen the anime before its difficult because of how they implemented changing routes
>> ARTICLE
like that bit where [](/s "nae goes on a murder spree")

Yes

>> ARTICLE
[qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) is relativly good and you can use VLC to watch it. You should not need anything else. If you don't want to seed make sure to limit your upload speed to something close to 0.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching the episode, and yeah, it's what I fully expected it to be. A sort of mini-prequel to Steins;Gate 0. Although I'm a bit bummed that it didn't elaborate much on Okabe's future motivation to realize the Steins;Gate timeline, I guess that's because he apparently only gets the motivation to do so along the way, and not right after he [](/s "kills Kurisu.")

Really looking forward to the adaptation. I hoped we could get to play the VN, but since it's on consoles, it's gonna be hard to get a fan translation going since a localization doesn't seem to be a plan so far. A shame since the original VN was really very good.

Also, Okabe looks so dapper in black.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch the part after the credits?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It was more of a teaser than an elaboration though. And yes, I also know that the Kurisu there [](/s "is an AI.")

I am a wee bit sleep deprived, whats this then? Am I 23 episodes behind a new Steins;Gate beta timelines anime?

Min 18-23 - Oh ok, he's just a normal guy now, but nothing has really changed too much, I see.     
Min 24 - WHAT THE FUCK!? KURISU!? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!?
>> ARTICLE
It diverges when Suzu goes to slap him but Mayuri protects him, and also that this Okabe is the one who makes the video so he doesn't have a video to use to save Kurisu in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit yeah, so this is the version that lives till 2025 and helps the other out. Fuck, I can't wait till this is released in english, that's gonna be a while though :/
>> ARTICLE
my god, this episode (15 mins and on is were the split happens) its like a totally different anime. Okabe starts going to collage and stops wearing his ~~white~~ lab coat and starts wearing ~~black~~ formal cloths - to me this points towards the chaos/sad/evil world he now resides in, after giving up and going forward with world war 3... Also as I watched the episodes side by side, in the -normal/original- episode the future Okabe says things like -It must of been painful- but he only really seems to be in a painful state at the part when he killed her... But in the  episode we visually see Okabe go though a very painful state... -we already know this next part but- so the Okabe in the future who makes the video is the Okabe we follow  ---also a tid bit we see a screen/tv with Kurisu on it introducing herself, though it seems to be a pre-recorded thing from when she was alive... this tells me that this video is what rekindles Okabe's flame to save Kurisu
>> ARTICLE
Would a kind scholar be so kind as to explain this Amadeus System / Kurisu? Was this something she was working on and mentioned in the original anime run? My memory is fuzzy. Also, would we know why then this motivates him to make the tape or I guess that's what this anime will build up to explain?

HYPE IS [REAL](http://gfycat.com/HeavyQuaintHoiho).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Amadeus mentioned by name in the anime, but it's why Kurisu was famous as a scientist. Why Okabe calls her "the *published* Makise Kurisu" when he meets her, and why she was invited to give a lecture at Tokyo Electric University in the first place. The knowledge she had from Amadeus played into her development of the Time Leap Machine (sending memories).

As for the motivation, that's what *S;G0* will explore. He's going to start out depressed and disturbed, but eventually he'll find the key to saving the world as the Future Okabe from the normal episode 23.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch Robotics;Notes it gets mentioned as well, but Amadeus is an AI system Kurisu was working on, modeled on, well, her. She combined the underlying technology of Amadeus to scan memories with the Dmail system to transmit information back in time to create the Time Leap machine.

Can someone please enlighten me.

Why wasn't Okabe able to open the video file in the first episode?

Because he hadn't yet jumped to the world line that would allow him to. He needed to experience [](/s "Kurisu's death") to put him on that world line, since at the beginning of the series [](/s "Beta-world line Okabe") didn't yet exist.

Have you seen Railgun S?
>> ARTICLE
No I have not, What is it about?
>> ARTICLE
It's the adventures of an electrical esper (artificial mage) in some advanced city that is basically a bunch of schools/testing ground for espers.  It's another anime with feels, which is why I asked.

Railgun S is the second season but is mostly stand alone and much more interesting than the first season.  It also happens with the same characters/same place as the series a certain magical index, railgun S even covers an arc from index 1 but does it way better.
>> ARTICLE
Wait you said its stand alone, does that mean I can watch Railgun S and not have to have seen Railgun? I tried watching Railgun after index and got bored really fast so I dropped it. I keep hearing how good Railgun S was though.

I'd say it is "almost" stand alone.  The real thing railgun S lacks is a proper introduction for touma.  But since you've watched index, you've got that covered.  There will be some unfamiliar side characters (they may barely show up in index or not at all), but it's not a big deal.

It's railgun S episodes 1-16 that get praised, the episodes after that are filler.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent! I will start watching it then. I was under the impression the storyline took off from the first railgun. Thanks for the clarification. 
>> ARTICLE
What a coincidence! I just started watching this a few days ago, saw episode 1 and it was awesome. I've seen Index and Railgun season 1 like a year ago but I didn't know there was a season 2 til recently. Gonna start watching the rest probably today or tomorrow, been having a stomach bug the past few days so I haven't really felt like watching anything.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommendation! I think I'm going to start watching it. It sounds awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa me too, why had I never heard of this?
>> ARTICLE
Gonna paste this quick warning about watching order, to maximize feels.

>Please don't watch index 1 before railgun S.  Or at least don't watch index 1 episode 10 before railgun S, episodes 1-9 are fine.  No matter what people tell you, absolutely do not do that.  Otherwise, have fun.  You can probably start with railgun S, but it isn't totally standalone.

>Railgun S has a much higher quality plot than index and railgun season 1, so don't be turned off from it if you don't like them for whatever reason.  Just skip and watch railgun S.
>> ARTICLE
Watch this AMV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFzo_BhIVXQ

It has clips from both seasons of index and both seasons of railgun.

The best order to watch them in is:

* A Certain Magical Index Season 1

* A Certain Scientific Railgun Season 1

* A Certain Scientific Railgun S

* A Certain Magical Index II

* A Certain Magical Index: Endymion no Kiseki

Enjoy :) They are some of my favorite anime.


>> ARTICLE
where is Index-tan ?

wwwww!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for this :)
>> ARTICLE
Somewhere else in the thread they're recommending to watch Railgun S before Index 1. You've seen them all it seems. Why do you think differently?

As someone who's watching Railgun S now and hasn't seen Index, [Railgun S early episodes](/s "I was *freaking out* when the Misaka clone was first murdered brutally by Accelerator. I had no idea that was going to happen. Furthermore, it was one of hte worst deaths I've ever had to witness. Yes, I've seen worse deaths, but they've been in shows where that kind of thing is more expected. Here? It was completely out of place and unexpected.")

If I had seen Index this experience would have been ruined for me, I think.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend that you watch in the order:

* Railgun season 1
* Index season 1 ep 1-9(first 2 arcs)
* Railgun S(season 2)
* Rest of Index(this includes index 1, index 2, and movie)

This is coming from someone who watched the Raildex series in the proper release order. I regret watching Index before Railgun S; Index spoils Railgun S. By watching the show in chronological order, you should get the most out of the series.

If you get bored of Railgun/Index past the first few episodes, i would skip them and go straight to Railgun S([The only things that you need to know is that(not really spoilers because they tell you pretty quickly in index, but just to be safe)...](/s "Kamijou Touma's right hand has a power called imagine breaker that dispels/nullifies all supernatural phenomenon. Misaka Mikoto picks fights with Touma because his right hand nullifies her electrical power and she is frustrated that she can't defeat him.")). The Raildex series has a fair bit of slice of life that not everyone is into. Railgun S is good enough as a stand alone anime and is definitely worth watching(I personally put it in my top 3 next to steins;gate and code geass). 

On another note, the silent party arc isn't as good as the sister's arc(hardly anything is), but the ending is pretty damn epic. I felt like the plot wasn't anything amazing, but the ending really did it for me. I feel like Raildex is an anime that's all about the characters. I wouldn't mind watching a slice of life show that had all of the characters in it. The action and plot is just a bonus. The sister's arc in Railgun S is the only arc with an outstanding plot, but if you find yourself loving the charcters like i do, you should watch the whole series.

**TL;DR**

**DO NOT WATCH INDEX I EP. 10-14 BEFORE RAILGUN S. YOU WILL REGRET IT.**

The show is still amazing even if you've seen index before hand, but i definitely regret spoiling myself.

There is no sequel. There is an alternate world line based spinnoff dating game called "Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Darling", a non-canon 8-bit sort of sequel that connects to C;H a bunch called Steins;Gate: Henikuukan no Octet, and another VN that tells the same story as the original from the perspective of various lab members called Steins;Gate Senkei Ksoku no Phenogram. The stories in Phenogram as supposedly varying levels of canon, but everything else is non-canon

>> ARTICLE
Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of the game, if one likes the experience they got in S;G, then they should probably also play C;H, probably one of the best SFW VNs that I've played. Just the atmosphere of paranoia and distrust were so well created and maintained.

Just uhhh, stay away from the anime, that wasn't done so well.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I found the VN to only be marginally better than the anime, and actually worse in some respects because being in the MC's head meant you had to put up with a lot more of his crazy paranoid whining. Probably the worst VN I have played. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime was a clusterfuck. 
>> ARTICLE
Is the game actually worth it if you watched the show? Loved the show
>> ARTICLE
Yes. The VN expands on things and characters that wasn't gone over too much like Moeka and Feyris. Plus it's like every other VN so it has different routes and good and bad ends.
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
In the show, Okabe looks more normal that he does in the VN.  Like, I never got the whole chuunibyou thing from the anime, but its really apparent in the VN.  Plus, alternate endings because it's a VN, although to get them you will definitely need a walkthrough because you have to reply to silly text messages by choosing the right word to click on.

I really enjoyed the VN and played through every ending just to see how different they were.
>> ARTICLE
>Okabe looks more normal that he does in the VN

Really? For me it was the other way around. He was a super chuunibyou in the anime, but in the VN you got to hear what he actually thought about things and it made him seem much more normal, as well as much more intelligent.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, 100%. There are a few major reasons, and I'll do my best to list them out. 

1: First person rather than third person. You actually hear what Okabe thinks and feels rather than him occasionally sharing his real thoughts out loud. This might seem small, but it gives those moments when he is forced to be serious all the more impact. 

2: Depth. If you liked Steins;Gate for the science, you will absolutely love the VN. It goes way more in depth in almost every area you could want. And more importantly, it doesn't shy away from the more local things that were cut or loosely translated in the show. Since there is an in-game dictionary that covers all sorts of specific Japanese and fictional concepts, it really helps with immersion, since you actually get all of their references and such. 

3: Alternate endings. The anime covers the true ending of the VN (and by doing so it covers most of the Kurisu ending). However there are another 4 endings all of which are worth going for. Faris' ending in particular left me crying like a baby, especially since right after you go back and choose the true ending path. I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but basically you should do every single ending you can. There is one for Faris, Mayuri, Suzuha, Ruka, and Kurisu, not counting the true ending covered by the show. 

Seriously do it. I had never played a VN when I started it, and I had an absolutely amazing time with it. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the OVA. It made me cry tears of happiness. Steins;Gate is so fantastic!
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to watch the film, it has a definitive ending that ties up lose ends and leaves you completely satisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
I will!
>> ARTICLE
I thought the movie kinda unnecessarily complicated things... 
>> ARTICLE
I wish the movie was dubbed. I really want to watch it
>> ARTICLE
\>implying its unwatchable subbed
>> ARTICLE
Well I watched the series dubbed, so I'd just like a consistent experience. 
>> ARTICLE
I know where you're coming from since I feel the same usually. Luckily never had a problem with that for anime since a friend introduced me to them and just pointed me at the engsubs right away, but with other TV series that I started watching german that are originally english I'll usually continue in german unless a huge amount of jokes gets lost in translation. (South Park.)

That being said unless you happen to like the voice actors of the dubbed version a lot more than those of the original, it isn't too big of a deal to switch imo. It's weird at first, but you get used to it after a few minutes.

However, I have to say that I personally found the movie really underwhelming (marathoned through the series + OVA + Movie in the last 4 days), and I kind of wish I had just stopped after the OVA, which clarified the ending well enough imo.
>> ARTICLE
BY THE WAY ALTERNATIVE WORLD LINES ACTUALLY EXIST JUST WITHOUT ANYTHING THAT THINKS IN THEM (USUALLY)

The movie is a sequel to the story and a damn good one at that.
Make sure to puke more rainbows.
>> ARTICLE
I will :D. I have to report tomorrow after watching the movie.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought the movie was pretty meh. Maybe it was due to me having any hype for the show die off since its origin.

Edit: I can't spell.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the movie was incredibly unnecessary and only served as a way to provide Kurisu fanservice.

It wasn't bad but it left a lot to be desired.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. The romance during the anime and OVA was great. One of my favorite in any series.

But, at the end of the day, our favorite mad scientist had gone through hell. And Kurisu had not. This was always going to be a barrier between them.

He had memories of her that she did not. And it made her feel bad, that she did not feel as strongly as him.

Now that Kurisu has gone through her journey, and saved our mad scientist, it brought them 1000x closer than the two of them growing older together would have.

I consider the movie an irreplaceable part of the epic called Steins; Gate.
>> ARTICLE
The movie fails as a hard scifi about time travel. The series was extremely internally consistent about it's rules of time travel and how world lines worked, and the movie kinda just shat on that.

However from a character oriented perspective the movie was pretty fantastic. Particularly the point of the movie was [S;G movie spoilers] (/s "To have Kurisu experience a small taste of the trials that Okabe went through. Their relationship was kinda stalled in large part because Kurisu was still having trouble coming to terms with her feelings from other world lines, and had a hard time relating to Okabe's experiences. But the events of the movie allows her to look at things from Okabe's perspective a bit, and begin to understand him on a much deeper level. The movie allows the two characters to move forward with their relationship on a much more level playing field")

So depending on what you wanted out of the movie it could either be fantastic or a huge disappointment. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Since I went in just wanting to see the relationship develop between Okabe and Kurisu, it was perfect for me. I could ignore the holes in the plot and ignore some issues with it, but I can definitely see that the plot cannot compare to the original Steins; Gate's plot.

Reading this comments I'm surprised so many people like the movie. I thought it made the world line theory make no sense and even though it was nice and had a happy ending it didn't make up for the nonsensical plot. I would avoid watching the film if you seen the series and like the keep your brain on while watching things ignore this film, but if you can turn your brain off and enjoy the film for what it is go ahead. 
>> ARTICLE
The movie is good IF [Movie](/s "you take their explanation as meaning Okabe is fading in and out of existence, not into other world lines. The series only makes sense if there is only one active world line at a time, otherwise all the actions he took time travelling are ultimately useless. On the other hand, having Christina go through what he did was fantastic in the movie, and seeing her understand what he had to go through was somehow very satisfying.")

And I don't mean the ass this time, I mean the actual plot.
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't like it.  I disliked or felt no attachment almost every character, was bored up until episode 12, and even then several of the reveals were things myself and the person I was watching predicted two or three episodes in advance.  I almost dropped the anime.

The worst part was I hated Okabe.  He's an idiot.  Moreover, he does not react or act like a single real person would in almost any circumstance.  Why would you keep secret from your friends everything you're keeping secret.  Why would you keep altering the past despite *the consistently mounting evidence it's a horrible idea*?

The rudimentary and ultimately uninteresting take on time travel was kind of the final nail in the coffin for me.  Sending messages in the past is a great *idea* but it's really not used to a great effect in my opinion, and offers very little insight into the philosophical ramifications of altering the past that hasn't been trodden over time and time again in nearly every work of time travel since H. G. Wells wrote The Time Machine in 1895.

Hell, even compared to even entry level sci-fi like Stephen Baxter's *The Time Ships* the use of time travel was simply boring.  I would even go as far to say, compared to the Terminator series the use of time travel was uninteresting.  For a show that uses sending messages back in time as a central plot device this was a major problem for me.

In the end I felt more relief that I didn't have to watch Steins;Gate any more than sadness that there were no episodes left.  I was *severely* let down by this anime.  Given the constant, constant praise it got I was expecting something revolutionary in the sci-fi and time travel genres, but I just didn't get it.

I'm of course ready for the wave of downvotes for having the gall to *personally dislike* an anime on this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
I think you've just gone in to the show with the wrong expectations/heard things about the show that were wrong. From the very first scene the show is set up to be mostly lighthearted and fun. Okabe is introduced as a nutjob who has absolutely no idea what he is doing and his best friend Mayuri is an overly naive and happy person. From there when I was watching I knew that there was not going to be anything philosophical in this show, instead it would just be a nice thrill ride, which I personally believe they did well. If you go in expecting anything serious past a few characters possibly dying, you're not going to have fun. But I feel the creators of the show did everything they could to let their audience know it was only going to be a thrill ride and nothing more.

I actually hate the movie though because they tried to go away from what made the show great and instead focussed on the emotional side of things that ended up being boring.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you dislike the main character of an anime you're in for a bad time. Besides, it's nice to have an eccentric MC for once in anime. I for one thought he was a riot!
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I'm truthfully glad so many people people got such enjoyment out of the show.  I think the problem was my expectations were both at once too high and expecting the show to be very different than it was.

I feel the show, as much as I subjectively dislike it, didn't really do a whole lot I would consider *wrong*.  The internal lore was consistent, the characters (even though I didn't like them) exhibited growth and their personalities were maintained consistently as well.
>> ARTICLE
Ironically, what draws most people to Steins;Gate are the exact points that /u/WeaverGames touched on but, with opposite feelings. Most people who don't enjoy the series most often stress their distaste toward the first twelve episode which are almost entirely character development. Not so many of us are as enthusiastic about time travel as the aforementioned but, The focus of Steins Gate was closer to the psychological effects of time travel rather that unique forms of time travel. If most people we're put in the same situation as Okabe they would suffer similar levels of distress trying to save their friends. Steins;Gate isn't the pinnacle of time travel theory anime but, It is an emotional thriller about an average person reliving a tragedy to save his friends. Finishing the series got interested in the other material such as, Other settings like in Robotics;notes, and the manga & novels where one of them explores the arc of the Okabe that failed to stop the death of Makise or SERN from taking over the world.

TL;DR- If you don't like the characters you won't like Steins;Gate

For Madoka I highly recommend you watch the TV series rather than the movies.

The first two movies are essentially the same as the series but slightly worse.  The third movie I felt only cheapened and diminished the story and ending.  I do my best to pretend it doesn't exist, because it takes a character I love very much and develops them in a way I that while I understood it and it made sense I didn't like and couldn't accept.  It is still a great movie... but I am very conflicted.

Thank you!

I've owned it for a few months but i just began marathoning the show again yesterday, and im thinking of trying to get the two endings from the game i have yet to get.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished the series and am getting the movie now. I am so fucking impressed.
>> ARTICLE
I remember my friend telling me too watch this, I was rather skeptical at the time and I thought it looked kind of lame. I watched the first episode and just couldn't get into it, thought it was going to be like a School Days or Boku no Pico situation where people convince you to watch it. My internet went down after that and I had nothing to watch, started properly watching S;G and marathoned the whole series nearly. 
>> ARTICLE
If by like school days you mean a masterpiece then you are correct.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I just finished a rewatch over the weekend, or this thread would have me rewatching it again. Just so good, incredible rewatch value. Been through it like 8 times, and always pick of more stuff, especially with [a certain character](/s "part-time girl")
>> ARTICLE
There is an OVA after the series and after that there's also a movie

I saw the first episode and wasn't hooked, I'll give it another shot.

I've downloaded and watch the first two episodes of Steins:gates 3 times. For some reason I never kept going. Seems like I should.
>> ARTICLE
Where did you watch it? I'm trying to find places and sites where I can watch anime for free.
>> ARTICLE
Yup definitely one of my top 3 favorite anime, glad you enjoyed too! :) 
>> ARTICLE
PLEASE GO WATCH THE OVA AND MOVIE IMMEDIATELY OP. ITS SO WORTH
>> ARTICLE
This anime left me wanting more, and I found out Robotics;Notes and Chaos;Head took place in the same universe as Steins;Gate, so I watched Chaos;Head afterwards and it was horrible, so horrible that it took me 2 months to finish, that's how bad it was. Robotics;Notes I only watched 2 episodes of so I can't really say just yet. The Steins;Gate movie was great as well.
>> ARTICLE
El psy Kongroo! go watch the movie an the OVA both are pretty good too!

i want to play the VN but no time T_T
>> ARTICLE
thank you...makise my waifu
>> ARTICLE
i marathoned it in 1 day... which was today xD
>> ARTICLE
Where can I watch it? Netflix? Or some kind of website?
>> ARTICLE
I was recommended to watch Steins;Gate a year ago, I never got around to it and watched one episode every few weeks or whatever, then I just forced myself to watch episode 8 and 9, needless to say I was hooked and ended watching the rest of the episodes in the space of a day!
It was a beautiful series and i'm so glad I watched it. I need to watch the movie now ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is the only show that all of my anime-watching friends gave a 10/10 to.  We normally have a large variance in what we enjoy, but this is the one show that not only do we all like, but we all agree it's one of the best ever made.  I'd give it an 11/10 if I could.
>> ARTICLE
loved S;G ! it always had me interested literally just finished now , and moving on to the OVA and movie special since thats what every comment is telling me to do haha 

El. Psy. Congroo
>> ARTICLE
You made me start re-watching Steins;Gate again for the 4th or 5th time. THANK YOU SO MUCH! I just love this series so much and every time someone gets excited or say they love the series i just really want to re-watch it again and it never gets old! 

I'd hate to put a series on the top of a list but this series is as close as possible to my #1 favorite series. Still tied with a couple of others..

 Eden of the East, Hunter x Hunter, Hellsing Ultimate... Also Eureka Seven, Seto no Hanayome, Gungrave, Code Geass.. man i love these kinds of anime.

Anyway this is an old thread but i just wanted to throw this in^^
>> ARTICLE
THANK YOU! This comment made me feel really warm and happy inside :D. I love it when  someone watches this anime and they feel as good as I feel after watching it. It has the tied no.1 place for me as well.

I hope you will have a REALLY AWESOME TIME watching it for the 4th or 5th time :D I have to say that Steins;Gate made me cry the hardest
I have ever cried while watching anime.

Im about to commit suicide on this subreddit but I really did not enjoy SG. Got to episode 6 and left it. Found it slow and dull. 
>> ARTICLE
You should really consider watching to atleast episode 11 or 12 and then decide. The first episodes were ok but after that WOOOOSH and it got so much more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit it starts off badly, it's really a show that gathers things for the first third of the series, then starts actually do things with it about episode 8.
>> ARTICLE
Well, watch until ep 11 then.
>> ARTICLE
I humbly recommend you give it another 6, because after episode 12 the show becomes very hard to put down.
>> ARTICLE
Well im not a fan of the characters either. Maybe I can watch another 6.

>> ARTICLE
Well the movie kind of follows up on the ova, I mean it is not necessary but if you don't watch the ova first there might be some things that would confuse you. Mainly just the beginning with the party.
>> ARTICLE
Please convince me to watch this, I watched it as it was coming out and I dropped it midway through the series because I was just bored with everything. Nothing in it really interested me. I barely remember anything from what I watched.

I hear all these rave reviews, and that the second half gets better but srsly why the fuck does it take half a series for it to get good? I can take 1-3 bad episodes but the whole first half of the show just melted my head (in a bad way)
>> ARTICLE
After episode 12 it becomes whole lot more interesting like REALLY interesting. I think the first part makes the second half better because it develops the characters.

Honestly the second half will just blow minds.

>> ARTICLE
I've been wanting to watch Steins;Gate, but have not actually got around to doing it. Why should I take time and view this anime? Fans and viewers of Steins;Gate convince me!
>> ARTICLE
tl;dr - Big investment up front, but it pays off if you stick with it.

As people argued above, Steins;gate is extremely slow to start.  I was pretty bored for the first 2-4 episodes, and still wondered when the shoe would drop to get this anime all the way to 24 episodes.  The slow start is to attach you to the characters, and establish a connection to them.  It was boring, but it was necessary to lull you into a false sense of security and a leisurely pace.

Around episode 11 is when you hit a sudden twist, and at that point I didn't want to stop watching.  Suddenly, the story became very engrossing and left me wanting to find out what happens next.  That was the shoe dropping, the action/motive that the story had been lacking.  That's the part that people remember and love, as far as the story goes.  You can also see the visual novel mechanics, as you explore each female character's story while the overall story progresses.

The pacing for the ending was a little bit slower than I would have liked, and by that point you pretty much know how it's going to end, if you're familiar with story tropes.
>> ARTICLE
it will make you cry moats of tears and you will enjoy every moment of it.
>> ARTICLE
It was sad. But in a very frustrating, twisted kind of way.
>> ARTICLE
I will give it a go!
>> ARTICLE
A really funny protagonist, who pretty much parodies many anime MCs who take themselves way too seriously and have ridiculous names for moves, items, ideas.

And then at one point the show completely switches gears into a psychological thriller.

I just think it's a very enjoyable show overall.  You'll never know if you will like it until you give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's intelligent, yet fun, and unpredictable, yet coherent and well paced. A bit slow and "silly" at first, but after the first 6 introductory episodes or so, the atmosphere is altered dramatically, and you find it hard not to watch the next episode to find out what happens next. Plenty of twists, too, but they're all genuinely thought out and fit well into the story. It's one of those anime that manages to blend a wide variety of plot devices and elements, and it balances out just perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if it will still be an anime, or if it will be a live action drama?
>> ARTICLE
A live action drama... would be... so... amazing...
>> ARTICLE
anime
>> ARTICLE
They say it's after the "true" end of the series. Which is all well and good except... like... how? It sort of had a perfect ending. I don't see what they could do now.

Also does someone wanna translate "Fuka Ryoiki no Deja vu" ? :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to hear. The funimation dub is pretty good, I have to say, I love the script. I think for me the dubbed script is better mainly because of Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars and Back to the Future references that actually work very well, assuming those were added by the English script writers. I probably wouldn't get any of the Japanese refrences.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the dub of Steins;Gate yet

 . . . . .do they reference Kurisu's resemblance to Amy Pond?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I'm awful with Japanese names it usually takes me about 20 episodes to remember everyone's name and they've only released 12 episodes. Although, it is a very good dub. Funimation actually *gasp* brought in a new voice actor! And she's very good!
Tuturuu!
>> ARTICLE
Most of those references were in the original script. The phrase D-mail comes from Delorean-mail, which comes from "Back to the Mail" (I know...).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I though they'd been dolled up. I didn't think people in Japan were big fans of Star Trek or Doctor Who. But then again I suppose Western Culture is very popular outside of the west.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has only seen 12/24 episodes (there's not an English dub for the second season, and switching to sub halfway wouldn't feel right...) I want them to make an English version of the second season more lol.
>> ARTICLE
What? There is a dub for the second season as well. 
>> ARTICLE
You should never have touched the dub to begin with. While the translations are actually quite good (thank god), the voices are god awful. Aside from Ruka none of them fit their character, and some a just painful to listen to (Mayuri and Daru).
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Am I correct in hearing that the release is dub only?

Okabe's mad scientist laugh in the dub is nowhere near as epic as the original.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching the show @ episode 10... It felt so slow to me but i know everyone is saying it's amazing, does it pick up after that point? Or is it more of the previous 10 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
my least favorite part of the show is when he is working tirelessly to restore the timeline.  specifically i have no use for the young girl, that is not a scientist.  
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it's slow till episode 12 but then it goes like BOOM! I had to force myself through the first 11 episodes too but it is really worth it.
>> ARTICLE
You seriously quit at when everything starts to get good.
>> ARTICLE
Go back and watch 11/12. That's when the mind fuck roller coaster begins. You'll be hooked at that point I'm sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I slowly watched 1 or 2 eps a day up to around that point as well but the next few episodes are pretty big and everything just kicks off in my opinion. I ended up marathoning the rest in one sitting because I just had to know what happens next.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much this. I started watching 1 ep per day before going to sleep and sometimes i would almost fall asleep since nothing of note was going on. Then along comes ep 12 or 13, cant remember, and bam, got me hooked for life.
>> ARTICLE
I think episode 11 is the one you're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched it all in one sitting.
>> ARTICLE
Cool thanks the reply i guess i'll look into the anime one more time and try and see what all the fuss is about
>> ARTICLE
Just try starting where you left off. The first 10 episodes are EXTREMELY slow. After that point, it gets good. Like, really good. Thats where all the circlejerking comes from and the love for Steins;Gate originates. 
>> ARTICLE
Same. I kinda fell for Kurisu at that point TBH
>> ARTICLE
>I stopped watching the show @ episode 10


HAHAHA

thats actually fucking hilarious...

lets just say yes, it picks up after that point. Now go watch episode 11/12 and feel stupid.
>> ARTICLE
That IS funny! How is it even possible to stop at episode 10 after what happens at the end of that episode?
>> ARTICLE
Whenever I see a post like this, I think, "maybe this anime isn't for this person, but that's okay". I think if you didn't enjoy the first 10 episodes, even after 12, its not going to be that amazing. How do you really feel the [spoiler](/s "shock and despair of okabe if you don't enjoy the slice of life.")

Plus, if it takes 12 episodes of 24 for an anime to get good for someone, its probably not their thing.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hate the first half of Steins;Gate enough to drop it, but I still didn't really care for it until episode [](/s "12") then I fucking loved it and it ended up being my favorite anime.

So I think its understandable that he would drop it if he didn't expect it to get interesting soon.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the entirety of Steins;Gate and all and I can see where you're coming from, though I think the length of the anime (most anime nowadays tops out at 11, 12 episodes due to budget issues) plus the fact that they spend so much time character building, the impact and the payout is greater for it. It's like early 2000's and 90's anime where most anime at least had 26 episodes to build up for the impact of later episodes.

Also, the more mundane first half is easier to appreciate considering what happens in the second half. At least for me while re-watching it again.
>> ARTICLE
For me personally, if it takes 12 episodes for that amazing to happen, it wouldn't be a favourite for me.

Now I liked the first 12 episodes. Yes, i was confused(that first episode), but maybe the sci-fi element, or just the light heartedness really got to me, all the while there was a dark undertone.
>> ARTICLE
That's an understatement.
>> ARTICLE
I see how that'd be a turn off for some people. [](/s "but the whole unexpected "WHERE THE FUCK DID THAT COME FROM" that was caused by the first 12 episodes of buildup made it excellent, its not like it was just a waste of 12 episodes.")
>> ARTICLE
He basically chose the exact wrong episode to stop, lol.
>> ARTICLE
You really did sir. Lol. Hahahaha... Lol.... I can't believe you stopped there.. Lol.... Gi watch it now and feel stupid :D but yeah honestly.. Lol... the odd wasn't with you when you decide when to stop...
>> ARTICLE
This anime will be quite the view. After all, we do go into **THE ORGANIZATION** with **KRISUTINA** as underground agents who have to stop **SERN** after they're taken over the world...

Why... why would you think you're the only one excited?!

Absolutely not!

Yes, you are the only person who's exited by the S;G movie. It's not like it's the 2nd most favorite show in /r/anime or something like that. /s

Pretty sure you aren't the only one, Steins Gate is one of /r/anime's favorite anime and is talked and recommended a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
I read it about it before subscribing to /r/anime but the art or the story didn't seem compelling until I gave in and downloaded it. 
>> ARTICLE
I found it boring, too slow to start, not much goes on other than talking. It is a good anime, but I feel it just isn't as good as the hype it gets. It def gets better though.
>> ARTICLE
>but I feel it just isn't as good as the hype it gets

pretty much the problem with any type of hype, you are more likely to be disappointed.

I actually liked the slow start, though I marathoned the first 12 episodes.

Welcome to the fan-dome my friend, as you can see we love it for a good reason. There's tons of amazing series out there, you've just peeled off one corner of tape. Myanimelist.net is a great place to find new shows and to add what you've seen.

As for more recommendations, Code Geass or Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood might be up your alley. Amazing stories with wonderful characters, if you're looking for something more specific genres/shows let me know and I'd be more than glad to help. Welcome to the community, trust me, you'll enjoy your stay. 
>> ARTICLE
Please help me! I feel like I lost touch with anime so long ago that I'm overwhelmed to start again. Ill tell you what I enjoyed though. 

Full metal Alchemist, really liked that, the characters were great and I liked the laws regarding all the powers and alchemy just really solid story. 

Initial D and GTO. I also really liked these ones, I enjoyed the high school setting and these were the first ones I watched that were more like drama style and set in the real world.

Eva, I'm sure everyone loves this. So you know why. 

Lain, this one I found a bit odd but in a good way, liked the slow pace and again high school setting. 

FLCL this one loved the humour and style. I've rewatched it many times. 

Death note/bleach I group them together maybe because I watched them at a similar time and they both deal with spirit world. I didn't like where the death note story went, all seemed too improbable but loved the start, and never finished watching bleach but enjoyed what I did see. 

Detroit rock city, I thought the complete lack of political correctness and the use of profanity was insanely hilarious. And the fish out of water genre always is funny. 

And movies I've liked are, all Ghibli, Akira, Ghost in the shell, Tekonkinkreet, can't think of more at the moment. 

If you can recommend me anything and tell me which one it is most similar to the ones I've listed I would be SO happy. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering you liked Lain (slow pacing and all) you might like Texhnolyze. It's painfully slow but the whole story is definitely worth it, although there's no school setting. It's done by the same people as Lain too. 

Also if you haven't seen it yet, you might like Revolutionary Girl Utena. Some people probably wouldnt agree, but I saw it as Evangelion's non-identical twin sister. 

I hope you can rekindle the anime faith soon! 
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, then you probably should. When you just say Fullmetal Alchemist, I can't tell if you mean the original version (2003 series) or the alternative version (2009 series, which some believe is the superior version).

I also highly recommend Hunter x Hunter, which is somewhat similar to FMA.

Maybe even Code Geass or Tengen Tuppa Gurren Lagann. Both have some mecha action, especially the latter.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't see many responces so I thought I'd give a shot. I'm recommending things based on what I think you'll like, not what I like.

>Full metal Alchemist

One of my firsts, I still believe the 2003 > Brotherhood. You could try [Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch). It has that similar feel of being a "smart action show" or a "gentleman's action show". Similar to Death Note, and [Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate/Zero), maybe even [Black Lagoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon).

>Eva

Yup. Saw this when I was 14. It's Eva. Serial Experiments Lain and Eva have similarities. You could give [Ergo Proxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy) a shot. Dark/Psychological/action/sci-fi/religious elements, just like Eva and Lain. Has some slow moments, but good none-the-less.

>FLCL

Personal Favorite show for about 10 years. Until I saw Steins;Gate and [Haruhi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu).

>Initial D and GTO

Havne't seen these...yet :( I'm assuming you've seen Bebop.

You could also check out

[Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!) - set in Chicago 1920's. Short series, has a great conclusion, story told out of order, it's writing is like... watching a Tarantino movie. Safe recommendation here.

[Madoka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) - Looks gay...I know. I thought the same thing. But if you appreciate good writing and storytelling, with thematic depth, meaningful symbolism, and you're powerful enough to look past the... 14 y/o girls in princess dresses, then give if a try.

**Movies:**

You said you likes Ghibli. Saw Totoro when I was 9, and I never looked back :)

3 movies buy the same director. Similar to Ghibli just more grown up:

* [Girl Who Leapt Through](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)
* [Summer Wars](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5681/Summer_Wars)
* [Wolf Children](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki)

You can also look at [mal's top anime](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php), with a grail of salt, it's very shonen biased. Or click on other peoples mal's/hummingbirds to see what their lists are. And make one yourself to keep track of what you've watched.

>> ARTICLE
If you are going to say Full Metal, make sure to add the rest of the words. Full Metal Panic is a franchise with 3 anime series which were all fairly well received, and completely unrelated to Full Metal Alchemist. There's also Full Metal Jacket, a Stanley Kubrick movie (it would be hard to mix it up with an anime, but if all you say is "full metal" it becomes not so hard).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks edited :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

I actually started watching Code Geass and loved it so far, but Steins;Gate is the first one I've seen through til the end. I've *really* been missing out, I need to catch up on the series I should have watched long ago!
>> ARTICLE
I used to be just like you, in regards to the whole stigma surrounding anime. Clannad and Steins;Gate are what changed my opinions. Good stories transcend the media through which they are told. If you've ever got the time, give Clannad and Clannad: After Story a shot, just make sure you keep a tissue box close by.
>> ARTICLE
Make sure you watch Code Geass all the way though whilst avoiding spoilers at all cost.  The Season 2 ending is hands down one of the best in Anime.
>> ARTICLE
Jumping on suggestion train - Valvrave the Liberator. You can hate me later.
>> ARTICLE
To jump on the "suggestions" train, I'm currently heavily into Kill La Kill and Samurai Champloo, which I consider great shows (disclaimer: your mileage may vary).

There's also a sub called /r/Animesuggest. They're largely pretty friendly and helpful for finding new shows.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy Code Geass then after season two you'll want to watch Death Note. The two are always compared to each other even though they are very different. Also Attack on Titan is the Game of Thrones of Anime.

and honestly, if you want something fun, weird, adventurous, full of action, and quick to watch (25ish episodes) check out Tengen Toppen Gurren Laggan!!

Also, if you do like Code Geass, I recommend watching Death Note (very similar, however I did like Code Geass a bit more)
>> ARTICLE
Imo, Death note kinda lost its appeal to me after a certain event which entirely changed the dynamic of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why so many people hated that change. I happen to love it all the time until the bitter end!
>> ARTICLE
give a shot to gurren lagann as well! It may appear to not take itself seriously but it is easily one of my favorite animes every
>> ARTICLE
> It may appear to not take itself seriously

Let's face it, that's why it's fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched Code Geass right after Steins;Gate as well.  Both were simply amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
hey are you that pokemon streamer iMAX1UP by any chance?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, I don't actually do any streaming. 
>> ARTICLE
ahh, odd coincidence
>> ARTICLE
Same here! Steins;Gate was my first anime and Code Geass was my second. Both still have 10s.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass will definitely leave a huge impression, have fun! 
>> ARTICLE
I really really need to watch that one day.......soon.
>> ARTICLE
I though Code Geass was very complicated though. New characters popped up like weed.  
  
[Opening 5 demonstrates that very well](http://youtu.be/Jsvov7wHR_A?t=1m5s)

I've seen Code Geass and forgot about most of those characters.

i watched it because "whatever. Nothing to do anyways" and it became one of the 3 series that made me tear up.

Boku no pico and Crayon shin-chan.

Only 3? You need more tears my friend.

He's only watched 3 series so far.

Since nobody's mentioned it yet, you should try Psycho-Pass.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any anime like psycho pass and S;G I really liked these anime series and I'm needing more I want to say like that anime movie king of thorn as well really enjoyed that to,
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with this. I don't think Psycho-Pass was very well thought out as a sci-fi series, especially compared to Steins;Gate. I mean, I enjoyed it, but from all indications I have unusually low standards for entertainment.
>> ARTICLE
I found both to be equally fantastic. Can you elaborate on why you thought Psycho-Pass was not as good as S;G?
>> ARTICLE
There were just some unbelievable elements that went unexplained, though I suppose I could've missed them, and it's been a while so I may be misremembering as well.

[Psycho-Pass spoilers?](/s "What happened to the rest of the world, and what is currently happening to the rest of the world? This was the big one, because as far as I could tell it wasn't like in The Big O where it's literally the last city on Earth, but it might as well have been from how everyone acted. I think I remember Kogami leaving the city once, and there was no fuss made over the fact that they must have some serious borders to manage the city like they do.")

[Why aren't there](/s "scanners in more places, or more cameras (there seem to be a whole lot of blind spots)? Why isn't there more (any?) automated law enforcement when they're already essentially automating so much of what the officers do. Why don't they issue the guns to be carried at all times since they're already so limited by the system?")

[I also thought](/s "the explanation of the antagonist's *specialness* was totally insufficient, that the characters were *too* good at profiling, and those two things together kind of cheapened the ending for me.")
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
I thought they explained the relative lack of butterfly effect (which i believe is what you're implying) by saying that certain events would simply come to pass no matter what and it is actually very difficult to change events (the exact terminology they used escapes me right now) basically the reason everything stayed very similar even if something specific was drastically changed (pick any event in the story really) is the same reason [that](/s mayuri keeps dying) and [that](/s everyone stays friends even if the circumstances of them all meeting change) and like the comment below stated, they weren't really trying to go back to the original world line, not the exact one anyway
>> ARTICLE
That's what *Attractor Field Theory* is all about. Basically, an Attractor Field is a super-world line. It determines all major events, or you could say, all major events determine it. Within any given Attractor Field are the actual individual world lines, but all of those world lines are bound together by the same *conclusion*.  
The butterfly effect is actually incredibly important in Steins;Gate. The problem lies more in with the Time Leap machines mechanics really. First, Okabe could only Time Leap back 48 hours. Second, the Time Leap machine was not actually constructed until August 13th. That's not a lot of time to try and exact a major change.  
More importantly though, it has to do with the chaos factor. To Time Leap allows one to observe and direct the changes of the past. A D-mail on the other hand, is an absolutely chaotic system. That basically means that you could say D-mails are the butterfly effect incarnate.
>> ARTICLE
[Steins; Gate Explanation](/s " The reason Okabe is able to return to the original timeline is because he is literally undoing the transfer to each timeline step-by-step by nullifying the text messages. This whole concept nullifies all those small contacts and makes them meaningless so you don't need to undo every single thing at all (also he doesn't return to exactly the same timeline just very close - in the new timelines the target people received text messages but disregarded them). As for Reading Steiner, its revealed to be an innate ability in everyone that Okabe just has an increased aptitude toward IIRC (although it's still not a great explanation)")
>> ARTICLE
Untagged spoilers, including to shows other than Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Good points.

The situation outside Japan wasn't really addressed if my memory serves me right, but I assumed that it wouldn't be easy for someone tagged by the system to just up and leave. As for the blind spots and lack of adequate automatons on the streets, wasn't that because of their complacency? After all, people such as the antagonist were a rare case; it's unrealistic to employ more resources at diminishing returns. If I remember correctly, they were carrying their Dominators most of the time. It's been a while since I watched it, so I might be forgetting some details.

As for the specialness of the antagonist, I don't see what more there is to explain. Obviously they could've gone down the more elaborate route to try to expand on WHY he is special, but that would've been at a cost to the main theme of the show, which was an exploration of the implications of a utopia (much closer to a dystopia I suppose) gained at the cost of its citizens sensibilities.

for me it was

>SPOOOOOOOKY BOOOOOOOOOOGY
>> ARTICLE
Hah! Well that *was* pretty annoying, but it would be shame to dismiss it for such a trivial reason.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely second this OP. You said you like dark undertones and this fits the bill perfectly along with having one of the best Protagonist/Antagonist conflicts in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of dark undertones, there's also Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni.
I found it a bit hard to understand at first, but it gets really good.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Umineko no Naku Koro ni over Higurashi; it's not quite as horrific.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying that you are wrong or anything, but the general opinion of Umineko is that it is utter garbage in comparison to Higurashi.

I haven't seen it myself but Higurashi is one of the best horror pieces I've seen in the last decade and is received as such, so for a newer anime fan Higurashi is probably a better place to start.
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi is a superior Horror anime, hands down, I'm not denying that. However, in terms of a 'dark' anime, I'd recommend checking out Umineko before watching the one that's more disturbing than A Serbian Film.
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi is a horror anime though. It doesn't have dark undertones, it has a full blown terrifying horror story. 
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you check out the Steins Gate Movie if you haven't already. It follows after the events of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It won't be for a while but it will likely be dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the movie. What do I do now? I feel kind of lost knowing that's all the Steins;Gate there is!
>> ARTICLE
The visual novel is getting an English release at the end of March. You can preorder it on jlist and get a digital and physical copy with future gadget lab member pins. There is also word of a harem steins gate anime in the works which I believe to be just the members doing stuff, not entirely sure. Also there are a lot of manga about the steins gate cast. 
>> ARTICLE
Mother of god there's a movie?! I will be checking this out asap! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Don't get your hopes up too high for the movie, the discussion topic we had for it had mixed reviews.  I personally didn't like it, but you might.
>> ARTICLE
Since three people have told you "There's an OVA!" without saying what an OVA actually *is*, it stands for "Original Video Animation" and is an animated special that's broadcast differently from normal shows, usually on DVD/BD only. In this case (and many others) it serves as sort of an "extra" episode to add to and/or help wrap up the show. The OVA for Steins;Gate is particularly good in my opinion, and shouldn't be too hard to find.

I'll also warn you that the movie is more an addition to the story than a continuation of it. The plot is more or less separate from that of the show, with the exception that it's also based around travel between world lines. It's still really good, but if you go in expecting to get more closure or exposition on the show's plot in particular, you might be disappointed. Adjust your expectations accordingly!

Glad you like the show, man. It's a 10/10 for me, personally, and is *the* show I'd recommend to non-anime watchers.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the OVA. It was a fun story, plus we got more engrish goodness in the airport scene. 
>> ARTICLE
there's also an OVA, watch that first before the movie if you have not seen it yet.

You could try a classic Cowboy Bebop. It a space and action anime.

I just finished this today. It's a classic for a reason, that's for sure.

Madoka Magica is great if you want to continue watching anime. It has a great and kind of dark story so don't get the wrong idea from the first couple episodes. It is also somewhat similar to Steins;Gate, but I won't give any spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Even better that Urobuchi Gen - who worked on the Madoka Magica - also worked in the same company that made the Steins;gate VN.
>> ARTICLE
While i agree Madoka might be a great show for people who like steins gate, i ask, is it a good show for someone who has seen little anime (probably no magical girl shows) and came from steins gate?  I seriously would like to know, cause in my opinion its not the show to watch after steins gate with almost no prior anime experience.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It's a great show standalone and doesn't need all that "deconstruction" crap.

I've was never into the whole magical girl business
>> ARTICLE
i showed a couple of friends of mine madoka magica over the weekend, and the best thing about it is that [super spoilers for everything](/s "after mami dies in episode three, the only consolation that i had for the people who were seeing it for the first time was 'it's going to get worse... a LOT worse... before it gets any better'.  one's jaw dropped and she just held her hand over her mouth while madoka cried onto the pavement.  it was glorious")
>> ARTICLE
The show became one of my favourite anime. Hell, I even have a cup and wallscroll now.
>> ARTICLE
I know, that show is a rollercoaster of feels.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate was my first too. Got me hooked man...
>> ARTICLE
you started off pretty heavy. welcome to the world of getting your heart ripped out and liking it.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the best description of good anime I've come across to date.
>> ARTICLE
If you just got into it, just remember that anime isn't a genera, it's more of a medium. If you want to well up, there's plenty where that came from, or if you want a laugh, there's plenty of that too. You started on a great show, but I'll be damned if there aren't some bad ones out there too. There are a lot of options, but approach them the same way you would approach other shows or movies. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice to hear of your revelation!

I'd love to give you somewhere new to start, but first you aught to tell us your tastes.

I can list off plenty of anime that I think would be worth your time but knowing exactly what you like would be a nice point for myself and others to narrow down some great examples for you. :)

Going from Steins;Gate alone though I could probably list a few you might like.

Robotics;Notes - It's the anime that came after Steins;Gate by the same studio, I love it but I hear it has mixed reviews. 
Up to you if you're willing to give it a try.

Death Note - It's a classic but for good reason, if you liked Steins;Gate then I can imagine you'll be hooked on this by the third episode.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - If there's any one title out there to define what 'Anime' is, this would probably be it, if not hiiigh up there and certainly recommend giving it a watch.
It's nothing like Steins;Gate but you'd have a hard time in here finding anyone who would'nt recommend it. 

Kill la Kill while you're at it too, if you catch up fast enough then you can feel the pain of having to wait a week between releases like the rest of us. :P

Any and all feel free to agree or disagree with my choices, just listing off the first few I think would appeal to OP.

Thinking about it there's probably a good few Movies I could recommend too.
Throw me a reply and I'll happily inform you of any! 



>> ARTICLE
I honestly have no idea! I'm quite liking the series with a sort of dark undertone like in Steins;Gate and Code Geass (Steins;Gate is the first anime I've followed through all the way so far), but I am more than happy to try anything and broaden my tastes! 

What are your personal favourites? I just want to get a consensus for what shows are good and I'll see if they suit me! :)
>> ARTICLE
Death Note was what hooked me into anime originally, go check out the first arc of it, till episode 12-14ish? You'll know *exactly* which episode I mean when you hit that point yourself.  
>> ARTICLE
I would like to give you a headache and ruin your day so I'd like to introduce you to [](/s "Neon Genesis Evangelion") followed by [](/s "Rebuild of Evangelion (The last movie isn't out yet)").
>> ARTICLE
If you like dark undertones, check out Death Note. That was the first anime I ever watched, and I too had a LOT of prejudices going in. Needless to say, I've watched many many series since then, and I love them :)
>> ARTICLE
I already posted this series in this thread, but if you're looking for a series with a dark undertone than Chaos;Head would probably be pretty good. Just make sure the play the Visual Novel, and only watch the anime if you're still interested, as the adaption isn't that great.
>> ARTICLE
My personal favourites huh?

Well it's certainly changed a few times over the years but I may as well list off the ones that I would happily watch over and over again.

Keep in mind my tastes are incredibly varied, from thriller to highshool romance I'll watch and probably enjoy it.
I know that's not the case for everyone though so I like to at least get that out there.

First off would be the Monogatari Series. 

Right now it would have to be my favourite bar none.
It's incredibly dialogue based but is one of the best series I've ever watched and it's still going.

The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya, one of the first I ever watched and to this day I still adore it.
The movie is also probably my favourite of all time too.

Clannad

The first anime I ever watched that made me cry, there are no words for what this made me feel.

Toradora! similarly had the same effect on me.

One Piece, now this series is ongoing and looong.
Was my original favourite and I've dropped off watching it as much as I used to but it'd be a crime not to include it.

The rest I won't go in to detail about, but I'll happily give you some information on them if you ask. :)

In no particular order.

Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanajo

FLCL

Black Rock Shooter

Hyouka

K-ON

Macross Frontier

Another

Mirai Nikki

(I'll stop there for series, these next few are some movies I adore and stop there)

Summer Wars

Anything by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away was my first so it holds a special place in my heart.

Sword Of The Stranger

Rebuild of Evangelion (also a series but the latest movies have been incredible with one more on the way)

There are all so many more I could happily list but I'd prefer if you did'nt have to scroll down for several hours. :P

Hope I've given you a nice starting point at least.

Have you tried watching [Hunter X Hunter 2011](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_(2011)?
I started watching it about a month ago now and at about 100 episodes through (out of the ongoing 117) I have to say it is one my favourite anime in a long time.
It starts off a bit slow but after a few episodes it starts to get really good.

Edit: Grammar and hyperlink
>> ARTICLE
Great recommendation. Not only is hunterxhunter 2k11 stunning artistically, but the writing blows me away with how free thinking the characters are and how the story evolves from this idea, allowing the characters to progress the story with no obvious interference from formulaic norms that plague most long epics. 
>> ARTICLE
If your looking for something with a dark undertone try Darker Than Black. It was actually my personal favorite until I saw Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, DTB is one of the best anime's around. I also like phantom requiem for phantom. 
>> ARTICLE
For dark and twisted...

[Deadman Wonderland](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland)

[Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied)

[Another](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another)

[Black Lagoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon) and its associated sequels.

[Ergo Proxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy)

[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) and its sequels.

[Serial Experiments Lain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain)

[Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze)

... 

That should keep you busy for a month or so ...  Also, [Redline](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline) always makes for a bit of a nice eyegasm.
>> ARTICLE
Deadman Wonderland was quite interesting, but wasn't a great success, so there won't be a second season. Which means you get a story that just suddenly stops.
>> ARTICLE
Seconding Elfen Lied and Black Lagoon here, definitely two of my favourites.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Jormungand ... another good series along similar lines to Black Lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
If it's dark you're after, I'm surprised no one's really mentioned the original [Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) series.  You should definitely give it a shot.  I'd watch the newer movies after you've already seen the original, especially since they're not finished with them yet.  
>> ARTICLE
Dark undertone and excellent series, super-interesting dystopian premise:

[Shin Sekai Yori](http://www.crunchyroll.com/shin-sekai-yori-from-the-new-world)

Arguably the best anime of 2013 (2012? It began in '12 but ended in '13). Only complaints I've heard about it are that it's kind of slow/ the pacing is off, but I personally have no such complaints. It's a great anime. It's also a little more mature than most anime, both in art style and story.
>> ARTICLE
Robotics;Notes is probably the weakest anime on that list.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, it has mixed reviews.

I just mentioned it because it is the anime that followed Steins;Gate.

I liked it but I know that's not the same for a lot of people here it seems.
>> ARTICLE
Robotics;Notes is as related to Steins;Gate as Kill la Kill is to Gurren Lagann.

I disliked Robotics;Notes simply because it ruined the good cast of characters and overarching plot, only to turn into a power-of-friendship nonsense (badly executed in this case).
>> ARTICLE
> Robotics;Notes is as related to Steins;Gate as Kill la Kill is to Gurren Lagann.

Kill la Kill isn't set in the same universe as Gurren Lagann, Anti-Spirals aren't the villains of Kill la Kill, no Gurren Lagann characters are characters in Kill la Kill, the list goes on and on. Terrible comparison.

You may not like Robotics;Notes, and while I personally absolutely love it, I can respect that opinion - but stating they lack a bigger relation than that is a blatant lie.
>> ARTICLE
>but stating they lack a bigger relation than that is a blatant lie.

I've seen and enjoyed Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, and Robotics;Notes. Aside from a few references each can stand alone entirely and you'd never know they were from the same universe. There is a grand total of one character carried over from Steins;Gate to Robotics;Notes and the events of Steins;Gate have no bearing on their character in Robotics;Notes at all. I didn't even notice they were the same person at first. There is nothing overarching that ties the show together so tightly that they're required to be in the same universe.
>> ARTICLE
How about the [](/s "Avengers-like organization the heroes from each installment are forming in the background?") Or the [](/s "NoAH IV from Robotics;Notes? Does it even make sense without knowing about C;H?") Also [](/s "regarding Nae, I'd say it's safe to assume she remembered Suzuha in her dreams via 'reading steiner' and strived to become like her given all the similarities...") But what I like most are the connections that aren't on the surface, [](/s "like how Kurisu is responsible for every conflict in the series in a different way.") You can see it's all very well planned too, [](/s "like how Geji-nee from R;N is referenced in every visual novel before it.") There's more of course, these are just a few. They *are* standalone, but they've also got a deeper connection.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, the comparison is completely valid if you look at themes and style.  
While not in the same universe, GL and KLK are vitually the same story of growing more powerful to defeat an ever increasingly more powerful foe.  To do this the character will do anything including making ridiculous and fun faces to having epic battles all over the place.  
You comparison of R;n and S;g is fine as is.

it is important to note that all of these anime are stand-alone.
>> ARTICLE
> I disagree, the comparison is completely valid if you look at themes and style.

Sure, that's one way you can compare KLK to TTGL, but S;G and R;N have pretty different themes and styles which is probably why some people looking for a second S;G leave disappointed. 

KLK is in a way related to TTGL obviously (same staff for starters), but not in the same way as the SciADV Series. All of these titles are standalone, but S;G and R;N are still part of the same series - one which is a lot more connected than it may seem at first glance.
>> ARTICLE
I can honestly say trying to find the similarities between the s;g and r;n worlds is vastly more challenging for me than seeing similarities in klk and ttgl.  But i completely agree with how the themes and styles are different for s;g and klk.  So in some ways to me it seems like ttgl and klk are more related than s;g and r;n are.  that said they are both either SciADV or Shounen.  both sets are just out of the box a bit in some regards.
>> ARTICLE
Next try watching From the New World/Shinsekai Yori!

I personally think there are far better written anime out there, though I still enjoyed Steins;Gate.

You should watch Death Note. That anime is truly amazing.

Steins;Gate is one of my fav animes of all time my first is Clannad AS, if you watch it...you know why,and i recommend Madoka Magica,i watch it after Steins;Gate and some of it is similar.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Clannad so you can cry or Fate/Zero if you want to be absolutely blown away or Magi for a fun adventure series with some deep underlying themes
>> ARTICLE
Magi is really funny at some parts, but it's also the darkest shounen series I know of. This series is highly underrated. So many likeable/hateable characters.
>> ARTICLE
I hear a lot of good things about Clannad, but I very much struggled to even watch it, I finished the first 7 episodes and just gave up. I just found it tedious. Whilst for Stein's Gate and Fate/Zero I absolutely adored them both. I feel that it is hard to connect clannad to Stein's Gate.
>> ARTICLE
They don't connect.

However I suggest you just skim through Clannad if you have the free time, and get to the After Story asap. Skim through Sunohara's arc in the After Story if you need to, because the real story begins then


>> ARTICLE
If you cried in steins gate, your dead in clannad. Definitely watch clannad, also Fate/zero is good action!

Anime is ranged from children to adults, whereas western cartoons are focussing more on the age range 6~12
>> ARTICLE
I feel you. Steins; Gate was the 3rd anime I watched in my life, and because of this series I got hooked onto anime. The other times were for "Another" and "Howl's Moving Castle"(maybe an anime, idk), some that you should also watch.
>> ARTICLE
I just want to double up on the recommendation I already saw here for Shinsekai Yori - if you're looking for the cream of the artistic crop, I would peg SSY as one of the best television shows of the past decade, period. It did not please the hardcore Otaku base largely because it avoided all the things that cause the prejudices you mentioned. 

But, it's very heavy.

I think you just ruined Steins;Gate for me forever. ;P
>> ARTICLE
At least you didnt watch it fresh after ep 18 like me
>> ARTICLE
Okabe is such an awesome character. J. Micheal Tatum is the perfect dub actor for him too....
>> ARTICLE
It took me a while to hit that kind of revelation too! I would say if you are looking for good anime I just finished Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary). It has great characters, a really cool artstyle (think fight scenes from Chuunibyou but serious), and an excellent story that carries you away. Short and sweet.
>> ARTICLE
While I enjoyed Kyoukai no Kanata, it's story was actually somewhat poorly written. It had an okay direction, and some plot holes were left unfilled and glossed over, but there were some major issues with how they concluded the show. The total lack of consequence and explanation was a large flaw. 
>> ARTICLE
watch the movie as well... not as good but you'll like it if you liked the series [Steins;Gate: Fuka Ryouiki no Dj vu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)
>> ARTICLE
I liked it just as much, personally.
>> ARTICLE
That's how I got into Anime too! 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching it as well + the OVA, it was so good!
>> ARTICLE
If you liked the anime you might want to try out the Visual Novel the anime is based on, if you have the time. It has more/different endings, and goes in depth a bit more. Oh, and in case someone hasn't already said it. Steins;Gate is in a series. Sort of. They're really only connected by being in the same universe and the occasional reference. There have been 3 games that have come out in the series. In order: Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotic;Notes. They all have anime adaptations, but the Chaos;Head one is alright at best, so you'd probably want to read the Visual Novel, again, if you have time. I'd take about 20 hours total or so. Chaos;Head takes place in 2009, I think, a year before Steins;Gate. Robotic;Notes takes place in 2019, and the Visual Novel hasn't been translated yet, but the anime is available. (I'm not even sure if it's on PC yet)
Sorry for the wall of text, Steins;Gate happens to be the first anime TV series I watched and my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
While on the topic of Visual novels Id like to make a shameless plug about how great Muv-luv alternative is. Quite possibly my favorite VN, although steins gate is certainly great as well.

i got to like episode 7-8 and marathoned the entire series in a night. the suspense was amazing! Theres so much more out there that's just as good as stein's gate too. enjoy your stay =)
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is what I would argue a rare masterpiece of under appreciated science fiction which I hope more people learn to appreciate. 
>> ARTICLE
I still have nightmares from Chaos;Head, which is on my list of worst series i have seen.
>> ARTICLE
Ever tried [Mayushii style cooking](http://imgur.com/wMWzCrs) ? For some reason the silly cheerfulness stuck in my head for weeks.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked it, you might want to try reading the source material for the show, the [Steins;Gate](http://vndb.org/v2002) visual novel (basically a fully voiced choose your own adventure book with lots of illustration). [The official English translation goes on sale 03/31/2014](http://jastusa.com/blog/2014/02/14/steinsgate-golden-master-and-other-news/) or you can use already released fan translation.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to get more in depth you can play the original game, which features more endings and some really nice art.

Other games that are part of the same series are Robotics;notes and Chaos;head. Another game in the series is also in development, called Chaos;child. As you have likely figured out, they have a thing for semi-colons.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to a new World.
>> ARTICLE
What is steins gate about? I've heard of it before. I'm definitely gonna check it out in the future just from hearing all the praise for the show tho
>> ARTICLE
It sounds cliche, but its incredible trust me: its about a small group of people discovering secrets about time travel, but they end up getting tied up in a larger underlying plot to do with evil organisations using time travel for the wrong reasons.

There's probably a million more ways for me to put it to make it sound interesting, but I don't want to spoil anything and really that quick premise is the bare bones of the storyline. The real magic lies in the characters though, even though the plotline is very strong, the characters are the aspect that make the show what it is imo.
>> ARTICLE
Is it a 12 or 25 episode series? I'll probably marathon it with a buddy of mine 
>> ARTICLE
24 with an OVA at the end :) apparently there's also a movie but its not integral to the plot, but I'm watching that tonight so I don't know much about it yet!
>> ARTICLE
Actually, there is a movie and an OVA. (the OVA is better than the movie though)
>> ARTICLE
I know, that's exactly what I said :P
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I loved this series, I also welled up. Anyway another anime that't kind of similar which would be Anohana or Angel Beats. They are a little cheesier, but honestly I love them. Just prepare for the feels.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note would actually be a good follow up if you are looking for a drama/thriller. At first I was pushed away by the animation style, but honestly it is keeping me on the edge of my seat as I watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome brother. 

S;G is in my top 3 as well. Watching that while it was airing was a real pleasure.

Anime is like anything else: 90% of is is bad, 5% will suite your taste immediately, while the other 5% **might** grow on you over time.

I'm sure people have already made recommendations here, good luck and happy watching.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate gets a lot of love in this sub. I watched up to episode 16 but I lost interest in it and never finished it. Are there any major twists or changes that might change my mind if I finish it? Or if I didn't like it by now is it just not for me?

I see this anime praised so often that I figure there must be something I'm missing.
>> ARTICLE
My favourite episodes were all ranging from episode 14-23ish, and the latter episodes just get better and better. However, if you aren't very invested in the characters then it might not do a lot for you. I would recommend just trying to stick it out though because honestly I think you would be missing out if you didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, that's significantly past the halfway mark. If episodes 14 to 16 didn't interest you, then I doubt you're going to be moved by the rest of it.
>> ARTICLE
apparently this is an anime that took place one year after chaos;head is that correct? does it involve plot points from chaos;head or no? I've watched the anime I just want to make sure before watching this one.
>> ARTICLE
It's the same universe/world as chaos;head but not related in terms of characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is definitely one of my top 5 animes, up with Madoka Magica, Witchblade, Gosick, and Gurren Lagann. 
>> ARTICLE
Welcome my friend to this amazing world.
>> ARTICLE
The first dozen episodes can get dry after a while and then the turning point comes around. Tears will be shed for this series
>> ARTICLE
I am happy that Steins;Gate wasnt my first anime, for me since Steins;Gate there hasnt been any series impressed me so deep.

I suggest start with a different genre now, because if you are like me you only will get disapoited by something in a comparable genre.

Watch One Piece, Kill la Kill and maybe Hellsing.
>> ARTICLE
You mean definitely watch Hellsing, the original not the OVA. Gungrave is also pretty amazing/depressing. there's a lot of great anime to choose from.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate usually leaves that impression on someone and it's better to watch it twice because sometimes there are things you may have missed the first time around.

>> ARTICLE
Steins Gate is one of the best animes ever made. Very well thought through from the concept of time travelling to the physics. The story is unbelievable as well. The first 9 episodes felt like such a slow start and when it shifted to high gear BAM! that stuff was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Now watch Beta 23 episode.
>> ARTICLE
Wait what?

There's a Beta 23 episode?

I'm so confused

[Yes.](/s "There was a variation of episode 23 (alternate ending) that ties into Steins;Gate Zero aired in Japan recently. Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTgry6vyzf8")

So I just watched it and, well, wow man
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the S;G Zero hype train!
>> ARTICLE
I've been on it man, I didn't know a new episode was out though. The VN isn't even out, not that I'll be able to play it, but the wait is a struggle.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's a teaser and/or beginning for Steins;Gate 0. It's pretty much the same as Steins;Gate episode 23 but the last 10 minutes are different. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the extra episode and the movie
>> ARTICLE
I love the extra episode.
>> ARTICLE
Movie is really great

>> ARTICLE
Has funimation gotten the rights to dub it yet? I personally enjoy the English cast better.
>> ARTICLE
No idea I never watched any dubs.
>> ARTICLE
Movie felt like a cashgrab, which made it less enjoyable for me, but I'd still recommend it to OP - especially if they like Kurisu.
>> ARTICLE
The movie was ridiculously good, I don't see how you can view it as a cashgrab.
>> ARTICLE
There were more inconsistencies than there were holes in Louis Sachar's *Holes*. It breaks pretty much all the rules put forth by the original VN, and the movie and OVA weren't written by the original writers, and thus aren't canon.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah aside from the somewhat sudden and rushed ending it was great. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it was the ending that turned me off it. I should probably rewatch it.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend it to anybody who liked steins;gate

>> ARTICLE
It's a great show. It was one of the first I saw that changed my perception on how anime could convey a wonderful story, without feeling like I had to tap my inner teenaged boy.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, S;G was probably when I started to venture off into more mature anime, one's which aren't shounen or the ones which aren't mainstream. It made me appreciate anime more than anything!
>> ARTICLE
Very true, anime never ceases to amaze me.
>> ARTICLE
Meanwhile, I'm still trying to convince my friends to continue watching after the first 3 episodes...
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. ikr total nightmare, so hard to convince someone its the best anime ever when the start is slow and confusing the first time round.
>> ARTICLE
Tell him to at least try to make it to episode 12. Promise him anything. just get him to do it!
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I somehow think everyone except me didnt like the beginning of the story. You can imagine how much i loved episodes 11+ when i did already love the first episodes.. The bad thing about loving an anime so much is that you need someone you can talk with about it so i really suffer when all my friends drop steins;gate down after 4 episodes ',_,'
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of people are let down because a lot of other people have hyped it up. I'm not saying that's true for everyone but I know others have hyped it up saying it's the best show ever. I call my self lucky because I started watching it right after it aired and many of my friends don't watch anime so I was going in blind. I had no idea what was going to happen but I did hear that it was great. Once I read that, I stopped reading everything else and just went for it. The first half of the show is necessary because you need to have some context and attachment for the later half. If it didn't have such a build up, the decisions later wouldn't be as impactful.

When I suggest it to people, I say it's a great show about time travel and leave it at that. My friend that did try watching it enjoyed the first 5 episodes I watched with him and was wondering what's going to happen next rather than waiting for that thing that changes the whole tone of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Well im that kind of friend who hypes a series too much, unfortunately. But i can't just hold me back from doing so. I just cant.. (but can you actually overhype a masterpiece?).

I just experienced that nobody of my friends watches the specific series i suggested them if i just tell them that it is great.
>> ARTICLE
And that right there is why I visit this subreddit. 
>> ARTICLE
Congrats on making it through, Steins;Gate is an emotional ride. It's definitely the first anime that I saw that really felt emotionally draining, and I think that's high praise for any work of fiction. Now we sit in hype for the release of Zero...
>> ARTICLE
Man, every time I say I'm gonna watch this show, something always gets in the way. I'm watching it before winter quarter starts up again, I swear to God.
>> ARTICLE
It hits you right in the feels, and science!! Totally worth it. Or reading the visual novel. Both delicious =)
>> ARTICLE
It's great to see you enjoyed it. I just finished rewatching it recently after playing the VN for the first time, and it was even better than the first time I watched it. The small details, characters, and foreshadowing really make this an amazing show. It's easily my favorite anime now.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of the best anime that I have watched. Great story, great characters, and compelling throughout. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the OVA and the movie. Great endings.
>> ARTICLE
Obligatory monthly-ish "Finished watching Steins;Gate" thread.
>> ARTICLE
It's 3am here and i've just finished marathoning episodes 7 to 25. I wasn't even intending to go through it all in one day but the story just kept getting better and better.  I'm probably gonna watch the movie and the alternative episode 23 tomorrow (today). Gah and i found out there will be a sequel to the series, i wonder if it'll have as many episodes as the original series. 

Too-too-ruu!
>> ARTICLE
Watch the OVA before the movie or beta ep.
>> ARTICLE
Epiaode 25? I've watched it. I heard it Isn't canon though.
>> ARTICLE
episode 25 is filler, in a sense, but it introduces a charcter that may, or may not be prominent in Steins;Gate Zero [Steins;Gate Ep. 25](/s "Suzuha's mother")

And gives more closure on Kurisu's relationship to the group (if you haven't scene the movie)
>> ARTICLE
Hah, same. I couldn't stop after episode 12 so I watched the whole thing from episode 10 or so.
>> ARTICLE
Now go play the VN. The anime only goes through the Steins Gate route and only scratches the surface. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently reading the VN and I was just wondering does the VN cover the anime + OVA and movie??... Or just only the anime
>> ARTICLE
The VN covers the movie and OVA, but not the movie. At least I don't think. I got like 99% completion on the VN, just never did the True route because it takes a LONG time to finish it. 
>> ARTICLE
Let OP wait a bit; The VN would be horrible to go through right after he finished the anime, only when he decides to rewatch he should go through the VN rather than the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Good point. It's a rough ride.

Yes this is a amazing show. Quick story my brother and I got into anime at the same time and have slowly  been trying to get our friends into it. We got a friend to watch Stiens: gate a year ago and he loved it enough to have seen it 5 times but has watched nothing else. Then my 2 best friends two weeks ago watched SAO. When they tried to defend it and say it was really good the three of us jumped on the opportunity to explain why it is not in detail and why they need to watch Stiens; Gate. Long story short they eventually did and now proclaim it to be the best thing they have ever seen and are REALLY getting into anime now.  We have a Group chat and it was hilarious to watch one of my friends brain explode in real time as he watch episode 12 and beyond. His watching time 1-5 on a Saturday. That Monday 5-24 plus OVA and movie. Needless to say he got hooked big time
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it this past weekend and I loved it! I'm surely half way through my second viewing of it. THere's so much overshadowing spread throughout the series. It's amazing! So well written. I love the characters, especially our mad scientist Okabe.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome to see another person that loves Steins;Gate. My post is still alive haha! Don't forget to watch the OVA and the movie as well as the special Steins;Gate episode 23 Beta. 
>> ARTICLE
I saw the OVA and I plan on searching for the movie and the Beta episode. Thanks for letting me know about these!!!
>> ARTICLE
I finished it a few weeks ago and still don't get all the hype. I found the main character excruciatingly annoying throughout. Didn't care for his inability to take action and just open his mouth in certain situations (but that is part of anime in general). His friends were cool though.            
Very slow start but once it gets going the actual story its pretty interesting. Not going to bother with the movie and probably not going to watch it again. Glad you liked it though. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It was a 6/10 for me. I don't understand how it's the 2nd highest rated anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you didn't like it doesn't make it a bad show
>> ARTICLE
6/10 doesn't mean "bad", it literally means "a bit better than average".

Which is still a generous rating. Anyone finding the MC incredibly stupid and irritating in the first few episodes should drop the show right away.
>> ARTICLE
6/10 means different things to different people.
>> ARTICLE
If it's true, then this rating system is broken.
>> ARTICLE
To me it means 60%....So, a D. =(
>> ARTICLE
What in the fuck do you rate a 10 if *this* is a 6!?
>> ARTICLE
I think the visual novel handles the general characterization better. I dropped the anime at the 8th episode or so because I didn't like the MC's character and it was tiring to watch his shenanigans, and the people around him weren't all that interesting either.

I read the VN a year later and loved it and it's in my top 5. Being able to see Okabe's internal thoughts helps you empathize with him. The humor is also much better which makes the first half more interesting to read.

So I'd highly recommend that people read the VN instead. What's funny is that on mainstream sites that reviewed the VN, the comments are just full of people saying to watch the anime. (However, it's less interesting to read if the anime is fresh on your mind, simply because it's pretty much the same exact story)
>> ARTICLE
Second on the Visual Novel. I thought the anime was slow and boring. So I quit. Picked up the visual novel and loved it. Seeing everything from his point of view really helps.
>> ARTICLE
I disliked the show as well.  Possibly because I've spoiled myself on amazing time travel sci-fi novels.  I hated almost every character, I felt Okabe was a complete and total idiot - and no, I don't mean him pretending to be an idiot; I felt he made immensely stupid decisions all the time.

I was calling certain twists several episodes in advance - I figured out many details of the final episode in the first episode as it uses the oldest time travel trick in the book, etc.

I'm genuinely surprised people here are calling the show seinen  because to me it had the depth and characterization of a teen fiction novel.  I will say I liked the "Attractor Field" idea; that similar timelines were easier to jump to than further away ones and that they sort of made up major "strands".  That idea was good (if not somewhat similar to the works of Stephen Baxter) though I didn't like that they felt they needed to techno-babble and surface level complicate a pretty simple idea, but that's a minor gripe.
>> ARTICLE
I found the the cast very dull and boring (aside from okabe), majorly because all the development/characterization is ruined from time resets. Still a great show though 
>> ARTICLE
His inability to take action reflects just how average he is. Most people in his situation would react in exactly the same way. The realism, in that respect, is refreshing. 
>> ARTICLE
For certain parts? Yes but a lot of it was just ridiculous.   
            
[One example: The dude that looks like a chick](/s "Remember when he did actually change into a girl and the MC groped him/her? Everyone was like WTF? Would have been a fantastic time for him to open his damn mouth and tell them what was going on and how serious the situation was but nope. There were some absolutely frightening situations that he handled bravely and in ways most people probably wouldn't. Other times during less threatening moments? Nope. Just sit there and don't discuss what is happening with the team. Just keep changing things. He did open up more towards the end though.")
>> ARTICLE
Your link is broken

>> ARTICLE
Not a link but a spoiler tag. Look at it on /r/anime. Not the message box. 
>> ARTICLE
His character development is actually subtly about taking action and talking to people though.  [He]( /s "hides everything until he confides in Kirisu, and the final thing he does with the blood and taking action is him being brave and not running away from something for the first time in his life") 
>> ARTICLE
You know I'm glad I waited to watch this all at one time instead of watching it on an episode by episode basis when it was coming out. It is a really good anime but it just starts out so slow that I probably would have stopped watching it about six episodes in. I'm glad I got to binge watch it after the fact and enjoyed a really good show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it episode by episode back in '11 and thought it was great.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap I stopped watching it after 6 episodes. Because of this thread I'm gonna go back and watch more.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking have fun, dude
>> ARTICLE
believe me its worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, ya things really pick up about half way through. I binged the last 15 episodes in one day in my first watch haha, couldn't stop. You won't be dissappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward to it! I started watching bc of how highly rated it was in all the anime polls, so I should've really tried to push through!
>> ARTICLE
I finished it last week, and this is entirely accurate. It took me weeks to get through the first 10 episodes. It was just so slow... But man what a wild ride. Once it picks up, it really picks up.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best shows i've ever seen. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my top 3 anime for sure, never gets old.
>> ARTICLE
Same it's actually my number 3 on best ever. 
>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity what are your 1 and 2?
>> ARTICLE
is there romance in it? 
>> ARTICLE
a bit, but it's a highly recommended anime.

Sort of, you should watch it and see for yourself.

[Let me actually answer the question you asked:](/s "Yes. Doesn't start right away though.")

Shouldn't be a link. Should be a comment marked as a spoiler. You can view it on /r/anime right?
>> ARTICLE
ah ok was reading it through inbox message
>> ARTICLE
I mean, they do meet in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT

Now we wait for you to watch the ova and the movie
>> ARTICLE
VN is even better. Recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
Though I wouldn't recommend it to someone who just finished their first watch, I'd wait a bit. The VN goes much more in-depth than the anime, but for someone who just watched it, it would be definitely boring, considering the person just finished the story.
>> ARTICLE
I have started watching this show twice and I have dropped it just after few episodes both times. Maybe the third time is the charm.
>> ARTICLE
You need to get past the first half, it starts slow but it is worth it
>> ARTICLE
Not only worth it, but necessary. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like the first few episodes but I pushed on and then got to like episode 5 or 8 or something and it really really was awesome. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
The same happened to me. I couldn't even finish the first episode, even though I pushed myself to do so. But one night I had nothing to do, I sat down and watched the first three episodes. 

Just saying, that night I didn't sleep at all. I got completely hooked, and even though there were some aspects I didn't particularly like, it's still a really good anime. Definitely recommended.

As you say, third time's the charm :D
>> ARTICLE
I will start again tonight. I have so much free time now after finishing my thesis. I hope I don't stay up whole night to keep my sleep rhythm :D
>> ARTICLE
Nice! Happy watching! I wish I could still do all-night-long binge watches, but college is a thing...
>> ARTICLE
Well, you can now watch the "prequel" (Chaos;Head) and the "sequel" (Robotics;Notes).

At least on R;N, some characters from S;G appear a lot, but with other things to do...
>> ARTICLE
C;H and R;N are just set in the same universe. They don't really have anything to do with S;G other than the committee of 300 and CERN. 
>> ARTICLE
SERN, not CERN. CERN are the guys who did internet, how can they be bad?
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head was awful.
>> ARTICLE
Such a good plot idea but appalling execution, Robotics;Notes was quite good, don't expect anything like Steins;Gate though, not even close, but a lot better than C;H.
>> ARTICLE
The anime, yeah, definitely. The VN was awesome, though. Best Schizophrenia Simulator ever.

Was mostly referring to the anime. I have yet to play any SciAdv VNs.

90% sure you are in my FC lol... 

The times match up and everything..

i watched it after watching a bunch of garbage animes which only heightened my excitement for it! Binged watched all of it in one sitting! 
>> ARTICLE
Where can one watch this series? 
>> ARTICLE
I believe it was on american netflix but was removed. Its defonately on canadian netflix.
>> ARTICLE
It's on funimation, it also has a great dub, it's the only series where I was able to enjoy watching both the dub and the sub without being able to determine which one I preferred.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to give this show another go. absolutely loved chaos;head and only watched the first couple episodes of steins;gate before I got bored. 
>> ARTICLE
You might want to prepare yourself if you loved Chaos;Head. Christ are you gonna be in for a hell of a ride.
>> ARTICLE
Now read the VN mate, it's even better.
>> ARTICLE
>Although the beginning was a bit slow

Now rewatch it. 10x better.  

>> ARTICLE
Exactly, right? THere's a lot of foreshadowing and little things to pick up. So well thought out.
>> ARTICLE
I looked at the time you posted this and I had finished Steins;Gate at about the same time! I watched the dub and the VA for Okabe was absolutely phenomenal.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate has that slow start but the reward is so good. Next girl I'll date will be binge watching this with me.It was so well done and the character development was good.*SPOILER ALERT BELOW*Episode 11 Heaven Sent of  Doctor Who current season reminded me of Steins;Gate.The Doctor busted an Okabe move. It was a great episode if your into it.
>> ARTICLE
You know, i dropped it after the first episode. Decided to come back to it 4-5 months later. Man, i just couldn't stop watching. What a thriller. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly my story. I watched the first episode three times before I decided to keep on going with the series. It hurt at first because it was THAT slow for me, but now I just love it all!
>> ARTICLE
It took me two tries to watch Steins Gate because the first episode was so slow and extremely confusing, but it's become one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
The show is legendary for a reason. 
>> ARTICLE
Truly is a series worth the hype
>> ARTICLE
11 days later, I know. No one else will see this. But I just wanted to say I just finished the series myself about twenty minutes ago, and its the best anime I have ever seen. It is exactly what this kind of storytelling is supposed to be like at its best. It really was brilliant.

>> ARTICLE
I finished it this past weekend. LOVE IT. I'm n the middle of my second viewing. It's so much better the second time around.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you loved it! It definitely became one of my favorite animes of all time :)
>> ARTICLE
Just finished this like not even 30 mins ago. It was amazing. I binged the last 9 episode and after the first half i watched like 6 episodes straight every sitting.

Just an amazing series, emotional, tons of drama, so much character development, and with one of my favorite tropes ever,time travel, as the plot makes this a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that you still found my post lol. It's great to see more people finishing Steins;Gate. You should watch the OVA and the movie next. I loved both of them very much.
>> ARTICLE
Yea i searched the subreddit for steins;gate and was surprised yours was only a month ago

I have the movie ready to go, and i guess i'll go dl the OVA

I'm pretty sure none of you guys mentionned it seems it is based on the Epigraph trilogy : these are mangas that are still released currently. I won't spoil anything but the photos about Kurisu in a laptop and the mysterious girl are from the same material, and also depressed Okabe. So basically, in this worldline [Spoiler of the Epigraph manga](/s "[Kurisu is dead, stabbed by her father, and Okabe had to deal with that, you should  definitely read the mangas. Okabe is a mess, and he hears one of Kurisu co-worker is making a meeting in Akihabara about the possibility of putting someone's soul and memory into a computer. So basically, Okabe speaks with a previous version of Kurisu")
[EDIT in my spoiler:](/s "actually I just read the mangas again and it was Okabe who killed her, which makes sense with all the depress look and such. Suzuha tried to make him save her, but he couldn't.")
>> ARTICLE
Can you confirm [somethings?](/s "I just read the first chapter. So in this world time line. It follows the original story up until he himself stabs kurisu and diverges at this point where he chooses to not attempt the steins gate timeline. Is that right? Does that mean he never got his own message? Or got it and chose to ignore it?")
>> ARTICLE
I think [Spoilers](/s "it's the timeline that leads to him sending the message to himself letting him know to try for the Steins;Gate World Line.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "Ohh right, that's why he didn't get a message from himself yet... and why he needed to fail once in the original anime. So this is a prequel! in a sense. That makes me more happier than an alternate story")
>> ARTICLE
YES! Of all the manga spin-offs of Steins;Gate, that one was the most interesting. I would really like to see the anime based off that series, it's very good and it doesn't feel like a forced adaption.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I also thought it was the most original of the spin-offs with new characters, a new timeline and a really good atmosphere! It was originally a trilogy of light novel that I couldn't read (since I don't know Japanese... yet) but it's a shame the mangas have had a hard time getting released recently because of production issues. I'm still waiting for confirmations, but it's weird since they also plan to release a light novel for the game. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's something which is honestly pretty unnecessary to do but it could be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
imo it will go two ways fail hard and devalue original or be as good or better as original resulting in fans loving every second of it.
>> ARTICLE
That's not how it works....

Even if the second season is pure shit on astronomical levels, it doesn't devalue the original.

The first season remains the same regardless of what happens here since its story already closed and it exists on its own and isn't bound by this second season.


>> ARTICLE
Except of course that's exactly how it works,take Darker than Black for example, it would be considered a classic if people weren't so whiny about the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Apples to oranges. Darket than Black Season 2 followed events after season 1 and continued the same storyline.
>> ARTICLE
1. Darker than Black is still loved by many. Every single time I see people asking for recommendations people recommend DtB and advice to simply avoid the 2nd season.

People STILL love the first season, its not like the 2nd season being shit made people say "Oh god don't watch DtB the 2nd season is horrible and therefore the show should not be watched", instead people are simply saying "Watch DtB its great, just avoid the 2nd season".

Your argument is true to shows where the story isn't well contained during the first season, stuff like "Tokyo Ghoul" which is pointless unless you're watching the 2nd season, since there's no actual ending.

Both DtB and S;G had fine (even excellent in S;G's case) endings, NO ONE will say S;G is crap if the second season is crap. Even if the second season is the very worst thing to happen to TV ever, people will still recommend the first season and simply tell people to avoid the 2nd.

tl;dr - you're wrong.
>> ARTICLE
How are my wrong, yes, DtB is recommended as a good anime, but like I said, I'd be considered a masterpiece if it wasn't for S2, right now it's only a really good anime with little flaws.
>> ARTICLE
Did you write on your phone? derp.

Anyway, DtB would have been considered exactly the same, very few considered it as a Masterpiece before S2 was even announced.

Also don't bother to keep arguing, I really can't take you seriously.
>> ARTICLE
nobody takes anything as a masterpiece when it airs, or even shortly after, I really doubt Akira or Princess mononoke were considered masterpieces when they came out. 

Also stop telling me to stop arguing, if you really didn't take me seriously you would have stopped replying a couple of comments back.
>> ARTICLE
You are correct that it wont retroactively muck up the original anime/VN.

However, a shitty season 2 can make a persons perspective and appreciation of the original go down by association even if it is self contained and not affected by the new material.

Hell, if a dude with a Steins Gate t-shirt came up to me yelling tutturu and kicking me in the balls, It would probably me rethink my appreciation of Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
While you're certainly not wrong, that only affects people who can't do a simple separation.

When talking about Darker than Black I'll simply recommend the first season, its as good as the day I first watched it and the 2nd season never made it look any worse to me. Same with Kaiji and plenty of other shows.

So yeah what you're saying is true, but honestly not all people are affected by it and some (hopefully most) can make a clear distinction between parts of a franchise instead of just saying "Franchise 5/10 cause 1 was 10/10 and 2 was 0/10" or stuff along these lines.
>> ARTICLE
Yes absolutely - for some people it is impossible to do view each experience as a separate work. And it is only those who are correct in saying (as for them and people like them): Oh no, they are going to devalue X:(

For me new material like this SG0 is a Win-Win since a well made addition can flesh out the original or give a new angle to think about it. While a new bad material is optional and cant negatively change the original and even make it easier to appreciate.

I really liked Madoka, but after Rebellion I liked it retroactively even more.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree, that's why I'm super excited for S;G0. Worst case scenario we get a bad show that we can simply ignore, best case we got another fantastic addition to an already amazing franchise.
>> ARTICLE
Yes! High Five for Win-Win SG;0 Action!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well, the movie was pretty bad, but it hasn't affected my appreciation for the original season.  I just aggressively ignore it.  Not everyone can do that, but for me, I'm glad this is getting a second season, if just for the gamble that we could get another fantastic show.  If it's bad, oh well.  I was super pleased with Rebellion, so I'd rather not write off stories that seem "complete".
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
As you like.  The movie was original material rather than more VN adapting, so I don't feel so bad about ignoring it and its terrible mechanics.  Hopefully the new VN will have the same key staff as before so they can produce a quality product for the adaptation.

What do you mean by "touch everything in the future"?  I didn't think we were getting more S;G material anyway, other than a few spinoffs.  Do you mean for anime in general, or something else?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
You think there'll be a *third* season of S;G?  That's some impressive optimism.  I hadn't been expecting this season, which is what I meant, but I certainly wouldn't expect anything past that.  Maybe I'm just jaded by the amount of anime without proper conclusions...

And this is a concurrently produced VN and adaptation, it looks like, so it's still technically an adaptation anime.  This means I'll be putting more faith into it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
No that's just dumb.

You can simply ignore whatever they show this season, the first season will still be just as good since the story is self contained even without a sequel.

Your argument holds in cases like say "Aldnoah Zero" or "Tokyo Ghoul", those shows each have two seasons but the story is never contained and you must watch the 2nd season to get the complete experience, therefore the 2nd season of those shows definitely has effect on the shows overall. That is NOT the case for Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
> You can simply ignore whatever they show this season, the first season will still be just as good since the story is self contained even without a sequel.

You can do that with any show. That doesn't stop the masses considering what's aired as being canon. While I agree it doesn't change how good the second season is, it does change the quality of the series overall.

For example if I'm eating a sandwich and the first half is good, then but then the next half tastes awful, I don't say "man that sandwich was great", nor do I say "man that sandwich was awful". I'd probably say "what the hell happened halfway through that sandwich". The important part is that I wouldn't consider it to be two different sandwiches, but rather two parts of the same whole. 

This is exactly the same as with TV shows. You can look at its parts separately but ultimately they're of one whole.
>> ARTICLE
>While I agree it doesn't change how good the second season is, it does change the quality of the series overall

Yes, no disagreement, but this is not the issue. Those people are saying it'll devalue the first season which is stupid.

The first season itself will be just as good, but you could say the franchise as a whole took a hit which is fair.

>This is exactly the same as with TV shows. You can look at its parts separately but ultimately they're of one whole.

Here we shall disagree, this is a case by case basis. With Aldnoah Zero for example I'll agree, both parts make a whole and they're both required. Same for shows like Stardust Crusaders and Tokyo Ghoul and whatnot.

But in cases where the first season wrapped up the story well enough for it to stand on its own, there's no need to view it as "one big season". its part of the franchise, but you can look at it as a spin off if you want. canon in the end is not something that should or shouldn't take from your enjoyment, if you're told "Part 2 is canon" it doesn't mean you have to watch part 2, just watch part 1 and if it ends well then so be it, no need to go with part 2 and it MOST CERTAINLY doesn't make part 1 any worse.

>Jeez, calm down. I'm just playing the other side here. There's no need to take jabs at me.

Uh, ok? I'll really try holding my rage back, thanks for stopping me from getting a heart attack. We all know that using the word dumb is a clear sign of rage and madness, totally my bad.

>That's called headcanon, which is unofficial, and personally, I don't like to use it because it makes me seem ignorant to the world around me. 

I don't wanna sound "mad and raging" but what actually makes you seem ignorant is caring what "the world around you" thinks of your opinion of a show, canon in the end of the day should only deter from your enjoyment if you're ignorant enough to care about that.

"Oh no, I can't enjoy the first season because the second season is considered Canon and therefore the first season is crap". > That makes you seem insanely ignorant. Also I'm still calm, I took mah pillz.

>You'd have to watch the season to know that you want to ignore it, and by then, it's already in your mind, and when you see the first season, you can't help but think of the second one.

Or you know, there's the sane alternative, you can watch the second season and consider it as crap while still loving the hell out of the first.

A:CM is considered canon. I think A:CM is utter and complete bullshit, its retarded beyond reason and one of the worst things to happen in my life. With that said I think Alien is one of the best works of art out there and I love every bit of it, my love for it did not change after A:CM despite it being declared canon. If it had changed, I would consider myself extremely ignorant and childish.

>again, I'm playing devil's advocate.

It's probably based on the existing LN spinoff [Epigraph Trilogy](http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Epigraph_Trilogy) (Spoilers for Steins;Gate within), which I personally think is necessary to grok the True End chapter.

steins gate handled her gender identity badly, but do people not understand that 'he' is actually a transgender girl? 
>> ARTICLE
> do people not understand that 'he' is actually a transgender girl? 

It was my understanding from the anime that Ruka was an unrealistically effeminate guy (hence "daga, otoko da"). He didn't like having his completely girl-like body and being a guy, which is where the d-mail that changed that came in. Transgender stuff wasn't even so much as hinted at. I'm not done reading the VN yet but so far it's exactly the same.

Also, if he were already trans before, then why during that painful scene with Okabe and post-dmail Rukako did Okabe realize his mistake after a grab to her groin? If she were a trans girl before the d-mail made her a born-girl then that couldn't be what tipped Okabe off that the d-mail actually worked.

Yeah, pretty sure Japan isn't all about trans rights tho

Wait who's going to voice Suzuha now that Yukarin has retired?
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
TIME TO COME OUT OF RETIREMENT!
>> ARTICLE
The 3 different Okabe's that matter.

**Alpha:**
The first Okabe sends the D-Mail, and somehow CERN ends up in power.
Kurisu lives but somehow ends up working for CERN.
This Okabe is executed before Suzuha goes back in time.

**Beta:**
The second Okabe exists when Suzuha alters the Alpha timeline, resulting in Beta.
Kurisu dies and WW3 begins; maybe she didn't die after all?
Suzuha goes back in time, but it was under Okabe's orders.
He is still alive, and he was the mastermind behind Steins;Gate.

**Steins;Gate:**
Suzuha goes back in time and helps Okabe achieve reaching Steins;Gate.
We watched this Okabe in the original series.


The Alpha line sounds more interesting to me.
But I'll take whatever I can get.

It'd be nice if somewhere in the middle of the show, he actually sends Suzuha to her 1-way trip to save the world.
But even so, the Beta line continues, and he will have to deal with it.
I wonder how Itaru will handle the loss of his daughter to save a whole other timeline instead of their own...

There's more attractor fields though. 

There's the Gamma attractor field, only described briefly on the wiki as: [Steins;Gate Spoiler for some sort of content from the series] (/s "2000: The Y2K crash occurred successfully due to the discovery of a SERN researcher of one of Okabe's D-mails.
2010: Okabe Rintarou is active as a Rounder, codename: M3. He and Kiryuu Moeka kill agents from Europol who had been investigating them.
By 2036, Okabe Rintarou has joined the leading ranks of the Illuminati of the Committee of 300. He rules as the dictator of Japan under the name Hououin Kyouma.")

The Delta Attractor field, which covers the spin-off VNs Linear Bound Phenogram and Darling of Loving Vows, along with a few other undescribed world lines

Then there's the Omega Attractor Field

[Steins;Gate something spoiler again] (/s "Okabe has no Future Gadget Lab, and is friends with Feiris only. He is a regular player of Rai-Net Access Battlers instead.
Due to the in-existence of the Future Gadget Lab, SERN will not complete their time machine. However, the presence of the Divergence Clock suggests that time travel technology may emerge elsewhere.")

Translation:

***

On ~~Wednesday~~ Saturday the 28th of March, 2015, at Chiyomaru Shikura's "New Game Announcement Meeting in Twitcasting," a new game in the Steins;Gate series was announced. The title is "Steins;Gate Zero." The new title will depict one of the series' pre-existing worldlines, the Beta Worldline, thereby making the numbering appropriate. A drama CD and a novel in three parts will depict "one of the routes" in an edited format. Release date is unconfirmed.

**Additional Information**

Additionally, a "Steins;Gate Zero" anime has also been confirmed. This will also have a "follow-up report" to look forward to.

Exactly, just like Fate/Zero

At least S;G had a good anime adaptation and people aren't forced into the VN. 
>> ARTICLE
Although I would say the VN is better, simply because you can explore different routes and get to play from Okabe's point of view. But you are right, the anime is absolutely excellent and doesn't need the VN to feel complete.

When I saw this pop up I thought it was just a joke. But wow it's legit. Not sure how to feel about this...
>> ARTICLE
interesting


 the trashed building with the machine stuck in it. . . . .what does that mean for Suzuha?
>> ARTICLE
Ok, just to be another one of those people who's explain when they think this is going to take place, I'll do my best to explain.

-Spoilers Ahead-

So I'm pretty sure that because Maho's in these pictures that this is going to be somewhat based on the Heiji Kyokusen no Epigraph manga. That would mean that this takes place in the timeline where [ep. 23 and 24 spoilers](/s "Okabe tried to save Makise but ended up killing her and refused to try again. So now there's no Makise, WW3 is going to happen, and Okabe is still depressed.")

I've read a lot of the Heiji Kyokusen no Epigraph Manga, and if it's going to be similar to that than this is going to be awesome... consider me hyped.

EDIT: I just watched a subed version of the trailer and by what the text said; This is EXACLLY what it will be. Or at least there's a 90% chance of it.

>> ARTICLE
Hey...what happened to that other visual novel that was set on the Steins Gate timeline? The one where they're all 25 and not emotionally shattered?
>> ARTICLE
It got cancelled, sorry. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, never really expected that, and getting an anime adaptation announced before the VN is even out is interesting. 

>The title " Steins gate zero ". One of the world line that appeared to Sakuchu, draw a " world line", is the latest installment of the series, it becomes legitimate numbering works. Story of drama CD and novels trilogy is, things to be recorded as "one of the root". Hard, Release Date to be determined. [Information added]  In addition, " Steins gate zero animation of "is also determined. Here also has just want to wait for further news.

The new outfits for the cast also look pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
I really surprised to hear this because the sequel novel was apparently canceled just recently without me hearing about it somehow. I'm guessing it was in favor of this? [The novel was going to take place in the Stein's Gate world line 6 years later.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate#Light_novel)

>A light novel sequel, set 6 years after the events of the original game and titled Steins;Gate: The Committee of Antimatter was to ship on January 16, 2015.[84][85] However due to "various circumstances", it was announced on December 22, 2014 that its release was cancelled

My problem with this is Steins;Gate ended pretty well perfectly. It was a pretty amazing show and it actually ended. I don't even feel the need to watch the movie but they're making more to it? What if the only thing this ends up doing is messing up how we feel about Steins;Gate?
>> ARTICLE
I'm just wondering if this will count as canon in the existing SciADV (Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Child) universe?
>> ARTICLE
I tried starting this anime, but had a real hard time keeping up. With this announcement I'll push through I guess, but I'm not sure how people can keep up with the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing gets in the way of Daru's gains.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how I feel about this. One the one hand, Steins;Gate is one of my all-time favorite anime. On the other, it had a satisfying conclusion, and I really don't feel like it needs a sequel. I'm kind of scared it'll ruin my experience of the original.
>> ARTICLE
My money is ready.
>> ARTICLE
If this one gets canceled like the Light Novel, /r/anime will burn.
>> ARTICLE
Well it will be interesting considering [VN/anime spoilers](/s "he dies in 2025 by some unknown cause, in alpha it was Nae. In fact from what they talk about in attractor field theory even on the Steins;Gate time line he's supposed to die in 2025")
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I'm thinking about is Mayuri saying tuturu so I am 100% behind this.
>> ARTICLE
I think Steins Gate already ended perfectly (especially with the movie)
but I won't say no to more Steins Gate
>> ARTICLE
Well, accourding to Mages : "Director Chiyomaru Shikura, Steins;Gate 0 will be the "true" sequel and not a fan disc, spin-off, etc. Platform for the game still undecided." 
[Sources](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/03/28-1/video-steinsgate-zero-announced-as-true-sequel-to-steinsgate) [Source2](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-03-28/steins-gate-0-follow-up-game-and-anime-announced/.86470)

Even if the sequel isn't that good or better , this will not change my opinion about the first season Steins;Gate. Being my most fav anime of all time.
looking foward to watch it [](#thumbs-up)
>> ARTICLE
I might be the only one that doesn't like this
>> ARTICLE
i didnt like this too cause it might ruin the series, but from the comments here (dont know if its true) its about the beta timeline which is the timeline on ep1 the one kurisu dies. It might just be a SoL with the characters. Im not 100% on board with it but it might be ok 
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda iffy on it. I love Steins Gate but does it really need to have more stuff?
>> ARTICLE
I think the movie was already unnecessary. I mean, I'll watch it, but I really don't see how this can be a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
As long as they will stay on the same level then i'm happy. The problem is that it's really hard to make sequel of the same quality.
>> ARTICLE
technically its a prequel, since its showing the events of the original timeline. 

Should be interesting at least
>> ARTICLE
It is a prequel, sequel, and completely unrelated all at once. Time Travel is weird that way.
>> ARTICLE
Remember this golden rule.

If it sucks, it never happened. 
>> ARTICLE
Tell that to Final Fantasy XIII. It sucked, but still got two sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Works miraculously well for everything. Tsukihime, Fate/Stay Night 2006, Metroid Other M, the list goes on and on.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah I love that rule the rule goes with Akame ga kill after episode 20 it was over 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure they went anime original after episode 17/18.
>> ARTICLE
After mine vs justice bitch they went anime original which I believe is episode 19 or 20
>> ARTICLE
I'm not so sure on this, but I think this is just showing the alternate universe and not a continuation. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, and by the fact that there's a certain character there, I think that this will be somewhat based on the manga Heijikyokusen no Epigraph... and if it is than this will be really, REALLY good.
>> ARTICLE
It's an alt universe story, so we can keep the true ending in our hearts (that sounds ALOT cheesier than i'd originally thought).
>> ARTICLE
Beta timeline ? Alternative timeline ? 
Means the same characters ? or different ones. 

>> ARTICLE
The beta timeline was the main (original) timeline, aka the one before the first D-mail was sent iirc, so it would be the same characters as well.
>> ARTICLE
So... [](/s "no Kurisu")?
>> ARTICLE
Well [Show spoilers](/s "at the very end of the series and further in the ova she does recognize Okabe and says she is having dreams about kissing him.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know. But if it's supposed to be a timeline where no D-mails were sent, then [](/s "she should be dead"). Unless it's the Steins;Gate worldline, which is technically a part of the beta worldline, right?
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused about this too. I mean, the beta wordline is the first ep, without d-mails right? And [Steins;gate](/s "at the end of the anime, Kurise and Okabe meet eachother and remember eachother. They are in Steins;gate wordline then right? So if this Steins;gate zero is in the beta wordline, this won't be a sequel because it is only a sequel to episode one? My head hurts as hell, I don't get it")
>> ARTICLE
Seriously

[details](/s "There are two times during the anime that we saw the beta time line. At the very beginning before the first DMail was sent, and during ep23 between he cancelling the first DMail and him getting the one from the future. Technically speaking this is an extension of the bad ending. We never saw what happened to Okabe had he not gotten that DMail from his future self, all we see are his shadows in a very blurry video talking about his work to build a better devices to send to the past. It's the timeline where he failed to save Kurisu, and that would play a major part in the story.")

I hope that would be clear enough for you to understand

The show and VN are probably going to be about the 'Pandora of Eternal Return' manga since there is Hijayou Maho and [REDACTED] IA.
>> ARTICLE
yesssss.....nooooooooo......

im so conflicted it can either be fucking good as original and it will be praised as fuck and I will love every second of it, or they will fail hard and every one will hate it and it will lower the overall quality of the original.

there is no midle ground imo
>> ARTICLE
Calling it now: The anime will be directed by Ei Aoki.
>> ARTICLE
That would be hilarious
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if this has any relation to the cancellation of the Light Novel "The Committee of Antimatter" and I was really sad when it got cancelled because it was a direct sequel to the Visual Novel. Even though this adaptation of Steins;Gate is not in the other time line... I'm super excited to see how everything unfolds because we never go to learn of the events in the time line in depth and it has alot of potential of being exciting. Hopefully maybe the English translation process of the VN will officially be done so that we wouldn't have to wait a long time.
>> ARTICLE
i don't know whether i should be happy about this.
my first thought is "yay, more steins;gate!" and my second thought is "did we really need this?" and my third thought is telling the other two to shut up
The only real conclusion i can make from this is that i really should try out the VN
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah Im playing through the VN currently
>> ARTICLE
So stoked for this, loved the first one! Hope they don't fuck this one up though...
>> ARTICLE
YOOOOOOOOOOOO

But damn I did not see this coming
>> ARTICLE
I thought I knew which timeline this one was, but i guess i was wrong. Someone help me out?
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the Beta timeline is the one we see the series start out on. The one Kurisu gets stabbed in, just before Okabe jumps to the Alpha line.
>> ARTICLE
So the one it ends on too?
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't it end in the Steins;Gate time/world line?

Might be wrong, though.
>> ARTICLE
Yup the Steins; Gate worldline is the ending, this is the worldline the original anime starts on.
>> ARTICLE
Out of nowhere ;u; ... my favourite anime characters come back to life 
>> ARTICLE
We could actually have a true antagonist instead of the implied overlord SERN. maybe a trip to the future would be nice also.  I'll watch.
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't know what I should expect now. I'm afraid that they will really mess it up just because they realized there is still money to make. I mean Steins;Gate was not one of the animes/vn that needed a sequel (in comparison to many other animes) because it had a perfect ending, a fitting movie and some funny specials (for fanservice) ... but still I hope that this won't happen and that they will blow our minds again just like Steins;Gate did it with us
>> ARTICLE
There can never be enough of Okabe or Kurisu. It will definitely be interesting to see how this story will play out.
>> ARTICLE
WHY? It is perfect the way it is ... 
>> ARTICLE
It's a different timeline.
>> ARTICLE
This seems so unnecessary, but when  the best anime I ever watched get a sequel I can't help but get excited T-T
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect this and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Apparently is based on some already existing spin off?

Well, it will be already a great thing if it is not as Robotic;Notes.
>> ARTICLE
More steins gate? 

More steinsss gateee :]
>> ARTICLE
As long as Shikura Chiyomaru is on board I am a happy panda.

So many people seem worried about this and also see it very unnecessary. Depending on how this is done, due to it being a time travel story it can very easily not affect anything we've watched so far so people need not worry and should be hopeful. If they do this right they could build on the layers they've already added and make some very interesting story.
>> ARTICLE
Inb4 april fools

But seriously I love this news!
>> ARTICLE
Oh my God. I never expected this, and I am hyped!
>> ARTICLE
this is the best news of the year *_*
>> ARTICLE
Can someone remind me, what is the beta timeline? And what will this mean exactly?
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling this is going to be either better than the original or flat out terrible
>> ARTICLE
So by beta timeline are they referring to [Steins;Gate](/s "the dark future where CERN has taken over?")
>> ARTICLE
No, that's the Alpha
>> ARTICLE
[Steins;Gate](/s "but isn't the alpha where everything turns out good and no one dies? The 'path of steins;gate'?")
>> ARTICLE
That's SteinsGate. Just remember in which world line was the term "alpha" brought up
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series but can't remember/dont know.. What is the beta timeline?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers for the different Timelines](/s "World B is where the show started and Kurisu is fated to die. This is the time where WW3 happens. World A is where the show jumped to after the first d-mail where Maiyuri is fated to die and CERN takes over the world. World Steins;Gate is almost like B except that Kurisu's death is faked, everyone lives, CERN doesn't take over and WW3 never happens. That is the timeline where the show ends and the move takes place in.")

So this show is supposed to be about timeline B [More Spoilers](/s "In Timeline B Okabe still traveled through time in an attempt to save Kurisu and Mayuri. In fact the entire show is still true in this timeline as Timeline B Okabe went through all of the same things in an attempt to prevent either from dying. Near the end of the show Okabe almost gives up when he receives a message from a future Okabe. That future Okabe is Okabe B and he is the one responsible for sending Suzuhua back to save Kurisu by faking here death and allowing that Okabe, Okabe S;G to enter the Steins;Gate line.") so we will get to see all the shit that Okabe went through afterwards before he gets a chance to make things right.
>> ARTICLE
haven't watched steins;gate in a while but doesn't WW3 happen in 2015 in the anime? really cool if they planned to have a sequel to be made this year
>> ARTICLE
Why? Steins;Gate ended perfectly... there was no need for a sequel.

But I guess it's alright if it manages to be as good as the original.
>> ARTICLE
It's technically not a sequel as the event took place within the story itself
>> ARTICLE
THEY BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP. if they don't, i'll be really happy, but if they do i will be sooo pissed.
>> ARTICLE
so much butthurt/milking blablabla comments, as a diehard fan of S;G I just don't fucking care, I'll enjoy watching/reading this so much. Can't believe we're getting more. I'M SO HYPED!!

> so much butthurt/milking blablabla comments

For a reason, people are skeptical it won't live up to its predecessor.

Woo-hoo, more Steins;Gate!

Really hope this one dosent get canceled like the Light Novel... that would make me really sad :(
>> ARTICLE
What is VN? And beta timeline was the original timeline right?
>> ARTICLE
VN = Visual Novel. Think interactive book with art + audio. Check out the wiki at /r/visualnovels for a better explanation.
>> ARTICLE
Can I ask you something? I just watched the trailer, does the sequel going to have the same artwork like in the trailer?
>> ARTICLE
The VN will, dont think the anime will if White Fox (the studio that adapted the original) adapts it. That's one of the things I didn't like about the adaption of the original VN, it lost the beautiful artstyle of the VN. 
>> ARTICLE
I need a refresher, what was the beta timeline?

HOLY SHIT HYPEEEEE

Here's to best girl Maho getting animated!! :D

OMG THIS IS THE BEST NEWS WTF

I highly recommend everyone check out the Epigraph of the Closed Curve manga to understand what this will be about. Character development is gonna be great in this. :)
>> ARTICLE
I think this is the best news I've heard all month!
>> ARTICLE
I might be mistaken but... Is that Kurisu's mom on the far right? I'm asking because I can't remember seeing this character anywhere in the Epigraph trilogy thus far, which Steins;Gate 0 seems to be based on. If it's her, then yay! We finally know what she looks like!

I also hope that they release in America and for pc. ^_^ only time can tell.
>> ARTICLE
Wait so is this anime focusing on []( /s "The reign of SERN and the resistance group?") because if so I am so hyped for this 
>> ARTICLE
It's the third Madoka film all over again. 

Unnecessary. 

Consider me not hyped 
>> ARTICLE
It fleshed out an ending that was glossed over though, so should be good supplementary stuff unlike that forced sequel
>> ARTICLE
Fleshed it out - then flushed it down the toilet. I thought Madoka's ending was perfect, though I feel I'm in a minority when I say that. 

At least this, due to the nature of the timeline, can't affect the original in any way. 
>> ARTICLE
So I tried to give this series a shot a while back, but I just couldn't get into it. Does it get better after a few eps?
>> ARTICLE
It starts out really slowly, looks like a regular meh SoL show, then around the middle (think its ep12) the consequences of messing with the past starts to show themselves and it turns into a very engaging thriller.
>> ARTICLE
The first episodes are kind of slow, especially if you are not a fan of slice of life, but the show really starts to shine in the later episodes. I believe you should give it another try!
>> ARTICLE
First episode has a good hook of mystery at the end
>> ARTICLE
It was voted /r/anime's all time favorite anime last year and is 2nd highest user rated on anime database sites like Myanimelist, hummingbird, and anime-planet (interestingly second only to Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood in each case). Suffice to say, even with no idea what your tastes and preferences are, statistically it's very likely to win you over by the end of it. 

It won me over, and if anything the visual novel it's based on is even better. Stick with it, after all even the biggest rollercoasters have a slow steady buildup and a rollercoaster is exactly what this anime is.
>> ARTICLE
Give it 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
and if you then dont like it just watch the rest since you are already through half the show.

Really this sounds so stupid. Watch half the show and maybe you will like it. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to finish this show.
>> ARTICLE
So is it like, another VN is coming out that will also be adapted into an anime?

Sounds cool anyway, didn't really expect that one, looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I'm confused. Aren't there tonnes of different timelines in Stein's Gate as the result of each time leap/D mail? Will we continue on from where [episode 14 or something](/s "Mayuri dies")? I can't say I really understood the time travel in Stein's Gate so maybe this is all wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
>  can't say I really understood the time travel in Stein's Gate so maybe this is all wrong. 

how.. by the end it should be pretty obv and they explain it through the show and its kinda easy to understand, its whole point of the show imo.. you should read up about it to understand it.
>> ARTICLE
Well considering all the responses to my post say different things, as well as most of the people in this thread not being able to answer similar questions, then I don't think it's very simple, no. 
>> ARTICLE
its the time line before d-mail was sent and ww3 happened.
>> ARTICLE
The beta timeline is the one he lived in before he sent the first d-mail.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so this is the world where [episode 1](/s "Kurisu stays dead")?
>> ARTICLE
yup
>> ARTICLE
Isnt it where [show spoilers](/s "she lives and never meets the lab crew? Where at the very end of the series she and Okabe walk by eachother and Kurisu recognizes Okabe.")
>> ARTICLE
That's SteinsGate, not the beta
>> ARTICLE
Ah right of course.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure really, everyone's saying different things. If it was that then I don't know if it would be very interesting as you wouldn't get much of a story out of that. 

Other people are saying it's the SERN dystopia/WW3 route, which would make sense from a story perspective. We see the other Okarin who lives through that I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler just to be sure](/s ""The story of the game and the anime adaptation take place on the beta world line, where Okabe could not save his precious person, Kurisu, on July 28, and ended up returning alone. However, the trailer for the game notes that Okabe does not know that Kurisu is in fact still there."")

Welp time to watch the original steins gate

>> ARTICLE
So it's  not the endless love and praise that pushed you to watch it, but rather the announcement of a spinoff season? O_o    Odd
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested, although it feels unnecessary. If it's exploring another timeline then it just feels a bit like a 'what if?' story, but if it's handled well then I'm up for it; it'll be interesting to see how the other timelines go. It won't detract from the original series in anyway, just another version of what could've been. The original Steins;Gate will always be the 'definitive' telling of what happens to me, though. Everyone looks pretty depressed in the image though, so I hope it isn't all bad events, haha.

The more I think about it, the more excited I am!
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth, it looks like it'll be less "what if" and more "this is what the series told us about without actually showing us."

Based on the trailer and the way the characters were presented, it looks like it'll be the world line triggered near the end of the series where Okabe goes back in time to do something and fails, but _before_ he goes back to try the same thing differently a second time.

[Less vague:](/s "Kurisu is dead either at her father's or Okabe's own hands.  WWIII is looming.  The story might be the build up toward "future" Okabe figuring out that staging rather than completely preventing Kurisu's death is the key to jumping into the "happy ending" Steins;Gate attractor field.  The whole series could theoretically take place between the events of EP24 of the original anime series.")

That's the way current speculation is heading by other posters, and, given the trailer, I'm inclined to believe it.

Why
>> ARTICLE
Why not? Money will be made where there's money to be made.
>> ARTICLE
Your right, it's just one of those cases of why can't they let something be done. I'm okay with spin offs, a direct sequel just feels like an especially gross way to milk the franchise. 

Then again, it could be great, but I'm not particularly hopeful. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, this is the first time there's been a direct sequel to a SciADV novel. All the others (Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Child) have been independent stories from each other, with little character overlap besides Nae being in R;N. So this is the first time 5pb/Nitro+ have done something like this.
>> ARTICLE
Could mean anything still. 

S;G is by far their most successful work, if I'm not wrong. It would make sense from a financial perspective to want to do more with it, but then again they could have more they legitimately want to do with the characters. 

We'll just have to wait and see. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, while I still think it's strange for them to do a direct sequel to a SciADV novel, if they're going to do it, Steins;Gate would be the most profitable since it's a name everyone knows.
>> ARTICLE
To call it a sequel would be erroneous.

It's based on the Epigraph Trilogy of novels and Drama CD Beta, side material that explains what happened to the Okabe that failed to save her in the Beta Attractor. It introduced several characters who will show up in this, such as Kurisu's senior lab partner, Hiyajou Maho.

The plot involves Kurisu's original research that involves implanting memory data into an AI, and a conspiracy surrounding it.
>> ARTICLE
When? WHEN???
>> ARTICLE
It seems more like a Spin-Off than a true sequel. There has actually been quite a few spin off vns of Steins;Gate already. I doubt this one will be any different from them, other than it having an anime. I predict people will overhype it and as a result they will bash it when it comes out, due to it not living up to the hype. In reality it is actually a pretty solid anime.

I guess it retrospect it was really good; I admit its the only "originally was a dating game" anime I ever watched; I guess the scifi and time travel elements sold a lot people including myself.

I love the entirety of the existing Steins;Gate Anime/movies. However, I can honestly say I'm not particularly thrilled about this. If it is a good Anime and folks like it, then more power to them. For myself though, I doubt I'll watch this. In my mind, the story has already been finished, and I have no desire for additional knowledge of other timelines. They'd just serve as a confusion and distraction to the 'real' story.

So....what? The Timeline where Kurisu is dead and WWIII begins? Wtf? How can you have a sequel story when you're secondary protagonist is supposed to be dead already? They'd better not pull an Aldnoah Zero here.
>> ARTICLE
Don't think I'll watch, the core of Stein's Gate comes from it's time travel plot device. The characters by themselves are pretty poor, completely carried by an interesting plot.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more, the whole anime gets carried by the plot, Their world is small and a bit uninteresting, they rarely visit anything besides okabe's appartment. "Welcome to the NHK", "Ergo Proxy", "Texnolyze" are way better in regards to having a captivating world + characters who actually live in it.

Everything else aside, what the fuck is wrong with Japanese and their stupid sequel/spinoff naming? If it occurs in "beta" timeline (dunno if it's true, couldn't suffer through more than three episodes of S;G drivel - nothing fucking happens), why not call it "Steins;Gate Beta"? It makes sense, especially since it's not a sequel. "Zero" implies it's prequel.

Oh who am I kidding, it's the same industry that numbers seasons using exclamation marks.

Because they don't know how to use english, but since english sounds cool they'll use it anyway.

Not the mention the show is actually nasty, [spoiler](/s "every world line where Mayushi dies keeps going on, even after Okabe left. It's not directly mentionned but that's how the travel time logic works in the anime")

edit: nevermind apparently my Creation and World management knowledge suck.
>> ARTICLE
Does that Mean okabe disappears from the changed world line, or is stuck in a branched world line where the time travel failed? Also, in making the steins;gate world line, didn't he nullify the alpha world lines by canceling the initial time travel?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Okabe disappears from a world line when he sends his thoughts back in time to a new one. He just copies his thoughts and sends them back I believe. 
>> ARTICLE
So then the time travel would for him, in fact fail in that world line?
>> ARTICLE
It would probably seem like it, I guess. Or maybe he can tell it was sent back, but is still where he is.

Pretty sad when you think about most of the times he uses that thing.

>> ARTICLE
But If it is the first Okabe, and he sees the time travel "Fail", and Miyuri can't be saved, then in his temporary world line, miyuri WAS dead, and he would have to deal with her gone. Also, in most cases where he would need to save her, he would die (or be incapacitated) shortly after, that would be a null point?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Yes? Mayuri would indeed be dead in the original's world line, hence why I said it was pretty sad?

What do you mean null point?
>> ARTICLE
the Steins;gate world line IS the original world line, but what i was trying to say is your point didn't matter, as for each okabe up the chain, mayuri would have died one less time.
>> ARTICLE
no, the beta world line is the original. not the steins;gate. 
>> ARTICLE
Well yes, you are correct that for each okabe up the chain Mayuri has died one less time. What I meant was sad is that there are still so many world lines with dead Mayuris and grieving/dead Okabe. All the situations he fought to change still exist. That's all I was saying, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this is true. The anime explains pretty clearly what's going on.

If it worked like you're claiming the entire show would be pointless in the extreme.

[The](/s "worldlines that Okabe isn't in don't exist in normal time.")

>> ARTICLE
/u/punxsatownyphil is right

the way suzuha explained it, there's only one timeline active, which would be the one he's in. all the others become mere potential timelines after you move away from them. 

otherwise there would be no point in trying to change timelines to stop cern or save mayuri, all you would accomplish would be selfishly running away from your old timeline. 
>> ARTICLE
[movie spoiler - mouseover at your own risk](/s "if this was strictly correct, the movie would not be possible")
>> ARTICLE
Wait what? The other timeline DON'T exist? I thought they did? I thought they all existed and it was pretty much Okabe just running from one timeline to the next, except not really cause one Okabe moves, another stays and has to deal with the world. Thats why the show was so god damn depressing for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Then how do the inactive timelines keep on being "emulated"?
>> ARTICLE
> emulated

are...are you using the right word?
>> ARTICLE
Not sure, I took that from French. 

But I guess you could translate by "working" or "running"
>> ARTICLE
>Not sure, I took that from French.

wait...what? emulate comes directly from latin. aemulatio, meaning "the attempt to rival"

anyway the answer is that the other timelines are not functional. only the active timeline exists 
>> ARTICLE
he probably translated the word he intended to use from french
>> ARTICLE
To elaborate on that, whenever something/someone travels through time, the entire universe is reconstructed in accordance with the events that changed. There's only one active divergence value at a time, but it can change whenever someone sends D-Mail or something similar.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought of it the way /u/Valiox does; the other world lines continue existing even when Okabe isn't there.  The movie helps shed light on the subject, and seems to support the idea that the other world lines keep going and can affect each other.

To be honest the dub for this anime was great and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I saw the japanese version too, and I don't find it better than the dub.

The characters voices in english is how I would have imagined them to sound if I had never heard them speak before, I was thoroughly impressed with the performance that was given by all the actors.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Accept I'm Canadian:D

I enjoy both subbed and dubbed actually, there are many series that I prefer subbed compared to the dubbed counter-part.

But let's be honest, all that really matters is what version you saw first, that's the version you will like more. Also, when I watch a dub I don't look to see if the characters sound like the japanese version. Their voice actors, not voice imitators. 
>> ARTICLE
all that really matters is what version you saw first. i wish more people understood that concept

>> ARTICLE
Spoken like someone that's never seen the dub.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you watched the dubs. Bad choice. They make some.... lets just say poor decisions with how to localize certain scenes. Especially the scene with the Black guy. Some of the characters also come off all wrong in the dub. Suzuha for example is much more bratty than she was in the original, she's supposed to be such a sweet girl.
>> ARTICLE
General rule of thumb : Dont watch dubs 
>> ARTICLE
The dub saves Daru, and there really is no way to make the scene with the black guy work in English.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. I am not faulting the people who made the dub for doing it wrong. There are just some scenes that don't translate. Also I don't know what you mean by "The dub saves Daru". I loved Daru in the original but felt he was much worse in the dub. At least me personally. 
>> ARTICLE
^ lol this kid. You new around here?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, not even slightly. I have given my opinion on dubs on multiple occasions. If you actually read some of my other comments in this thread you will know that I have legitimate reasoning for disliking dubs beyond the dumb "American voice actors suck, Japan is better at everything" bullshit you hear weeaboo spouting. It comes down to physical limitations of any dubbing process that leave even the best of dubs objectively inferior to subs (but you can still prefer dubs, that is fine but that is a subjective opinion based on tastes).
>> ARTICLE
The dub is great. I'm aware the subs are good too, but the dubs are very good. 

It's true they mishandled Suzahu *a little*, but overall the whole thing sounded great. Especially that scene with the black guy, even though they are indeed different both sub and dub handled the scene *great*!
>> ARTICLE
The dub scene with the black guy made Okabe seem racist. The original he was just trying to speak english, it had nothing to do with the guy being black it had to do with him not being Japanese. I understand that it's hard to deal with that when you are dubbing, but that's just one of the many reasons why you are always going to end up with a technically inferior product any time you dub it from any language to any other language. 
>> ARTICLE
I see what you are saying, and I suppose you're right about that scene.

But

>you are always going to end up with a technically inferior product any time you dub it from any language to any other language

I still cannot agree with this. Have you watched Baccano!? It's very well dubbed, and while I believe the japanese dub is supposed to be of high quality there is no way it can compare with the english one. The accents combined with the great job done in general just can't be beat. Lad Russo's monologues, for example, are just fantastic.

That Steins;Gate example is a scene literally centred around what language is being spoken. To take that example and use it to assert that all dubs are technically inferior is just wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I've written up long discussions many times about this. Basically there are a bunch of reasons and this is only one of them.

The biggest issues are lip flap synching and character portrayal. Lip flap synching is the issue of trying to match up the new dialogue so that it looks like the characters are actually saying the right stuff. When done well this involves large amounts of reanimated lip motions, but this is expensive. Thus most of the time it instead involves lots of rephrasing which at best makes conversations loose a lot of nuances, and at worst leads to super awkward phrasing and two shows that are almost completely different. 

Character portrayal is another issue that a lot of people overlook. The original voice actors get a lot of direction from the series director and the original author on how their character is supposed to act and sound. The dubbers don't get that same coaching. Often times they have not watched the original. Thus they give a different spin to the character that often does not match the dialogue as well, and usually leads to a few scenes throughout the series feeling out of character for the new version of the character.

This is not about American voice acting being bad or about Japan being superior or any of that dumb stuff that a lot of Weeboo spout. This is about all material being better in it's original language. In fact the best way to watch anime would be to learn Japanese as even subs loose things in translation, but it is obviously not realistic to expect every anime fan to learn Japanese. However if you are serious about having the technically superior experience subs are the way to go. If you have a preference for english voices that is a subjective thing that makes dubs better for you but has nothing to do with subs being objectively superior. Even in shows where the dubs are really really well done there will still be a few scenes that either have awkward phrasing, reduced nuance of dialogue, and seemingly out of character actions. For some people one or 2 times out of a series may not be a big deal, but I prefer to have zero times. 

ps. A show in it's original language is not a dub. There is no Japanese Dub of Baccano. And the sub of baccano is actually still technically better than the Dub and is a superior experience. Yes I have seen both.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean, and you make good points. So I suppose you are correct, in that more or less every dub will be weaker 'technically' than the original.

But it's important to remember that defining the comparison in that way is not useful. A better question would be which offers the better experience. All of your points still apply of course, but there are a few things to remember:

1. You are now reading the dialogue rather than listening. This essentially turns character voices into background sounds, which is a definite difference from actually having lines delivered to you by the characters by speaking.

2. Nuances in tone and accent. It's pretty reasonable to think that when you are listening to a language you don't speak you are going to miss out on a lot of subtleties about *how* things are said. Not completely of course, most emotion comes through. But I don't think I could recognize japanese with a Scottish accent, or japanese with an australian accent, etc. It's all just japanese, spoken behind words I'm reading.

Like you mention, it's subjective how much these factors effect your experience and vary from person to person and show to show, but there's no denying that there are inherent advantages to lines being delivered in a language you speak.

To be clear I watch both, at any given time I've got some shows on the go I'm watching subbed and some I'm watching dubbed.

>A show in it's original language is not a dub. There is no Japanese Dub of Baccano.

Well I'm pretty sure you understand what I mean, and I don't know of a way to referring to the original dub of a show that isn't much more clumsy than saying 'dub'. 

>And the sub of baccano is actually still technically better than the Dub and is a superior experience. Yes I have seen both.

I will definitely have to disagree with you here. You may prefer the sub, but dub is the superior experience for me here. The accents and line delivery really sell the experience for me in this show, and they are lost on me when spoken in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who does not speak Japanese but watches almost exclusively subs at this point, I can say that it does not take long to start being able to pick out a lot of difference nuances. I can tell when someone's Japanese sounds strange, and I can pick out a Kansai accent. Additionally subers usually put an effort in to keeping these nuances in the subs. Yes you still loose a bunch but I would argue you lose more via dubs. Additionally I don't even realize I'm reading rather than listening anymore. It's more of absorbing. I read along at the pace of the talking so it seems completely natural. There was a period of time where I read too fast and finished phrases before the dialouge was done which sometimes hurt dramatic effect, but people naturally adapt fairly quickly.
>> ARTICLE
> The original he was just trying to speak english, it had nothing to do with the guy being black it had to do with him not being Japanese. 

Uh it kind of did, why else would he try to speak English to a black guy other than assuming he isn't Japanese?

>> ARTICLE
Well he as not Japanese. He happened to know broken Japanese. The scene could have worked just as well with a blonde obviously American guy.

Yeah Suzuha was really charming in the sub.

Check my dubs, of which there are none. Subs only son.

Strange, I found Suzuha really endearing and I only watched the dub.

Not only that but there are Doctor Who and Portal references in dub are pretty well done as well.

I'm pretty sure Okabe even references Kurisu being a redditor or something.

>> ARTICLE
It's not my opinion that they way the characters were portrayed was different. It is my opinion that it was worse. I said the decisions made were questionable. That is not the same as saying bad. Some people could like the changes more, I acknowledge that. However when you consider that an author has an intended way they want a character to be portrayed when they write the story, you can argue that the original is superior (which is does not necessarily mean its better).
>> ARTICLE
> However when you consider that an author has an intended way they want a character to be portrayed when they write the story,

Do not presume to know how a creator wants to portray a character, or assert that all members of the audience must interpret art the same way. And before you say you are not doing so, I provided a quote from your previous comment. So all you have to do now is admit wrong doing and apologize.

>you can argue that the original is superior (which is does not necessarily mean its better).

You "can" argue... Well of course. You can argue anything. Stop wasting internet space with poorly thought out revelations.

>Well thats like, your opinion man.

The dubs honestly weren't bad at all. J. Michael Tatum did a fantastic job as Okabe and most of the other cast was good, too. Much better dubbing than usual.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't say I had a problem with the voices. The voices were fine. I had a problem with some of the localization of lines and portrayal of characters. That's a completely separate issue from quality of voice acting.
>> ARTICLE
J. Michael Tatum also did an amazing job writing the dub. I became a huge fan of him after his work with Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
>J. Michael Tatum also did an amazing job writing the dub.

Yup. I've read a lot about the work that went into making the S;G dub. I could really feel the passion and responsibility those involved with the E-dub had for the show; especially when considering how unusually important dialogue was for the show.

Tatum's def a G in my book.
>> ARTICLE
I won't argue they did fantastically well with the dialogue.  I was however kind of expecting that manic/normal voice switch that the Japanese VA managed to pull off with Okabe, and that was absent in the dub.  I find it somewhat jarring.

The rest was fantastic though, watching some of the scenes in sub then dub and seeing just what they did to capture both the essence and spirit of the lines is great.

Kurisu's dub totally blew me away.  The emotion.

>> ARTICLE
>Kurisu's dub totally blew me away. The emotion.

Ya, I watched S:G when it was being aired and love it, so it's no surprise that I became very attached to the voices. I never thought I would accept anything other than Kurisu's Japanese VA but thankfully I was wrong.

hopefully they dub it

Please dont forget the watch the OVA before the movie, not really a big deal if you dont but the ova is so good too
>> ARTICLE
I did watch the OVA :D
>> ARTICLE
The OVA made it so much better, it was definitely the best OVA i have seen added to a show. It just makes the ending happier knowing that they do get back together.
>> ARTICLE
It was mostly good, but I thought it was stupid how Okabe said he remembers things because of his Reading Steiner ability.  Didn't he say in the show that there was no such thing as Reading Steiner, and everyone is linked to their other selves in other world lines?  I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they made a big deal about it.  Wasn't that also part of why Mayuri gets progressively depressed as the series goes on?  They say all this stuff that has a great effect on the show, and then just contradict all of it in the OVA.
>> ARTICLE
He remembers everything clearly while the others memories are fuzzy dreams that only appear when he reminds them. Feyris lived for ten years without remembering anything until he started to question her and show her where May Queen used to be.
>> ARTICLE
Still, I'm pretty sure he said Reading Steiner didn't really exist in the show.  If he's the only one remembering things clearly, then what the heck did he mean?  It is obviously a thing.

Maybe it's because I saw the Funimation sub.  Their subtitles are exactly the same as the dub's dialogue, and I heard they screwed up much of the show.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was a mistranslation or something.

I'm not even mad though.  It just gives me another reason to go back and re-watch the series.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't know if that was the case. He is definitely different, the question is just how different? Especially because it was even said that he got really sick as a kid after collapsing and he said that must have been the first time he felt the world lines shift.
>> ARTICLE
> Still, I'm pretty sure he said Reading Steiner didn't really exist in the show


Its made clear that it *does* exist, both in the dub and sub, just that its not a skill unique to Okabe, though he has it the strongest.
>> ARTICLE
YES.  That was exactly it.  It's been a while since I've seen the show.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't say there was no such thing as Reading Steiner (or maybe he did but whether or not those were his exact words I'm not sure) he just said that everyone has it.
>> ARTICLE
Is it really that good? Alright, I guess I'll hope on the train then. 
>> ARTICLE
Give it a bit to kick in, I gave up after episode 3 because it wasn't interesting enough for me but I decided to give it another shot and I really enjoyed it. The first half is just character development, then it gets insanely good. Easily in my top ten now.
>> ARTICLE
Second point to above: I would say to watch it only when it catches your interest, not only because other people say that it's great. It IS great, but if you aren't entertained by it, there's no point in watching.

I strongly disliked episodes 23 and 24
>> ARTICLE
I loved the series as it was (will give anyone a "just watch it" recommendation), but I agree that I would have liked it more if it ended on 22. The end of episode 22 was able to make me react with very strong emotions similar to how [Anohana's ending](/spoiler) or [Angel Beats Otonashi being rescued from train](/spoiler) made me feel. Moments like those that leave a lasting impression would make me rate an anime 10/10, but I felt cheated when episode 23 and 24 of Steins;Gate [undid](/spoiler) what happened in 22. Removed the "lasting impression" in favor of "closure," unfortunately. But I guess some people might enjoy the show even more because they prefer the latter.
>> ARTICLE
The way the story was structured from the first episode kind of prevented it from ending at ep 22, there would have to have been major changes.
>> ARTICLE
Why?  I thought it was cool how they tied everything together.
>> ARTICLE
While I personally liked them because ending on 22 would have left a hole inside me, I think they are reasonable to dislike.  The story would have ended on such a difficult decision, but the best decision available, benefiting everyone but Okabe.  It kind of feels like out of no where they slap on 2 extra episodes and EVERYTHING works out perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
It's cus it's the "true end" of the story, the game can end with Okabe just going back to the world line, but Kurisu still being dead, but the true end is that he saves her.
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't already, I suggest watching the other two shows in that universe. Chaos;Head , and Robotics;Notes. They're both great shows and worth the watch.

I finished it today as well. It was on my Plant to Watch list on MAL for a year, and now, after watching it, I can that it was there for a year too long. 

----
(Wall of Text imminent)

I'm blown away. I watched S;G in two sittings, eps 1-7 and 8-24+OVA. 

Where do I even start? (oh, this post will be ridden with spoilers, I'll try my best to mark most of them, but still, beware!)

Let's start with **OP**. As mentioned above I pretty much marathoned the series but I only skipped the OP about three times, because every second mattered. I wanted to watch the next scene as soon as possible. I'm a person that doesn't usually watch OPs, I'll watch it a few times decide if I'm liking it and move on, but Hacking to the Gate, was different. It just smashed its way to my top10 OP list. And due to the nature of the anime it felt (especially in the latter half of the show) like watching/listening to it was like embarking on a new adventure (I didn't even pay attention to translation of the lyrics). 

Let's move a bit: **First Half of the show**

Heard that it was weak/boring. It was slower, that's true, but it provided the two bases for the whole show, introduced and outlined the characters, as well as build the premise very thoroughly. I'm a person that likes when both 'ingredients' are well developed so I don't have any complaints here. [I'm talking about](/s "Learning about SERN's experiments, analyzing them as well as figuring out the possible complications - without this the show wouldn't have been so good").

[Mad scientist and the well developed female cast](/s "And there's some romance involved, but it's not forcing itself to your screen, it's just there, tagging along, serving as at tool to get the viewer hooked up on particular characters even more. The cast is really wide: One Tsundere, one Childhood friend, one reliable Tomboy, one cosplaying Loli, one closed character with Yanderish tendencies and one Trap. Not everyone is involved romantically but they are still somehow connected to Okabe." )

**The Latter Half**

Suddenly someone pushed pedal to the metal and nothing remained the same. On top of the strong bases the writers built [more character developement](/s "There's another reason why Mayushi was in the show instead of her ~tutturu~ every now and then, Okabe turns out to be a real man, Suzu is even more awesome than she was /yeah, you got me, she's my fav character/, Kurisu shows her sweet and caring side... Only Daru could've used a little bit more attention but he's still good." ) Some really good action (see it yourself) and [drama](/s "don't even get me started on Suzu, I cried my eyes out during her departure only to get my heart eaten alive by ravens just few minutes later").

[Then comes the end](/s "one of the best closed stories I've seen, that's all I've got to say").

Minor things that irked me? The way Faris spoke. She reminded me of Dekomori from Chu2 with that and I don't like Dekomori too much, but that's only a really, really minor thing.


---
PS. I'm currently waiting for the Movie and I'm going to play the Visual Novel as soon as I'll get some more time on my hands.

PS2. Double checked if I used spoiler tags correctly, but alert me if something else should be marked as spoilers. 

---
**tl;dr: If you haven't already, Hack to the Gates yourself, don't be me and don't put S;G on your plan to watch list for a year, that's just silly, watch it.**



>> ARTICLE
I think you messed up something with the spoilers...
>> ARTICLE
Now you know why I kept telling you to watch it ;)
[BTW](/s "As far as favourite characters go, mine will always be Kurisu,  especially in the moments when she recognizes that Okabe time-leaped and helps him to come up with a solution to Mayushi's death etc.")

>> ARTICLE
I really hate using "harem" to describe steins;gate, seeing as it pretty much isn't, like at all. 

There's no love interest between anyone except Okabe and kurisu for pretty much 99% of the show. Not to mention the other members of the so called "harem" are: a male, a childhood friend whose relationship with the MC is strictly brother/sister, a mysterious girl lacking screen time and any possible love interest, and a weird cat-girl who realistically had the best chance outside of the obvious choice.
>> ARTICLE
After reading your reply I think I should've worded my original post differently. 

I should start with: "wide & well developed female cast" and go from there, just the word 'harem' was the first thing that came to my mind. 

I stand corrected, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I just really hate harems as a concept in general.
>> ARTICLE
I did the exact same as you! Put it off for ages, then EP 1-7 then 8-24+OVA today :D
>> ARTICLE
I fell asleep during the movie like 4 times and had to keep restarting it.  Pretty good though.

The anime was a classic,and I dont like many shows without much action. 
>> ARTICLE
I also just recently finished it, truly was a brilliant show. Couldn't have wished for a better ending.
>> ARTICLE
After watching the first 4-5 episodes a few times and not really getting into it I decided to push through and see what was on the other side. I finished it about 30 seconds ago and I loved it. It was really good and I too am very interested to see how they can further the story line from here in a movie. It exceeded my expectations from the first few episodes for sure.

It sucks I finished it but at the same time I don't feel sad like I do with some anime after they finish (I'm looking at you Toradora. Idc how amazing you were - I am dissatisfied for the most part!) and I genuinely enjoyed watching it. I love a MC with bouts of personality so that was a big bonus too.
>> ARTICLE
i still now only drink dr. pepper because of that anime
>> ARTICLE
I just finished to. I am so sad that I finished but it was fucking beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
I am not a very emotional person. I could not stop crying during episode 22.
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler alert, if I hadn't watched it already I'd be annoyed because I'd know it has a happy ending just from your title.
>> ARTICLE
The title does say "it has a happy ending," it says "I am so happy." The same could be said after watching a good performance of Macbeth, but would you call that a happy ending?
>> ARTICLE
I think this is one of those cases where technically you are correct, but I look at you with "the look" and say "but c'mon." 9/10 times out of ten it will be for the reason I said. It's one of the reasons I don't browse anime too often, people don't realize how even the most subtle things can be interpreted easily if there is a small pool of reasons for using that subtly to choose from.
>> ARTICLE
Being happy after finishing something does not imply a happy ending. I have been very happy after finishing some extremely tragic anime. Pretty much if it's well executed and a great show, I will be happy.
>> ARTICLE
This gives me encouragement to watch

Keep fighting friend. It's a bit slow and boring in the beginning but it picks up really, really fast.

>> ARTICLE
I know this thread's probably dead and buried now, but I just finished this too, and it's probably better than posting on some 3 year old thread. 

I went in not knowing what to expect, but came out shocked at just how brilliant this series was. I was almost put off near the start just by how slow it was, but by episode 9 I was absolutely hooked. 

On the topic of the ending, I couldn't agree more. I'm so glad it actually wrapped it up, and almost perfectly too.

I think this anime is going to sit on the top of my favourites for quite some time.

more then happy, steins;gate is the perfection. tuturuuuu

OP In case you do not know there is also a movie and OVA. The Movie is a squeal to the Anime.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I tried to watch Steins; Gate the absolutely terrible opening turned me off.  Didn't even finish the episode.  My two big anime turn offs are panty shots and cicadas.

Eventually I heard people keep saying it was good so I stuck with it, and it definitely is one of my favorite animes.  Not one I would recommend to people though, because of the terrible, terrible opening.  Very bad first impression.

The Encyclopedia in the VN is fucking amazing. Played the game first and got the Suzuha ending (didn't you know you could send different messages...), so yeah basically I got the ending you get for left clicking your way through.

>> ARTICLE
i believe the joke is that Dr.Pepper ejaculates into a bottle since his wife is dead
>> ARTICLE
Ohhhhh. Come. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
It's a play-on-words joke with "come." He's saying since Dr. Pepper's wife is dead, he can't (or at least probably shouldn't) have sex with her. Therefore, when he jerks it, he comes in a bottle. Of course this leads one to question Dr. Pepper's masturbation habits a little. Why a bottle? Ease of cleaning perhaps? But still, there must be a better way. 

Anyways, jokes are like frogs. When you cut them up to explain them, they're dead.

I don't get how the first page is a reference to Steins;Gate because they work for the Committee of 300 in the anime/VN. That just seems like a standard line in any company pamphlet.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, its a tenuous link, but I think they are nodding to the anime.  1) in their AMA's they always get questions about s;g and know what people are talking about. 2) if you were going to mention an organization you would either not capitalize "Organization" as it's not a proper noun, or you would state the Committee of 300 explicitly instead. 
>> ARTICLE
Most of the time I see them at AMA they absolutely hate those questions. They would rather talk about the science than be sidetracked by an anime. In the end, to me, it seems simply like a typo.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I agree. In the lower comments someone asked them how tired they get of it and they just sounded exhausted. But, there's more than one person at CERN, so the person making the webpage might like it better than the people answering questions. 
>> ARTICLE
Just a friendly reminder that while S;G references lots of cool physics stuff, the way it's used in the show is pretty dodgy a lot of the time. Don't be that guy who gets caught trying to justify S;G physics. Your physics friends will never let you live it down...
>> ARTICLE
What physics friends?! Rounders?! We shouldn't be afraid to judge Steins;Gate as the core of science is "question everything". But thanks for the reminder.
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering the fact that we don't have time travel yet it's pretty obvious Steins;Gate would used some sort of fictionalized physics to explain it's story...

Of course that is the cause as Steins;Gate can't escape the fact that it is fiction.

>> ARTICLE
Didn't play the game first. Fucking casual.
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that one should watch the anime first, because you literally can't get the True End without a walkthrough. But OP should still read the VN now.
>> ARTICLE
I played Steins;Gate without a guide(well I kind of cheated a bit when I got stuck at the Suzuha ending), and I was devastated by the ending.  Watched the anime and was like 'what the hell?'  Immediately played the VN again with a guide to get the true end.

Steins;Gate ruined me and I haven't played a VN without looking at a guide since.  Well except for School Days because it's fun just watching the bad shit happen to those characters.  They all deserve what they get.
>> ARTICLE
For someone who doesn't feel like playing the VN, could you give me a brief summary of what the true ending is? Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
The true ending is the one they used for the anime [S;G ending](/s "The whole mission to save kurisu's life is all part of the true ending. If you get either mayuri or kurisu's endings the VN just ends after they delete the data from SERN's Echelon network and get back to the Alpha world line.")
>> ARTICLE
Ah ok thanks.
>> ARTICLE
[Steins;Gate Spoilers, VN and anime](/s "You know how at the end of episode 22, things kind of end on a bittersweet note where Okabe is accepts that Kurisu is gone forever, but then he gets the call from Suzuha in the credits?  If you don't unlock the true ending, that phone call doesn't happen, and the entire story ends with Kurisu dead and Okabe getting on with his life.")

That kind of fucked me up for a while.
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched S;G with my brother back in December and It was his first time watching, after episode 22 Instead of immediately getting up to put on the next episode, I sat there for a couple minutes just to mess with him, he was like "Oh it ends like that?" in a disappointed tone. I slowly move over to the remote and silently skip the ED, The episode 23 OP plays, "Oh thank goodness"
>> ARTICLE
I'm showing S;G to a couple of friends of mine, and my plan is to ask what they thought of the show while the credits are rolling and let the interruption catch them by surprise while we're talking.
>> ARTICLE
Please do! Its so funny
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely don't understand your logic. Why does that matter, and why does that mean you should watch the anime first? All the endings are very formulaic and easy to get, and then for true end just look it up to get instead of having it spoiled in a short version.

* Chapter 6 - Dont send dmail to say dont stop Suzuha - Suzuha end
* Chapter 7 - Dont send dmail to stop Fariss dmail - Faris end
* Chapter 8 - Dont stop Lukas - Luka end
* Chapter 10 - Do you have NO true end flags? - Mayuri ending
* Chapter 10 - Do you have ONE or more true end flags? - Kurisu end
* Chapter 10 - Do you have all flags? - True end

The visual novel is a lot more indepth, and while most of the endings aren't must sees, Suzuha's is wonderful and bitter sweet and honestly unmissable. I've watched the anime and movie but played the VN first, and I'm so happy I did.
>> ARTICLE
The Suzuha ending was my favorite ending other than the True End of course. It seriously blew my mind.
>> ARTICLE
Don't mind me, when I ship a couple, I'm literally unable to ship any of them with anyone else. Seeing those alternate ends would make my stomach physically hurt.

All I'm saying is, if you're like me and you want to see the True End, you have no choice but to trigger a bunch of flags that are NOT easy to guess, even if you're actively trying to get them, so you'll most likely end up with the Kurisu end, which is fine if you did multiple save files, but I'm stupid, so I didn't. And playing a game with a walkthough just takes you out of the immersion, which is why I didn't, the first time (that and I was confident I could obtain the True End by myself... yeah, right).

So, uh, what I'm saying is, to me, the true Steins;Gate experience is the True End, but as you're not likely to get it the first time around without a walkthough, you're better off experiencing it first with the anime, which, in my humble opinion, is pretty fucking awesome in itself. But everyone has different opinions, I'm not really trying to convince anyone.
>> ARTICLE
> which is fine if you did multiple save files, but I'm stupid, so I didn't

Man, he was right. You are a casual.

...I'm kidding. But saving at every choice point is pretty much the standard way to play a VN.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm no denying the fact that I'm a casual. S;G is the only VN I've ever played.
>> ARTICLE
Haha. I've played quite a few, but most of them are basically "indie" non-commercial ones. I've only played a few well-known VNs; it's basically just Fate/stay night and Katawa Shoujo. Not many of the big names run on Mac...

Very clever, I am glad you liked it though. I find time travel as a concept to be one of the most interesting things Scinece Fiction has to offer. One of the reasons is because there are so many theories out there, making a time travel story can just be a literal grab bag of "this theory would work for our story" or [Slight S;G spoilers](/s "Yeah sure a microwave can make mini black holes! Why not!") But anyway, I can really appreciate a story that does its research, Loved how S;G used the John Titor story and The many worlds interpretation as they were both things I had heard about previously but had never looked into untill after the series. I really praise this show with its ability to introduce abstract concepts like these time travel theories in a way that can be understood by just about anyone who pays attention.

**-- THE FINALS --**

Well, to put it bluntly, I'm voting for Steins;Gate. [And this here is the reason why.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140316140252/dragonball/images/6/64/We5ikbG.gif) Well, that and the gorgeously well-done plot, the endearing characters, the marvelous visuals. But mostly that.

The biggest thorn in Code Geass's side is the particular uniqueness of its visual design and art style. Mostly due to how some more critical anime fans may consider Geass's characters resembling anorexic, high-school-student-cosplaying Slender Men more so than human beings. Shit's kinda iffy, in my personal opinion, but I could see the appeal in it. 

Both series are known for their complicated and interwoven plot points, their captivating characters, and, most importantly, their fucking kick-ass endings.

With that, then, I'd see the main advantage that Geass has over Steins is that many people would probably see the ending to Geass as better and more well-done than that of Steins.

But, is that going to be enough to give Geass the edge overall? My apologies, but I really would rather think not. Personally, Steins;Gate has an iron grip on my heart, and I think on the hearts of countless others. It has its reputation for a reason, and it wholly deserves it. I think Steins;Gate is going to take this tournament, everyone. And if there had to be one series I would rather have win this thing other than 'Gatari, it's Steins;Gate.

[**Steins;Gate has come here to drink Dr. Pepper and kick ass, and it's *all out of Dr. Pepper*.**](http://31.media.tumblr.com/7fa63887e0e008a65a84004c8a499c3d/tumblr_mxtp6lAxct1r3rdh2o1_500.gif)

Good game, would play again, now it's time to strategically retreat back to /r/araragi and [lick our wounds](http://24.media.tumblr.com/de0ad06cf58a7beef2b2636bd9fbeb4f/tumblr_mr0bf7bTyg1rbtx3po1_500.gif).

Also, to anybody who hasn't seen the top four shows yet, you need to get on that. They've survived through this bloody battle royale for a reason, alright? I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari *are* among the best anime has to offer. (EDIT: Although there are other amazing and fantastic shows that just haven't been able to garner enough attention to popularize themselves, mind you.)

And I would really like the idea of a movie-exclusive tournament, although I don't think I'd be able to contribute very well to it. Outside of Satoshi Kon, Makoto Shinkai, Ghibli, Summer Wars, and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and the quintessentials like Ghost in the Shell and Akira, I must admit I'm not too well versed in the realm of anime films.
>> ARTICLE
Running down my List, I've seen 40 movies. Some of those are actual feature-length movies. Others, like [Tsumiki no Ie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5365/Tsumiki_no_Ie) or [Harmonie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20903/Harmonie) or the regrettable [Eikyuu Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1106/Eikyuu_Kazoku), are shorter and more OVA-like. So I'd probably be more informed about the movies than I was about the series... Plus, it's easy to just sit down and have a movie night. 2 hours and done is much simpler to organize than the 4-to-6 hours for many full series runs. That should make for interesting nights as a decent percentage of /r/anime get together and watch movies for a week or so.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari are among the best anime has to offer

While I do agree with this, I also think some of the best shows anime had to offer got unceremoniously crushed, while some of the mediocre to downright bad shows made it pretty far. But of course these are opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was definitely thinking about that, take a look at the edit.
>> ARTICLE
of the 4 I hadn't yet watch 'gatari yet. It seems from MAL that the 3rd season is the best. I'm almost done with the first, and dang I find it draining just to watch. It's good...but exhausting. 
>> ARTICLE
Good but exhausting is exactly how I'd describe the show, yeah :P

Make sure you're watching everything in the right order, including the last 3 unbroadcasted episodes of Bake (they aren't on Crunchyroll). It might be annoying if you've already been filled in on this, so sorry, but Bake > Nise > Nekomonogatari: Kuro > Monogatari Series Second Season, in case you haven't.

Also, tell me what you think/thought of episode 12 of Bake when/if you've finished it.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Bake like a week or so ago. Watched it on CR.

The show had something interesting happen in almost every episode, and at times I was very interested in what was going on. At others, though, I found myself a little bit bored.

It was a very weird show, if nothing else. I'd have a very difficult time describing what it's about if anyone was to ask.

I find I have trouble understanding Japanese dialogue a lot of the time. What I mean by that is, a lot of the time in anime characters will have an exchange and then one of the characters will have a reaction that to me makes no sense. They'll act as if they were just insulted, or they'll get a bit upset, or they'll make an exaggerated EHHHHHHHHHH?! face or whatever and I'll be like "wait what? why are you reacting this way?"

Anyways, the 'gatari series seems to be a very dialogue heavy show and so instances like this occur a lot more frequently than in anything else I've watched. I've never really hard anyone complain about this so I assume it's not a common problem. Also I'm a bit slow in general; I didn't understand that in the first like 8 or so episodes that Senjouafesafdrgahara was flirting with and interested in Araragi, and I find I don't 'get' or appreciate a lot of the 'witty' dialogue.

The point of this post, really, was to ask: based on this information, should I continue watching? I really wanted to like this show as much as everyone else seems to, but after season 1 it really seemed just 'okay.'
>> ARTICLE
Well, personal tastes vary so it may just not be your kind of show. With that said - a lot of the wit in the dialogue comes from puns made based on the structure of Japanese language. For example, at one point Araragi is talking with Hachikuji (whose name roughly translates to "89 temples" - this is important) and then fools with her name, for example calling her Shichikuji - this would alter the interpretation of her name to mean "79 temples" - with each mispronunciation, he is, essentially, devaluing her.

So a lot of this is going to get lost in translation, and things like that you can't really help. I feel like the banter is pretty witty on its own English merit, however, although it can indeed be hard to follow.

Ultimately, whether or not you continue watching depends on how much you enjoy the show. If you still think it's an enjoyable show even if you can't catch everything that goes on then sure, keep watching. But if you spend your time confused and lost, then no matter how much I like the show, I'm not going to continue to encourage you to watch it. Go find something else that you can actually *enjoy* watching, because ultimately that's the entire point of any entertainment medium.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for sure. Thanks for the response! I was mostly wondering if it gets notably better in the later seasons, or if its just more of the same.

Overall I guess I enjoyed it, but found it to be nowhere near 'masterpiece' or even 'really good' levels.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really say, myself, because I've just finished Bakemono and nothing else. I'm going to keep watching, and I'll most likely enjoy myself. Same to you though - if you can definitely say you liked it, then I don't see any reason to stop. The opposite is also true though.
>> ARTICLE
I was in the middle of 12 when you messaged me, lol. 

First, someone really needs to teach shaft how human heads work, I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke. 

12 seemed fine. Though I feel that all the "romance" in 1-11 was almost tongue-in-cheek or parody-ish. It was a more "proper" romantic episode. Mostly dialogue, but that's par for the course in this series. Is there something in particular I should be noticing? 

Also, on the site I'm at, I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?
>> ARTICLE
> I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke.

The worst part is, I think that Shaft still does think that.

>Is there something in particular I should be noticing?

No, nothing in particular, really. It's just that that episode is considered generally one of the better ones of the series until pretty much all of the Second Season arc finales, and a lot of people really like the ending  of the episode. I really liked it myself.

>I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?

No, you're good. Only the original 12 episodes were broadcast as part of the series on television (did you think at all during it something along the lines of 'man, this seems like it could work as a finale'?), and there are 3 final episodes that finish the Tsubasa Cat arc that Shaft set aside to release by themselves, combining to form 15 total episodes. It looks like the site you're using has everything in order, and saved you some work.

> 64- Space Battleship Yamato

Poor Yamato, even getting beat by some pretty terrible stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Poor availability really hurts that one just in terms of likelihood that anyone outside of Japan has actually even seen it, which is a shame because Yamato 2199 is a fantastic show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anyone that hasn't seen it but has seen whatever it's up against would certainly vote for the other one, especially if there's no talk or hype about it.
>> ARTICLE
Even when 2199 came out, there wasn't really all that much interest in seeing the classic. Which is too bad, as it is one of the better anime that came out in that entire decade. (Plus, unlike most people on this sub, I was actually alive when the original Yamoto came out. I wasn't yet out of diapers, but I was alive.)
>> ARTICLE
At last we come to the final round of the Chinese Cartoon Grand Prix. In a result no one was shocked by Steins;Gate and Code Geass move on to battle each other for the coveted /r/anime crown. As much as I hate to admit it the result of this match is pretty much determined already with Steins;Gate as the victor. Unfortunately for Lelouch strategy means nothing when your opponent is a mad scientist, and to be honest I'm not even angry. I'll take second place with pride as I retire to work on my orange farm, good on you Steins;Gate. 

The movie tourney sounds like a great idea. I quite enjoyed this one and you did a wonderful job running it. Looking forward to more.
>> ARTICLE
I know which one im voting for :)
>> ARTICLE
Rest in peace FMA and Monogatari. You fought valiantly, but you were merely lambs led to a slaughter.

Your comrade, Code Geass, will be joining you in this cold dead grave shortly.

All in all, I quite liked this tournament. Steins;Gate did its stereotypical run and there were a couple of close matches.

[NGNL rustled some jimmies.](http://i.imgur.com/aLhZiGi.gif) It probably got as far as it did due to it's "fresh" factor, but it isn't a TERRIBLE show as many people make it out to be. If you started watching the show, you were given it at face value. If you expected any significant character development and no otaku pandering, you came to the wrong place.

Yes there's excessive fanservice, and there might be a certain crossing of lines, (I'm looking at you Shiro) but it's a fun show to watch if you can not get hung up on the "[Super Healthy Space](http://i.imgur.com/L04VDI3.jpg)". It's no great work of art, but it's a show you can enjoy the ride for. 

----

For future tournament formats, I would love to see one excluding the "super popular" franchises so it would be much more volatile. (e.g. no Steins;Gate, FMA, Code Geass, etc) An underdog tournament if you will.

I was pleasantly surprised that Kill la Kill and SAO ranked so low (still pretty high all things considered), but I guess they couldn't beat out the classics such as Angel Beats, Clannad, and Samurai Champloo.

Since we all already know the flaws of the shows that got shot down in this tournament. What does Steins;Gate really fail at? What blemishes could have been improved or was it an untouchable masterpiece? 

One of the major plotholes I see is that "Time travel will ALWAYS have a problem, whether in the future .... or in the past".

Thanks for reading my musings, and I quite enjoyed this tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate*

sorry, it really bothers me
>> ARTICLE
Sorry about that.

I thought I caught all of them >_>
>> ARTICLE
I admit, NGNL being ranked so high maxed out the rustle meter on my jimmies. I agree with what you're saying, it's not a bad show. It knows what it's doing and who it's doing it for, and it executes that particular flavour of entertainment pretty well. But god, reading testimonies of how it's up there with the fucking titans of animation just gets my blood boiling man.

I know, I know, I shouldn't care. Enjoy what I enjoy and leave it to that, but WHO IN THEIR FUCKING RIGHT MINDS COMPARES MADOKA AND NGNL AND DECIDES NGNL IS THE BETTER SHOW OH MY GOD I'M SO MAD ABOUT SILLY JAPANESE CARTOONS.

I realize it's stupid, but I guess I just want my viewpoint to be reinforced by the community I feel a part of, and it hurts seeing a show that I feel is so painfully, painfully mediocre and striving for nothing but, get above what I consider truly meaningful pieces of art. 

EDIT: stupid typo, thanks Arbalor
>> ARTICLE
Meh. Some shows just need to be taken at face value.

If you overanalyze your run-of-the-mill anime, all you're gonna get is bored. It's just a fun anime, and should be viewed as such.

Yes many of the "great" anime tackled great questions and were meaningful works of art, but NGNL is NOT one of those. Not by a long shot. 

Just accept that it's never going to make you question your world and see reality in a new light, and accept it for what it is. Pure unadulterated fun and stupidity. 

Arkada who does Glass Reflections for anime similar to this style. (along the lines of Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) Stu-fective. Stupid yet effective. Stufective. It's not any literary masterpiece, but it sure as hell is fun.

Just don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine. If you want some more intellectual fare, I would suggest Steins;Gate, Ghost in the Shell, or Welcome to the NHK. This is not one of those, and there are MANY more that are better at conveying a message and being a piece of art.

TL;DR Don't overanalyze it. Sometimes the curtains are just blue and it doesn't mean anything. Your AP English teacher can try to convince you that it represents the melancholy that pervades the human spirit as much as she wants, but sometimes the author just means that the curtinas are f*cking blue.
>> ARTICLE
I accept all that, trust me. It's just that, to me anyway, for a piece of art to cross a certain quality threshold, it needs to attempt to tell me something important in a unique way. So when I see a list of "top anime", it bugs me to see a show that I don't consider having crossed that threshold for me personally. Again, I fully acknowledge I'm in the vocal minority on this, and am probably being a humbug. 

And also, I feel KLK and TTGL did stupid fun a lot, lot better than NGNL. I think it did stupid fun with an interesting twist, with unique characters and beautiful animation, and a plot that wasn't centred around weekly doses of deus ex machina.

To be honest, analyzing shit is what I enjoy the most about entertainment. I like shows like Breaking Bad, I like movies like Memento, I like feeling like I'm not only being entertained, but I'm also being taught something. I think that feeling is really, really cool. I don't think that's the only way to enjoy art, or the 'right way', but it is definitely my way. So a show like NGNL that offers nothing beyond the surface at all, bores the utter crap out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Meehhhhhhhh. To each his own.

I totally understand your desire to search out entertainment which also can be thought of on a deeper level. It's a personal choice and it's a great way to judge/enjoy those works.

But trying to apply that to every product of entertainment isn't going to work out well. Intellectualism isn't the focus of any series the majority of the time and judging them on the scale of Breaking Bad and Memento is unfair to all shows in general. They simply aren't geared for that type of audience.

They're for a more juvenile crowd which just doesn't need as much in terms of deep thought. 

This is not a list of "top anime". This is literally a popularity contest in every way shape or sense of the word. This is your high school student council elections all over again. The most popular person wins and the same will be applied to this "tournament".

This is NOT an accurate representation of the "top" anime. It's simply a bracket system which pitted anime of differing caliber against one another and was sorted by the amount of votes.

This isn't indicative of much besides how /r/anime feels about these anime in this particular instance of time.

I agree that analyzing shit is fun, but if you try to analyze SpongeBob Squarepants you're just wasting your time. It's meant to be a source of entertainment with little to no substance (deeper logic, social critique, etc) 

Not everything has to be a piece of art, just the exceptional CAN be. Only the top 10-20 percent of shows have this aspect and I believe it's extremely unfair to judge the rest of those on that standard. 

TL;DR NGNL is entertainment NOT art. Anime can be art, but the vast majority of it is just there for fun/sales.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka is a much better anime than NGNL. I honestly had more fun (enjoyment) watching NGNL. IDK if most people voted on their objective best or what they had the most fun watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Really just depends how you are comparing them. I loved madoka but not as much as the average anime fan apparently. Ngnl however I thought did stupid, ridiculous and hilarious fun amazingly. I couldnt get enouth of it and personally got enthralled in it more so than madoka. Probably in the minority though lol
>> ARTICLE
I'd say you are in the majority. It is just the loud minority that hates NGNL.

Madoka my friend cause god knows ngnl is atleast better them mahouka

WHAT!?! BUT FMAB IS AMAZING!?
>> ARTICLE
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood was amazing, but Steins;Gate is by FAR the standout anime at this point.

Unless you're talking about something else entirely, I don't think that FMA truly beats Steins;Gate in many categories. 
>> ARTICLE
I think its safe to say that there will always be flaws in every show but i feel like the best are the ones that make you overlook the flaws without a second thought. I felt like FMA brotherhood did this the best for me(which is why it is my favorite anime, and one of my all time favorite shows) but the fact that some other people feel that others did it better is fascinating.

Im in the middle of Steins gate and i can say it is spectacular, but it was this subreddit that made me watch it because it wasnt on crunchyroll. I only recently got into anime(only used to watch toonami and adultswim back in the day) and i kept seeing it being praised here and then people were betting on it to take the win against great shows like fma and code geass? "Well shit, now i have to watch it."

Ive put quite a few other shows on my to watch list because of this tournament so i really enjoyed it. And Super Healthy Space too fkng good lol. Kind of annoying that people are hating on it for being good at what it tries to be:fun. 
>> ARTICLE
I quite agree that great shows will be the ones that make you overlook the flaws.

Everyone remember's their first time watching Stein's Gate and I hope you enjoy it as much as many of our other members seem to have. Don't forget to rewatch it to see what you may have missed the first time through.

Recently getting into anime isn't really too much of a problem in my opinion. It's about what you get after you come here. There's a niche for almost everyone, and I'm sure you'll find your stay here quite enjoyable.

I agree that the Super Healthy Space was hilarious. Some times you just need to accept something and move on. If you take things too seriously, then it just gets ruined. Shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill would never be good. NGNL isn't quite on that level, but you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.

It's not MEANT for you to take it as a social critique of child pornography. It pokes fun at fanservice by going excessively overboard with their fanservice. (Notice they removed all genitalia and nipples, common points of censorship) If you take it at an intelluctual level it has gone a couple miles over the line. (11 year old pedophilia much?) 

But it's meant to be a fun show that shows off how brilliantly amazing these shut-ins are and how even magic and [furries](http://i.minus.com/iVPXhWiVv9zSz.gif) can't stop their quest for world domination.

It's an otaku empowerment anime and the otaku pandering is almost a given.

I hope that you enjoy the rest of Steins;Gate and you find many more things to watch in your adventures as an otaku.

Could I get a name or two of shows that are on your to-do list? You don't seem to have a MAL or anything, and I'm quite interested on what you will be watching!

Thanks for the conversation and I hope you have a great day!


>> ARTICLE
Ive been binging quite a bit of shows on crunchyroll whenever i get the time and im getting around to starting jojo, log horizon, and twgok because my friend recommended them. But from the good things ive heard and their placements in this tournament ive decided to check out Haruhi Suzumiya, Angel beats, Hunter x Hunter, spice and wolf and psycho pass. Ive seen most of the other entries.

Yeah its a lot now that i look at it lol. This is going to take a while considering ive got League and a few currently airing shows to keep me occupied. Oh and real life too lmfao
>> ARTICLE
Looks like a pretty good lineup!

Log Horizon is great. I finished marathoning it in like 3 days. And there's a fall season coming up soon!

I haven't watched Haruhi yet, but I have experience with most of the others. It looks like a good list to go on thus far to be honest. Angel Beats pacing sucks quite a bit though so just power through it. The feels you get are pretty worth it.

Spice, JoJo, and TWGOK are pretty niche series, but if you liked the initial premise it shouldn't be too bad of watch. 

League is great, and this season's currently airing shows are pretty amazing thus far. I followed the manga of Akama ga Kiru and I hope that the anime adaptation does it justice.

[Real life is just a video game with shitty gameplay.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/48/486b454f99e9a1962b3defc0b5d5338348214aade0d97b33b231537e87a23b6d.jpg) Seriously though, enjoy your summer. I might give SAO 1&2 a whirl if you really like the concept of Log Horizon. Latter half of SAO1 was mediocre, but the new season is looking pretty amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ive seen SAO1, i enjoyed it although i definitely prefer badass asuna to damsel in distress asuna. 

Im one of those people who will usually like a good show if it has at least some enjoyable qualities, regardless of how niche. And im pretty good with shows with slow pacing, for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its magic/science really interesting.

I have high hopes for Akame ga kill, havent read the manga because i just dont have the time, but from people who have all i hear are good things about it. Zankyou no terror is shaping up to be pretty great too. Im going to wait for a few more weeks to decide if im going to pick up any other airing shows.

Good talking to you though. Enjoy your summer as well.
>> ARTICLE
> for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its ONE TRUE TATSUYA IS MY ONII-SAMA

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the original can still hold. I'm interested in Mahouka from the worldbuilding perspective (and will probably start reading the LNs after the show is over) as well as because of /r/onetruetatsuya, so it doesn't need to be an either-or scenario...
>> ARTICLE
I mean i watched it, had fun and all, but 6th place against all other anime ever made? uwot

Can someone explain this hype to me
>> ARTICLE
The hate for NGNL is seriously getting absurd on here. Like jesus Christ. Is it THAT hard for you to grasp that a show meant for fun and enjoyment CAN STILL BE REALLY GOOD. Why is this so hard to grasp? A show doesn't need to be morose, dark, sad, or any of those just to make it into the top. NGNL did what it intended (for many people) perfectly, and that's why it's at a top spot.

Where's your bitching and whining about TTGL winning top 5?
>> ARTICLE
Because like you said, a show meant just for fun and enjoyment without much in the way of depth or meaning can still be really good and enjoyable.

The difference between TTGL and NGNL is that TTGL was really good and enjoyable. NGNL wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe to you. I found Gurren Lagann stupid. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah and you allso have a  shit taste, move on
>> ARTICLE
This is all turning into a circlejerk. Why not accept both shows were most likely placed high for good reason?
>> ARTICLE
Ughh the point isn't that it's a bad show dude. The point is that it's undeserving of its standing. Call me in a year's time when it doesn't even make top 64. That's the whole point. Yet because it's fresh, it beat out classics like Clannad and Madoka. Of course people are going to shit on it.
>> ARTICLE
Which I disagree with. Especially because TTGL made the list, while nobody had a problem with that being there. 
>> ARTICLE
It is 7 years old. I'd say it's passed the test of time.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, great hype is usually followed by unwarranted backlash. Both will balance out eventually, and people will see it for what it is. I wasn't part of the anime scene when TTGL aired, but I'm sure it garnered similar reactions at the time. Just gotta play the waiting game. 
>> ARTICLE
it was pretty easy to get into so lots of people got into it
>> ARTICLE
Nomination topic got downvoted pretty hard and the nominations were limited, so we can't say "against all other anime ever made" first of all. Secondly it's new and popular, and there are a lot of new anime watchers on /r/anime. I think I saw an age poll where the average was around 17 or 18. If this was an older audience, or this poll was held a couple years later, I don't think it would have done nearly as good.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe this poll should be an annual or bi-annual event, it would be really interesting to see how much the standings change.

Then it would only be the hype trains that showed any real movement, and nothing else would really matter.

It might show some demographic changes in the subreddit if nothing else, /shrug.

Kinda sad it got so much recognition while all i saw about my season favourite, Ping Pong, outside the discussion threads was 'lol art sux, dropped'

I loved ping pong, and although the art style was unorthodox and strange, I thought it had its own unique charm that fit the story perfectly. I can't even imagine it in any other art style.
>> ARTICLE
If it makes you feel any better, I have Ping Pong down as one of my Top 5 anime. Its one of five that I've ever given a 10/10. 
>> ARTICLE
The art was part of its charm and I can't imagine how would it turn out if it was like any normal anime.

I don't care how they animate it. Good story and good characters make a good anime.

Ping pong would have done a lot better if it didn't go against Geass round 1

Just as a piece of advice, DON'T skip the intro EVER! And go do it NOW!

>> ARTICLE
Why shouldn't you skip the intro? Did I miss something?
>> ARTICLE
I never skipped it because i love it but i noticed that as you watch it, it changes it's meaning, adding to the show quite a bit. There is also a new intro on the last 2 episodes
>> ARTICLE
oh gotcha. yeah i agree, it's meaning does change as you learn more. I never skipped it either, but I thought you meant that there was something different in them that I never noticed.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Steins;Gate twice, and though I watched the intro most of the times I never really picked up on it being different. Any of the lyrical changes would just be using different parts from the full Hacking to the Gate song, right? Maybe I should have paid attention to reading the song subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
Changes in the last 2 episodes from the full song, yes
>> ARTICLE
The song stays the same but it conveyed more of a message as you go through the anime, giving meaning to the lyrics. Perhaps i'm just kinda dumb... Could be that
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I should pay attention to it when I inevitably watch it for the third time. But that won't be for a while, I feel content having experienced the series (dub+sub), movie, and visual novel (which is even better than the anime IMO).

How is it possible to have one as a favourite but think the other is a better anime overall?

Well I guess I overestimated this sub's love of Monogatari. I had it beating S;G in the finals, but as I have said before, I would not have been surprised to see S;G, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, or FMA win either.

I do find it interesting that Code Geass and Steins;Gate are battling for the top slot. There are a lot of similarities between Hououin Kyouma and Lelouch, and these shows have two of my favorite endings of all time. In fact I once wrote a [large post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1kv16a/a_deeper_look_at_steinsgate_spoilers/) talking about these two very things, and using the similarities to analyze Steins;Gate a bit.

I would be thrilled for the movie contest to be done as a condorcet method type vote ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method ) such as ranked pairs or schulze method.

Such a method produces much more "accurate" results, and determines every position rather than just first.  The drawback is it is not quite as fun since you do it only with one complex vote rather than many simple votes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh geez, I remember doing something like this for a math competition. To be honest, 64 votes are going to be intimidating for most people to do.

Perhaps do the Condorcet method in the first round, then use the results of that to make seeds for a bracket-style tournament?

I think it would be fun to have a tournament with anime that don't get much attention on reddit. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with this would be in the voting phase. "I haven't seen either." would stomp both of the two competitors each time. Even with the popular anime in this tournament, that was a pretty common choice that racked up about 20% of the votes. I don't know how fun it would be for the majority of people to vote in something where they haven't seen many of the shows.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if we're given a wider timescale to work with... Ain't nobody got time to watch 8 full series in 24 hours like these polls gave us, so either you saw it before the ball opened or you had to pick None Of The Above. 

Maybe announce the vote on Monday and hold the actual vote on the following Sunday? That might give people enough time to find those less-popular shows via their usual *"perfectly legitimate means"* (*coughcough*) and give them a good watch before the poll opens. Also, too: Make it 4 shows per week. Again, that way we can give a full watch of whatever series we find interesting.

That's true. Guess a 1v1 voting system wouldn't really work. Personally I never voted "I haven't seen either", I just skipped voting when I hadn't watched the shows.

Wouldn't really be a tournament, but having a survey format could work. First survey you get to pick 3 anime. New survey for the top 20, limit it to 1 pick and there you go. I am just excited to see the results of who won, personally I don't really care about the 1v1 matchups..
>> ARTICLE
There's no way I can choose between these two...they're both among my very favorites and I've watched each of them 4 times, more than any other anime except for Cowboy Bebop. They were both extremely compelling binge watches that gave me major cases of post-anime depression. 

In the end I'm going to vote for Geass...only because I think Steins; Gate will win this and I want the vote to be as close as possible. 

It's been a fun tournament! ^^^Except ^^^for ^^^NGNL! ^^^I'm ^^^still ^^^salty!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, FMA:B vs Monogatari was the hardest choice I've had to make this whole tournament, they're both 10s for different reasons.

I think for me though, FMA just edges out by the smallest margin imaginable.
>> ARTICLE
It was sad seeing FMA lose, but both it and Steins Gate are great shows. However for the finals I can see Steins Gate winning hands down, primarily due to Code Geass' overall weaker second season. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Steins;Gate...but the one thing I felt is that some of the characters are just **too** strange.

I got used to it as the show progressed, but starting the show and seeing Mayuri, Okebe, and Daru be the way they are is odd.  They are very different.

I really did enjoy Steins;Gate though and I am only on R1 for Code Geass so I will not vote, I am fully loving Code Geass though.  These two are very good, and it was almost predictable that they would be finalists.
>> ARTICLE
If anything I'd say R2 was better than R1 for Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I actually preferred R1. The show devolved into "new, more powerful mech of the day" in R2 which kinda turned me off. Plus I was very disappointed with the resolution with Charles near the end. Too abstract for my tastes.

yeah it's a good show. the brother sister thing really isn't as bad as it was in other shows. it has lots of fanservice (it's ecchi like sekirei, High school of the dead)

watch up to episode 3 and decide for yourself.

If you don't take it seriously, yes. It's a great show.

Against Reddit opinion, I really liked No Game No Life. It hit my top 5 and the unorthodox drawing style made it even better for me. There is a lot of fanservice, but since I watched it in a group that just added humor at times.

I thought it was a very shallow show, but the hype train rolls on.
>> ARTICLE
Agree on all counts that Steins;Gate deserves this win, it's of my top 3 shows for sure. Code Geass is amazing too. Sure, many fault the second season for this that and the other, but other complaints could also be said of Steins;Gate's first half as it isn't terribly interesting in isolation.

How about a best character contest?

This is outrageous. How did Code Geass make it this far?

Because it is one of, if not the best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
You could not be more incorrect. 
>> ARTICLE
What did you not like about it?
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't you like Lelouch? He was the ultimate anti-hero. He was an excellent military strategist, he was charismatic, he was everything you could want in a character. [ R2 Spoiler](/s "And he ultimately sacrificed his own life, and his legacy to make the world a better place") If you watched the english dub, Johhny Yong Bosch did a fantastic job voicing him. What's not to love?

>> ARTICLE
That shit he pulled with Schneizel was a real ass-pull, though. I won't go into details, because I'd rather not have an entire paragraph of spoilers, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about and you've probably heard the same complaint before, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't really Lelouch being a bad character, so much as lazy writing. I agree that the whole thing as complete BS, but I still think overall, despite the sometimes lazy writing and deus ex machina stuff, Lelouch is one of the most well developed, and amazing characters out there.
>> ARTICLE
Of course this is all personal opinion but I felt like [Spoilers](/s "his character was far to unlikable for me to root for him in any way. I don't think he was the ultimate anti-hero, nor excellent military strategist (just pretty clever, but a bit dues ex and a bit douchey haha) and not even charismatic (he's just fake, nothing charming about his character at all).")[](/s "His actions were a little too unbelievable for me to really immerse myself in the show, and Suzaku's terrible character along side him just made it worse. I didn't enjoy the show anywhere near as much as other people because quite frankly I hated a lot of the characters and I was happy to see them stuck in shitty situations because of their so called "great leader". ")[](/s "Anyways, I still feel the show wasn't incredibly intelligent, just very well written. These two things can be mutually exclusive. Well written shows tend to flesh out everything nice a cleanly with characters that have depth (even if they are unlikable). I just don't feel like it was intelligently written. Half the time I felt like all of the plans on Zero's side were far too luck based or flat out suicide. Not to mention he got intercepted quite a few times. While this makes for a believable scenario, I feel like it costed the MC's integrity far too much. It could've been handled better. I enjoyed lots of the exposition and world building more than I enjoyed the actual interactions between Keikakku MC with his godawful leadership skills and his army/anyone ever. It was even more disappointing how the story just fell apart in the R2. It's been a long time since I've seen the show (watched it while it was airing way back in 06), I just never felt like it was worth a rewatch. But you know, regardless of how much I actively disliked Lelouch as a character, I still enjoyed the show, I just don't think it should be anywhere above the Monogatari Series." )

EDIT: ~~oopsie forget to close the parenthesis.~~ Spoiler tags do not work on giant blocks of text.
>> ARTICLE
I can respect your opinion I guess. What made him unlikable? He was pretty douchy at times, but he was smart, and he worked towards a good goal
>> ARTICLE
Being an awful leader. I thought he was a shitty leader.
>> ARTICLE
In the first season, he was a fairly good leader, and even at the beginning or R2. He gave Kallen the Guren, because she is a better pilot, instead of using it as protection for himself, and he wasn't a dictator or anything, he listened to the other members of the black knights. [R2 Spoiler](/s "He was still a good leader at the beginning of R2. In the second episode of R2, an ordinary soldier was trying to sacrifice himself to give Zero a few moments to escape, and lelouch tried to talk him out of it, and to not think of himself as disposable. About halfway through R2, he realized that in order to change the world, not just japan, he needed the entire world to hate him, and so he made several decisions to do so, he betrayed the black knights, and betrayed the country of Brittania even. If anything, I think this makes him a fantastic leader, he gave up his life, and his legacy for the benefit of the world")
>> ARTICLE
I'd said its worth a rewatch.  Maybe the show is just better marathoned.  If you ever do rewatch it, I highly recommend the english dub, the VA really increased how  much I liked Lelouch. I agree with almost everything you said, except for Monogatari being better than Code Geass.  I'd say the Monogatari series is probably my second favorite show of all time however
>> ARTICLE
I watched it in english while it was airing. And Monogatari is my favorite, personally I feel like it surpasses Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Really? It's a fun, campy show, but calling it "the best anime of all time" is a fucking delusion. A good analogy would be calling a cult-movie like Starship Troopers "the best movie of all time". (and I love starship troopers and I don't mind geass).
>> ARTICLE
"Fucking delusion" is a strong phrase. Perhaps you don't feel that way, however considering it's battling for the top spot in 'this' poll means that he's not far off calling it at least, 'One of the best anime of all time' 
>> ARTICLE
Most popular =/= best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
The difference being? What we consider best is generally directly related to the most popular anime. When you consider that like the top ten anime left on this list are also probably the top ten best anime and the most popular. 

Unless we all just agree "best" is entirely relevant to the viewer and therefore there is no such thing as best anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Example: NGE can very well be considered one of the best anime of all time by many people (critics and the seasoned anime watchers alike!), but it's not even in the top 10. Just look at the sheer amount of reception it's gotten worldwide. It's no secret that NGE was a groundbreaking show that is a true representation of how anime as a medium can successfully convey such controversial, yet well thought out themes and still also appeal to a large audience, yet it's not even in the *top 10* when it very well should be.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, just look at how far TTGL made it. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it's the best show of all time, it has a few too many flaws and plot holes for that, but it is hands down my favorite anime. Lelouch is an absolutely amazing character, and the plot was excellent, but the art is a bit odd, and there are some unnecessary filler episodes from here to there, and R2 started to stop making sense. R2 also focused too heavily on the mechs themselves, as opposed to Lelouch's master strategy. 
>> ARTICLE
YES! My favorite two anime in the final! Sorry Code Geass, but Steins;Gate gets my vote today.

YAY! Elfen Lied beat bleach :)

Also it might be fun to have a "greatest episode contest", where rather than the whole series you judge based on a single episode.

I think I'll watch it again and stop at episode 22.

I actually also thought it ended at 22 initially. I didn't mind the ending and thought it ended as a tragedy.

I do love the ending of the movie/series though since happy endings always feel nice. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually do prefer tragedies. I don't know why, but ending it at 22 would have been really cool for me.
>> ARTICLE
I like a tragedy too sometimes, but Steins;Gate just seems like it really deserves its happy ending given that the entire second half of the series was [](/s "endlessly trying to avoid an inevitable tragic end with Mayuri's many deaths. Episode 22, after the love confession scene, while perfectly tragic way to go out with some form of closure and acceptance, is still a disappointment after having come so far.")

It must have been so painful.

Don't forget the OVA (episode 25) and the movie.

I thought that ["Steins;Gate"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) had multiple *suitable* ending points.  

Either Episode 22, Episode 24, Episode 25/OVA, or the movie can all do the series justice.
>> ARTICLE
okay

 question


 were those all adapted from VN endings?
>> ARTICLE
No just 22 and 24

22 would have been either the Kurisu bad end or the Maiyuri end, 24 is the true end for the VN Steins;Gate. The OVA and movie are extra may or may not be canon stuff not found in the VN
>> ARTICLE
who cares?  

they're still suitable endings
>> ARTICLE
The guy who asked the question? I didn't say they weren't suitable endings I just told what was actually in the VN, and made mention that a sequel VN or the new light novel may make the ova and movie non-canon
>> ARTICLE
You should rewatch the first episode after watching the last episode too. You'll catch/realise things you didn't notice before.
>> ARTICLE
care to explain? I can't find anything
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers, Obviously](/s "While the Okabe in Episode 1 is doing all his shinanigans, the Okabe of episode 24 is currently running around the building doing his shenanigans as well. Along with that, at the end of Ep. 1, Okabe1 hears a scream from upstairs, runs to investigate, and finds Kurisu covered in blood (Presumed dead). Okabe1 sends the text that starts the series. At the same time, Okabe24 has tased Kurisu and shoves his hand into his cut open gut to produce as much blood as he can to make it look to Okabe1 that Kurisu is actually dead. The scream Okabe1 hears that brings him to the top floor is Okabe24 screaming")

Also, as a side note, I love this thread. It convinced me to go rewatch the last 2 eps of S:G again. I'm gonna have to rewatch the series for like, the 10th time now...
>> ARTICLE
also it explains why [Spoiler](/s "Kurisu asked if Okabe wanted to tell her something (it actually was Okabe24 who did that) when he first met her"), which was awesome :D
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the way everything was brought together so well is why Steins;Gate is such a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
In a show about time travel, the fact that I've never seen anyone else who put this together the second they watched it boggles my mind.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as it was established that Okabe was indeed not crazy I tried hard as hell to piece together how Kurisu met Okabefore he met her.

The mechanics of D-mail could not explain it - and the time machine was one-way only when introduced.

It felt so good when what had been mysterious for me the whole series was explained.
>> ARTICLE
actually, it is pretty hard to find shows about time travel that correctly show such interactions between past and future versions of characters
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was what I feared when i first saw Steins Gate - the unexplained "What did you want to tell me" from Kurisu. I loved the ending of episode 22 - and had it not been for the unexplained first episode encounter, i would have preferred it.
>> ARTICLE
You're just like the guy who went to the cinema too late and missed the first 5 minutes of Interstellar, and only realized at home that he actually missed the first 90 minutes of it.

I wouldn't have minded if it ended on ep. 22, [spoiler](/s "I just think it's to convenient that they have to go back to save Makise") I really just prefer shows where the writer isn't afraid to kill some main characters.
>> ARTICLE
This is the reason I thought it was the ending. I could defiantly see people being happy with this sad ending. However watching the last two episodes after three years is like [Spoiler](/s "She actually came back to life not in a cheesy perfect ending way, for me Makise has been dead for three years. ")
>> ARTICLE
The ending was extremely well crafted and had been foreshadowed since episode 1. It worked very well as a completion to Okabe's character arc [] (/s "where he had to re-don his Hououin persona that he had spent half the season shedding. His attempt at a heroic sacrifice fails due to his own survival, he is not a real magnificent bastard, just a fake one, so he does get the happy ending he earned"), as well as all of the shows themes. It was the furthest thing from a copout ending, and it really annoys me when people say that a sad ending would have been better just so a character could die or just to not have a happy ending. I enjoy bittersweet or sad endings as much as the next guy, but it simply would not have fit this story as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this was the furthest thing from a cop-out ending, in fact it's more a cop-out to just accept the bad ending and just go "oh well, can't do anything now but move on" when the entire premise is you *can* change the past, but there are serious and often unpredictable consequences.

I'm gonna be the dissenter and say I watched the entire thing waiting for it to blow me away like other people say it will. Nope, never blew me away. Pretty much every Steins;Gate thread gushes over it though so you can at least give it a chance.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe too high expectations?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe. I had no expectations when I started watching it. /r/anime had plenty threads saying that it shifts into high gear at episode 11 though. That coupled with the fact that I just finished watching Madoka (which I loved) probably did result expectations that were too high. I was underwhelmed when i hit episode 11.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure having watched Madoka influenced. Steins;Gate is a wonderfully constructed, fractal story; but Madoka's ending is possibly the best ever put to anime, with every single moment of the show secretly building up thematically and emotionally to it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it only really blows you away if you're already pretty invested in the plot and characters despite the slower pace and don't actually see what's coming. Interestingly, similar could be said about Madoka: if you're really bored for the first couple episodes and already know it's supposed to turn dark and basically become this almighty "deconstruction of the magical girl genre" then the actual impact of the transition to such is less meaningful.
>> ARTICLE
The characters need time to develop. But once it starts to move (like around episodes 11 or 12 IIRC) the story gets really compelling.  It will be worth your time...[spoiler](/s "and also worth the time in any parallel timelines.")  

Enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
After reading several comments here, I will give it a shot. Currently starting episode 4, and it does seem rather slow, so we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
Many people consider the series to be quite slow for the first few episodes, but it picks up as you approach the second half. It's worth powering through, I promise!

It's one of those shows that has extremely slow pacing in the beginning, but gradually starts to blow you away if you give it the chance.

If only you had watched past the credits...

Whoa, TL;DR spoiler alert just FYI
>> ARTICLE
Fixed. Nice call, my bad.
>> ARTICLE
I actually have a similar story to yours, though it doesn't end quite as well.

I watched Oreimo season 2 as it was airing, and somehow convinced myself that the show ended on episode 13. I believe this was a flashback episode, and remember thinking that it was a really strange place to end. However, I didn't question it, and left it at that.

On reddit, I kept seeing people raging about how they hated the ending, which started to confuse me. From what I could remember, nothing happened in the ending at all. What was there to hate?

Well a couple months ago, I discovered that those last 3 episodes do exist and decided to watch them. If you've seen the show, you'll know that's when things start to go really downhill. My mind was blown too, but not in a good way. I can't help but feel that maybe if I'd be better off if I had gone on pretending those episodes had never existed.
>> ARTICLE
I hated that ending BUT I can honestly say it contributes to my enjoyment of the show. The fact that it engaged me enough that I have emotional feelings over how FUCKING DUMB the MC is and how THAT BITCH fucked her brother over is pretty awesome. I think more people who don't like the ending (Or the ending to other shows) should go and reconsider that maybe it wasn't bad, but they just didnt like it.

Ayase4Waifu

Kuroneko4Pleasure
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the biggest problems people have with that ending (partially what I felt and what I've seen others post) is that the ending basically meant this entire roller coaster ride ended at nowhere. It's not some tragic romance where they end up dying but it was like lets get together and then just drop it as if THE ENTIRE SERIES didn't happen. Personally I got way too invested in the series and that ending just didn't fit for me because it had been all this drama of romance between everyone and it just ends with no actual closure or wrap up. After a while though I found the OreImo subreddit and it talked about an an epilogue chapter in the light novel and I thought to myself that it was a happy way to end because they are still together even though they tried to end things.

Also you must really be into some weird stuff if you want Ayase.
Kuroneko4Life
>> ARTICLE
Ayase would make the best wife out of any character in that show. The way she took care of him was top notch and I felt she was the only one who actually loved him for him (Aside from his childhood friend who i cant remember the name of because fuck her)

Kuroneko is too inexperienced and possibly has some chuunibyou syndrome goin on. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally I'd rather have Ayase as a housemaid or something the biggest problem with her is her temper. I just remember one scene where she is holding a knife and the only thing I was thinking about was Please don't stab him repeatedly. Their relationship before living together was literally just her abusing him. If that's what you are into there isn't anything wrong with it, I just couldn't stand being kicked every time I tell a mildly perverted joke or anything of the nature.
I can see what your logic is though, but I feel like Kuroneko would grow up or at least mature in other aspects of her life seeing as how she was a freshman towards the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I wish it *had* ended on episode 22. It would have been a more convincing ending.
>> ARTICLE
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH.  Oh well, that makes you a great adventure!
>> ARTICLE
ahhh, so that's where I should have stopped
>> ARTICLE
I believe that the Ending song of episode 22 is different from all the others because [spoilers](/s "the ending song goes faster and instead of the hourglass going back in time it is actually shattering, and then the ending song is interrupted with a phone call telling Okabe about world war III "), It was a nice way to tell people shits not over yet
>> ARTICLE
Also, the episode 23 opening is different. Would never have noticed if an observant (and more Japanese-savvy) friend didn't point it out at the time.
>> ARTICLE
Similar story for me (but better?): NGE was one of the first anime I watched; I watched it airing on Adult Swim one episode each week, without missing any.  I got up to Episode 24 doing that, but then went on vacation and was gone for the weekends where the last two episodes aired.  And to this day, I've never seen them.  
>> ARTICLE
Having seen them...they were pretty strange. Very different from the rest of the series without much to say why besides rumored budget cuts. You should watch them to see what the fuss is about, but the more satisfying end of Evangelion is the movie (literally "The End of Evangelion") which still is weird at times but it's really well done, high budget weird that definitely brings the series to a close.
>> ARTICLE
I've had a similar experience. I basically did the same thing with Re:Hamatora except I ended it [](/s "after the apocalypse episode aka episode 11 where the main character gets shot in the heart and hajime chan's minimum turns the world into mindless zombies")

To me that was the worst possible ending a series could ever have and in my head I was so incredibly pissed off at the guy who wrote the series for ending it so bad. As a writer you don't just end the series [](/s "with the antagonist winning and causing the apocalypse in the process")
>> ARTICLE
After enjoying Hamatora's first season quite a bit, the second one just doesn't seem quite right. It was still pretty good but I got to the episode where [](/s "Murasaki gets destroyed and dumped in front of Hamatora in a body bag") which was really shocking and had me questioning if they really had the guts to kill a major character. But then [](/s "next episode he's perfectly ok and the entire thing is just stupid gags in the hospital, completely undermining the previous few episodes and coming off really cheap.") I ended up dropping it there and then, but if it's actually worth finishing maybe I'll do that.
>> ARTICLE
Whether it's worth finishing or not is debatable. Just a notice though. They never have the guts to kill a major character. Never. That's a part of what makes the ending kinda dumb because a character you thought got killed didn't due to the magical power of plot armor but it's still a decent ending.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that how season 1 ended? So I'm guessing same thing happens in season 2 as well.
>> ARTICLE
Something like that except one a more annoying level and with more closure.

I don't know if that makes it better or not.

tbh I'm playing the visual novel and it's slow-going
I know in VNs you have to kinda click through it at times, but I wish they would take out excessive/unnecessary details and dialogue :P

It would have been better with it ending at 22. Deus Ex Machina happy endings aren't for me.

it wasn't a deus ex machina ending. the actual ending explains the events of the first episode that didn't add up

> Deus Ex Machina

Hey look, it's that literary term that uninformed people constantly throw around!

S;G's ending was planned from the very beginning. You can tell because, well, there is huge foreshadowing right from the very beginning.

And it's not even just hastily explained together in retrospect, the first episode is actually full of anomalies that only piece together in your head after episode 24.

> I stopped on Ep11 at 3am. Now I am at work, sleep deprived and can't do anything but think about how that thing is going to progress.

Be thankful you stopped there.  Had you gone any further you'd probably have pulled an all-nighter.

I look forward to your reaction to the latter half of the series.

edited to add:

There's an OVA (episode 25) you should watch afterwards.  And a movie that comes after the OVA.  Neither should be considered absolutely necessary viewing but they're great if you want more of the gang.

There is a new Steins;Gate story coming out sometime in the future.  Don't google it.

The OVA really ties the series together.   I'd have probably given the series an 8.5 or so without it.   With the OVA, 9-9.5.

Nah, I give it a 10 without it. The OVA is really just a side story, although still pretty good. The movie is also definitely worth it (drunk Kurisu is best Kurisu :D)

Yes, in hindsight I am very glad I stopped at EP11. It woudl have been a whole series binge otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
They hinted the new steins;gate story like a year ago. 

A year later and i dont think there has been any new details on it or even hints on a release date. 
>> ARTICLE
Release date for the VN is this fall. They've posted some character art and descriptions and released a couple trailers.
>> ARTICLE
It's worth noting that the sequel posted a year ago, Steins;Gate Committee Of Antimatter, was scrapped in December. Steins;Gate 0 was only announced two months ago, but it's already nearly finished being made. It's not a sequel so much as an "interquel".
>> ARTICLE
Are you talking about the 4th part of the Science Adventure series? or just another Steins;Gate story?
>> ARTICLE
I think he means "Steins;Gate Zero".  I'm guessing he said not to google it because there's probably spoilers to the original series in the descriptions.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  This guy's on episode 11, he shouldn't know about any greek lettering.
>> ARTICLE
I binged the entire series when I decided to watch it. Well worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I did as well, but then spent he next few days rewatching it. The immediate rewatch, haha.
>> ARTICLE
I did too.  It was the first anime I watched (after FMAB) and I was like "I'ma watch this alllll night."
>> ARTICLE
OVA gave me a little more closure, I'd recommend that one for sure.  
>> ARTICLE
I actually spent a whole night watching S;G. It was already 11 pm or so, and guess what I was at Episode 11. I wanted to stop but couldn't. Slept at 5 am or so.

Still had a great time!
>> ARTICLE
>I stopped on Ep11 at 3am. Now I am at work, sleep deprived and can't do anything but think about how that thing is going to progress.

Damn, you're lucky you still have a job.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, you stopped on 11? Oh dear, you better start watching early because from here on you will not want to stop watching until its over.
>> ARTICLE
Lucky you stopped right there on episode 11, 1 episode more and you'd be fired
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who felt that the show's first few episodes were excellent?
>> ARTICLE
They are.

They are what get you invested into the characters. And they are very, very good at it. Making you actually care about the characters is what make the middle of the series personal instead of dismissing it.
>> ARTICLE
Be glad you didn't watch episode 12. If you had, you wouldn't be at work right now.
>> ARTICLE
> I stopped on Ep11 at 3am. Now I am at work, sleep deprived and can't do anything but think about how that thing is going to progress.

That willpower
>> ARTICLE
"I stopped on ep11 at 3am " You're a better man than I am. 
>> ARTICLE
At least this isn't another "So I finished Steins;Gate....10/10" post.

What are your thoughts on the anime's presentation (art style, animation quality, editing, sound, etc.)?
>> ARTICLE
Sound is good. It fits perfectly, but besides the opening there are few times where it is memorable.

The editing is fantastic. It is not fast paced (at least yet), but they make a really good job at making you care about the characters. Since things are going down the drain ( Thats pretty obvious from EP.... uhhh... some episodes ago, the pager message ) It is very important that you care about the characters, otherwise it doesn't have any impact. EP1 however was a bust, I almost gave up on it at that point because it made very little sense, but from Ep2 and onwards, when you start to understand the environment things start getting interesting.

Art style - well, not my cup of tea. I don't actively dislike it, but its not one of my favorites. Yes, it is very well drawn, just not on my favorites. Animation however is pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with /u/_Pleinair_ above - I started watching this show with my brother who had already seen it, and while I thought the first episode was rather meh the first time I saw it, he told me that I needed to watch it again after finishing the series.  I recommend watching it again after you watch the last episode, preferably in the same sitting.  Steins;Gate is best enjoyed episodes 1-25 and then 1 again.
>> ARTICLE
I actually recommend rewatching episode 1 after you finish the series. Or leave it to a full series rewatch much later on. I had pretty much the same opinion as you on episode 1 when I first watched it while it was airing and actually dropped it for a few months before restarting it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to add that if you watched it subbed I'd recommend watching it dubbed next or vise versa, they are both great
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm that dub is good.
>> ARTICLE
you sweet summer child
>> ARTICLE
The only problem with this anime is that [Spoiler:](/s "The last two episodes was revolved around the idea of paradoxes. In the Steins;Gate world, paradoxes shouldn't exist, because no matter how you change the past, the outcome will branch into another world line. Because the outcome branches into another world line, paradoxes should not exist. The idea of paradoxes completely contradicts world lines, and ultimately the anime as a whole. I believe Suzuha said something like 'If you succeed, I won't ever have to go back to the past in the first place'. This quote completely contradicts world lines.")

Putting aside what I said above, Steins;Gate is probably the best anime I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually explained in the VN, but the explanation was cut from the anime adaptation, for time reasons.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'd like a link to that explanation as well.
>> ARTICLE
See above.
>> ARTICLE
Could you link or explain that explanation? I always figured that [Spoilers](/s "the actual time machine Suzuha uses doesn't change world lines so they are just travelling in the same world line") I could be wrong, haven't watched it recently.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers ](/s "The machine she uses does change worldlines, but the divergence is less than 0.0000000001%. So it's practically the same line, but without the chance of running into yourself. The 'Steins Gate worldline' that they reach at the end is one 'that has never been observed', which means it isn't bound to the same Attractors as the Alpha and Beta worldlines were.")

[Continued ](/s "It's a worldline where anything is possible, because the future is unknown. But it's also a future where Kurisu is alive and the Nakabachi Thesis is destroyed, so WW3 won't happen--at least, not over a time travel arms race--and SERN won't be able to steal the PhoneWave tech and force Kurisu to make it into a full time machine, as the PhoneWave never gets used.")

[tl;dr ](/s "The machine she uses *does* change worldlines, just very slightly. But it's enough to prevent running into themselves and causing a paradox, since paradox isn't possible.")
>> ARTICLE
Why did Suzuha even warn Okabe then about running into himself, if it's not possible because paradox? 
>> ARTICLE
That wouldn't be a paradox. That would just seriously freak past-Okabe out.

But the warning she gave was actually a moot point, as it was **impossible** for Okabe to actually run into himself [before](/s " past-Okabe sees Kurisu 'dead' in a pool of blood and he texts Daru about it"), as the Attractor wouldn't allow.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I vaguely remember all of that now. Thanks for clearing it up. They didn't explain that in the show? 
>> ARTICLE
Not that I can recall. Of course, the VN was just better for explanations in general. Which is to be expected, I guess, since it's around 50 hours long instead of ~12 hours.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you found the beginning really captivating :) As I'm sure you've heard, it just gets better from here on out. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah well, wait to finish it, + the movie and OVA, and then you'll understand the true meaning of a 10/10 anime :D
>> ARTICLE
Glad you're enjoying it so far! However, the rollercoaster ride is just beginning. You just made it to the top of the lift right before the drop. I'm eager to find out what you think about the rest of the series.
Don't forget to watch the OVA then the movie afterwards!
>> ARTICLE
It really starts to pick up from 12 on wards i feel, have fun. :)
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate had me captivated as well. Aside from a couple of issues I have with it, it's an incredibly enjoyable anime.
>> ARTICLE
You got so freaking lucky you stopped at 11. Plan to finish it next time you start. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the comment. Really. Glad I followed the suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, the opening moment of episode 2 was exactly when it fully hooked me. I loved the intrigue of trying to figure time travel in the first half.
>> ARTICLE
Yeha, very much. Ep1 was very much "meh" as a starter, as it made little sense. The beggining of Ep2 is what got me enough curiosity to keep going, and then you start putting emotional investment in the characters as they start to develop.

**Very** well written.
>> ARTICLE
haha, i remember my first time watching through Steins; Gate, i watched like all of 12+ in one school night...
>> ARTICLE
It was Kurisu wasn't it? 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't until EP 16 or so.
>> ARTICLE
So many feels... 
>> ARTICLE
Glad you're enjoying the show! When you're done watching it, stop by /r/steinsgate if you have any questions or want to discuss anything.
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to get my mom to watch Steins;Gate, and she fell asleep in the first episode. She says that she'll try to watch it again this weekend, because she's interested in the show but was just too tired to stay awake. That, and S;G starts off incredibly slowly. 
>> ARTICLE
also has one of the best English dubs I have ever heard.
>> ARTICLE
Uh... I tend to avoid dubs like the plague though. I feel that it just never gives the same feeling as the original.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta agree, and yet it doesn't make it into peoples 'good dub' lists, I think its only because the sub is also so good,  oh well.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I love the first half/early episodes. it [](/s "made me care about the characters and understand Okabe's struggles as to why he's so desperate to fix everything. If the early episodes weren't there, I probably wouldn't have cared too much about trying to save Mayuri or Kurisu.")
>> ARTICLE
Exactly this.

If they had made it quicker I wouldn't have had nearly enough emotional investment into the characters to actually care. I didn't start loving Kuriso until Ep 15 or 16 or so, when Okabe finally starts using her as emotional support, for example.

If the anime had not taken the time to flesh out the characters and their relations my reaction to the big episodes (Namely, Mayuri ones and Kuriso ones) would have been "meh, whatever."
>> ARTICLE
The monochrome running sequence was great
>> ARTICLE
The same thing happened to me when I watched it! Great anime
>> ARTICLE
If you like Steins;Gate, then watch Chaos;Head and Robotics;Notes !!! (: they link up
>> ARTICLE
Stein's gate is awesome. I own the visual novel, but I haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. The only downside for me was it's predictiveness. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you will watch show closely you will forsee a lot of things. Some people say about rewatching ep. 1, but it's not hard to notice all of little things while watching it for the first time. 

But, for what I love this anime, is that story went exactly how I wanted to.
Not sure, if I helped OP, it's just that I've finished it not so long time ago, and wanted to share my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, now this makes me want to pick it back up.  I got to about episode seven and stopped watching for reasons that escape me now.
>> ARTICLE
It's totally worth it. Episode 12 is generally considered the point of no return. (Which, to be honest is late for a show to hook people in, but I was captivated one the first episode. Depends on the person, I guess.)
>> ARTICLE
I accidentally started watching the dub and for some reason never changed it over.  Honestly enjoyed it!  I have some shows to knock out on my list, but this is definitely one i'll be coming back to in the next few weeks to complete.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched some of the dub and the entirety of the sub, and I'd have to say I much prefer the sub. The VA really gives off the "mad scientist" vibe in the sub. The dub's VA sounds more like Dr. Watson to me, but it may come down to a matter of preference. The movie is only subbed as of right now, so that may influence things.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say, tried the sub after watching the dub, sub Okabae sounds so boring to me, I don't even get the charm that people seem to have with the sub voice actor.

I have no idea with this one, people seem to be really polar opposites on which Okabae they prefer.
>> ARTICLE
Funniest part is that you haven't reach the part that is coonsidered the good part yet
>> ARTICLE
atleast you only waited till dinner. i watch ep 1 on its year of release then stopped. watched ep 2 the next year. i watched ep 3, guess when, the year after. i only completed the series about 2 weeks ago.

really like the show. it's really funny that i didnt finish it right away.
>> ARTICLE
It has a slow start but it's amazing overall once it picks up. My friend felt the same way when I recommended it to him and he doesn't like the whole time travel premise but he still loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this show on a week long trip to Uganda. I queued up the first episode on a rainy day in the Toyota Hiace van while on a 5+ hour commute back to Kampala. Wasn't even mad.
>> ARTICLE
I ended up marathoning it because i had to know how it was going to end. 

I was bored at first tbh because of the first 3 episodes, it felt really slow, I had no idea where it was going. But after about the first 3 episodes, damn I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
One of us! One of us!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I usually tell people to muscle through the beginning, because it starts off pretty slow. I've never heard anyone regret it.

Steins Gate is a one of the greatest anime ever created(IMO) im glad you are enjoying it

wait, what???!!!!!!

only 9 minutes?????!!!!!

Are you expecting more? It's the lead in to S;G 0, because of what changes at the end of the episode. If you remember what happens in the True version it should make total sense.

so..... has s;g 0 aired yet?, are we getting more s;g?

The VN isn't even released yet man. It releases next week. Famatsu rated Zero 1 point higher than the original VN too.

so no, no more s;g anime huh....

i know, but sorry that i didn't elaborate, i feel like "there's no more s;g anime"

it's like aria arietta, it's out, i can't watch it, so it hasn't came out yet

If you remember Episode 23, and what Steins;Gate 0 is about you should be able to figure it out yourself. Everything of Episode 23 is the same, except for the last ~7-9 minutes where it is an altered ending about Beta Okabe instead.

Since Steins;Gate 0 is such a confusing title, I can't wait for after the anime airs and we get a bunch of posts every day asking what the watch order for Steins;Gate is. :P

We call upon your strenght Fate/FMA/Monogatari fans!
>> ARTICLE
Um..is this a bad time to ask what is the order for the fate series and what the best versions are and whether you there's any in the order which are commonly skipped out?
>> ARTICLE
If I may chime in as someone who has gone through that just a while ago (bar the complementary works and all that), I'd like to suggest a few things if you don't mind:  

* The novels do require a big time investment, but I found it really was worth it after all was said and done. I just finished the three main routes, only getting one ending in each, and clocked about 80 hours in. I consider myself a fairly quick reader and only skipped when redoing something.  
* Listen to the flowchart mrsirgrape linked! As an extension of that...
* ...do not, under any circumstances, fall into the trap of watching Fate Zero straight after watching UBW if you have not played Heaven's Feel yet; I did, for some dumb reasons, and regret it a lot.  

Ok, with that out of the way, I gotta say that reading and watching through the series has honestly been one of the most rewarding media experiences I've ever had. Probably because I love worldbuilding and good animation, and oh boy, is there a lot of that in the novels AND ufotable adaptations.

>> ARTICLE
You need to go get the other endings asap! Once you have all 5 endings done, the True Fate route ending - Last Episode unlocks. 

Also really check out some of the endings, especially Bad End 30 & Bad End 38 in HF. One of them even have their own soundtrack specifically for that ending.

Follow the VN flowchart to see where they diverge.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I will definitely do that once I get some free time. Incidentally, those two endings are among the few that I didn't get haha, I meant the main ones in my comment.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah once you get Fate, Good & True UBW, Normal & True HF endings Last Episode will unlock if you were playing Realta Nua version that extends Fate route ending.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, this is sooo helpful. :)
>> ARTICLE
Step 1) read the visual novel

Or go to the /r/anime watch order wiki
>> ARTICLE
Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend reading the VN, its a big time investment. However I also think it's the best way to experience the series.
>> ARTICLE
[I got your back, seeing as I just watched them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate)
>> ARTICLE
Cheers!
>> ARTICLE
I think I got this figured out.

First, you watch Steins;Gate up to episode 22.  Then you watch episode 23 beta followed by Steins;Gate 0.  Then finish off by watching the original episode 23 and 24.

That's how I see it.  Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
That sounds about right.  It's another timeline and events that contribute to the ending in season 1

http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Steins;Gate_0_(Anime_Series)

So it's not a sequel.  It's not a prequel.  It's a middle quel ?


>> ARTICLE
Nah, I think Steins;Gate first then Steins;Gate 0 will be the best. Knowing what happens will be part of the hype.
>> ARTICLE
That and release order almost always trumps out chronological order for watching/reading something. It's part of the experience man
>> ARTICLE
Lets not forget Darker than black here.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, whenever people ask what order to watch any anime in, no matter what I feel like release order is always a good option since well...90% of the fanbase probably experienced it like that anyway.

For example, I didn't need anyone to tell me how to watch Monogatari series. I just went on MAL and looked at the airing dates and watched it in that order. Turns out that's the order widely thought of as the best.
>> ARTICLE
There is one Anime I would NEVER watch in release order.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. 
I don't know what's more retarded, the release order or the endless eight. Plus season 2 is chronologically in season 1.
Man that is one convulted anime watch order
>> ARTICLE
There's no perfect way to watch Haruhi. Part of my frustration with it was definitely the way episodes had no real flow into one another. *Twice* they cut apart two parters with a random episode and it boggles the mind.

The one thing the release order does right are the first and last episodes. Starting with Episode 0 is 100% the best decision. It makes you immediately interested in the show and it really makes no dramatic impact when viewed in chronological sequence.
>> ARTICLE
Broadcast order of Haruhi isn't that bad though. I know many people that prefer broadcast over chronological and I can see why. I'm pretty sure the community is pretty evenly divided on it too.
>> ARTICLE
>Fate/FMA/Monogatari fans

You could've just said /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
inb4 new watchers tell everyone to watch Zero first.
>> ARTICLE
Start them with Chaos;Head so they lose all will to live. 
>> ARTICLE
Best order is obviously: Fate/Zero -> Steins;Gate 0 -> FMA -> FMA:B (skip first 12 episodes) -> Steins;Gate -> Monogatari toothbrush scene.
>> ARTICLE
broadcast order, skip endless eight, but not the first three episodes.
>> ARTICLE
But, in all seriousness, do not, absolutely do not, skip the first 12 of FMA:B. Maybe the first episode, but you cannot not skip episode 2 onward. 2 has major changes and plenty of new stuff. Episode 1 is all new stuff from 2003, but it is essentially all filler, unless you care about the checkov's armory of foreshadowing and character introductions.

But the changes really do just keep compounding within the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood
>> ARTICLE
Oh yea, completely agree. I hope no one actually took my post seriously.

I understood (read: thought I understood) what Kurisu said, which was basically "Greetings, my name is Kurisu Makise. How are you doing?". But that could be completely wrong (and even if it isn't, it's not the meat of the teaser).
>> ARTICLE
The "Hajimemashite" part is key... "this is my first time introducing myself to you, how are you?"
>> ARTICLE
From my limited knowledge of weeabo here is what I understand:  
Kurisu: nice to meet you my name is makise kurisu, let's work well together. 

Okabe : Destiny something something, in the end I did not do the right thing(??) Something something. El Psy Congro.

Edit: could be "I'm not good enough" instead of "I didn't do the right thing", someone who knows Japanese plz confirm.

So I wonder how this anime is going to end for this new Okabe.  Like [Speculation](/s "Once he give the other Okabe the means to save Kurisu whats going to become of Okabe 0? Like is he going to just kill himself knowing that his mission was accomplished or maybe move on from all these traumas? I'm going to be very curious to find out hist fate.")

Is this new anime out or have I been under a rock 
>> ARTICLE
na its just they re did episode 23 of steins gate to better aline with the new series and everyone is going crazy about it
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't really a redo in the traditional sense. They are not retconning the normal Episode 23. The new 23  is supposed to reflect a different world line, specifically the one that leads into Steins;Gate 0. This new world line is where Okabe [S;G 23 Spoilers](/s "never saves Kurisu and instead gives up on trying to save her after his first failure. I believe that this is also the world line in which Okabe creates the video which he sends to his past self to tell the Okabes in every other world line how to save Kurisu, but I am not sure about that.")
>> ARTICLE
He is fashionable but he looks completely distraught and in emotional pain in all the images of him so far.

Maybe being Hououin Kyouma for real is a lot more stressful than he thought.

Attempt at Translation (Not perfect, likely to be mistakes)

Kurisu: Hello. My name is Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.

Okabe: Does fate come in these kind of forms (I wasn't really sure how to translate this line. Sorry if it doesn't make sense)
What do you think, Houin Kyouma?
Looks like I have to do it after all in the end.
Wish me luck. 
>> ARTICLE
> Okabe: Does fate come in these kind of forms (I wasn't really sure how to translate this line. Sorry if it doesn't make sense)

Better translation:

"Does fate converge in this sort of way/this shape? Huh, Houin Kyouma?! 

Ultimately... it seems I have to do it after all. Please be wishing me luck in battle."
>> ARTICLE
One last thing during the title shot I'm pretty sure he says "El Psy Congroo" 

(I originally heard  but thought better of it)

That is what he says. The subbed version has been out for awhile now.

Yep he does, I completely missed the last part XD.

I just watched the stream of the new section and the first line Okabe says something along the lines of: "It seems fate has other things in store for us, Houin Kyouma"

Cool, thanks. Can't wait to see the scene where Okabe records the message, I'm getting chills just thinking about it.
>> ARTICLE
It's sorta an "inbetweenquel". All of *S;G0* will essentially take place in episode 23 of *S;G*.
>> ARTICLE
So where does the movie fit in? I watched the dubbed version of S;G and I couldn't bare myself to listen to anyone else than J Michael Tatum deliver Okabe's oratory madness. Thus, I have held off on the movie, hoping for a dub, which does *not* seem to be coming.... So what should I do about the movie?
>> ARTICLE
The movie is not technically canon. That doesn't mean it's bad, or anything negative. It just means that the events of the movie **are not taken into consideration by the creators** for the continuity of events in future *SciAdv* titles, like *S;G0*. So, in a nutshell, the events of the movie and episode 25 (the OVA), will not factor into *S;G0* at all.
>> ARTICLE
The movie is an epilogue of Steins;Gate as it normally ends at episode 24 + the OVA. The main point of the movie was to further build on Okabe and Kurisu's relationship. Funimation technically did license distribution rights for the movie in NA so your hope of a dub might be possible? It did take them two years before doing a dub of the regular series after all and it's only been somewhat over two years now.  

Although, if you really won't watch a subbed version...well, enjoying waiting for 2017 going at Funi's rate for when Steins;Gate 0 is dubbed, haha!
>> ARTICLE
All these secondaries. It's spelled El Psy Kongroo.
>> ARTICLE
El Psy Kongalee.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately Funimation took Crunchy Rolls errors and rolled with them. "Ruka" and "Congroo" made it onto the Steins;Gate DVD/Blurays despite how 5pb have stated their official english translations.

At least they're minor things, I remember that one of the releases of the Steins;Gate manga actually translated "Tutturu~" and "Toodle-do!"

In Steins;Gate 0, Okabe, using his memories of Kurisu, builds an AI based on her, and when he finally activates it he realized just how much that'd hit him in the feels.")

>> ARTICLE
Whoa fuck what chapter of the manga is that from?  
I thought they stopped making it.
>> ARTICLE
That's from the second book, *Pandora Of Eternal Return*. Chapter three, iirc. And yes, the manga adaptation of the *Epigraph* trilogy LNs is on an "indefinite hold" and has been since May. It's effectively canned, as the new VN will overwrite it in terms of *SciAdv* canon.
>> ARTICLE
So, there's a manga of it? I thought it was an original VN story that's about to come out?
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit complicated. Here's the breakdown as simplified as I can make it.

First, there were the *Epigraph* trilogy of LNs. Those have not been translated into English, but the first two were adapted into manga and those were translated. The upcoming VN is going to take the *Epigraph* story, mix in some stuff from the Beta Drama CDs, and also add some new content. So *S;G0* is heavily influenced by and partially based on *Epigraph*, but it's not an adaptation and will actually replace *Epigraph* in the setting canon.

They seem to have lifted a fair amount.  For instance Okabe's relatively normal (threw away his mad scientist shtick) and is even going to mixers looking for dates.  He doesn't visit the lab and apparently is a somewhat talented student when he applies himself.

I wonder if he'll drive...

Don't worry that wasn't really a major spoiler, its something you learn from watching some trailers of the game or reading the box
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, "massive" probably isn't entirely accurate. But better to warn big than warn small, when dealing with spoilers. There's always a chance some dumb-dumb who hasn't seen *S;G* yet might wander into this thread.
>> ARTICLE
fjuh im safe then
>> ARTICLE
Knowing that YouTube captions are horrible, especially when you translate between languages. According to the translations, this is what the teaser said. 


Kurisu "Yes, click, gamble."

Okabe "lukashenko civil code that alligns. Komorowski, instead of always ok. Q, more than mayence, toyota. Q, like the others."

>> ARTICLE
>toyota

?

lol this is so good xD
>> ARTICLE
[WhyNot/Reading Steiner's translation of the teaser](/s "Kurisu: Nice to meet you. I'm Makise Kurisu. I hope we can get along. Okabe: It seems fate has decided to converge once again, Hououin Kyouma. I guess we have to fight either way in the end. Pray for my good fortune. El Psy Kongroo.")

I'm really, really curious about what Okabe is actually looking at. Some past recording? Some kind of AI? WTF is the "Amadeus System"? 

And now my ~~watch~~ wait begins.

Edit: Steins;Gate wiki has the answers to my questions above if you're also wondering.
>> ARTICLE
I know what they were saying, I was just laughing at how bad youtube is at translating. 

Also, to further note. She said hajimemashite, meaning, nice to meet you (for the first time). You don't say that if you already know somebody, that's an initial greeting.

So wait - I've seen all original 24 episodes of Steins;Gate.  There's also a movie which I haven't watched yet.  It sounds like there's an Episode 23 Beta and a "Steins;Gate 0".  What order should I watch all these in?

I tried to use Youtube's closed captioning to translate into English. The problem is that it auto translates in French for whatever reason. Then it translates the French into English. So it goes Japanese sounds -> French translated text -> English translated text.

The translation I got goes as follows, and I'm not kidding here. 100% serious.

> Yes click . . . gamble

*cue Okabe heavy breathing*

> Lukashenko civil code that aligns

> Komorowski instead of always ok

Yes the literal letter q

You really won't have to worry about this just being a cash-out on the original series.

It was good. Slow start though, but I guess its expected. The first 12 episodes are there to set up the characters' personalities and you get a feel for them. After that, it gets real good. I highly recommend it also.

I also liked this for the same reason I liked Shiki.

The slow build-up was enjoyable, and led me into thinking "this is pretty good, but I'm not really expecting anything big to happen, even though I know it has to, by virtue of being an anime"
>> ARTICLE
I actually thought the pacing was OK for the first 12 episodes/exposition. After [the attractor field/Mayuri death arc there's some strange pacing issues. The weird fluctuation in dramatic tension was especially baffling for, say, the Ruka sub-arc. I understand what they were trying to do, but the awkward date scenario was very strange given how tense the background drama is (Mayuri's death, the looming threat of SERN/Moeka, etc.)](/spoiler)

This. Steins;Gate was like Shiki, but they messed the suspense a bit more in the middle and had nerdservice. This is also one of the reasons why it didn't make it to my top 3 of the spring/summer.

its true that this series has a slow start and I did actually find it pretty boring in the start too but I have to say I really am glad that I decided to watch the entire series instead of dropping it. its true that the series really starts getting good in episode 12.

I started enjoying the show around episode 7 though, so I would at the very least watch until episode 7 ,and if you still find it boring after that then I guess this show just isn't your type of show.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of have a problem with the idea of "don't worry, it'll get good in so many episodes."  
Then again, I did watch Babylon 5 with the promise that the action starts in the 3rd season, and I have told people to watch Eva until "the last third".  

>> ARTICLE
> its true that this series has a slow start and I did actually find it pretty boring in the start too

Actually, it's not boring if you pay attention to the inter-time communication premises. What we see here is a scientist ellaborating theories and making small, testable experiments. Granted, he ruins them by not being careful enough, but it all makes sense if you've ever analyzed a time-travel story before.

In this sense, the pacing is perfect for the first 12 episodes.

By coincidence, my dad just rented "Frequency" with Dennis Quaid; It involves communicating with the past, parallel timelines and the main character remembering both timelines. 

Sound familiar? (Awesome movie, btw)

I think I'll give it a second chance.  I tried to watch it when there was like 5 or 6 episodes out and got bored.  Does the show follow a single universe theory or a multi universe theory?

multi universe theory, though it might be slightly modified/different than the standard theories. They'll go into detail about the rules of the show though

The reason it seemed like a visual novel is because, you know, it IS a visual novel.  Just an adaption of it.  That was done far better than either of the other two in the series.

All in all I absolutely loved it but get that not everyone will like every anime.  If you haven't seen the OVA or the movie be sure to do so.  There's also a sequel light novel coming out that takes place about six years in the future, I believe.

There is only an OVA, there is no film and there won't be a sequel. Just like there are no Matrix sequels.

Although I'm assuming you're just trying to rustle my jimjams.  And I also don't know what you're referring to in terms of the Matrix.
>> ARTICLE
The Matrix sequels are considered horrible films in comparison to the first one, so some people just pretend there was only the first film. The same goes for the Steins;Gate anime and the film. The series is great, it makes sense, everything fits and then there is.... No. The film doesn't exist. I refuse to acknowlege it's existence. That's how horrible it is. It has no meaningful plot, it doesn't show new sides about the characters, it doesn't fit with the logic of the series.

Edit: As for the sequel, after seeing the film I lost my faith in the studio being able to make a sequel worthy of the original series/LN.

IMO the movie was terrible, not worth watching. It just tries to milk a story that already ended.

Gintama's time travel plot was surprisingly good. I was expecting so much more cliche out of something like that but it blew me away. 
>> ARTICLE
The story hadn't ended though. The OVA and Film answer the remaining questions left at the end of the series. If they didn't you'd have people making the same argument. "The series isn't 10/10. They need an OVA or film to tie up loose ends."
>> ARTICLE
What makes you feel that the story didn't end?  I thought it ended, and that the OVA and film could be deemed as "filler material", however, both were relevant and added some extra things to spice things up.  Sure, they weren't needed, but they were executed very well and only helped.  The OVA was there to help please fans with a strengthened bond between this world line's Kurisu and Okabe.  It also helped us all laugh when Okabe acts like a jackass when speaking English, again.
The only relevance to the rest of the series the film had was the origins of Hououin Kyouma.  Other than that, it was some more romance between Okabe and Kurisu and more wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff.  Outside of Kurisu being the one to give Okabe his alter ego, I didn't see it as anything relevant to the prior plot.  Sure, his Reading Steiner may have gone wonky, but that wasn't really guaranteed to happen, it just did.

tl;dr I think the story had indeed ended but they gave us the extra stuff because it added more flavor to the soup.  And the soup was already hella good to begin with.

OVA provides background information on who the mother of the girl from the future is (sorry, forgot names). It fleshed out how the fat hacker dude meets her mom. In addition it connects the Kirisu from the new timeline with the ones from the past

The series ends with MC saving her but she has no idea who he is. That's not too conclusive. 

Film fixes up the rest if this and connects her other memories to her. 

Thus with the OVA and Film it ends with both characters in the same timeline with al of their old memories. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes, forgot to mention that as being one of the good things the OVA provded as well.  And now that you mention it, I suppose it does a good job showcasing that they can retain their memories, although slightly, across world lines.

The movie I'm still iffy on, but again, I loved it as well as the rest of the series, so it ultimately doesn't matter to me.

I actually found the Robotics;Notes anime *less* visual novel-ish (although it was worse in every other aspect). In Steins;Gate, you can clearly see each girl's "route", which feels a bit mechanical; *okay, I just helped this girl come to terms with her tear-jerking backstory, now who's next?* Not that they could do much because of the source material, but this is why I prefer anime originals and book adaptations in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Robotics;Notes wasn't very VN-ish in the beginning but towards the end he might as well have been carrying a notepad, checking of each girl as he completed her tragic back-story. I think he did like three-four in a row.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on that one.  I disliked R;N most out of the series, but out of the three, it was definitely the least in that matter.

Here's to hoping that Chaos;Child and Occultic;Nine can have the best of both worlds - great stories and great adaptions.  And a Chaos;Head reboot that is done right would be nice.

I gave it a 10/10 mainly because they dealt with time travel extremely well. Many animes have tried to apply some sort of time manipulation but ended up falling apart due to irrelevant or unsuccessful plots/methods. Steins;gate unfolded the concept of time manipulation extremely well, while creating a relateable plot and story. The beginning slice of life drew you in and then boom, shit goes down. 
Also, TU-TURU~!
Excuse my English, not my first language.
>> ARTICLE
They actually dealt with time travel in a way i can actually understand what going on. And in my case it one the best way to tell a time travel anime/show or anime.... Im looking at you LosT
>> ARTICLE
I understand all of your complaints - it's not that I don't see the flaws, it's that I interpret them differently.

Okay, I got nothing about Ruka - I thought he was the most annoying character and could have easily been taken out with no consequences.

The obviously harem elements - yes, it's inevitable coming from a VN. I think they handled the harem elements really well though - imagine taking a bunch of different paths and condensing it into one linear narrative. Thankfully, with the power of time travel, they managed to adapt it extremely well.

The reason why I was rather okay with the harem elements is because it was all done surprisingly well. Feyris's story was heartwrenching - it drove home that time travel isn't a fix-all solution, it has real, tangible consequences.

I thought Feyris was annoying and generic. Until her little episode in the middle. That said, I can't see Feyris as a generic, stereotyped character anymore... she did go through some real development. I thought Moeka was a successful character study of dependence and depression; she definitely went through development as well. Many characters, like Mr. Braun, are not who they initially appear to be. In other words, the characters, while not perfect, have multiple facets which makes them better than the characters of many other shows. I'd say the characters are above average at worst.

Yes, the ending was cheesy and ideal. But you know what? In this series, I'm perfectly okay with that! After the brutal episode 22, and all the tragedies before then, I feel like the characters really deserved the best possible ending. What's more, it fulfills the thematic core perfectly by highlighting the importance of individual choice and the consequences of time travel on society.

However, all I have managed to do is deflect or respond to some of your criticisms. I still have not gotten to the heart of the matter: why an effortless 10/10?

I give it a 10/10 and the position of my #1 favorite anime. The reason is simple: it succeeds. Steins;Gate was an incredibly ambitious project - for starters, VNs aren't suited for the linear anime format, so how do you adapt a VN? Secondly, the plot is incredibly complex, especially when dealing with time travel - how do you prevent readers from being utterly lost and confused? How do you prevent plot inconsistencies? Third, how do you escape the character stereotypes and move beyond a typical, generic anime?

I'll answer each of those points one by one.

1. The VN adaptation was not exactly perfect (see: the harem in the middle of the action), but I think it was basically the best possible adaptation (excluding Ruka). Each character got one episode to introduce her, and then another episode to resolve her story arc. And in the context of time travel, it made perfect sense! Each character got the chance to develop and shine, and the whole time, the viewer still feels the plot progression. The character arcs NEED to be resolved in order for Okabe to continue his path, so they're well-justified. Finally, the anime adaptation picks a route and sticks with it. Sure, elements of romance are hinted at in different routes, but the anime makes it clear who the main romantic interest is. That eliminates much of the harem antics.

2. The plot is beautifully done, not much I can say about that. In episode 23-24, when the viewer finally sees the events of episode 1 resolved, the sense of satisfaction is immense.

3. Steins;Gate largely avoids this by being genre-savvy, with lots of references to current culture and anime standards. The dialogue in particular is well-done and feels more real and human than other anime. The only exception might be that Kurisu's tsundere was turned up a little too high.

When a series accomplishes everything it sets out to do, I don't mind giving it a 10/10 easily.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with most of what you said except I enjoyed Ruka as a character.  Also you didn't mention Daru at all Which is too bad because he played off the other characters really well and underwent some very well-done character development.

Overall, though, I gave it a 9/10 despite it being one of my top 3 favorite anime because I think I would have preferred if it ended at ep 22.  That's just me, though.
>> ARTICLE
the reason i didn't mind the "harem elements" (insofar as i am acknowledging that they are there to allow me to even comment) is that it didn't seem harem-y.  was mayuri in love with okabe?  no.  was feyris?  no.  was ruka?  no.  was cell phone girl?  no.  there wasn't even any other real romance besides the one between okabe and kurisu.  because of that, it didn't feel "harem"-y.
>> ARTICLE
I think it throws people off that Steins;Gate definitely has the set-up for a harem, being an adaptation of a VN where you pick the route to get the girl, but the Harem just never happens.
>> ARTICLE
I totally thought Mayuri was in love with Okabe until after everything ended. :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, me too. I thought there was that whole childhood friend love interest thing going on, which made it even better, for me, that that expectation was successfully subverted.  
>> ARTICLE
I hate how every time the MC is remotely involved in a love-triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, etc. the story instantly becomes a harem.  A harem requires a certain commitment. Competing for the love of one person is not a harem.
>> ARTICLE
Good, so I'm not the only one who thinks that. I basically made the same argument for the [Monogatari series](/r/araragi) - while there are elements of romance with a number of characters, there's only one actual relationship there.
>> ARTICLE
i agree, and i've gone around and around with people in this sub about it :(
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, except I think Ruka's love was heavily hinted at. Also, Feyris was somewhat ambiguous. But yes I agree - there was only one real romance.
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't find the flag to Kurisutina's route in the VN, you [](/s "were automatically going for Mayuri route"), so yeah. 
And even if you found it, it was very tricky to get all the flags for True (anime) ending, if you missed just one, [](/s "Mayuri is dead"). 
>> ARTICLE
I was referring mainly to the anime, which follows the true route anyway :) In the anime, there really weren't any signs that Okabe had a romantic interest in Mayuri
>> ARTICLE
Right. Other routes are other routes. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched S;G as it aired, played the VN a few months ago when it was released, and recently rewatched the anime.  It's an incredibly good adaptation, which is probably a big part of the reason it was a hit in Japan (S;G's VN was very popular there), and when something's really sensationally popular in Japan usually 4chan and other sites pick up on it and get aboard the hype train.  The frequent major cliffhangers also kept people talking about it.

Anyway, there's a lot of reasons I'd say it's great but I think the thing that pushed it into everyone's toplist is that for the last... I dunno, 8+ years (?) many of us have endured a deluge of shows that have minimal original plot or concepts and which often just seem to serve as vehicles for fanservice to sell merchandise: "Here are some girls with barely any clothes on and here are some $80 figures", rinse, repeat.  There have been other exceptions to this rule but they've been rare; there's only been 0-2 anime series/movies a year that I'd consider buying, and I used to buy *a lot*.  In fact, looking at my recent purchases I can see the only things I've bought recently are Elfen Lied's blu-ray release, Steins;Gate, the Akira re-release, a handful of Shinkai movies, and AoT... so like 8 anime purchases in as many years, and next to them on the shelf are maybe 50 other anime DVDs.

So, scarcity of good anime that focus on a captivating story and interesting characters more than pantyshots are a big part of the reason.  Another big part is that there's probably a fairly strong overlap between people who watch anime and people who are geeks, so the hard sci-fi aspects appealed to us a lot.

Some other things I liked:

- Okabe and Kurisu are the most "believable" couple I've seen in anime recently (and Suzuha is possibly my favorite character overall... play the VN)

- Great soundtrack, voice acting, and audio generally

- Great art, hardly any recycled animation or other lazy tricks

- Awesome humor

- The story was unpredictable but made sense, it always kept me on the edge of my seat and checking to see if the latest episode was out yet every 5 minutes on release day

- All the main characters are basically just regular people trying to make sense of an impossible situation; aside from Okabe's ability to retain his memories between timelines (which is almost a curse), nobody in the show has any kind of "powers" or other nonsense.  The main character doesn't save the day by screaming, raising his power level, or forcing a mecha to bend to his will through the sheer power of his manliness, he's just *some guy* trying to keep his friends alive while the universe itself keeps demanding their death.

- The events of episodes 23 and 24 (and what leads up to them) make complete sense and give the main series a satisfying conclusion.  The ending was foreshadowed from the very beginning... and I'm repeating myself a bit here, but I have to emphasize: the main character doesn't save the day *by waving around his giant dicksword*, he does it by using the same rules of causality that kill his friends to save them instead

- NO NO NO, SERIOUSLY.  The main character is *completely powerless*, the single ability he has only offers him the chance to watch his friends die in every horrible way imaginable.  Where's his fucking mecha?  Where's his magic eye or notebook?  No, all he has is the unlimited opportunity to discover in minute detail how completely powerless he is.  And he remains powerless *for the entire anime*.  There's no eleventh-hour superpower, he's just a regular guy from beginning to end.  At the end of his journey back to the beta worldline he's so broken inside that he can't even bring himself to care about possibly saving billions of people's lives.  His mind reached its limit *months or even years ago* and it's only been a matter of days for everyone around him, people who will never know the ordeal he's been through for their sake.  He pretends everything's alright, he desperately hopes everything's alright, but in reality he's become hollow inside.  When faced with the opportunity to prevent World War 3, as far as he's concerned, if the world's so fucking determined to burn he's fine with just letting it burn, because he can say with confidence that billions of lives being lost is probably *the good alternative*.  The closest he comes to holding a sword is a glowstick, the closest he comes to having a gun is a children's toy.  He holds a knife exactly once and it's for the sake of stabbing himself with it.  He has to play by the universe's rules, and the universe demands he gets a Bad End.
>> ARTICLE
As you say the main character is completely powerless, he's also completely powerless against his own peers, at times being bounced around to do things such as groceries or buying/retrieving stuff needed to set up experiments. (I'm speaking about you Makise, Mayuri and Daru)
>> ARTICLE
For me it was an enjoyable anime: interesting plot, likeable characters, bits of romance and comedy thrown in.

In my opinion it isn't a 10/10 but I can see why some people like it so much, it's definitely worth watching.  Some fans overhype it, but you can find that with almost any series, really.
>> ARTICLE
The main reason I gave it 10/10 is because I haven't really seen something that I would consider better than Steins;Gate. Sure, I've seen things that I consider as good as, but not better. To those, I also gave a 10/10.  
I know it has flaws and it isn't perfect as a 10/10 should theorically be, but nothing is and I don't think anything ever will. Specially when grading on scale with only 10 options, if I had to give a 9 for it, it would fall on the same level as animes that aren't as good as it (but are still good), so I believe it should be higher than those, making the only option 10.  
Things could be diferent though if the way we think about grades changed. If 5 was the grade for an average/non disappointing anime that still deserves to be watched, then I'd probably not give 10/10 for SG.

>> ARTICLE
> The main reason I gave it 10/10 is because I haven't really seen something that I would consider better than Steins;Gate

this right here is why it's 10/10.  it is the show against which i will measure other time travel shows.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly.  10/10 for me doesn't mean "it's perfect in every way", it means "I would give it my highest recommendation".
>> ARTICLE
There is my problem with basicly every score based reviews out there. On a scale from 1 to 10. You would think 5 would mean it's dead average and not terribly good, nor bad. Just average.

Just out of the top of my head right now, sombody like GRarkada(?) is terrible at this.

The most common scoring system goes like this:

* 1 to 3 basicly doesnt exist.
* 4/5 - It is basicly terrible and not recommended to watch at all.
* 6 - It's not particularly good, but it might be worth a try if you got nothing else.
* 7 - It's pretty good, not amazing and has its flaws. Recommeded to it's designed audience.
* 8 - Now we are getting pretty serious, it's rather good, nothing in particular wrong with it. It's just not a masterpiece.
* 9 - OMG this show is epic, it's a masterpiece. A MUST WATCH for any fan out there
* 10 - Basicly anything regarded as a 8/9 score but is ten~ years old, that is being review now, and is considered a "Classic".


The sole reason I gave Steins;Gate a 10/10 is because there is nothing better out there currently. It's not perfect (as a 10/10 score would imply). But it's simply the best show out there as of now. **In my opinion**
I also gave something like **AnoHana** or **Angel Beats** around a score of 5/6 (Which seems to be this some of this subreddits favorites aswell). They are not bad at all, they are totally watchable and deserves whatever praise they get. But are nothing special **For me**, they are average, nothing amazing nor terrible about them. This is just my opinion as an example.

So I guess I mix alittle of what *most reviewers* and you score things off of.

**tl;dr** : Basicly how wrongly most reviewers use the 1 - 10 scoring system. And how a mix of *Faisken* and my scoring system would work.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch TheNeedleDrop, Anthony Fantano's reviews of music, he does a much better scale where essentially nothing gets above like a 7 unless it is mindblowingly good, and a lot of things get a 4, 5 or a 6.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying anything bad about his scale. But doesnt his ratings seem abit ineffective? If 7 - 10 rarely gets used, isn't it used wasted "space"?

Then again I just looked up the first review some Spoon album, which he stated was "Decent, I'll give it a 7".

Edit: To go on; if as you say a 7 has to be mindblowingly good, then what is the difference between 7 and 8? If 7 is mindblowingly good, then 8 must be near perfect right..? ...so what then happends to 9 and 10?

ps: I might just be talking out of my ass here on a random rant, I havent actually watch Anthony Fantano's reviews at all.
>> ARTICLE
> I just looked up the first review some Spoon album, which he stated was "Decent, I'll give it a 7".

No, what he said was "I'm feeling a decent to strong 7". He likes to give his score as a range rather than just a single number, and always says something like "strong 8 to a light 9" or "light to decent 5".

> If 7 - 10 rarely gets used, isn't it used wasted "space"?

I wouldn't say that they rarely get used. I would say that he uses them very appropriately.

I've been watching his reviews for almost a year now, and to me it feels like he gives a 7 to things that are more than just decent. A 7 is something that is good, something that anyone with an interest in the genre can get a lot of enjoyment out of.

An 8 is quite an achievement, something that feels fresh, interesting and well thought out, a coherent album with few dull moments. He'll usually give out one to three 8's each month (on the YT channel at least, I believe he does a lot more reviews on his website).

A 9 is quite incredible, and should be checked out by anyone who has a more than a casual interest in music. It succeeds on almost every level and has very few flaws. Top contender for AOTY in that genre.

A 10 is a modern masterpiece, which will be talked about for years to come. It perfects a concept and takes it to a new level. When looking back on a particular decade, these albums instantly come to mind. I don't think he's given a 10 to anything but [The Money Store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Money_Store_\(album\)) and [To Be Kind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Be_Kind).

>On a scale from 1 to 10. You would think 5 would mean it's dead average and not terribly good, nor bad. Just average.

The other thing to keep in mind is that people use varying methodologies for how they determine their score. Some people try to rate shows from a critical perspective. Others rate based on how much they enjoy the show. Still others rate based on a mixture of these two. Based on your comment, I gather your biggest issue with ratings is with people who rate based on enjoyment or let that factor heavily into their rating. Most people watch anime *because* they enjoy it, and usually choose specific anime to watch because they think they'll enjoy those anime. I suspect the majority of the time they're accurate with their selection, which is why many MAL scores fall in the 6-10 range, which would range from an "okay" to a "I can't imagine enjoying that anymore" level of enjoyment. Furthermore, when people do miss on a show and aren't enjoying it, most people aren't going to force themselves to finish it, meaning there will be almost no completed shows that will be scored 1-3. 

If people were to randomly select anime to watch, and finished watching them no matter how bad they thought they were, I bet there would probably be many more MAL scores in the 1-5 range, and the actual average for most people's scores would probably me much closer to 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've suggested in past threads that MAL should have two rating systems to take different scoring methods into account. It could let you first rate shows based on how much you enjoyed them and then by how objectively good you believe them to be after taking into account things such as plot, music, characters, etc. Then the two scores would remain separate or be combined to create a final score. 

Or at the very least your method of rating could be shown on your profile so that others will know whether your rating from a critical or enjoyability perspective. 
>> ARTICLE
People treat the 1-10 scale like school grades. 7.5 = 75% = C = average. So if you really want something to blame, you can blame the American schooling system and society. 

Though to be honest absolute scores are hardly useful compared to z scores.

Yes, blame the Americans in particular. There's no other country, specifically not Asia, where academic excellence is expected.

>> ARTICLE
It is my belief that people take issue with giving scores on the lower end of the spectrum not because they feel that there are not shows that deserve them, but rather because they don't actually watch the shows that they feel might deserve them. What I mean by this is that truly terrible shows often get such a negative reputation that many people will not watch them, however they will know that they exist due to their infamy. As a result of this people may feel the need to preserve the lower range scores for these "infamously bad" shows regardless of whether or not they actually watch and score them. So a show someone considers bad might get a 4 as opposed to a 2 as said person has heard of, but not seen, shows which people make out as being much worse and basically the trash of the anime world (see Mars of Destruction).

Edit: To expand on my point on a little - the very fact that an anime the reviewer considered bad gets a score of 4 obviously then necessitates the inflation of the scores given to any anime better than it to the point at which a score of around 7 becomes the hallmark of a watchable anime. It is this preservation of the lower scores, which may as well be considered the circles of hell, that leads to anime receiving higher scores than perhaps they should if 5 were to be taken as an average and watchable anime. Having said that, I do not think the current system is bad per se, provided that it is looked at in context.
>> ARTICLE
So basicly what you are saying in the first part is that the lower scores are already reserved to those infamously bad, which people would point at as to being *really* bad. So basicly something like *School Days* of modern anime. So anything that isnt those infamous ones can only get a 4 at worst. 

But it leaves an awfull lot of "wasted space". If *zed* anime were to recieve a 1 or a 3 wouldnt really matter would it? Due to it already being infamously bad. You would either not watch it(you were told it was trash). Or you would watch it only because you heard it was infamously trash.
The latter not relying on score at all most likely.

As for your expanded part, it isnt as you say "bad per se". Generally it works really well. But sometimes I feel like due to there being fewer digits to base the score of. It gets clustered up. As where something **X** reviewer thought was really good got an 8, while something else he praised just as much just got a 7. Then again, it might the the Reviewer at fault. But I have seen multiple scenarios where exactly this has happend.


Edit; If anyone even bothered to read this far down in my random rants. Here is another one.

So if you tecnically *Cant* get a score lower than 4 from most reviewers, in this case anime reviews. Wouldnt it then be a profittable market for "Shitty, but barely watchable" anime to be made? Where you have a really low budget anime with an interesting premise, and just make it *barely* an acceptable watch. It has probably already been done, since there are a fare few manga/LN adaptations where shit just hit the fan hard for the sake of selling more of *zed* mange/LN.
Was just a random thought I had.


>> ARTICLE
My message boils down to this scenario - suppose a reviewer makes a review of an anime he considers bad but not terrible, worthy perhaps of a score around 3, now consider that he has made a review of School Days an awarded it a 2 (even if he has not made the review, he may feel it is worth this in his mind). To give this new anime a 3 would bring it very close to School Days in terms of score, and as a result may lead to comparisons of the two anime, suggesting that they are similarly poor in terms of quality. Now then the reviewer, whilst he considers this anime bad, does not believe it to be anywhere near as bad as School Days in terms of quality, so as a result he inflates the score somewhat, perhaps to a 4, so as to avoid comparisons. It is not that scores of 1 to 3 are never used, just that they are reserved for truly terrible anime, and as a result few scoring margins are left for "just" bad anime. One could suggest using a decimal system with a score given out of 10.0 however here the difference gives an impression of being too incremental assuming certain ranges are still adhered to for certain levels of quality. Likewise in a larger system there are simply to many scores to the point at which again create artificial restrictions (see Metacritic where 75+ is again the hallmark for something playable in terms of games). Thus I feel the key issue with reviewing is not necessarily the scoring format but rather that it is looked at comparatively as opposed to within isolation, that the anime is assessed by the quality of other anime as opposed to on its own merits, a situation brought about by scores but not inherent to them.

I like to think people rate shows based on personal enjoyment, god help us all if that's not the case.

A lot has been said in this thread already so I will keep this simple:

1. Good story contributes to your enjoyment;
2. Good characters contribute to your enjoyment;
3. Good story != Good characters != enjoyment;

Also wish fulfillment shows and characters are not a bad thing, why would they be?

Honestly a story is a work of art, not something you can break down by it's plot, characters, setting and other factors. They are simply used as metric to try to gauge a numerical score to a show, but none of that cant possibly account for personal preference and that's the only thing that matters.

You can see what I'm getting at right? No one can say why Steins;Gate, it just so happens that most of us enjoy it, if it was easy to objectively describe what kind of anime is good then making money would be a walk in the park :P
>> ARTICLE
You are kinda missing the point that Okabe has to forever live with the memory of what had occurred. He has seen Mayuri (and others) die tragically hundreds if not thousands of times. He suffers this burden by himself. And it eats at him but he is strong enough to not let it get to him, which you can see in the OVA and movie.

And the show is based off a VN. If they had 13 more episodes, they can probably flesh out the other characters better, but as a complete story about Okabe, Kurisu, and Mayuri, the series works really well as is.
>> ARTICLE
i think he saw [derp](/s "mayuri die 26 or 27 times.")
>> ARTICLE
You haven't played the VN.
>> ARTICLE
i wasn't talking about the vn.  what is in the vn that indicates it's more or less than that?
>> ARTICLE
It's been a few months since I played the VN or watched the anime, but IIRC:

- it doesn't explicitly state a precise number but the VN implies that he tried a lot more times than we're shown, both in the anime and in the VN itself

- in the anime (somewhere in episodes 20-24 IIRC) he said "dozens" IIRC, though that may have been a liberal translation... safe to say many tens of times at the minimum though

- given the lengths he goes to for other characters (see Suzuha's ending) I think he probably attempted to save Mayuri hundreds of times - enough times that, as he says himself, it stopped bothering him to see her die

You should really play the VN, it's worth the time spent.
>> ARTICLE
Kurisu also called him directly out on that "it stopped bothering me" bullshit, in the anime, and he fessed up that it was an exaggeration. 

edit:  furthermore there is good, canonical evidence that he witnessed it [23 times](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1xmq1f/spoilers_tuturuu_questioninvestigation_about/).

>> ARTICLE
VN is canon and the anime glosses over and skips a lot of things.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it definitely does a very competent job of keeping the overall story structure intact while shrinking it down to a 24-episode format, and also broadens its audience considerably.

Anyway, I've played through it to 100% completion and as much as I enjoyed it I'm reluctant to play through the whole thing again just to find texts where Okabe mentions how many times he attempted to save Mayuri.  I know for sure he doesn't give an exact number, but I can say confidently though that he tried many more times than we're shown, and the VN already shows more of her death scenarios than the anime.

As an aside, the S;G movie implies that Okabe as we know him may actually have memories from many different possible timelines, even ones that aren't part of the "true ending" that the anime depicts or otherwise shown in the anime, and by extension, potentially even ones the VN itself didn't cover.  Two examples are Nae with the knife (an alternate scene from the VN not shown in the anime) and a portion of Suzuha's ending.  If the movie is accepted as canon, and unless I'm misunderstanding, it implies that Okabe may have virtually infinite memories of every possible attempt to save Mayuri across every possible Alpha timeline, so from his perspective he's seen her die an infinite number of times.
>> ARTICLE
this is one of the reasons vn to anime adaptations are so thorny: canon debates.  i'm not having it.  we're in /r/anime, the anime is canon.  take that vn shit to /r/visualnovels. 
>> ARTICLE
Kurisu is a Tsundere.

I really like the show and VN because it's about time travel. And not only that, it uses a popular story from a self proclaimed Time traveller who appeared online in the year 2000. Oh well. You already heard that. But did you know that this self proclaimed time traveller [really existed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor)?  And they really did their research on him.

[SG](/s "From his theory he used to travel back in time, the dystopia, how he thinks that bicycles are important and so on. It's all stuff Titor said back then.") And I really like it when anime use stuff that really exists in our world and use it for their story. And it was also very good executed. The timelines make sense and it doesn't contradict itself in any way and you can also perfectly relate to the characters. Especially Okabe.

Also S;G goes deeper than what you can see in the anime. It's part of a bigger story about a conspiracy around the commitee of 300. And you know that? This conspiracy also [really exists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_300). They just left this part completely out in the anime, even though it's the one thing that connects Chos;Head, Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes.

Regarding the characters: Yes. There were many clich characters. Mayushii, the air head (and I tell you, after getting the VN to 100& I can't stand her speaking patterns anymore. Geez.), Kuriu the Tsundere, Ruka the shy girl, Moeka the quiet girl, Okabe with his chuunibyou stuff and the energetic Suzuha. Ok. Point taken. But just these tropes don't make them bad characters. It's also possible to relate to Okabe, who lives his boring student life and just wants something interesting to happen

Also the happy ending was due to the VN nature, as others already told you. It's the one true ending in which everything is happy. There are other endings which are extremely dark. The one I will never forget is Faris' ending. That was some tough shit. Also the scenes which led to Suzuhas ending. Damn. Oh, and then there was 
[VN](/s "Jelly-Mayushii").

There also wasn't really much of a dating aspect in the VN and it never really felt like this. It was mainly just Ruka who had a crush on Okabe, even though you actually get together with the different girls in the different endings. But it was only implied in Suzuhas ending at least.

And you complain about character development. The thing is: The only character really going through a character development is OKabe for obvious reasons. For all the other characters the time is rewinded every now and then. And we're just talking about a week here where all this stuff happens. The other characters can't really develop, because there isn't much happening for them. So it would actually be very weird to see them change very much. The exception is Kurisu of course to some degree, because Okabe always fills her in.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. It's a *very* good anime, but not my favorite of all time. Looking back, the story was emotional and captivating, but the ending was a bit straightforward and in its entirety Steins;Gate didn't blow my mind away. In addition, I couldn't stand Okabe for half the series.

However, as a whole, it is a masterpiece. The music is some of the best of any anime, the art is terrific, and the voice acting is on par. While I did not think the story was as genius as others would think, I can understand why some people really enjoyed the story.
>> ARTICLE
It sounds like you went into it knowing how hyped it was and you were looking for things to complain about - I don't know what to say other than congrats, you found them good job.

Steins gate gets a 10 from me because it did a great job building rising tension and then resolving it.  That doesn't sound like much but it is integral to good storytelling and most shows don't do it we'll at all.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get the part for the little sucker punch where you accuse him of nitpicking explicitly because the show is hyped. Why can't he have problems with the show regardless of hype? In fact, that seems to be an overwhelming amount of SAO discussion in this subreddit that the subreddit decides to strike viciously upon SAO disproportionate to how bad SAO actually is.

But I'll play devil's advocate given your justification. If building tension is integral to good storytelling and that's all Steins;Gate does, what justifies calling it a masterpiece? Solely based off your definition, all Steins;Gate does is good. All it means is other things you've watched failed in delivering a good story but that doesn't mean Steins;Gate suddenly is a masterpiece. It's like finding a piece of silver in a mound of trash and calling it gold.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not the one you replied to, but in my case, I'm sometimes let down by shows that are really popular. It's because your expectations are so high, that every flaw, no matter how minor, comes as a disappointment.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, this is obviously true as shown by SAO. But my question still remains why the accusation is necessary? He can still find flaws with Steins;Gate and they're still legitimate. The argument that "nitpick because hype" can be used to defend any anime that gets hyped and is recieved well no matter how bad it is. That type of counterargument obliterates criticism because it's dismissive. It's essentially, you can't find flaws with what I like.
>> ARTICLE
A ten from me just means it was in the top ten percent of shows I liked.  I rate things based on a decile system (I give even amounts of each rating.)

Building and resolving tension isn't easy - to do it as well as SG did you have to do a number of other things right.  Things like using characters that are interesting so the audience cares about the resolution, having a presentation (art/music) that subtly enhances the story without being distracting or immersion breaking, having good plot pacing to keep things interesting but not confusing or underdeveloped... And so on.  So doing it well basically means you did lots of stuff well.
>> ARTICLE
And a ten as defined by the rating system that you're participating in labels 10 as a masterpiece. 10% of works aren't masterpieces. That's fine if you want to call it top 10% (I'm pretty sure I have it within my top 10% as well), but 10/10 in the rating system means something else. Say if you were classifying people's intelligence. The way IQ works is a distributed bell curve. In the same way genius correlates to a small group, so does masterpiece in most people's analysis or at least it's intended to. MAL ratings just have gone to shit with people employing different metrics that deviate heavily from MAL's defined scale. The average anime isn't average according to the new scale, the average anime is "good".

Your argument only defends your interpretation of 10/10, however if we use the defined scale, does Steins;Gate really qualify as a masterpiece?

Steins;Gate was incredibly slow in its pacing early on and was very boring personally. In the end, it picked up but again, I still believe that doing these things only makes an anime good. A great anime requires more than just presenting the story nicely. The real question is what makes Steins;Gate a masterpiece? Simply meeting the criteria of being a basic story qualifies you as Harry Potter. What makes Steins;Gate a classic instead of just another solid story?
>> ARTICLE
We'll if you equate a masterpiece rating to genius IQ, genius is four Std devss above mean which corresponds to one in ten thousand people or anime show.  Since most people don't watch that many very few would have an outlier that far.  A rating system like that would wind up not even using that score in the majority of cases which I do not feel is very useful.  I like my approach because to me there is a lot of meaningful separation in quality that gets lost when your distribution is clustered like bell curves are.

Also it is very important to note that the results from IQ tests do not resemble a bell curve at all - rather they are shunted from their original distribution and artificially transformed to follow a bell curve after the test scores come in.

Ill repeat myself one last time as to why I give SG a ten - to me the tension of the story had great impact, I really cared about the conflict and the resolution of the conflict.  I was highly invested in the outcome in a way that I was not with other shows.  Maybe this isn't as important to you as it is to me when judging a show, or maybe it is but you weren't as impressed in this case, but I never said my ten had to be universal.  It is just my personal ten.


>> ARTICLE
It doesn't even have to be exact, the point is that the distribution is more of a bell curve. I'm not making a 1:1 equivalency to IQ and thus the distribution doesn't have to be like an IQ. You can isolate any range centered around 100 and extend it to a certain point. It doesn't have to go from average to genius.

And there's a lot of meaningful separation in quality when you lump in the top 10% with each other. Look, there are tons of randoms in college who fit in the top 10% of intelligence. Your scale lumps those people in with Einstein. Meanwhile a bell curve, while it eliminates the difference between the B and C student provides us a way to distinguish between your random A student and Einstein. It's a matter of where you try to lose the distinction.

Yes and that's what a rating scale ultimately is, comparative. They can be altered the question is whether Steins;Gate would hold to a ten.

That's not my point. I'm not saying you can't personally rate Steins;Gate a 10. My point is that you tried to invalidate OP's viewing of Steins;Gate by insisting he's nitpicking because of Steins;Gate's popularity. By certain standards it's very easy to say Steins;Gate isn't a 10. He's simply asking why it gets bombarded into a 10.
>> ARTICLE
It's sort of the least common denominator. Like Fullmetal Alchemist, pretty much everyone can agree that it is good to great, making it one of the top recommendations, leading to lots of people seeing it, leading to everyone knowing it, leading to it being a must-watch type of thing. Now, I love Steins;Gate, and think it is worthy of a 9.5/10 or so. 

It's not perfect, nothing is, but I love the mix of humor and drama, and even though some of the characters were fairly flat, they were still all interesting and enjoyable to watch, and I'm okay with seeing something that is essentially Okabe's story. Just think of it as seeing the other characters the same way Okabe sees them. He's too busy to get into all the details of their lives and what makes them people, so he sees just a few facets of them instead. And we, as viewers tagging along with him, end up seeing the same thing. 
>> ARTICLE
Your complaints are pretty accurate. It's just that some people make the value judgement that the great plot outweighed the characters on this one, and you felt the other way. It's fine.

Though it's worth mentioning that the development of the relationship between Makise and Okabe was done well, helping to flesh out their individual characters. Their relationship became the plot driver - given that you've seen the anime, I'm sure you understand what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
You're completely right in that it's overrated, but not by much. The reason it loses points for me is that it felt like a slog until people started dying, but the last half of the series was well worth the build up. 

The ending was wish fulfillment, but they explained it and put effort into it so I think it works a lot better than other series. When I think of "lazy" happy endings the one that immediately comes to mind is Kyoukai no Kanata.

Personally, I agree with you on Steins;Gate. But then, I also do not think that Attack on Titan, Chuunibyou, AnoHana or Kill la Kill, shows highly regarded by this subreddit, were particularly good. What I do like, for example, is Mushishi, Mononoke, Wings of Honneamise, Usagi Drop or Kaiba (and anything by Masaaki really). How often do you see those shows mentioned in this subreddit?

A lot of it probably comes down to demographics. Younger people will prefer more action/moe/supernatural stuff at the cost of consistency, plot holes and quality of writing. Older people will prefer more story-driven shows with good character development at the cost of pure entertainment value. And I don't think either is wrong, after all, it only matters if you are enjoying it or not. But it's also easy to see which demographics is more prevalent here.

>> ARTICLE
> I also do not think that Attack on Titan, Chuunibyou, AnoHana or Kill la Kill, shows highly regarded by this subreddit

AoT is not highly regarded in this subreddit...there's a pretty big anti-circlejerk any time it's mentioned; [AOT spoilers](/s "Eren should've stayed dead!") and the like. There was a pretty big overhype push-back against Kill la Kill even before it finished airing. Chuuny is generally well-regarded but it can never be mentioned without people throwing up all over season 2; "what season 2 amirite guyz?!"

Anohana is the only one of those shows that is consistently gushed about in this subreddit with very little in terms of dissenting opinions.  
>> ARTICLE
AoT *was* popular, and it still *kinda* is, though the complaints and anti-hype have become more vocal since.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much every time AnoHana is mentioned you have people who say that they don't like it because it is just super-melodramatic, though I agree that it isn't as frequently criticised as Titan or Kill la Kill. Pretty much every popular anime has its fair share of both supporters and critics on /r/anime. 
>> ARTICLE
>don't like it because it is just super-melodramatic

True, I have seen that too and it's definitely a legitimate gripe. Anohana is way over the top at times. It still hit me with one hell of an emotional punch though so I forgive it for that flaw and consider it a very good anime. I refuse to listen to Secret Base again...I don't like that lump in my throat. 

>though I agree that it isn't as frequently criticised as Titan or Kill la Kill.

We can go ahead and add No Game No Life and Sword Art Online onto that list of extremely popular but very much criticized anime. It's getting increasingly rare for the most popular anime of any given season to be able to escape the anti-hype pushback. This season's most popular, Zankyou no Terror, will be the true test for this. It appears to be just masterfully done so far and almost beyond any major criticisms. We'll see if it'll stay that way or not after it finishes airing.  
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps I shouldn't have used the phrase "highly regarded" but "highly popular" instead, as what you describe is essentially my point. NGNL was criticized in a fair number of comments but those were *by far* outweighed by the amount of content generated by the community (like e.g Jibril artworks) and the sheer number of upvotes and gushing comments in each episode discussion thread. The massive popularity comes from one demographic, the small but vocal opposition -- from the other.
>> ARTICLE
> How often do you see those shows mentioned in this subreddit?

Mushishi is quite a favourite, as is Usagi Drop. Mononoke just won the /r/anime favourite anime film poll. The only anime you mentioned that I haven't seen frequently in this subreddit are Kaiba and Wings of Honneamise.

Also, in my experience, older fans are just as willing to forgive shows that have plot holes or other issues. The only real difference I've encountered between older fans and younger fans is that older ones think that anime was better in the past than it is today.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi only saw a recurrence after the airing of the second season. You could actually see it quite clearly during the spring season - there was a small group of people who watched only Ping Pong and Mushishi S2, and a large group watching NGNL, Hitsugi no Chaika or Akuma no Riddle.

Searching this subreddit for Usagi Drop yields a handful of results, vast majority of those under 30 upvotes. Try the same for NGNL or Kill la Kill.

Not much is going to compare to NGNL, Kill la Kill, SAO, AoT, etc. It's fruitless to complain otherwise. Usagi Drop is very, very frequently recommended in discussions about slice of life anime.

the thing that, for me, separates the ending of steins;gate from other "take a third option" endings is that he ended up having to make a choice between mayuri and kurisu.  he didn't and *couldn't* know that he would get to have his cake and eat it too, until the events after episode 22.

On thing I get a little peeved about:

"Wish fulfillment" is not a good thing or a bad thing.  People on /r/anime use buzzwords like that without realizing what they're trying to make a point about -- it doesn't matter if a character or a plotline is "wish-fulfillment", it matters how you got to that point, and if it's a satisfying and conclusive ending that  remains consistent with the premises and themes of what had come before.  In that sense, I think Steins;Gate had a great ending that wrapped up the show nicely.  And really, a happy ending suited it far better than a sad one -- they ended it in the only way they could have.

Honestly, I think the 'route' element of S;G is a executed very good. It not simply because he wants to help them, but the 'routes' element plays a important part to the plot at the same time [because](/s "if he doesnt explore the 'routes' Okabe will not be able to return to Alpha timeline"). It makes them have a significant role, not just some tearful stories abt some cute girls to complete a VN.

It made for a very unique show that I could see as plausibly being a 10/10 despite the flaws you mentioned.  This has a lot to do with my specific tastes though, so it maybe doesn't answer your question about the show's general popularity.  All I can say is that the things Steins;Gate does well are hard to come by.
>> ARTICLE
I like it because it takes those harem/VN elements and actually integrates them into the overall story. Instead of the character arcs being independent of each other, they all serve a purpose in reaching the end goal. And while the ending is a little bit of wish fulfillment, it is also really clever.

The reason Steins;Gate is so great as a time travel story is because it lays the rules down early, and executes a wonderfully complex plot without contradicting itself or having to bring up new rules. The reason I don't usually enjoy time travel stories (for example, Madoka Magica) is because they try to use time travel as a plot twist. 
>> ARTICLE
>it seemed like a visual novel with the obvious harem elements happening in the midst of the chaos. Some parts it was just girl characters (along with Ruka) fighting for attention from Okabe while more important events were going on. The ending was good but felt more like a wish-fulfillment ending, where everyone ends up happy and there are little-to-no consequences in the end. I'd like to hear some thoughts!

Are you describing Clannad or S;G?

In any event, I'll answer your question for what I think makes it an exceptional show.

Lets look at what it is:

* It's primarily a **thriller**
* with **dramatic** elements
* in the genre of **sci-fi.** 

In addition it contains some **slice of life** and **romance**.

For each one of these things it accomplished them well. Without repeating each one of those things, I will say that it has multiple great moments of each one. I would argue that for each of these 'things', from an analytical (non-opinion based) standpoint, S;G has examples of the best.

Next we have some finer points of creation: writing, narration, characters, cinematography. For the sake of time I will just say that the writing, especially the dialogue, is top notch:

**Narration** (how a story is told) is masterful - with the exception of ep 17 & 18 (the dating sim eps), it's so good it's almost like I'm watching something made by America. 

The two leading **characters** are among the most well conceived and effective anime has to offer; the supporting characters do their job, which is more than I can say for some of the leading characters of supposedly ["good"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/Mirai_Nikki_(TV) shows. 

**Cinematographic** elements, while nothing [ridiculous](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu), get the job done; animation and art style is fine but the real triumph of the art department is it's contribution to the tone and atmosphere of the show.

In the end you have a highly effective work of story telling, one that treats your mind/taste with respect, cares about it's characters, and knows how to craft a compelling narrative. All things that are truly rare in anime. And in a sea of lazy, uncreative story telling; with cat girls, high school melodrama, and teenagers saving the world, any flaws that S;G might have are simply meh*
>> ARTICLE
Why are you posting this when you gave it an 8. 8 is a very good score. Did you mean to give it like 6-7? You didn't think it was perfect. But you thought it was great. That should be enough. 10s are always always always subjective to the singular person, or a product of hype train. Perfection cannot be dolled out objectively to an anime. Ever. 

You're not wrong. But its weird to complain about a show you rated highly. 
>> ARTICLE
He's not saying it's bad - he's just saying he doesn't think it's not as good as everyone made it out to be (i.e. 10/10).
>> ARTICLE
Great plot, interesting characters. One of a few animes where I actually cared about what happened to each character. 
>> ARTICLE
Character interaction and development that is sorely lacking in many animes, fantastic dialogue, great art direction, and an interesting plot. It's not without it's faults and preferences differ, but for me it was everything I wanted in a show. Oddly enough my biggest reason for giving it a 10 was it reminded me of when I first watched Cowboy Bebop; not the actual content, but in the way that it captivated me.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's the only time travel anime that doesn't look like Swiss cheese with plot holes everywhere.
>> ARTICLE
You are not alone.  
I considered it to be dull at times and completely out of place. I am not here to pinpoint exactly why, [first 2 episodes spoilers](/s "but for example everyone I know freaks the shit out when he sees someone lieing on the ground with blood around her, but not only that a few moments later he sees that person walking around again. I mean cmon Okabe, you could atleast, like, tell Makise that in that one timeline she got murdered and she shoudl probably look out").  
That wasn't the only time where I felt like the characters acted completely absent from reality, I even dropped it halfway through at one point, becouse I got very bored of it.  
I think other anime with a similar premise pulled it off way better. Since mentioning the show would be a spoiler in itself I'll give a hint, the anime I am refering to begins with an H and it's [](/s "Higurashi")  
  
That being said, I still would rate it relativly highly becouse I like the anime as a whole(art, tropes, theme etc.)  
Take everything I say with a grain of salt, becouse I am one of the rare oddities who gives madoka only 7/10.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, the whole [](/s "groundhog's day") trope has been done by a lot of shows, including the two you said, [M](/s "adoka"), [H](/s "aruhi"), and (to a much lesser extent) [M](/s "irai Nikki"), idk if it's worth comparing them based solely on that. 
>> ARTICLE
> [first 2 episodes spoilers](/s "I mean cmon Okabe, you could atleast, like, tell Makise that in that one timeline she got murdered and she shoudl probably look out").  

[First 2 episodes spoilers](/s "He does? He tells her when he meets her. He even calls her "The Zombie" after that. The problem her is that Kurisu doesn't believe in time travel at that time.")
>> ARTICLE
My bad then, I can't believe I missed that, however my point still stands.
>> ARTICLE
Could you explain a bit further why it felt for you that the characters acted completely absent from reality?

Also your other mentioned anime had a big problem: [H](/s "You can't understand shit by watching it. To understand Higurashi you HAVE to play the VNs. Because they didn't even mention all the witch games stuff going on. So I can't say the Higurashi anime pulled time loops betetr off than Steins;Gate. In Steins;Gate you're only missing out on the Commitee of 300 stuff in the anime. But the story still works alone without that.")
>> ARTICLE
I've been dying to ask this too. I found it quite boring and kept falling asleep in it. Couldn't get past the first few episodes and tried many times. Does it get better?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Much better. (The first few episodes are very unlike the rest of the show.)

I suggest you try to stick it out at least halfway through the show.
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly. My biggest disappointment was probably how [](/s "Ruka had the same shy, insecure, downtrodden personality in the timeline where she was born a girl. You'd think getting rid of her gender dysphoria would increase her confidence a bit more than that.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "Her apparent gender dysphoria is not what made her shy; that's simply an aspect of her personality.")
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree with you. The plot is really great, but I think the characters lack depth.

But another point I don't really think you're touching on is that I don't really think it has thematic depth either, which for me stops it from going beyond a 7/10. A huge part of why Madoka is a 10/10 for me is because it so tightly focuses on the theme of desire, and ultimately asks the question, "Is there such thing as a selfless desire?" and then tackles that question from multiple perspectives with multiple layers.

A lot of people who give Steins;Gate a 10/10 will defend it and say things like, "well, you went in with expectations too high and were nitpicky" or "it's all about how much you enjoyed it." But while I may have really enjoyed, say, The Hunger Games, the fact that maybe I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed reading Virginia Woolf or Faulker or any other literary masterpiece, doesn't put it at that level, so I'm not going to give it a 10/10. I understand if you want to make your MAL 100% subjective, but if you're going to post on a forum and recommend something, you should at least be a bit objective.
>> ARTICLE
becouse its good, there is a reason it is top 5 best anime in japan.

geting downvoted for truth, sad. go look it up its 5th most popular anime in japan.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that I didn't like about Steins Gate is that they talk about Cern and the future but it is then solutioned without actually showing you anything, they mention a lot of things but they don't actually show them, and the story seems to change focus towards Okabe x Kuriso and forget about the setting. Basically, I don't like it when stories have things there just to make something happen and they don't actually develop on them. If you are going to have time travel, instead of focusing on the relationship between the characters, you should focus more on what time travelling means and it's implications, not just mention an "evil corporation" and a dystopian future but leaving those elements in the background.

Steins Gate is great and I enjoyed it, but it isn't thought provoking or something that I will remember as anything more than entertainment or that I want to rewatch later on.
>> ARTICLE
While Steins;Gate definitely has its flaws, its strong points are so good it overshadows that.

Sometimes the best show isn't the one with the least flaws. For example, Psycho-Pass is in my opinion one of the most flawless shows, but I couldn't give it a 10/10 because it lacked "something". I couldn't say exactly what was that, it has great plot, characters, animation, soundtrack, etc. But still didn't feel as potent as some other, "more flawed", shows.

This "something", lets call it inspiration, is what Steins;Gate has a lot of.
>> ARTICLE
I think the word you are looking for is ambition. Like how a flawed but epic show is more interesting than something perfect but overdone. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it probably has to do with the relatively shallow reference pool the average r/anime user has. There was a survey a while back that showed most of them have seen less about 60 anime. So, while it might be a lot of them consider it so much better than everything else, it mostly just means they haven't seen any shows that are better. (See also: the inexplicable popularity of Clannad.)

Or they just think Okabe/Hououin Kyouma is so fucking cool that they don't care.
>> ARTICLE
So a single survey proves this? Stop trying to make up reasons and just accept that people can have different opinions.
>> ARTICLE
I never said people can't have opinions. I just don't think those opinions exist in a vacuum.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's it, I've watched [a fair number of shows](http://www.anime-planet.com/users/Ryuujinx), but I still think it's pretty good. I don't really like the ending - I feel like it removes a lot of the feeling of sacrifice of choosing [SG](/s "Mayuri to live and let Kurisu die") when you're just like [SG](/s "JK EVERYONE CAN LIVE, I FOUND SOME MAGICAL TIME LINE WHERE EVERYTHING IS K"). 

But I still think the show is good, and definitely a solid 8.5~9/10. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh I don't think it's bad or anything. It's just the people who tend to say "steins;gate is my favorite anime" tend to have seen fewer anime in general. Which is fine (everybody starts somewhere). Personally I mostly liked it, but I probably won't bother with the movie/ova/whatever else.

I don't see any reasonable points of comparison to BTTF2.  I can at least understand your reference to Groundhog Day, there's a similar theme of repeating the same day(s), but that's really only a small aspect of S;G's overall story and it serves as a vehicle for the rest of the grander plot rather than the central conceit.  The two stories are in completely different genres and don't have any overlapping character types or much of anything else, really.  I mean, it's been a while since I last saw Groundhog Day, but wasn't he repeating the day involuntarily?  That alone is a pretty big and important difference but there are so many others.

Honestly, the comparison to BTTF2 makes me think you're either trolling, weren't paying any attention, skipped a bunch of episodes, maybe watched episode 13 *by itself* and nothing else, or just stopped watching once you decided it was a "rehash".
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I have a habit of sometimes re-editing my comments for like half an hour after I post them when I'm having difficulty articulating my point properly.

>The old man died on that day no matter what he did. The exact same situation in S;G.

No, this was a *major* difference.  Okabe **willingly** relived the same days and it was slowly killing him inside, torturing him, disconnecting him from reality.  Okabe must come to grips with the lives he's harming or even sacrificing for the sake of setting things "right" as well as saving Mayuri and the world in general.  He's just a regular college student but he's being forced to decide make choices that would be difficult even for someone with much more life experience.

*^(One of the VN's endings emphasizes this so strongly it was honestly heartwrenching.  You're probably not interested in what the VN did differently but I thought I'd mention it anyway because it demonstrated his mental anguish and self-sacrifice in cruel detail, which unfortunately the anime couldn't cover because it diverged from the "true ending" route.  IMHO they really should've made a series of short OVAs covering the alternate endings as a blu-ray bonus.  Maybe they didn't want to sabotage the VN sales, dunno.)*

Contrast this with Groundhog Day, where IIRC there aren't any horrible consequences for the choices the ultimately makes and the reason for the time loop is ultimately unexplained.  Rather than purposefully endure self-inflicted mental torment time and time again for the sake of others, he eventually decides to take the opportunity afforded by the time loop to better himself.  He learns a new language, learns to play the piano, learns to sculpt, etc.

Regarding BTTF2, again I can see only the vaguest of similarities.  My problem with your comparison is that the central theme - correcting mistakes using time travel - is so commonly explored in science-fiction that, to me, it's akin to you saying that Caddyshack is a ripoff of Seabiscuit because they both involve a sport.  Time travel is an entire genre, a large portion of which tends to be concerned with the unintended side-effects of changes to the timeline.

I didn't mean to imply earlier that you were a troll, just that I was so confused by your choices of comparison that I didn't think you were being serious.  Both of your examples were movies which individually bore some small resemblance to an aspect of S;G's overall plot, but my problem with that is that *most elements of virtually every story published in the last 50 years* were probably already considered in an earlier work.  It's the big picture that makes the difference.  [S;G is an amalgam of numerous common sci-fi and other tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate), but no other story has combined them in such an effective way, IMHO.

S;G isn't perfect, it drags a bit in places, parts of it are predictable, parts of it could probably be removed entirely without detriment to the story, and many important parts of the VN had to be skipped or glossed over due to time constraints or the constraints of the medium, ie the story must be linear.  It's so popular that the hype surrounding it is almost impossible to live up to.  As an anime and a science-fiction story [I still think it's really outstanding](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ddi1e/why_so_much_love_for_steinsgate_genuinely_curious/cjosb4c) and I feel like you're selling it short by your choices of comparison.

From what I've seen thus far. Fam was used a lot by black guys as a form of slang for family; or you know your "bros".

Though, this has since been adopted by fobby Asian guys and bro-ish white dudes. That said, some find it funny to say and will say it ironically with their friends. Though the irony soon becomes habit and you just get used to saying it. I feel as though that's how many slang trends begin anyway. Similar to the "blessed" and "thank" trend going around.

Some of my non-fobby Asian friends say it now and it's really not so bad. I say it occasionally now too. I dunno, it's a millennials thing. (>implying I'm not a millennial)

Approximate translation of the sign at the top: "Mwahahahahaha! Coolant is sold out! You should drink Dr. Pepper instead!"
>> ARTICLE
Can you read any of the sign in the bottom right? I think that's Mayushii on it.
>> ARTICLE
From the quality of the picture I can only read that the top says 'Tootoorooo'. It's that thing she hums. 

The thing to the left of the Mayushii post says 'If you drink it 3 times it'll become a habit'. 

The thing to the left of that says 'Otoku Iroiro'.

Not sure what that means.. otoku could be 'very economical' and iroiro generally means various or many. 

It might just mean the vending machine itself is economically responsible?? Low electricity bill? Low environment impact? 

Not a clue. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe its a wise economic decision to buy the drink
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gou9vl3fEko
>> ARTICLE
It means that the prices are cheap - otoku is a bargain. Normally it's written . Iroiro refers to the number of different products -- it's on every vending machine. Seems like a mistake on a machine with only one product, though.

Either that or it has various blasphemies.

>> ARTICLE
I try, honest!!

I'm embarrassed now. ( )

I do better work over in /r/AskHistorians, promise!

I've been speaking Japanese for about 8 years now but there's always definitely new stuff to learn. 

There's always specialized jargon that even native speakers might not know unless they're knowledgeable of the industry/field (I've been working on my biomedical tech translation, hopefully it pays better than run of the mill translations), as well as cultural references, the new hip stuff the youngsters are saying, the new memes, etc.

Honestly, it's really cool when you learn new stuff in a language. It's really fun for me. The phrase 'life long scholar/learner' sounds like bullcrap when you're young but it's a real mindset that really promotes self learning. 

Also, the more you learn about a particular subject, the more you realize you don't know. Again, one of those things that everyone says but the more of an expert you are on something, sometimes the biggest realization is about all the stuff you *don't know* even after years and years of study. 

I'll stop now...

It truly is our Mecca. 

>> ARTICLE
Getting off Akihabara station, going through the tunnel, and then coming out the other end was fucking magical.

Wasn't too into anime before I went to Tokyo, now there's no going back.
>> ARTICLE
I lived 15minutes away from Akiba during my 1 year stay over in Tokyo. Needless to say, my stay was extremely awesome and expensive. 
>> ARTICLE
As soon as I stepped off of JR railline I had the stupidest grin just plastered on my face. I couldn't believe it was real.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't really into anime merchant because I find a lot of the stuff sold in the US is errrrrr... tacky.  Or very overpriced.  But when I went to Akiba I had a hard time controlling myself and trying not to overbuy!  There was such a huge variety of things!
>> ARTICLE
I know, right? I was there just 2 weeks ago, and there's something about being exposed to that alien culture and not being able to help becoming incredibly fascinated by it. In my case I was already interested in anime when I went there, but on the other hand I never really had any interest in merchandise. Yet, [now I have this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/121316087/2014-06-17%2014.55.58.jpg).

One thing, though. Maid Caf's are not as fun as they seem, at all. I don't easily get embarassed, but that was so immensely awkward that I don't ever want to try it again.

EDIT:
I just want to clarify. Even though I think the Maid Caf's are really awkward, I still recommend going to one. While it is really weird, it's definitely an experience you don't want to miss out on when you got to Japan. I'm glad I went there, but in my case I think once is enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you man I never wanted merch beyond DVDs/ BDs but then anime boston came and I got two shirts a key chAin of Gilgamesh a prism Illya figure and a nanoha figure ( nanoha is by far my favorite haul though and the most expensive)
>> ARTICLE
Well no youve got my interest. Please tell us what happened

>> ARTICLE
Care to elaborate your awkward experience?
>> ARTICLE
Basically, they want you to participate in lots of small rituals with them, and they're very enthusiastic about it. I just found the atmosphere to be a bit intimidating, almost. And the way they wouldn't let you finish your order until you joined them in these small synchronized dance-like performances, made me extremely self-conscious about having all these strangers and cosplaying girls watch me put on a show. It sort of gives you the same feeling as speaking in public, except three times as intense.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh common man, it's not fun if you don't make a fool of yourself. Leave those inhibitions at the door. The [Moe-Moe-Kyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ac7GnUUy80) before the food was the best part! Everyone's there for a good time, no one will think any less of you. Besides its not like your ever gonna see those people again. 

I had trouble speaking to the maid in English but it didn't make the experience any less enjoyable. Ordered a cocktail and a sundae, had fun trying to talk to the maid in English, and got my picture taken wearing cat ears(which is never going to see the light of day ever again, that picture is going in the back of the drawer). I for one would definitely recommend going.
>> ARTICLE
I can't do that. If I'm uncomfortable doing something, that's just how it is. If you have someone who's deathly afraid of speaking in public, you can't just flip a switch to make that person suddenly be okay with it. You need lots of practice to overcome something like that, and I frankly don't see the point of training to be able to find Maid Caf's less awkward. I also strongly dislike having no inhibitions, because I no longer feel like myself when I do that. My inhibitions are a part of my personality, and I feel extremely uncomfortable with removing them. I've been there, done that, and I'd prefer going about my life without ever doing it again. So, I think I'll just live without those Maid Caf's instead. It's not like I need to be able to enjoy every single form of entertainment in order to have fun in life, anyway.

Don't worry about me not being able to make a fool of myself, though. I do that all the time, and I think it's fun in the right situation. I went around singing in public, for example. So it's not like I have a crippling social anxiety, I just felt like the Maid Caf was way overdone. It's too much.
>> ARTICLE
>you can't just flip a switch to make that person suddenly be okay with it.

You would be surprised man, i am dead scared of speaking in public, but if i focus i can go into zero fucks given mode. Its not like they know you. Adding to that is that you are only doing it once, some of those guys are regulars, you have no reason to be embarrassed really, but it can take some preparing and state of mind.
>> ARTICLE
> Its not like they know you. Adding to that is that you are only doing it once, some of those guys are regulars, you have no reason to be embarrassed really, but it can take some preparing and state of mind.

Did you read the last paragraph of what I said? I think I was pretty clear about how I really don't care about what complete strangers think about me. If I was, I wouldn't be going around singing in public in the middle of Tokyo. I'm saying the Maid Caf was *too much*, as in, it crosses the threshold where no amounts of "not giving a fuck" will remove the uncomfortableness.

I think you're misunderstanding my state of mind in there, too. It wasn't "oh no, everybody is looking at me, I'm so embarassed". It was more along the lines of "this is too damn weird, I don't like this place, the atmosphere is too awkward. I want to get out of here, these people are too much for me." It's more like the feeling of an awkward silence than being scared of speaking in public. The speaking in public was just an example of feeling embarassed, it wasn't an accurate analogy to how it felt like being in there. I can promise you that I didn't for a single second worry about what those people were thinking about me, I just couldn't handle the weird, awkward atmosphere. It embarassed me on their behalf, if anything. Sort of like the feeling people got to /r/cringe to get, coupled with the feeling of a long and awkward silence.
>> ARTICLE
BEHOLD THE FIELD IN WHICH I GROW MY FUCKS!

LAY THINE EYES UPON IT AND THOU SHALT SEE THAT IT IS BARREN!

but yea I get that some people are uncomfortable, but it's good to push your own boundaries every once in a while.
>> ARTICLE
I can understand how you should leave your inhibitions at the door, but I also think it's because of the way they are expected to act for their main customers. Let's face it: It's a place for otaku's to fulfill a fantasy of being served by cute cosplaying chicks. They actors fulfilling a role they are expected to fill, and that means they have to make every customer feel as involved as possible.

Not everyone is going to like the super special attention. I myself would like the atmosphere, but I hate being forced to participate in things like that. I've never visited a maid cafe, though there is one in NYC I looked into, but again, I don't like to get involved in a lot of things.
>> ARTICLE
Ahahahaha I went solo and I must say the Maid Cafes were something else.

I don't think I've ever been so red than when they called my name to take a picture. I didn't even know I could blush before.

Edit: [Some of my loot :D](http://imgur.com/a/uOQjO). I also ordered a cocktail at the maid cafe. Being a little buzzed definitely made the experience a lot more fun.

If you like Maid Cafe's the best one in my opinion is not in Akiba but in Shibuya. It's a really nice looking cafe and they perform the best and most fun shows I've seen anywhere. http://maidreamin.com/en/shop/shibuya_denno

Why does the character cover up the brand name?
>> ARTICLE
I've noticed that this happens a lot in Japan. I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't an official Dr. Pepper machine (or at least machine logo), and Japan censors trademarked names when they're being used presumably without permission. In Steins;Gate, you never actually see "Dr. Pepper". It's obscured by an object or the angle, or it's called something else, like "Dk Pepper".
>> ARTICLE
Priorities.
>> ARTICLE
Because if you see enough of the logo, and a familiar character, you'll know the brand, and it'll probably make you want to buy one, followed by you saying quotes from Steins;Gate while opening and drinking it. If I was there I would've done that.

First few days I wasted tons at vending machines. All that walking works up a thirst if you're not used to it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm used to walking and biking to where I need to go, since I never bothered getting a driver's license. So the walking didn't really bother me. What bothered me was the heat, now *that* built up some thirst. You can say I'm pretty much guilty of wasting a lot on vending machines too. I mean, their summer was around 18-19 degrees celcius hotter than what I'm used to. I was drenched in sweat 24/7.
>> ARTICLE
Living in the north east builds up your resistance to all types of weather. Cold? No problem. Hot? Body has learned to conserve water. 

Seriously though, A combo of walking around everywhere and heat  (esp. humidity. Fuck humidity.) gets to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I live in northern Norway, so I gotta say that theory isn't entirely accurate. I have no problems with the cold, obviously, but when our summers generally only get to around 18-20 degrees, then suddenly being in a constant 36 degrees is not something your body will be used to.

It's great - though I don't think it deserves the #1 spot it has on MAL. It's a must see though, it gets quite interesting.
>> ARTICLE
It's very good. I'm not a fan of the typical cutesy anime stuff, I like the darker more realistic shows. Stein's Gate had a little of that, but it also had some really awesome character development, especially Okabe or whatever the main character's actual name is. If you don't like it at first, stick with it for a bit, things change. It's a show about responsibility, choices, ego, and fate.

so just think how much better it would be if you had it here :)   sadly you can't get a Dublin Dr. Pepper anymore.  Which is from Dublin, Texas but you can get something called Doppelganger in a few places in Austin that is quite similar. It's like a mexican coke as it's made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.     made by maineroot.  But the Dr. Pepper's I had in France and England were just very unappealing to me and Dr. Pepper is the only soda I drink.

both. It's just not the same.

Before or after you've rewatched steins;gate? (   )
>> ARTICLE
Watch the OVA and then the movie if you haven't done ! Also re-watch the 1st episode, connect some more dots if you haven't already.

S;G is one of my favorite anime, and I'm currently rewatching it (I suggest looking at the [rewatch threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=steins%3Bgate+rewatch&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) currently going on to see things you may have missed) + going through the VN which adds more too.
>> ARTICLE
There's an OVA and movie?! I'm so excited now. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend the movie. It did continue the story, but it didn't really do much for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Can you expand more on what 'didn't do much for me'? I'm interested as to what critics have to say
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing. I thought the series ended really well at the end of episode 24. The OVA (episode 25) decided to continue the story by rehashing the possibility of a romance. The movie is a continuation of the plot started in the OVA.  I don't mind the romance, in fact I really liked the romance in the main series, but [main series spoilers](/s "Okabe and Kurisu's relationship is basically unwritten by the events at the end of the main series.") [OVA and general movie plot spoilers](/s "The OVA then implies that there is a chance that Kurisu may still be able to regain her memories of the time she spent with Okabe in the main series. Now begins the movie. The main gist of the movie is Kurisu trying to understand her memories of Okabe and eventually come to fall in love with Okabe all over again. Here is probably my biggest gripe, I don't find Kurisu's character that great alone. Kurisu is alone for a large portion of the movie. In the main series it was the chemistry of Okabe and Kurisu that I really enjoyed watching. Kurisu on her own spending a solid half an hour deciding whether or not she is forgetting something did not keep me engaged. I think possibly one of the most damning things about the film is the incredible similarity to the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya which I had seen only a few weeks before I saw the Steins;Gate movie for the first time. Disappearence had pretty much the same story, but did it better. The character trying to understand their feelings had more to work with and faced more adversity throughout their journey. Perhaps it's merely by comparison that Steins;Gate ended up feeling so week, but overall I just felt like nothing was happening and walked away feeling rather unsatisfied. It's been about 6 months since I've seen the film and I can't for the life of me remember how it ends. Just kind of forgettable.") 

So now for a non-spoiler wrap-up. You'll like this movie if you really, really loved Kurisu and are patient enough to sit through what I consider to be a slower and worse Disappearence of Haruhi Suzumiya-styled character discovery story. If you can't get enough Steins;Gate go play the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 22 is a WAY better ending than 24. 23-24 is very inconsistent with the concept of world lines which kind of ruined the anime for me.
>> ARTICLE
They are both pretty good aswell.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, Episode 25 and then the movie takes place after that.
>> ARTICLE
Oh! I saw the episode 25. It came on the complete collection Blu-Ray!

Funimation has the license for the movie too now, so hopefully they do the English release soon. I watch with subs for literally everything, but Steins;Gate is my exception.

The movie is very good, by the way.

If you like steins gate the show that I rate closest to it in feel and quality is madoka magica. But it's a lot shorter

You may want to consider reading the visual novel. There is a bit of extra content (alternate endings), and also a bit more info. You wouldn't miss out on much by not reading it though.

Now watch episode one again, and have your mind completely and utterly fucked.

Then come back and read this explaination.

[](/s "You see, this is the Beta world line. What you're seeing is one of Okabe's attempts to save Kurisu, before he was able to sucessfully do it. Most likely, it is the attempt Okabe had to fail at before he was able to save her by receiving the video from his other self. It also may be his other self, though it's unlikely because if it was, this would have to be the last attempt before his other self gives up and becomes obsessed with saving Kurisu, which is what we're going to see in Steins;Gate 0. What happened is he must have run into her while trying to save her. I believe he ran into her and told her he's going to save her in the last ep, but I'll have to check to be sure.") Either way, it's a total mind fuck, and amazed me. Please, do yourself a favor and rewatch it.

Edit: Found it, [here's the last episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOaM9MciET4&oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBOaM9MciET4&has_verified=1) Skip to 8:40 and observe the fuckery.

Same here. It's my message sound for everything, yet I hadn't played the game, and dropped anime after 3 episodes of **nothing fucking happening**.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode and I realized that none of it was interesting, it felt like I was watching a dialogue scene in Bakemonogatari series and I wasn't really paying attention

Well, it's like this for at least 3 episodes (as far as I've got before dropping it).
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching, it's a bit of a slow build up but it gets really good around half-way through.

> it gets really good around half-way through

So half of it is bad? It's like saying "oh, this one game is very good, once you get past the first 4h of it". Kind of waste of time IMO, if 50% of content is garbage.

Upscaling the image in software won't be very different from just telling your OS to stretch the image to fill the display unfortunately.

If you want a non-upscaled version I pad the 1280x1024 image that isn't cropped with white to fill your display. (Is it actually 2560x1080 or is it 2560x1200?)

[I made a quick skin for my rainmeter using this new background.](http://imgur.com/rO6uE2s)  
I think it turned out ok.
    

The rainbow is a visualizer that takes sound from my computer, I just cut the image to let it be in the background. While the divergence meter is a clock, the first number is AM or PM, 0 and 1 respectivly. The rest is the time down to the second.

[Kirisu .ini](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwn8h0jtftjfch9/kirisu.ini?dl=0)    
Put the pic and the .ini in the same folder in the skins folder for rainmeter. All other skins should self install
  
If the skins dont automatically install then you need to open the rainmeter skins folder and drag the folder in and refresh then skin list in the rainmeter manager. 
   
Once you have loaded the Kirisu cut,(which you do by double clicking the .ini file in the rainmeter manager) you should see a couple of options, you want to make it so that you can click through it.    
   
You also want the desktop vu meter to be the bottom layer so make sure its that way.   
  
Also if your desktop resolution isnt 1920x1080 you will have to edit one line of code. Go to the .ini for kirisu and change the line that says "resolution=1920x1080" to whatever yours is.

Sweet. Much appreciated.

The two "messages" are from characters in Steins;Gate 0, Kurisu's co-researchers. She actually gets a call from Maho at one point in Steins;Gate, but you can only hear Kurisu talking and it's very brief. Just a little Easter Egg.

I know it's mostly a joke but DEEN's newest project actually looks really good. Maybe they're returning to their glory slowly but surely.

What project? Subarashii no Sekai or that Chinese webnovel thing? They both look like they were actually done in Paint.

The currently airing [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28735).
>> ARTICLE
i'm not too familiar with studio DEEN, but could you give me a short tl;dr summary of this studio joke? only thing I've watched from them recently would be the fate/stay night ubw movie which seemed pretty good from my memory.  thanks!
>> ARTICLE
They were one of the top animation studios in the past (I think in the 80s) but have slowly become worse in terms of the quality of their animation.

Here's a few examples from recent years:

[1.](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/d17fa15c3d5db42dde7b15300e0b8dad1416805032_full.png) [2.](http://i.imgur.com/LKfkZuZ.png) [3.](http://i.imgur.com/93g3sId.jpg)

But their newest work looks way better than that.

I only found one screenshot but it showcases one of the [humerous reaction faces](https://i.imgur.com/YpG7ACR.jpg) quite well.
>> ARTICLE
Struvk me too. I thought wow, the art is beautiful! The characters remind me of death parade. Time to check mal to see who - STUDIO DEEN? 
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand, Deen's studio has a whole staff working on the stuff they're producing now and the shit they have produced in the past.

This guy made this all on his own on MS paint.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, it's not 100% MS Paint. 90% of the animation is done in a video editing program, and not frame by frame in MS Paint. Still extremely impressed with it tho.
>> ARTICLE
They're slowly redeening themselves.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't just say "slowly." Sankarea was drop-dead gorgeous, and Is This a Zombie? put its budget to great effect several times.
>> ARTICLE
I just bought the un-censored Sankarea BDs it's a pretty great show.
>> ARTICLE
Deen can do great and awful projects, just like any other studio. For some reason, however, most people don't realize this??
>> ARTICLE
Because their awful is so bad we had to name the bottom portion of the scale Deen.
>> ARTICLE
[This "deen" wordplay reminds me of the dean](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/community-sitcom/images/5/5f/Dean_Pelton_crazy_smile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140227204508)

I'm back with another opening in paint. This time with reddit's favourite Steins;Gate.  
It took me around 60 hours, so more time than my One Punch Man video. It was not easy to get the original feeling. Only programs used were MS Paint (with a mouse) and Sony Vegas.  
My next project will probably be "No Paint No Life", but I will need some time to do it. I won't have as much free time as I did this winter holidays.  
I hope you like it!

I'm honestly not sure if I should admire or ridicule you for spending time on these projects.

[](#helmetbro)


>> ARTICLE
Time = money. OP said it took 60 hours so even at $8/hr that's a potential $480. 

>> ARTICLE
Considering that the video is 1:30 long, that would put the price of an episode at about $6,400 for the animation which is incredibly cheap.
>> ARTICLE
True, but a lot more goes into an animes budget than animation, and most animators make more than $8 an hour.

I don't know how you manage to sync the music so well with the animation. Good job.

Keyframes are OP, the thing is he did both drawing AND animation which are two huge jobs (and usually specialized).

All jokes aside, you can draw in MS Paint better than I could in real life.
>> ARTICLE
lol, my real life drawings are (much) worse than what I can make at [MS Paint](http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/renaxo2r74zd5j.png). ...I made this over 2 years ago, never got much feedback. Is it kinda good? (considering its done in MS Paint and its from Higurashi^ ^ )

The entire picture is 3692x1736, the head alone is about 2020x1736.

This OP is much better than Dagashi Kashi's OP.

Tbh big part of this wasn't even looking like it's from paint. Especially first 20 seconds.

I've watched both the subbed and the dubbed version, and I think the actual voice-acting was actually very well-done on both ends, and J. Michael Tatum as Okarin did a good job with the crazy. Although Suzuha seems a bit snarkier and less genki in the dub, I don't think it's *that* off.
>> ARTICLE
The line I'm talking about isn't "a bit snarkier and less genki" though. It's her insulting Okabe pretty meanly, while in the original she looked up to Okabe throughout.

Edit: [Here's something I said about this line recently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1j8j44/steinsgate_group_watch_episode_01_discussion/cbcsq26?context=3)

The player can make decisions at key points of the game, but I wouldn't necessarily call it "playing". Most of the time you'll just be reading text + viewing graphics.

I normally say "play" if it's interactive. Although that would make Choose your Own Adventure books "games", so... ='D

Is steins gate hard to get into arent there a lot of spin offs? :o
>> ARTICLE
The Steins;Gate anime was made to be standalone. The visual novel, however, while mostly standalone is still part of a series, and reading (not watching, reading) its predecessor, Chaos;Head, is good to do before reading Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i like to read the manga beforee watching anything like soul eater was cut off way too early. Anywhere i can get a hold of the visual novels?
>> ARTICLE
You could use google, like everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
wow man i think he just assumed it be better to ask someone who knows what hes talking about and likes the series would be a better source of information than just googling around trying to find stuff
>> ARTICLE
[JAST USA](http://jastusa.com/) announced that they'd be bringing Stein's;Gate to the west at Anime Expo 2013. So it's on the way. But there's currently no plans to bring Chaos;Head or Robotics;Notes west. 

There is an unofficial fan translation of Chaos;Head floating around though, as well as anime and manga adaptations of the whole series. So you shouldn't find yourself starved of context.
>> ARTICLE
Thats cool. Its always interested me and the title is pretty bad ass
>> ARTICLE
Does Chaos;Head have that much relation to Steins;Gate? I haven't played it (tried it but couldn't get into it), but it looks entirely different. Seemed to me like it was safe to skip.
>> ARTICLE
They take place in the same universe.

That's about it.

There's like 2 or 3 cameos to the other series in each, and that's the extent to which the shared universe matters.
>> ARTICLE
In the Steins;Gate VN you unlock various wallpapers and ringtones for the in-game phone.  These come almost entirely from Chaos;Head.  Aside from that, they take place in the same world so there is some overlap between sites on the in-game internet, and a few other minor references, but that's about it.  No characters or events overlap that I noticed (I played S;G first).  C;H is far more a horror novel than sci-fi though, and has a very different tone.  

S;G has an 8-bit sequel in English that is a direct crossover though.  
>> ARTICLE
No, it doesn't. Even if you know they're sorta connected, you still can barely spot any similarities.

Also, don't watch the _Chaos;head_ anime; it's one of the most disappointing anime ever in that it seems to have so much promise initially and then falls to complete pieces.
>> ARTICLE
If nothing else I love the ~~opening~~ ending from Chaos;Head. Seira Kagami is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Opening was good too. It's Kanako Itou!
>> ARTICLE
The OP is good too but I swear anything Seira Kagami does is another level, the OP for Isekai no Seikishi no Monogatari is one of my favourites of all time.
>> ARTICLE
Alright then. Though if you are curious, Kanako Itou does most of the music for the series, from Chaos;Head to Robotics;Notes.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realise there was an anime of Robotics;Notes, I'll have to watch that now, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
No similarities? What about [the fact that](/s "Kurisu's research - mostly the same exact research - plays an important part in all three parts of the series?")

I'll elaborate on this, and other stuff, later.

Two flashed pictures is not an obvious connection.

Please reread this thread: I did not say there were no connections; I said there were connections; I said they were not at all obviously connected even if you knew what to look for.
>> ARTICLE
I said it's only a hint of what's to come. And if you were paying attention, then it is quite obvious. 

EDIT: Sorry, that second sentence is rather rude. I'm not that good with words. Still, that patent actually was given a fair amount of time in Chaos;Head.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, like Robotics;Notes.

^I ^kid, ^I ^kid...^sorta
>> ARTICLE
Robitics;Notes had a lot of potential to be pretty good, until they rushed it.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've heard there is not much in common. Same universe, but based on watching Robotics;Note (the successor to Steins Gate) the only commonalities between the two were 1 or 2 minor characters and some references. I assume the same is the case for Chaos Head.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the connections were taken out of the anime adaptations. Still, even in the anime there's stuff such as in Robotics;Notes Nae is a supporting (not minor, supporting) character and [we see](/s "Noah IV.")

I'll talk about the connections between the series (yes, it's an actual series) once I'm off this phone and able to talk.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Nae was a pretty significant supporting character in Robotics;Note, but she was the only one directly mentioned and that appeared onscreen (at least in the anime). Daru had a [significant role](/s " in hacking the missile defense thing, but remained semi-anonymous under the DaSH pseudonym"). Apparently Kurisu's username on @channel appears but it's not significant nor central to the storyline at all. Of course, this is just between anime to anime, the visual novels would obviously have a lot more depth and breadth in which connections could be made.
>> ARTICLE
There's supposed to be the same big evil conspiracy behind each of the shows.
>> ARTICLE
The Organization, obviously.

The Organization is something Okabe came up with via his chuuni delusions. The real big bad is actually the Committee of 300.

So, since seeing this post (and remembering a friend suggesting this to me a long while back), I've watched all 24 episodes, the OVA, and I'm too fuckin excited for the movie.

December, why don't you hurry up!


On a side note, would anyone suggest the VN and the other 2 VN / Animes? I really wanted to play the VN when I started the show, but then I read about the endings being slightly different, and I don't think I could handle that. And if it leaves me in the state KS did... Well shit, might as well just call it quits.

I do plan on re-watching the show again though, but dubbed this time. It seems like a lot of people are saying the dub is really good, but I might not go through with it. I love Hououin's laugh in the subbed too much, so it probably wouldn't feel the same.

Do sub, not because either performance is bad, but because you miss out on Okabe's engrish in the dub, and one of the funniest scenes in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, this is easily solved with youtube, this alone isn't enough of a reason to watch it subbed imo.
>> ARTICLE
It's really a shame you're downvoted so much. Really, the dub is fantastic. Subs are fantastic. If you really want to listen to Okabe's engrish, you can use Youtube. Something like that isn't a swaying reason to switch audio tracks. 
>> ARTICLE
This is reddit silly! No opinions allowed.

Yeah, there's a lot of elitism in the anime community, which I find especially funny considering 90% + of the people here don't even speak Japanese.

Eh, whatever, I'll stick to watching shows the way I like to, which I think everyone should be doing anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I'll argue that it is a reason to watch subs since Okabe's use of English is a defining part of his personality, without it you're missing out on a lot of his delusional aspect. Also, you'll miss out on another masterful performance by Mamoru Miyano.
>> ARTICLE
> I'll argue that it is a reason to watch subs since Okabe's use of English is a defining part of his personality

Thats a huge stretch

>> ARTICLE
it's really not

think of the first half of the anime, without his engrish, you could almost imagine he *was* onto something.

the sprinkling of engrish into his speech really makes it clear he's chuuni
>> ARTICLE
>think of the first half of the anime, without his engrish, you could almost imagine he was onto something.

We watched two very different shows apparently
>> ARTICLE
clearly, considering you dont consider his engrish as a defining part of his personality
>> ARTICLE
Clearly as you honestly think a portion of his speech used mainly for comic relief defines him as a character.
>> ARTICLE
...did you even watch steins gate?

the reason of why he does the comic relief is a *massive* part of his character. go watch the film or rewatch the series and pay attention to mayuri and his reason of why he could go through what he went through is abundantly clear
>> ARTICLE
You have a great point, but the dub does a pretty good job at portraying how delusional he seems as well, without the engrish. Have you actually seen the dub? I still prefer subs because I watched it that way first, but the dub is very good. Also something people don't seem to notice that much, but subs really do take some of your attention away from your art. Definitely try both and decide which you like more. 
>> ARTICLE
Just my opinion, but the art of the anime isn't really all that special. The real eye candy is in the visual novel, and there you have plenty of time to look around. Also, Steins;Gate isn't the most actiony series to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
It's really not a huge deal though. It's made pretty clear in the dub by his overzealous yelling and childish attitude at times that he's not meant to be taken entirely seriously. 
>> ARTICLE
If you listen, Okabe actually sprinkles some Engrish all around. And hell, Steins;Gate and Reading Steiner are supposed to be blatant English/German (Kurisu even points that out), and that kinda loses its effect in the dub.
>> ARTICLE
How so?
>> ARTICLE
Because English is the main language, so the blatant English isn't chuuni anymore.

chuuni?

I personally hold the dub in pretty high regard(Tatum is a big Sci-Fi geek and poured a ton of geeky heart into the script), but it's still honestly a wash because of just how fucking good Mamoru Miyano is in the Japanese audio.

I'm not really answering your question, but it really just comes down to what your go-to format usually is. If you prefer dubs, there's really nothing to complain about here.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the sub. The voice acting is great in both versions, but I prefer the script in the original. The dub changed some characterization, had some mispronunciations, etc.

Of course, this is coming from someone that has read the original visual novel and the side material, which the sub is closer to and the dub has broken compatibility with, so to say.
>> ARTICLE
You can't go wrong with either one they are both good so it's only a matter of which language you prefer.
>> ARTICLE
I say subs because IMO that is the most natural, but never having watched it in dub before I don't think it would be a bad idea to try the first episode in both dub and sub
>> ARTICLE
I watch everything subbed anyway, something just seems off to me about dubs, even the good ones. I've heard that the dub's good though, so go ahead if you like dubs.
>> ARTICLE
I personally cannot handle dubs overall, but I have seen my roommate watch the entire dub for Steins;Gate, and you really cannot get the character feel off the dubs. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the dub first, mainly because Okabe's English voice actor was the same as Lawrence's from Spice and Wolf.  
>> ARTICLE
Watch the dub, then go back and watch episode 15 subbed. Just to get the best scene that sadly couldn't translate well into english

The Dub... Its okay, none of the voice actors are anything special, i prefer Dub when possible, but for this one i watch Sub, every VA fits there character perfectly,  Okabe is hilarious,  and Mayuri and Faris are extremely adorable, and through the Sub you really get the emotion and profoundness.
>> ARTICLE
dear god please never bring this kind of stuff up
>> ARTICLE
The dub is very good. Just bought the Steins;Gate set 1 on Blu-ray. I am really glad I watched this anime in both. There are little gems that I get from both the sub and the dub. 
>> ARTICLE
Sub. Dub has Isaac from Bacanno! as Okabe, but the sub cast is better as a whole and as u/Sirlag_ mentioned, it's not worth missing out on Okabe's Engrish.
>> ARTICLE
I say do dub, because while you miss out on the engrish in the dub, you miss out on the faris match, which in my opinion is even funnier.

Ultimately there is very little difference, both versions cover the story brilliantly, so really just do which ever is easier to get your hands on (for example if your lucky your local library/dvd store will have steins;gate in dub)
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Faris match is funnier in the sub, plus what Okabe did makes more sense (Faris could've called Okabe out on what he did in the dub). Also, [Okabe's](/s "poor skills in the game are brought up again the episode or two after, and in the movie.")
>> ARTICLE
Aah well personally I found the dub version funnier

really I stick with my final point of just getting whichever is easier to get OP'S hands on, since both options are pretty much equal anyway
>> ARTICLE
I do think the sub is easier to get, since it's free on Hulu and Youtube.

If anything, dub Mayuri was actually better. Instead of being straight up retarded she comes off as ditzy.
>> ARTICLE
She didn't give that feeling off in the sub either, although I may be biased since I've read the VN and a lot of the side material.
>> ARTICLE
Her voice just doesn't seem right to me. She seems like shes meant to be an adorable airhead to me. I haven't played the Visual Novel but I'd assume she was originally made to be like the sub showed, so I think they ruined her character. Plus I'm in love with Kana Hanazawa and her [voice is adorable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cckn54Tpz6Y).
>> ARTICLE
> She seems like shes meant to be an adorable airhead to me.

Which she comes off as in the dub, as opposed to mentally retarded in the jdub.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know where you're getting that. She's caring for Okarin and she has a lot of thing she says that is no where retarded, and she seems nice but just a bit thick in the head, and KanaHanas voice is perfect for that.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno that's the vibe I got at least, referring to herself in the third person among other behaviors.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of Japanese people refer themselves in 3rd person, particularly females. It's up to the subbers to replace them with pronouns, depending on the context. If you look carefully, many characters in various anime will say their own name, while the subs say "I","me", "my" etc.

The dub is seriously great and it's how I prefer to watch the show. That said, there's one scene from the subbed version that you absolutely have to look up at some point. Just know that it involves the main character speaking engrish.
>> ARTICLE
I'd personaly reccomend the dub. But you encounter the same problem as the haruhi dub, both have two leads that are amazing In both but one lead is far better than their sub/dub counterpart. All in all ,being able to focus on the show overcomes the shortcomings of having one lead better than the other so I reccomend the dub.
>> ARTICLE
Both are excellent. It all comes down to whether you prefer subs or dubs, or dubs over subs. There are gems in both, and realistically you won't be disappointed with either.

Whatever you generally watch.

Something similar happened to me while I was watching another show on Netflix (Twin Peaks). The loading screen for an episode showed a screencap of a scene that basically ruined the whole season for me (and I was on the last ep). I was pissed, and contacted support as well. He said he'd put a request in.. we'll see

Maddo Scientis! 
>> ARTICLE
It looks like one of those spoilers that is only a retroactive spoiler... like, if you've seen the show, you know it's a spoiler.

If you've never read Game of Thrones, an image of a guy with a wolf's head means nothing to you, but the GoT community loses their minds.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously it's not a spoiler if you've never seen it, but the second you see Suzuha acting like a normal teenage girl you'll know.
>> ARTICLE
Even still, there's no real context.  If you hadn't have spoiled that for me, my assumption would have been that she needed to wear that gear, maybe for protection or something.  It could have easily been seen as situational, rather than "Plot twist!  Dun dun duuuunnnn!"
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has seen neither this nor GOT, none of these are spoilers for me because I haven't seen the show yet. Images alone hold no significance because I cannot place them in context. 

Only people who have seen the show all the way through will understand the spoiler. So I don't see a big deal. 
>> ARTICLE
And that's exactly it.  I haven't seen Steins;Gate either and this image has no meaning to me.  Even reading a brief synopsis of the show, I got nothing.
>> ARTICLE
That's because the girl with the gun and combat gear was portrayed as an average highschool girl getting a part time job. It's only revealed much further in the show that there's more to her. Seeing a character that for the first half of the show as a normal innocent child, suddenly fully loaded and prepped for combat, fearlessly wielding a pistol on the roof in the middle of the city spoils that there's a large plot twist involving her and that she isn't who she claims. Is say that's a spoiler. 
>> ARTICLE
See...  The thing here is that you have no context for this image.  It's not a spoiler for you right now.  But the moment you watch the show, there are things about that image that will immediately seem off.

It'll spoil something in episode two or so that you really shouldn't know until much much later.

If you didn't know Star Wars and saw a clip of Vader telling Luke that he is Luke's father, then it won't mean anything to you.  As soon as you start watching though and you see Vader and hear about how Luke's 'Dad' died, you're going to understand what you've had spoiled for you.
>> ARTICLE
No, it'll be a spoiler as soon as you watch the first few episodes. Unless you're blessed with being able to forget the image.
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler or not, I feel like people are going to go into the show and expect guns and shit, and be disappointed with the first 12 episodes.

I loved the first 12 episodes, and I loved the rest of the anime, too. But you know.
>> ARTICLE
Some people may say it was too slow, but I really enjoyed the first part. I just loved the characters and their interactions!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, me too. Sure, it may have been "slow", but they were trying to familiarize you with the characters and make you care about them, and they did a damn good job at it. If they had jumped right into the interesting parts with zero development, what would be the point of the story?
>> ARTICLE
i was rather disappointed with the first few episodes - or at least, the first seven, where i'm at right now.

Psycho Pass is amazingly good.
>> ARTICLE
If you like crime drama then yes, it's very good.
>> ARTICLE
Its a crime drama and then its not. Its like saying GitS is a crime drama.
>> ARTICLE
I'm almost certain it's always a crime drama?  Unless you're referring to the whole sibyl thing..
>> ARTICLE
The crime drama is just a vehicle to show the universe and to advance the plot, its not the point of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
That's fair enough, but people who still dislike crime shows are probably going to find it hard to swallow. I'm not a big fan of police detective plots myself; it was my biggest gripe with GITS:SAC, but thankfully GITS: SAC II moved away from that.

Edit: Thanks for whoever downvoted my opinion, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
>Thanks for downvoting my opinion, I guess?

I hope you are not talking to me.

Really I felt like it was a crime drama using sibyl as a gimmick,

Pyscho Pass 2 on the other hand... not very good. Looking forward to the movie though.

Yeah the second season isn't as good.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Youve got it right, there is nothing really great about pyscho pass. Its a bit above normal low to mid budget anime, to be certain but its writing is still pretty average-ish.

Its not even a unique story, as you pointed out. However 12 year olds who love anime have not seen better shows, or even the stories it rips off (which did it better the pyscho pass).

Its very average for a high tier anime, the same way transformers is average for a michael bay film. Yes they both cost more money to make, but that doesnt make them great.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching it ATM; reminds me of GITS. Cyberpunk is okay, but I really am not a fan of police-type shows. Crime cases bore me, which is why I liked GITS: SAC II much more than the first.

Psycho Pass seems very much what a junior high student might find deep and gritty, but is ultimately very juvenile even in its philosophical views, villains, and ultimate final arc.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I haven't really formed much of an opinion yet. On episode 6 and I've found it mildly interesting, but I'm watching the Tatami Galaxy as well which is a *very* different type of show. I haven't gotten the feeling it's beating me over the head with themes, though I have definitely encountered that type of show before and get pissed off really quickly. Hell, a lot of movies do it, a recent example being Interstellar.


>> ARTICLE
I didnt enjoy it until Episode 11 or 12 amd then I had to marathon the rest cause I couldnt stop watching
>> ARTICLE
I think everyone who likes this anime, including me, will tell you that the first 10ish episodes are slow buildup. Then the rest will just blow you away. Or maybe not, depends on you I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I got through 7 or 8 and dropped it for a year. It was slow and boring, something about some old computer. 

Came back to it, shit got real really goddamn quick. I nearly dropped the show again (you'll see why) because I couldn't handle how real shit got.

Keep going, man. It gets real fucking good.
>> ARTICLE
all right, i'm at 13 now, it's getting good x) 
>> ARTICLE
You're *right* on the cusp of interesting, stick with it!
>> ARTICLE
haha, sure, i'll give it a try today! 
>> ARTICLE
From my time on this subreddit, I've created a theory:

There is an inverse correlation between your level of enjoyment of the first 12 episodes of Steins;Gate and your enjoyment of the first two titles by Trigger, commonly hyped up as the titles that "saved anime."

That is to say, I think people who like modern slices of life and rom-coms seem to like the first 12 episodes of Steins;Gate just fine. And people who don't...well...usually tough it out until episode 12 or 13 (I forget which one's the one where the action starts).
>> ARTICLE
I loved the first part of Steins;Gate, loved KLK, and Gurren Lagann was meh. 
>> ARTICLE
Not really. I loved both. It helps that both are quite good.

I'm not a fan of most slice-of-life (...the moe kind, at least, which seems to dominate the genre), but I liked the first half of Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
I loved TTGL and Kill La Kill and the first part of Steins killed me. 

But I also love SoL - Nichibros/Nichijou/Non Non Biyori are some of my favorite shows ever.

Honestly though, Steins is pretty slow at first. Id heard such great things but nothing was happening, so I got bored. So glad I came back to it.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I loved Steins;Gates first part and disliked TTGL and KlK. I think /u/tistorm has something here.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like he's figured something out.

Don't get me wrong, the first 12 of Steins; weren't bad - they set the universe/world/characters really well.

I had just gone into the show expecting mind fuckery right off the bat, and short of the UFO, there wasn't any. I was over-hyped for it. 

Looking back on it, I much prefer the beginning of the show to the second half - it got so dark, so heavy, so...fucked, I was wishing for the peacefulness and calm of the beginning.

The thing is, though, I love SoL and romcoms. I mean, I enjoy pretty much everything, but SoL and romcom are some of my favorites.

I don't think TTGL or KlK "saved anime," it was doing just fine. But I do love me some over-the-top action, which they provided. Check my list, if you want, to see how many SoL and romcoms I've watched. 

TL;DR - Yeah, probably. Not all encompassing, but a good baseline. There's some part of his statement I disagree with, I just can't figure out which part. 

I think "The more you like TTGL and KlK, the less you enjoy the first 12 Steins; episodes the first time through" is sufficient. Your overall tastes in show have no bearing on whether or not you like S;G, but TTGL and KlK do. 
>> ARTICLE
You know, I was actually thinking of KlK and Little Witch Academia. I know the founders of trigger worked on TTGL, but I don't think Trigger existed yet when it was being made.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's right, Gainax was behind TTGL. Trigger members were part of Gainax.

LWA was also pretty good. Too short for the story it tried to tell, but good. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't dislike either story, but I became more and more bewildered the more I read about each, and this confusion peaked when I read the Kickstarter story about LWA and finally got around to watching it. It was fine, I didn't get how it was that good to get that much money.

Then I realized all the things I found was lacking (not enough anime tropes, etc.) was why people liked it. And I've adapted my theory that there is an intrinsic divide between anime fans in the west over that realization (some redditor actually made a post about this after LWA beat its kickstarter)
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I loved both.
>> ARTICLE
Exact same thing here. This is just creepy.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of Kill la Kill and Little Witch Academia, actually. Or am I wrong when I mean those?
>> ARTICLE
No, that's more accurate, as they were actually Trigger's first two, but I haven't seen LWA.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Steins;Gate and TTGL are my top 2 anime and I very much enjoyed the first half of S;G. I haven't watched Little Witch Academia, so I can't comment on that matter.
>> ARTICLE
Firstly we need to do a poll to validate your theory.

Secondly, it wasn't so much the SoL aspects of the first few episodes that I liked so much as the science. It was fun to see people learn to use time travel technology via experimentation.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is #2 on MAL for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
It took me 3 tries to get passed the 7th episode, but it was totally worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Or some reason I read that as it took you 3 years to get past the 7th episode
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it, what's so bad about the 7th episode that you needed three tries?
>> ARTICLE
GELNANAS
>> ARTICLE
Nothing special about that episode, the series just seemed kind of slow to meet at the time and struggled to keep my interest and that was the episode I always stopped at. One day I just blasted through the whole thing and it was totally worth it.

It took me a few episodes before I really got into it. It ended up being one of my favorites by the end.

God Fucking Damn It, Netflix!

I'm not quite sure anybody would see this as a spoiler without previous context... And to be honest, it's not even *that* big of a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I haven't even watched it so I don't even know what the spoiler is.
>> ARTICLE
as someone who hasn't gotten around to watching this animu yet, I don't see anything in it as a spoiler and have no idea what any of it means.
>> ARTICLE
Being that I have not seen Steins;Gate (I am going to start it now that it is on Netflix), I looked at this and didn't think twice about it. Now I am dreadfully curious how this could possibly be a spoiler. I think I have been ruined by this post.
>> ARTICLE
Don't go into it worrying about how it works into the show. I appreciate Steins Gate mostly for it's great cast of characters anyways. The plot is awesome, but your enjoyment of it shouldn't be ruined by anything that you've seen in that thumbnail.
>> ARTICLE
As long as you **don't read any other comments** in this thread , you are good to go.
>> ARTICLE
The problem was that my curiosity was too great. If I am told something I am looking at is a spoiler I have to know why it is.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta be my favorite part of this thread - complaining its a spoiler and then giving more spoilers!

I guess it *is* marked as a spoiler but still, gotta laugh.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty big spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.  I didn't even realize what was being spoiled at first.  I really don't think anybody watching it for the first time would have gotten tripped up by that.  But hey better safe than sorry I guess
>> ARTICLE
A bigger spoiler would be if they [revealed](/s "that she is john titor"), that's more of a minor spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Right?  Nobody seeing that picture would know what that machine represents in the context of the picture until the end of the series, at which point they would already know anyway.  And all the picture reveals about her is that she knows how to hold a gun.  In fact, I would even say this doesn't spoil anything.  At all.
>> ARTICLE
You see her in combat gear in front of the time machine from the beginning. It's a bit of a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
what time machine ? that looks like a space observatory to me. 

And didn't she say she was a soldier in the first couple episodes ?
>> ARTICLE
Not saying that you're wrong since I'm sure multiple people interpreted her saying that she was a soldier literally, but when she first mentions that I initially thought she was joking and saying that to mean that she was a hard worker.
>> ARTICLE
You see her early on as a normal character. This spoils it...
>> ARTICLE
This kills the spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
I never said it doesn't... It just doesn't reveal anything *that* important. Her character is hinted to be out of place from the beginning anyways, and her outfit doesn't say anything about her actual identity or role in the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Huh?? I've only watched the first few episodes and this displays little to nothing. What does this spoil? 
>> ARTICLE
[Steins;Gate Spoilers](/s "It's not a blatant spoiler, but it shows that Suzuha knows more than what she's letting on, and that she's related to the time machine which crashed into the building.")
>> ARTICLE
Err, did anyone see her and not assume she was some kind of ninja assassin?  
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Not really, she did say she was a soldier early on, which was pretty odd...as well as mentioning something about hearing about fireworks long ago or something, that was quite an obvious comment that she came from the future when I first heard it...and putting one and two together ....new employee, new to the city, oblivious to common things, I correctly guessed she would be revealed later on as a time traveller. ")

There also were quite a few twists that I pretty much called it happening early on.

hope I'm not coming off as higher than thou.
>> ARTICLE
I get your point, but just because you worked it out, and I'm sure plenty did, doesn't mean it isn't still a twist. Whether it's completely unpredictable or you saw it coming a mile away, it's still intended to be a twist, so it should be concealed.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was the time machine in the background that was the spoiler.

But then again, Por qu no los dos?
>> ARTICLE
How would you know that's a time machine without watching the show? Honestly I don't know how this could really spoil anything from it, it basically requires context. 
>> ARTICLE
well that could be anything
>> ARTICLE
Way to spoil the time machine.

Is it a hot tub?

The title mentions spoilers so it should be assumed before coming to the comment section that there would be spoilers

http://i.imgur.com/Za7VFO3.jpg

Nah, that ain't a spoiler. You can see that thing in episode 1, it's just that its importance isn't revealed until later - pretty much a textbook Chekhov's Gun.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, wait, wait, you see it in Episode one?

When?

I thought you just hear/feel it? It rumbles or whatever. I don't remember seeing it...
>> ARTICLE
I've read the whole VN and only watched the first episode of the anime for sake of comparison. In the VN you see the time machine because everyone runs to the roof, while in the anime you only hear/feel it. In both you see the time machine embedded in the side of the building leading to slightly different thoughts/chatter from Okabe after he causes the first divergence.
>> ARTICLE
You see it in episode one when he runs to the roof in the anime. Okabe barely opens the door to look out but its right there. As well as when the world line shifts and it instead crashed into the building.
>> ARTICLE
Had to load it up again real fast but yep you were right, you get a small peek at it for a couple seconds when he opens the door.
>> ARTICLE
Its the satellite that crashes into the roof. He sees it when he leaves, and more importantly it disappears when he changes world lines for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
He also sees Suzuha (but doesn't know its her) in an outfit and helmet waving him away from it as he peeks at it on the roof in the first episode, but he gets distracted by Mayuri.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. Wow. It's been too long since I've seen it.

I was planning to get the VN when it was released for the PS3, but I have a friend who was wanting to watch the anime so I might as well re-watch it with her. 

Well, I'll still get the VN, but no harm in watching it again :D
>> ARTICLE
I have never watched this anime. I have no idea how this is a spoiler and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have noticed it being a spoiler until I ran into this post right now. Some things aren't spoilers until you tell someone else that it's a spoiler. 
>> ARTICLE
If you watch the first few episodes you know its a spoiler. Someone watching the show on Netflix will later look back at the picture and be like, hmm that doesn't add up, why is the store assistant girl holding a gun with him. Theres more to it then that because of a lot of things that happen early on but I don't want to spoil it for you.
>> ARTICLE
Classic fucking Netflix

For those who have yet to watch a show, that image is meaningless. However, by pointing it out that it is in fact, a spoiler, you basically just spoiled them yourself, OP.

I don't think episode 3 was that crazy at all, but that anime (especially rebellion), is my number one. I would recommend watching through all 3 movies (6 hours total) for a faster paced version. The 3rd movie (which is not part of the original anime) is extremely good post the first 30 minutes of it.

So summary: speed watch 4.5 hours of madoka movies so you can fall in love with the rest.

That gif may seem like a spoiler, but it isn't.

Spoilers aren't really spoilers without context. I saw that same gif last week and though she might have killed herself, saw the movie and what happened was quite different then what really went on. Context is what makes something a spoiler.

The only way this is a spoiler is if you've scene the anime already, if not and you're not reading too much into a picture for a show you're about to watch it means literally nothing. To the average person, you'd see, oh hey, chick with a gun and she looks tough, scientist guy who looks pretty balla and the space thingy from the moon launch! I'm going to check this show out!
>> ARTICLE
If you're going to watch the anime, then having that picture up there is a huge spoiler. If you don't plan on watching it, then it's really no big deal.

>> ARTICLE
Everyone is saying  "it's not a spoiler" but it clearly is a minor spoiler.

It is a spoiler because the character is wearing tactical/combat gear and carrying weapons.  That character is not revealed to be capable of such a thing until later in the show, but anyone who sees this picture will not be fooled when this character first shows up looking innocent.

>> ARTICLE
So as someone was never watched an episode of the show but who has heard a lot about it how is that spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "It's showing Suzuha in combat gear. The fact that Suzuha is a time-traveling revolutionary from 2036 isn't revealed until about half-way through the show.")
>> ARTICLE
You don't want to know.
>> ARTICLE
Then should I watch to know and feel some feels or something?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Of course. Forget about the picture you saw and watch the **entire** show. Steins;Gate won't dissapoint you.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to check it out but Grisaia no Kajitsu and Chaika has me hooked so far.
>> ARTICLE
Chaika is trash compared to Steins;Gate. Seriously.
>> ARTICLE
Aww but how am I suppose to get my magic shooting loli action?
>> ARTICLE
Tell everyone why dontcha
>> ARTICLE
Why is it a spoiler?

Someone can tell me, I don't mind. I'm not a huge anime watcher and it wont ruin it for me if I come across it down the line.
>> ARTICLE
I finished watching the whole series today, was a really good show. But i didn't see how this spoiled anything.
>> ARTICLE
I opened the link and I haven't yet started watching the animehave I ruined it for myself?
>> ARTICLE
Not really. Just watch it. Don't read the episode descriptions.
>> ARTICLE
Well I didn't know that til now... 
>> ARTICLE
well not really, cause those who haven't seen it yet don't know what that image means <.<
>> ARTICLE
US Netflix only, or is it on the Dutch one too?
>> ARTICLE
Spoilers, spoilers everywhere
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't have to be; it just makes SG look like a generic sci-fi action flick, where everyone and their dog just happens to have a gun lying around.
>> ARTICLE
So what exactly has been spoiled for me? Since I only watched the first few episodes of Steins;Gate, apart from know some of the characters I don't have any extra context related to the story.

^Except ^maybe ^that ^working ^time ^machine

>> ARTICLE
Just watch the show. Why ask for it to be spoiled?
>> ARTICLE
Because I was just wondering what the image is actually spoiling, I have no context so I can't really tell what's being spoiled. 

>> ARTICLE
You have to watch a few more episodes to figure it out. But I'm not just going to outright tell you, because it's actually a huge plot twist.
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth; that may be a spoiler, but it doesn't have any significance out of context. Especially for a show with the time travel as a plot device.
>> ARTICLE
That's maybe not the right place to ask. But is this anime worth watching? What do you guys like most about it? Thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
It's my (very close) second-favorite anime series.  They give you half the series as a character comedy to warm up to everyone and then the fantastically paced and presented overall plot kicks into high gear the further you get.  It starts off brilliantly zany and endearing and ends up being pretty damn moving and a good bit deeper than most comedy/drama mashups ever even bother trying to be.

S;G is simply well done in nearly every regard: The art and animation are pretty consistently high quality, the writing is solid and the comedy bits are filled with internet culture jokes that are actually used mostly contextually appropriately, the dub's localization is arguably well-done (some people dislike that all the Japanese 2chan jokes were changed to more recognizable western memes and references, but since the Japanese-centric stuff would go over my head, I welcome the adjustments) and the voice cast is solid all the way around.  The only thing that it really felt like it was missing was a soundtrack that sticks with me long after I finish watching the show (E7, Bebop, S&W as good examples) but other than that, everything present is great.
>> ARTICLE
Thanm you this sounds good. Time to watch if for me :)
>> ARTICLE
Yes. A million times yes. The show is all about the relationships between the characters, and it's fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Could you possibly post an update if it gets fixed? I've been looking forward to watching this series.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix manages to spoil things quite often, I mean why tell me that a character is gonna die in the goddamn episode description
>> ARTICLE
It's only a spoiler if you know it...
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that really does give away mass.....
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for posting this. I thought if this was going to be on anywhere it would have been US Netflix but Canada is just fine.

>> ARTICLE
I just looked on my netflix and I don't see it, am I the only one? or is it down now or something?
>> ARTICLE
I'm probably dumb or have bad memory but what episode was that?
>> ARTICLE
That description isn't really describing Steins;Gate properly
>> ARTICLE
Clarification people: this is Canadian netflix. You know, the one that serves a population less than California. Yeah false alarm everyone.

When you say "added to Netflix" can you instead say Canadian netflix in the title so we don't get confused with real Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I always preferred the VN over the anime, but that's mostly due to how gorgeous the vn makes everything look...
>> ARTICLE
No context no spoiler
>> ARTICLE
Did they remove it. Its no longer on Netflix!
>> ARTICLE
This is some fucking bullshit. This show is meant to be an emotional roller coaster, and right now netflix is being as callous as my ex girlfriend  who is still fool around with but she says she doesnt want to be in relationship. goddamnit netflix dont treat these undersving people like this. steins gate is god damn poetry.
>> ARTICLE
It's only a spoiler if you've watched it. As someone who hasn't seen a single episode yet I would not have been able to tell. So thanks OP, for spoiling it.

Holy shit. Who is in charge of putting these pictures anyway.
>> ARTICLE
And now you posted that same picture here, to spoil the subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
I put spoiler in a bracket as the first word. If you haven't seen the show or the VN and insist on clicking on the link, that's on you.

It still shows up as a thumbnail though

Uh, no it doesn't?
It's marked as NSFW, so no, it doesn't show up as a thumbnail.

You can't make out jack from the thumbnail anyway. If getting spoiled through extremely tiny images really bothers you, change your reddit settings to not show NSFW (spoiler) thumbnails.
>> ARTICLE
And? I wasn't trying to disprove your point.
>> ARTICLE
Just seemed so from your tone, my bad :)

That's because of your RES settings.

Can you really actually make anything out of that little thumbnail though? I mean, you don't see faces at all...Or anything going on in the picture.
>> ARTICLE
That's true xD
>> ARTICLE
That is entirely your fault though. If you change the options in reddit to not show thumbnails in spoiler threads you will see nothing. I believe this is on by default so you either changed he setting or have an extension that changes it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen the show and I have no idea what's spoiled. I don't even know which image they're talking about. The tiny little splash image or the 2 characters?

This sub needs to relax, it's not a spoiler at all.
>> ARTICLE
> I've never seen the show

THIS IS WHY.

If you seen the episode where the character was introduced you'll know it's a spoiler.

>> ARTICLE
Not even that big of a spoiler
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, now you let me know thats a spoiler when I wouldn't have known either way.  Upstanding job, OP.
>> ARTICLE
It's thumbnail is hidden, as it's tagged as a spoiler, he said it was a spoiler, and you clicked on it anyway... you have nobody to blame but yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Are you fucking kidding me?  Did the person who chose that picture even watch the show?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like they may try but to the extent where when they added the show someone just asks the room if they've seen the show and if not they try and find a screen cap that looks interesting.. having a gel-nana would have made a lot more sense but someone scrolling through Netflix randomly likely wouldn't stop to watch it if they had no information about it prior.
>> ARTICLE
Probably not.

I don't know why I spoiled that for myself by clicking the link.

Guys, I am looking for a new anime to watch. I tried Psycho pass but its not my type. What baout Steins;gate? is it really good?
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate is one of those shows that was like a hidden gem or at least to me. Didn't know about it until i stumbled upon it and man that show has some great characters in it. Each one develops into really likeable people and it has some great comedy in it as well. I should also mention as a man who loves dr pepper, this show is all about that pepper. Seriously, its in almost every episode and is front in center for the most part.    
All and all, the show has a really good story, theres some great drama, mystery, sci-fi, romance, and when you finish the show it leaves you with a good feeling.
>> ARTICLE
It is amazing. It will be one of the best animes you will invest your time in.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me when fixed so no spoilers
>> ARTICLE
"Invents a microwave phone that let's them send text messages into the past"

Sounds like a really, really, really bad B-movie.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, no. It's fucking awesome. And that's not the spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't say anything about the quality of the anime, but the wording of that sentence sounds really bad.
>> ARTICLE
Why are the top 50 comments something among the lines "I never watched the show and I wouldn't understand it's a spoiler until you said it was". Well, no shit!!!

If there's an image of a movie cover with a guy in a full cyborg body and when the movie starts you get, 1st scene a doctor explaining a new cyborg technology and 2nd scene the guy in the cover learning he has to go into a dangerous mission, do you know what's going to happen or not? I'm sure you wouldn't be surprised when you see him get injured and later turned into a cyborg.

What gets spoiled if you just see that cover without having watched the movie? Absolutely nothing because you don't even know if the movie is about that guy or some fluffy unicorns.

Out of curiosity.  Where are you seeing all this "shit" about Netflix and what sort of complains do people have?

it's cosplay but it's not unbelievable, they look like normal clothes, and it looks very real for hair.
>> ARTICLE
I was afraid to post this. Apparently the hair is a wig. Though, I figure that's where most of the time was spent. Besides the wig and contacts, I can't imagine this taking much more than a quick amazon shopping session and about ~2 hours of work.

Not to take away from the other things she's done. She's got some really nice costumes in her deviant art page. But, maybe it's because I don't watch anime, but I really don't get what the big deal is about this particular one.
>> ARTICLE
I remember reading on her blog that the jacket was self-made at least. I would assume most of her other stuff would be too.
But definitely one of the best Suzuha cosplays to come around!
>> ARTICLE
Among the plethora of mainstream Anime, Steins;Gate is a fairly recent addition to the average viewer's canon. 

(source: Anime Consumer)

As far as Anime goes, Steins;Gate is one of the most enjoyable, that doesn't rely on fan-service or exploiting the supernatural. 

Instead, the series uses a protagonist anti-hero and his small group of loyal, lovable friends as a medium to play with theoretical physics. The setting is modern day, with a perfectly normal external world. There are no supernatural elements or irreproducible factors to the opening of the story. Their physics are equivalent to ours at the opening curtain. 

To sum up the experience: Episodes 1-12(ish) are an entertaining experience with lots of laughs and embarassing moments, while episodes 13(ish)-24(the 25th bonus episode not included) are almost exclusively serious, emotionally turbulent, and all around powerful. 

Personally, I've never watched an Anime that sported a cast of characters that I felt as much for as I did for this group.

Suzuha, however, is something of a fun anomaly. You love her character, even though she's (i think) the last introduced and the first to turn when the plot twist occurs. 

tldr; if you ever decide to watch anime, I strongly recommend this one. It's goofy, lovable, and incredibly suspenseful.

>> ARTICLE
In what way do they consider time travel (even if it's only texts) *not* supernatural...
>> ARTICLE
Fair point. Personally, 'science fiction' has always been completely separate from 'supernatural' in my mind. So I've never viewed time travel as something in the same ball park as demons and magic. That's more what I mean.

to each their own.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of science fiction is thematically much more similar to fantasy than anything science related. Star Wars, for a classic example, is very much a fantasy story in space.
>> ARTICLE
That I agree with based on the simple fact that star wars contains supernatural abilities through its use of The Force. The rest of the story, I'd personally keep in mind it as science fiction due to the focus on technology. 
>> ARTICLE
And then play the light novel! There's so many different endings, it really expands the story
>> ARTICLE
"Apparently"? I thought it was rather obviously a wig.
>> ARTICLE
oh yeah, despite what I said, it's clearly a wig, just not nearly as obvious as most of the cosplay wigs
>> ARTICLE
Again, don't follow anime and cosplay. So, I wouldn't be able to immediately catch that. Read it on her page.

Best girl (to me) is basically who I think the best female character is. Sometimes it's a Misaka, sometimes it's a Saten.  Then there's a show where worst girl is still best girl, she's just not up to snuff with the top three: 1)Mio 2)Mugi 3)Yui.  Also, some people are lonely and crave affection, so you gotta let those people have their waifus.  

Saten is mine, and no one else can have her.

What are you, some kind of nerd?

I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this one, but Sakurasou's Graduation Speech scene is definitely the most cringeworthy scene I've seen in anime and I absolutely despise it.

Let me explain,

It's a graduation ceremony and people are graduation, right? A very important part of their life is ending. 

And guess what happens, some random girl starts talking about shit no one cares about. And she doesn't just simply ask for help, she starts talking in depth about private and emotional stuff. 

And what's even worse is that most people dislike that place to begin with, the entire scene couldn't be more forced than it was.

Seriously, I can't explain in words how embarrassed I felt while watching, I couldn't look at the screen.

If you still have trouble understanding me, try imagining yourself being one of those who were graduating, your high school is ending, and random girl you know nothing about started talking similar things in the same fashion.

Just no
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I genuinely liked the show for the most part, but that episode flaunted into an area of unbearable forced melodrama. I thought it was awful. It was like the writer was going "You're supposed to cry here". Like they replaced the neon "APPLAUSE" sign with one saying "START CRYING".
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely agree. That was the scene that cemented my dislike of the show, for the very reasons you mentioned. It makes me feel weird whenever I see people around here praising it as one of the best episodes of anime.

The whole anime was cringe-worthy in my opinion.

This subreddit has some of the worst users ever, though some of the absolute best as well, people constantly downvote opinions just because it is criticism of an anime they liked. There is no other subreddit that I have found where people downvote so rigorously as here. I am pretty elitist with my taste in anime but I don't downvote everyone who has a different opinion. On the other hand I am actually afraid of posting a controversial comment because I know I will get downvoted unless I make funny jokes about it, but if I am being 100% serious, I will get downvoted to oblivion.

Shinobu, Hachikuji and Yotsugi are pretty strong contenders in the Monogatari series. All 3 of them are kind of immortal and are older than they look so I think it's acceptable.

[Monogatari Series: Second Season Spoiler](/s "Shinobu and Hachikuji also appear in adult form but in the Loli form they're just too cute.")
>> ARTICLE
In regards to Monogatari, for me at least, Shinobu and Hachikuji are two of my favorite characters in the show simply because I love their interactions with Araragi, but that doesn't mean I want them to hook up with him. 
>> ARTICLE
i agree, its weird as fuck. especially when the loli is actually young, and doesnt just look it.
>> ARTICLE
 The only decent season of Monogatari is the first one. It went downhill from there.

 Tokyo Ghoul is a generic "gorefest" anime. Wimpy protagonist turned messiah is overly done.

 Didn't gave a fuck about that girl-ship that sunk on KanColle. Was introduced so briefly and her relationship with her kohai wasn't fleshed out for me to care. Kinda funny that a ship can be sunk with a single bomb.

 I have no doubts that Kaori will die on Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.

It's like Simon and Shinji in a cage match, and that is just amazing.

To be fair, the others are pretty much wasted on the sideline. I do like the new humorous side of Inaho in the latest episode though
>> ARTICLE
Since this is an actual unpopular opinion thread, I'll talk about my feelings on Inaho. Inaho is one of my favorite MC's of all time, (top 3). I like the humor he brings about; stuff like his salute, the most recent episode, and the he's on cloud 9 face. I really like how little emotion he shows, because it keeps his character solid and actually makes him seem calculating, not just calculating when he needs to be. His personality doesn't just suddenly change during a fight, I really don't like when that happens. I also think he obviously has emotions because he does shit like jump first and looks at his sisters good luck charm.


This is an actual unpopular opinion, lets see how it's taken.

To be fair it's a show possessing very few interesting characters anyway. We've got Cardboard Genius MC-kun, Cartoon Villain Count Saucybum, Generic Innocent Princess-sama, Cockblock-chan, angsty traitor Rayet, and MC-loving moe-chan.

I will give credit to Morito though, he could be a pretty damn interesting character but the show criminally underuses him.

I liked the teacher, the general lady and the red haired girl. I thought they were pretty diverse characters, with motivations that made sense.

Wasn't he trying to overthrow the monarchy? I thought he made sense.  Irrc His wife died in a senseless war and he was trying to orchestrate another war in an attempt the rise the ranks during the chaos. Its not entirely moral but it makes sense, he's like a less cool Littlefinger.

Mecha is by far the best genre and anyone who disagrees is a fuckboi.

This subreddit is pretty much just a circlejerk between a couple of popular users, only a few of which actually contribute anything besides shitposting.

Eva 3.33 was the best rebuild movie.

Posable figures >>>>>>>> Jointless figures

Gendo did nothing wrong.

Gurren Lagann is a bloody fantastic anime (it's actually my favourite) with one of the most annoying fanbases I've ever seen.

I can elaborate on a few of these points if you want, these are all just my opinions and they aren't all neccasarily right, like any opinion.

Edit: Wait are these actually unpopular opinions or are they just unspoken ones? I'm confused since it's getting upvoted. I know for certain the first and third are since mecha regularly gets voted people's least favourite genre by an incredible margin, while barely anyone votes for it as their favourite, and 3.33 gets more hate than praise even in the Eva community. And I certainly see more non-posable figures in /r/animefigures and the merch thread then I do posable.

I think they are mostly (I assume the second one is unspoken) unpopular and only getting upvoted because of the thread.  Like you said, Mecha is consistently named in least favorite genre threads.

DBZ is a bad show. I dare anyone who disagrees to try watching it again.

Monogatari has the worst fanbase and hate-base.

NGE and Madoka are the Tupac of anime. They get tons of praise for being a deconstruction, but the end products aren't very enjoyable.

Code Geass had an okay ending that was completely ruined by the denouement.

Edit: Also anyone who likes lolis deserves to have 24/7 government surveillance.
>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched DBZ.  It holds up, and it's problems are well understood (i.e. pacing.)  It is obviously not exactly a cerebral show, but it was never trying to be.  To me it is the quintessential kids show; its messages are simple and clear: good beats evil, earnest honesty is the best policy, kindness pays off, and you can always become a better version of yourself. 

It doesn't have too much to offer adults besides nostalgia, although there is interesting character development in Vegeta.  *This doesn't make it a bad show.*  It just means it is not a show for adults.

- Toradora is average. First half was enjoyable, but the second half was overly melodramatic and the ending (final arc) was downright terrible.

- Kirisu isn't even best girl in her *own show*.

- I think /u/N1njawaffle has good taste. ^^^he ^^^actually ^^^doesn't

- Nagi no Asukara's second arc was a disappointment in comparison to the first.

- Clannad isn't boring. It's an incredibly well crafted SoL with a nice balance between touching moments and comedy, as well as never getting too melodramatic.

- Endless 8 was a really interesting experience and one I don't regret watching.

- Chunnibyo was good for about two episodes (7 & 8), but otherwise it was pretty average. 

[maybe I'll edit with more later....]

Agree, like 80% of the reason I like it was the neat underwater art/worldbuilding. Then it went full melodramatic polyhedrons. Is this really an unpopular opinion?

Having recently been downvoted to oblivion in another thread, apparently my opinion that Attack on Titan is worthy of a 9/10 rating is quite unpopular.

I thought it was a highly well-executed series that hit all the right emotional notes and captures the imagination, and I will continue to agree to disagree with the community here when I maintain that its characters, pacing, and plot are substantially stronger than the majority opinion generally acknowledges.

The original Fullmetal Alchemist was better than Brotherhood. Brotherhood's comedy sucked and I found the plot and character developments in the original more interesting and Brotherhood a bit cliche. Ed's final sacrifice in Brotherhood seemed a bit too easy, not really equivalent exchange. 

This sub is terrible at predicting whether a show will be good. Aldnoah Zero had signs of being bad even in the first episode but it was still really popular. Same with Zankyou no Terror and all of the civilians surviving the first two terrorist attacks just so that you wouldn't have a reason to hate the main characters yet. It's gotten to the point that if a show is popular on this subreddit then I am cautious about getting into it.

Shows like AnoHana, Clannad, and Nagi no Asukara are way too melodramatic and rely on cheap tricks to try to get you emotionally invested. Half of their problems are really petty and they react to some of them in really unrealistic/stupid ways. I also just generally hate love triangles.

This sub is easily the worst I've seen in terms of reddiquette. Comments get downvoted just because the opinion isn't popular, not because it's trolling or inaccurate. There's less downvoting in /r/trueanime but I don't want to read an essay just to discuss shows. There isn't a single good anime subreddit on this site.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, see I actually liked how they handled ed's equivalent exchange in brotherhood.  They kept trying to use alchemy to solve their problems, and in the end alchemy was the problem.  Just has a feeling of completeness for me, sort of a smack on the head moment of "ah, that makes sense".  That said, i do think I like the original better.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that annoys me about Brotherhood is it assumes you saw the original already, and doesn't bother going into more deep development of characters because hey, you already know this stuff.  I love both shows, but I can see that each has its strong points and weak points.

Never seen Grisaia, so I can't comment on Yuuji, but as for Inaho and Kirito, it's a bit of a weird comparison. Both are certainly bland to me, but in different ways. Kirito has emotions but they're the same emotions we've seen people have over and over. Kirito is too conventional. Inaho is less conventional but has no visible emotions to speak of. He's just basically a human-shaped gun for the Terrans to point at the Versians and say "go kill the thing." 

Both are dull as dishwasher, but they're dishwasher with different bits of discarded food floating in it.

Kirito is a dishwasher that sprays shit all over the place because he's basically insulting the viewers intelligence by acting like an emo douche when he could have saved a ton of people.

Shinsekai yori was one of the less enjoyable anime for me and not because of its themes, i fucking loved what they where talking about.. but everything else the characters the animation the way the plot keeps going everything except the main concept

i saw 6 ep of cowboy bebop and holy fuck the 6 episode of cowboy bebop is probably one of the worst episodes i've ever seen (if you dont know what im talking about go see what it is).. i also hate how episodic this is i cant get into it.

The anime i hate the most is tokyo ghoul and aldonoah zero

If you want a mastermind show you should read Liar Game or watch One Outs.  If you want politics and mastermind and war show you should read Kingdom(it has an anime, but the animation is crap).  In all honesty Lelouch wasn't much of a mastermind, he could just bring in elements that watchers weren't aware of.  Season1 was good if you want a mastermind show, but season 2 just became about overpowered mechs
>> ARTICLE
I've been reading Liar Game slowly and while I enjoy it, it's very much lacking in characters or plot. In some ways it's kind of like a logic textbook using the characters as examples... which is fine, I actually really like it. CG I did like largely for the politics though. I'll read Kingdom at some point if it's as good as you say, but really what I'm looking foreword too is when I actually get the motivation to watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes, which will probably bump CG out of the 10/10 spot.

Also, Makise Kurisu isn't actually a good character, she's mostly there to distract you from the 10 episodes or so when nothing happened in Steins;Gate before it got really amazing.

Finally, nearly 8 months after finishing Gaworare, I still don't really get what happened in that show, but I still stand by it as probably being really really good.
>> ARTICLE
> I find Nichijou to be mind-numbingly boring because it is simply random and spastic for the sake of it. Being random and hyper is not comedy.

Yeah this show is *very* hit/miss for people imo. In most cases, you either love it or you don't. Personally, my big issue is that they often fail to deliver the punchline as strongly as I could (one episode, there's a ton of buildup when they're trying to break a pumpkin in over-the-top ways, and then the final line is "This Pumpkin is really hard!" -.-) 

That said, it had enough times it blew it out of the park that I'd strongly recommend at least everyone *try* it. I do feel it would have worked if rather than 24 minute episodes, 3-6 minute ones. Watching the clips on YouTube from the show sometimes is funnier than watching the actual show, and I feel due to the nature of Nichijou's style it works better in a shorter format. 
>> ARTICLE
Despite having beautiful imagery and great action sequences, 90% of the Monogatari series is boring as hell and nothing but a slideshow with pseudo-intellectual one-on-one conversations. I've watched the first few seasons 2-3 times trying to actually enjoy it but I just cant... 

Also those GOD. DAMNED. SCREEN. CUTS. Sorry, cutting away to a colored screen every few seconds is NOT "artsy" it's fucking annoying and is in no way adding anything to the show but frustration. this is especially horrid whenever they cut out during a fight, "I see you're enjoying the stunningly fluid animation in this fight scene... here! let's interrupt that flow with a giant red "SCENE MISSING" screen because fuck you, that's why!" At first I thought it was for censorship, then I went and watched the BluRay release version and it was still there so it's obviously on purpose, ugh, terrible.

Agree'd always feel super awkard whenever some comes up, I can understand anyone liking skinny/flat-chested/etc. girls, but come on, you know they're deliberately drawn as children and that's f*ck'd up.


Incest I'm more open on, I don't really mind the *oh I never met her, until she became my sister* dynamic on an individual basis, but it does weird me out how much of it there is. Also any incest where they grew up together is grim as fuck, I don't care how many times the creator qualifies it with "technically, she's adopted and so she's not real sister", at this point it feels like 80% of the women in Japan are "technically not blood related" to their siblings.

Kara no Kyoukai is pretentious as fuck and incredibly overrated.

Cowboy Bebop is bad, I was annoyed by the main characters, didn't care for their random adventures, and having to plow through them made it really hard to enjoy the main plot.

* Under the Dog will never save anime
* Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru isn't good
* WIXOSS is way better than Yuuki Yuna
* Kizumonogatari will be released
>> ARTICLE
>Cross Ange was better in the first episodes

Mostly agreed, the first ten episodes was probably the best [](/s "Break the Haughty") plot I've seen. The episodes after that seem to be going full Valvrave, but I'll wait to judge until it finishes.

>I think Cowboy Bebop is average at best

Agreed.

I agree about Under The Dog. 

It doesn't have any appeal other than promise for good action scenes, and the funding only greenlit one episode as far as I was aware. 
>> ARTICLE
> Parasyte is getting uninteresting

There's no overarcing plot/story and its getting boring.
>> ARTICLE
Also there's practically no progression since like episode 8, practically 2 months of blue balling.
>> ARTICLE
Let's see here... 

* Cowboy Bebop is *not* in any way a master piece. At most is good.

* FMA: B is at the level of, say, Dragon Ball Z. Enjoyable and fun, but not good by any means. Plus the ending is terrible.  

* Kill la Kill has as much "unnecessary" fan service as any other show, and it starting as satire doesn't excuses it. 

* The fan service in Monogatari is not "justified" any more than in any other show. Just fucking own up to the things you like instead of trying to excuse them. 

* Pandering is not necessarily a bad thing.


* The argument that Lolicon is or encourages Pedophilia uses the exact same logic than the argument that Videogames cause Violence: That is, they both assume that the viewers/gamers can't separate reality from media, and they both assume their acts are caused by the media itself and not by the warped mind of the viewer/gamer. Holding one opinion without holding the other one is intellectually dishonest.

I am biased in liking cowboy bebop because I fucking love corgis.

I like that you lump Monogatari and KLK together. One of the things that annoys me about most KLK or NGNL critics is they'll hate on the fanservice, and then ten seconds later talk about how great Monogatari is.

Regarding loli..I respect everyone's right to their own opinions, and everything's cool as long as it's kept to thoughts and not actions. But I still think being sexually attracted to an 8 yr old is creepy, animated or otherwise. As long as you don't act on it, that's cool. but it's still a little ick.

Kara no Kyoukai is pretentious drivel!  
Monogatari *is* indulgent fanservice!  
YuYuYu's ending was fine!

Watch [**Princess Tutu**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721/) plebs!
>> ARTICLE
Clannad was personally for me melodramatic garbage, it's writer responsible for many of key's works its pretty terrible in which all he ever does is try force feels down your throat and twists that are far and away nonsensical and purely there for pure plot conveniences. It's a classic enforcement of 'It made me feel human by crying to incredibly unfortunate circumstances, thus it's great writing.' Majority of his characters are terrible too.

Half agree, it's based on Nasu's first original works. If it wasn't for Ufotable's excellent animation, i'd of struggled the will to keep watching. Deem me a filthy casual if you must fans of Sinners.

Being a big fan of Monogatari, i can neither agree or disagree, there is a lot of indulgent and creative fan-service but it's not nearly close to what the show is about or what hooks you in.

YuYuYu ending was perfectly fine, 100% agree. A lot of subtleties were missed but i'm a firm believer that the ending was purposely open for interpretation. The best theory and actually believe what they were going for is the one where Yuuna is still a hero, there's too many conveniences and hints that fit once you look into it. It was probably done as it was because they weren't sure how the show would sell and if it could garner enough interest for a sequel. The ending leaves enough questions and hints that it can go on, however could be satisfyingly left if the circumstances were unfortunate.

Nothing will kill my interest in a show faster than the words "loli" and "harem". Nothing.

Also Kill la Kill isn't the intelligent satire of fanservice people claim it is. There's a step between recognizing a silly trend in a genre and saying something interesting or noteworthy about it, and Kill la Kill doesn't take that second step. Still, great soundtrack and animation.

Actual unpopular opinion:

Bake is best monogatari

Hakaze and Nano made Nichijou a lot worse

Second season of Kuroko no Basuke is a lot worse than the first season, I'd even call S2 bad, but I still had fun watching it

~~I didn't really enjoy Madoka Magica, mostly because I couldn't care less about any of the characters(which is a shame because I love the premise and the artstyle)~~ Looks like that's a fairly popular negative opinion. Disregard

Tonari no Seki-kun was unfunny and annoying after the first episode

Chuunibyou(S1) got boring after ~4 episodes

Penguindrum's characters are obnoxious and the humor is unfunny

Katanagatari's comedy is the only thing I dislike about the series, it wasn't funny in the slightest

I dislike Korean Zombie Desk Car mainly because every girl in that show was shit

I dislike Mikakunin because I didn't like a single character(Mashiro was cute though) and Benio is one of the most obnoxious characters ever

I dislike Dusk Maiden of Amnesia because I didn't like a single character AND because the ending is the most rage inducing ending I've seen in my entire life

Moe characters just get on my nerves after ten minutes.

A death wish on this sub but I thought the ending of Toradora was terrible. I loved the show up until the last couple episodes. Not because I disliked the final pairing but because in the span of an episode [Spoilers](/s "Taiga and Ryuuji went from trying to win over their crushes to deciding to run away and get married to each other"). The whole thing seemed too dramatic and forced at the last minute with little build up.

In Nagi no Asukara, I liked Tsumugu until near the end. [Nagi Spoilers](/s "When he confessed to Chisaki, he told her he would respect her answer whether it was a yes or a no. She said no and then he harassed her until she gave in (I found she has almost no backbone) and said she liked him and would be with him.") If someone likes you, they don't HAVE to be with you and what he did was anything but respectful and accepting of her answer even if he felt she said no for the wrong reason.

- People who watch an anime before reading a manga and get spoilered deserve it one hundred percent for going online to talk about it before reading the manga or finishing the anime. Every time I hear someone whine about spoilers when the source material is right there for them to read, it pisses me off. Personally, I think people who have no interest in reading manga have no place in the anime community whatsoever.

- One Piece's art style is absolutely terrible. The way people, especially women, are drawn in One Piece just gives me a fucking headache.

- Sword Art Online was an extremely important anime and I'm very glad it came out, because it gives me the perfect example of what exactly makes an anime absolutely positively mediocre. Aspiring mangaka, LN authors, and authors should all be forced to watch Sword Art Online through the [Ludovico Technique](http://neurologues.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2013/05/ACWO_Ludovico.jpg) to show them exactly how NOT to write a story or design characters.

Both Tokyo Ghoul and Aldnoah Zero are shows that fail to produce almost any interesting characters so they bring in lots of tropy ones that need superficial traits like "desu" or "the uniform wasn't cute so I didn't bother to wear it on the most advanced warship we have defending Earth"  in order to be distinguishable at all. The characters are like spray and pray, maybe someone will like some of them and stay, but they will never develop because the shows already struggle with the lead cast. A bunch of troped up characters we have seen before elsewhere, probably done better.

* I've tried to watch Bakemonogatari multiple times and decided that I didn't like it. 

* I actually like Eren Yeagar as a character. He's less angsty and more perpetually. I was iffy at the start but [](/s "when you see that he was willing to kill slavers even as a young kid and was totally unrepentant") sold me. I also like the political sections. 

* Shoehorning in fanservice shows a lack of respect for the character in question and generally makes me dislike the show more.

* Traps are not attractive to me. 

* Being overly attracted to lolis is creepy. It's almost as bad as Toddlers in Tiaras. Also, the excess of "she's much older than they look" is BS 9 times out of 10. 

* Incest isn't something to encourage and it's not even an opinion, it's just genetically a bad idea. See: British monarchs, certain parts of the US, and King Joffrey.

I PREFER DUBS TO SUBS

Story/pacing/framing is way more important than art style. Good shots and direction are timeless. I would watch something drawn in crayon and if it was well-staged and a good story I'd give it a 10/10

Slice of life is shit and pointless

Shows with young girls in provocative positions are creepy and wrong

Fan service should not exist and is in most cases damaging to a series rather than adding anything. It's not even neutral. It's just alienating and it needs to stop.

Movies/specials are generally better than series

Nichijou isn't funny

Oh man, I remember when Oregairu S1 was airing in 2013 and how many people tried to argue with you about this, saying you were somehow "wrong". That said, will you be watching S2?

Liking Loli's sexually is equivalent to children. No, I don't care that the Loli is 800 years old in a child's body, its weird.

Fan service is uncomfortable and completely brings out the immersion in a show. And yes, I do watch shows for the plot. Literally.

I think people who take waifus seriously (I'm talking the ones who are buying the body pillows version) have bigger issues on their hands than the plot going on in their more recent ecchi anime.

NGE wasn't that great. The character development was really good, I'll give it that, but pretty much everything else was kinda subpar in my opinion. I think it's obnoxiously pretentious at times and rather dull at others. The mindfuck scenes, namely EoE's ending, as well as the symbolism felt really forced and tryhard to me. Overall, I think it's very overrated and overhyped.

DragonBall and its sequels is really no better than your average battle shounen, and I think nostalgia's about the only reason for its popularity. I guarantee that if it were realized nowadays, people would totally trash and hate it. The art style is ugly and the character designs look downright stupid. 

The second half of Death Note really wasn't that bad. Sure, it's not as good as the first half, but it's still totally worth watching. It's definitely not the 0/10 pile of garbage that everyone claims it is. 

If a show takes many many episodes to get good, then it's probably not that great a show. You shouldn't have to sit through half the series to get to the good parts. Luckily I haven't watched any shows like that yet, but I've heard many people say that. Why the hell would I sit through 15 mediocre episodes in order to watch what everyone claims is the good part? That's like playing an entire CD for someone and saying "The first couple of tracks aren't that great, but don't worry, it gets good by Track 6."

* Steins;Gate is terrible. Nearly every character is very unlikable, either from being an asshole, annoying, perverted (one fucker is a complete pedophile), or a combination. Apparently it gets better after the second half, but no show should rely on you slogging through shit to get to something "better". And by that time I'd hate the characters even more, hoping they'd get sucked into the void, from playing with an extremely predictable time travel plot.

* Monogatari is really really creepy and disturbing (I'm talking pedo level). When it isn't being that, it's slow as hell, and nothing ever happens. All the events are are dumb and pointless.

* Fanservice should not be a part of any show. It **only** detracts from the experience.

EDIT: Also, Gintama isn't that funny. Maybe if I was 10.

Alright, well, let's just get this all out there then, shall we?

The whole **Tsundere** thing is stupid and annoying. The Tsundere is always the worst character. Taiga, Senjogahara, Chitoge, Makise, Akane, Tohsaka, and so on. Worst.*

---

Second worst, just below the Tsundere is the **Comic Relief Character**. No show needs a comic relief. I don't need to be relieved of the middling discomfort and shallows your show is barely sticking its toe into.

---


**Barakamon** is one of the blandest shows I've ever watched. A 5, at best. If this is what devoted Slice of Life watchers are looking for, then *holy shit*.

---

**From The New World** only has a handful of good episodes, the rest is borderline bad, mostly just unstimulating. It's perhaps the most predictable and straightforward show I've seen that isn't a by-the-numbers school comedy show.

---

**Tokyo Godfathers** is a bad movie.

**The Wind Rises** is a bad movie.

**5 cm per Second** is a bad movie. It's one of those, "Oh, it's over? That was it? Huh." sort of movies.

---

The first season of **Higurashi (When They Cry)** is trash. The second season is god-damned brilliant.

---

That's all I can think of for now. Hopefully those are polarising enough for ya.

There is no non-racist reason not to count Avatar as anime.
>> ARTICLE
Defining anime on non-cultural grounds which still exclude Avatar is still possible. It doesn't have to be racist.

Theorists who analyse anime often talk about *limited animation* and the qualities of movement that this creates. This has often been used to map out a rough territory of pieces that can fall under the banner of 'anime'. Avatar does not use limited animation. Nor do the films of Yamamura Koji, which I would also not classify as anime.

Defining anime on an *art style* rather than *technics and techniques of animation* is ridiculous and would make anime a genre rather than a medium. Such a definition would exclude, say, Yuasa Masaaki's works which thoroughly embrace the technics and techniques associated with anime. Just because Avatar has an art style kinda reminiscent of some forms of anime does not make it anime.

The final recourse to calling Avatar anime - Asian themes - is even more suspect when it comes to racism.

Can't be assed to watch them? Here's a TL;DW:

Things like *Avatar* and *RWBY* aren't anime. So what?   
Whether or not they are "anime" doesn't doesn't make them any better or worse.   If anything, calling them "anime" forsakes the fact that Westerners are actually putting in the effort to try and make worthwhile animated series.

Let things be what they are. Enjoy them for what they are.

Also, before you say *"Yeah well, 'anime' is short for 'animation' in Japan. So any animated series is an anime"*.  

The "anime" Japan uses, and the "anime" Westerners use are different words.  
One is, indeed, Japan's word for animation. The other is what us non-Japanese use to describe and label Japanese animated works of various, but noticeable, art styles, tropes, and themes.

I'd sooner punt my pets over a fence before retracting any of these opinions:

2) **All of you are babies and it's the worst**.  No perspective, no appreciation of the classics, you think old = ugly, you'd rather watch a harem than a mecha show, you are probably in a school desk as I write.

3) **The following shows are dog shit**:

* Kill la Kill

* Suzumiya Haruhi

* Toaru Kagaku no Railgun

* Angel Beats!

* Steins;Gate

* Free!

* Golden Time

* Ghost in the Shell (1995)

* Aldnoah.Zero

* Nisekoi

* Gundam 00 & SEED

* Bakemonogatari, and especially all of its pointless sequels

* Every SHAFT show with the exception of Arakawa Under the Bridge

* Durarara!!

* Every Kyoto Animation show ever made

Edit: If you would like an elaboration as to why I hate any of those shows, I can write some explanations on demand, but I'm not about to do several paragraphs on each thing I listed without prompting.

4) **Gundam: G no Reconguista is the best show in the last year**

Welp, lets start off by saying that World Trigger is much better than AT LEAST 50% of the show's currently airing, people give it shit because of the animation when IMO there's way worse out there that is praised.

- Like /u/6MultiplyBy9is42 already said, this sub, sadly is a circlejerk between popular users. To add I think discussion threads are really crappy here, unless its a rewatch discussion thread, there's barelly ANY discussion going on the weekly threads, most top comments are .gifs, screencaps, photoshop of a funny scene or a quote from someone in the anime. In order to talk about the actual episode i have to sort by new or go to the bottom of the thread.   
- Same as /u/Starterjoker I think TG 2nd OP is better than the first, while I think the music used isn't really the best compared to the first, the scenery in the OP has way more meaning than the first.  
- I actually don't like the possibility of Kousei ending up with Kaori OR Tsubaki, leave the man alone and let him play the piano.  
- And last but not least, the Monogatari series are way too damn hyped here, it is good, but its not worth the "ALL HAIL THE MONOGATARI SERIES" religion that we have here.

Anime isn't a good medium for realistic portrayal of people and stories.

This is partially due to Japan's culture which, for example, forbids displaying "negative" emotions in front of an authoritative figure. Also, anime (cartoons in general) just aren't good enough when it comes to displaying many subtle facial expression. 

I'm not saying anime or Japanese culture is bad. It's just very hard to get into when you're a normal person living in the West.
>> ARTICLE
> Anime isn't a good medium for realistic portrayal of people and stories.

A lot of people watch anime for escapism. It's a chance to immerse yourself into fantasy story telling. If I want to watch a show about a real McDonald's employee, I'm sure there's some lousy reality tv series I can see. On the other hand, if I want to watch a funny show about a MgRonald's employee who happens to be a demon lord, there's an anime for that. 

Anime is entertaining because it's not constrained by the need to be realistic. 

> Also, anime (cartoons in general) just aren't good enough when it comes to displaying many subtle facial expression. 

Disagree with you about that. Most good anime is as effective in displaying visual facial emotions as any decent western animation. 

I somewhat agree with you about the Japanese culture thing. I think some western viewers get frustrated if they don't understand a Japanese cultural reference. That is understandable, but a bit of research online can explain a lot of things and make the next viewing experience more enjoyable. Some viewers just want to be spoon-fed.

- I like Fate as a franchise but I'll never play the visual novel because I'm not willing to invest 50 or more hours into it.

- Both Asuka and Rei are shit, but if I had to pick one I'd pick Asuka by a landslide.

- Cowboy Bebop is overrated and Tank! was one of the worst opening songs I ever listened to.

- I refuse to watch Clannad, Ping Pong, Aku no Hana, Hidamari, Sidonia no Kishi and plenty of others because of the artstyle and/or animation. (I watched Madoka and liked it)

- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the anime which I consider closest to flawless.

White Album 2 was boring as fuck until the last 3 episodes, when it became half-decent at best. Also it wasn't sad at all. [WA2 ending spoilers](/s "Why should I care if some teenage asshole cheats on an immature brat with a somewhat less immature but indecisive brat?") 

The show failed at making me laugh and it also failed at making me sad. TBH I don't think I felt any emotion at all whilst watching it(does cringe count as emotion?). The only good thing about the show is its music. I also hated every single one of the characters, I know you're supposed to but still.  3/10 wouldn't recommend

Monogatari is stupid fanservice with no depth and shitty characters who talk too much. 

Hamatora was the best anime of 2014.

Clannad and Clannad: After Story are neither sad nor tragic; they're stupid. 

Red Data Girl was actually good. 
>> ARTICLE
>Hamatora was the best anime of 2014.

I haven't see many people talk about this show so I hope you don't mind me throwing some questions at you. 

* As the first original anime story written by the writer, how do you think he went? 

* Would you be interested to see more original stories from him? 

* What are the biggest strengths of this niche series? 

* In terms of production how do you feel about the switch of the animation studio from NAZ to Lerche between season 1 and 2?

* It's one of the more serious stories that Seiji Kishi directed. Given his track record (and the performance in YuYuYu later in the year), do you think he has finally able to deliver a more heavy series than the usual comedy ones?

* Just how amazing is the second OP? 

>> ARTICLE
* I thought the writing was a little inconsistent in some respects, but surprisingly tight. It answers all the important questions, gives just enough detail about the world without extensive infodumps, and manages to use normally infuriating tropes in an effective way. It has a very weird tone, but that's actually one of the more consistent aspects. Nice is one of the most interesting characters, period, imo.

* Definitely wanna see more from him! He's got a very unique voice.

* Surprisingly, for a comedy-mystery show, the best parts were, for me, the more serious moments. I tend to dislike excessive gore, but what ultraviolence the show indulges in has this sort of understated elegance to it, and it's rarely - if ever - done for its own sake. It serves the narrative, or a character's arc. Also the music is great.

* I thought the switch mostly worked alright, although I did miss the wacky colors in S2, and the transition scenes were a bit obnoxious.

* Confession: I absolutely *loathe* Seiji Kishi. I hated Angel Beats, and what he did to Persona 4 makes me seethe. Honestly I think I like Hamatora *despite* Kishi's involvement.

* Both OPs are pretty fucking amazing.

Bonus: I think that Hamatora is the show Durarara *wishes* it was.

At least 99% of Anime is a waste of time

Code Geass is the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. Was a fun comedy tho.

Angel Beats was straight up bad and not sad at all. 

AnoHana could have been finished in 3-4 episodes but was dragged out way too long for no reason since the ending wasnt sad at all and felt forced as fuck. Actually the whole show felt forced.

Eve No Jikan is a good show despite being boring.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes could have been so much better. Still belongs to the best series in the medium to be ever made. Speaking about the best the medium has to offer: There is no reason to watch anything after Evangelion. It killed Anime.

It's weird because I liked Makashima so much more than Kamui, but I love Kamui's plan so much more than Makashima's. If that makes any sense.

I agree completely. Kamui started to become less of an interesting character and more of an interesting concept. 

Once I found out he was a similar entity to the Psycho Pass system, I was blown away and really excited. Also the way they blended the dialogue and ED was perfect every single time. 


I also *really* loved Shimotsuki's struggle. I love when complex characters sneak their way into anime. 


I also think season 2 had better gut wrenching scenes, like they actually made my stomach churn. [spoiler](/s "like when the terrified civilians got mowed down or when Akane's grandma was beaten to death with a crowbar and pictures were shown to Akane.")

Worst MC ive ever seen, and the rest of the cast is not much better. Also it tries to be attack on titan way to much.

2006 Fate/Stay Night's first half was pretty good, all things considered at the time.

Kuroko's Basketball is legitimately becoming lamer and lamer each season. Not that I still don't like the series. I just think the first season has been better than all of S2, and what we have of S3 so far.

The average commentator in this subreddit sucks at commentating. They say that a series sucks or a character is boring/annoying, and never elaborates why. As if their opinion is fact and that we should automatically know what they're getting at.

Fate/Zero, *by itself*, is not a good series. Seriously. It infodumps a lot of things about a world that you're supposed to have already intimate knowledge of. Without that knowledge, what they're saying is just a bunch of bullshit. Also some characters, like Zouken or Tokisaka, generally don't make sense to people who have only seen Fate/Zero. They just kind of seem like asshats.

Honorifics are not the golden gospel of subbing. It makes no sense to include them in western-based anime, such as Allison and Lillia, Spice and Wolf, or One Piece. Intelligent Localization > Translating too literally.

The amount of narration in the Chimera Ant arc in HxH seriously cuts down the quality of the arc by a huge amount. It cut the pacing to an absolute crawl for little to no reason.

Lolis aren't creepy. Dude, literally almost no little girls act the way they do in anime. Nor do they have the same body proportions outside of small boobs. At this point in time in anime, they're basically completely separate entities. 

Comedy in anime doesn't really "suck". It's just different from what our prescribed tastes in comedy are in whatever culture we come from. No form of comedy actually sucks. It just doesn't mesh well with your taste of comedy.

I liked the first season of Clannad more than After Story. Because of Best Girls Tomoyo and Kyou.

Oh boy, you guys are gonna hate me.

When I went into Eva, I was expecting this glorious masterpiece.  What I got was a badly dated show that probaly had good animation at the time, but has dated really badly.  I also got extremely unlikeable characters.

> BUT UR NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE THEM!!!!!11one!!!

I don't give a fuck.  You make a show, I SHOULD LIKE THE CHARACTERS.  Your show should also not rely on symbolisim for me to enjoy your show.  I couldn't finish it.  I tried 4 FUCKING TIMES TO WATCH THIS SHOW.

> 2deep4you

Fuck off.

* Anything in the Fate/ Universe that isn't Fate/Zero is SHIT. (Unless Carnival Phantasm, because that seems funny and I haven't seen it yet)

Oh boy, this shithole.  Let me tell you two things before I start.

1.  I have nothing against romance IF USED IN AN APPROPRIATE SETTING.

2.  I started off with Zero.

Now then, lets start.  My main problem with the series is that I hate the romance aspect of it.

> BUT IT WAS AN EROGE FIRST!!!!1111!!!

Do I look like I give a flying fuck? No? You're right.  Now then.  Like I said before, when use correctly, romance can be VERY WELL DONE.  However, I feel that Fate/ is a action battle royale show and not a fucking shittily done romance.  Yes, I said it.  The romance in it is bad.

> THE ORIGINAL SOURCE IS BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another problem I have with shows is that if you REQUIRE me to read the OC, you ARE doing a very bad job.  I don't care how good it looks.  You paint a turd gold, guess what? It's still a turd.  Also, the fanbase for this show is so damn obnoxious their smeel rubs off on me though the internet.  Need a ketchup bath for that shit.

* Steins;Gate is OK.

Nothing to really say here, It was an OK show, but no masterpiece.

* Loli Fanservice is DISGUSTING.

I'm not even gonna bother explaining this one.  If you've missed my previous comments on it (Not suprised), look at the other people here who have talked about it, they nail my oppions on it very well.

-Clannad: Afterstory had a mediocre middle with a shit ending and is a solid 6/10.

-Wolf Chidren is a BORING film

-The entire Monogatari series is simply BORING, and it's dialogues aren't exceptionally witty or funny, except for one Snail one that I saw.

-Cowboy Bebop is incredibly mediocre

-Princess Mononoke is one of the worst Ghibli films

-Fate/Zero was excruciatingly boring and I never watched the second season

-Death Note was bad both before and after "that event".

-Shingeki no Kyojin is a fantastic anime and people who dislike it literally do so because it's popular.

-Parasyte was the best anime in the fall of 2014, way better than F/SN and slightly better than Mushishi S2.

-Evangelion is worse at the *beginning* and then gets *better* until it's two final episodes, which are the best.

I thought the first few episodes of Shin Sekai Yori were by far the best in the series, while the later bits were...okay.  The Bakenezumi/Monster Rat war in the middle, while it served to set up Squealer's dilemma and solid speech later in the series, dragged horribly and was generally uninteresting while the finale felt disjointed and the pacing was still off.  

That's not to say the plot points were bad or anything - I think its take on history was well-done, and the characters and their description of societal romance were...interesting, I guess?  But as it went on it sank in to a sort of generic melodrama with occasional high points, and a bunch of Everyone Is Secretly A Terrible Person (Also Cats) that lacked the energy and immediacy of the early bits up until the monster rat war started.

[](/s "I really wished they would've taken the disappearance of Sora much further. Possibly even really making it that he was just a memory implanted in her head based on being alone her whole life and wanting so much to be able to relate to someone. Maybe when Shiro becomes God of the world, she creates a Sora from that false memory and you have a happy ending, even though he was never real - it doesn't matter. It's real enough. When this shit happened, I was expecting masterpiece material when finished and I was blown away when it happened and close to tears because the story seemed very light-hearted and easy-going until then  but all problems resolved next episode and i was very, very disappointed") and it really gave me "oh okay nothing bad is going to ever happen ever without being resolved" feel so I definitely get what you're saying.

TTGL is mediocre at best with the last arc being the only redeemable part of the show.

Grave of the Fireflies is bad.

Mecha anime is objectively superior to Harem anime, Moe anime,and Slice of Life. And the vast majority of other genre's as well.

The Rebuild Evangelion movies range from pointless to terrible. 

Hellsing TV is superior to Hellsing Ultimate. Mostly because Helllsing Ultimate follows the Manga which was a complete mess made by a bad mangaka. 

FMA isn't even the best action adventure shonen out there. Maybe the 4th best.

i really, really, really disliked Knights of Sidonia, and not for the reason most people do. The CG was fine, I don't like CG over normal anime, but I love it when studios try new things. What I disliked was, the rushed plot, boring characters( though I could probably talk for 10 minutes ranting about a certain someone being a fucking bear,) not to mention a constant feeling like someone just decided that this show didn't want you to care about it. I can't remember any character that I was ever attached to or even felt relatable. The main character was dull, boring, and really stupid. This also might be one of the worst written and rushed romances I've seen. The show seemed to go out of its way to be different, but it just came off as weird. The show trys to have interesting ideas, but when you hear that humans can photosynthesize, I get less of an intriguing vibe and more of a, confused vibe. Whether it's bears, or photosynthesis, or things shooting up your dickhole, this show was just so odd it was offputting. The action/battle scenes were easily the best part of the show, but they were predictable to a point of ridiculousness. You basically went into every battle knowing exactly who would live and who would die. I haven't read the manga, but the plot felt really rushed in the show. They just ran out of time to develop characters, and whenever someone died you felt nothing. As someone who usually likes mech shows, I was very disappointed with Knights. (That soundtrack kicks ass though,

Railgun was a complete mess of a show that couldn't decide what it wanted to be and solved everything misaka and spouting friendship. Misaka while I enjoy her interactions with Touma asI do with all the harem members is a generic Tsundere. Anybody who thinks railgun is lost in a circlejerk for Misaka or read the manga in which i still think the index novels are better. Half of the show is filer anyways and the Sisters does not redeem the entire series.



Index is not the most annoying character in the universe.

Same can be said about Cowboy Bebop, but major props to the animation studio! They were probably the last studio to switch to actual animating. Meaning they drew EVERY frame individually and patched them together.

When sad about expectations for anime rewatch Gurren Lagann :(

I don't think I've ever seen an anime that I would consider to be a masterpiece. I have watched shows that have made me both laugh and cry, but they never feel on par with award winning television. Shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, House of Cards, etc. will go down in history as some of the best shows to ever exist. I just cannot think of a single anime that comes close to that level of quality.

EDIT: I think a lot of my problems with anime in general is how they handle characters. It's very rare to come across an anime where all the characters behave realistically. I'm not saying that unrealistic characters can't be fun, but sometimes I want to watch something different.

Angel Beats was the most overrated thing I've ever watched. The ending bit was where the show finally got a bit interesting cause background finally got developed for the OP and whatnot, but I did _not_ go anywhere near bawling my eyes out like I was expecting to. The feels scenes was okay, but the impact was way underwhelming than what I've experienced before. The majority of the show was just cringe because of the slapstick(?) comedy which is just an utter turn off. Like the show pretty much sets itself up as a show that has no serious tone to it and then it throws that one scene and expects you to cry? No thank you.

I'm very pleasantly surprised so far. I have no complaints about anyone's voice, but I've only watched like 30 minutes.

The evil laugh is acceptable, although its not as... memorable. Even "[tutturuu~~](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLS_vC_OYvw&feature=relmfu#t=13m19)" is decent. More of a "[doodo-doo~~](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLS_vC_OYvw&feature=relmfu#t=14m22s)" though.

My main complaint is "Ooooooooooo, Metal Upa!"  wasn't awesome. Maybe that one line wasn't even that special but for some reason it's burned into my mind.

EDIT: [BUT HE'S A GUY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d52-eG9yQcU&feature=plcp#t=7m11s). Is it just me or is this far less funny?

EDIT2: Not really watching in any particular order. "They are my waifus" replaced with "my harem." I thought waifu was a pretty common term? Guess not. The change is less funny. Mostly a good dub hto.

Why didn't they switch to Given Name Family name but instead kept it Family Name, Given Name.  Doesn't that just seem odd?  Also, I don't see how hard it could be to pronounce these names correctly...Mayuri's voice doesn't click with me.  Other than that everything else is fine I suppose.  
>> ARTICLE
Because they have to keep the Japanese culture alive. Almost all the jokes are based around the fact that they are in Japan, so removing part of the culture would kill the scenes. Just like they couldn't replace all the text with English, because they are in Japan still. Every single bit of culture they could keep, they tried to keep. It's one of those anime that you can't just "pretend" they're all American, it would ruin the show.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they had syncing issues trying to reverse it? 
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't know.  From the dubs I've seen syncing issues are just unavoidable for the most part and it seems like most of them will change names to a western order.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, that's a good question. My assessment is that Funimation thought, "Fuck it, this takes place in Japan, so we will keep their naming conventions." I know, I know, it's a localization, and it would have been a really easy change.

I guess the other alternative is that when Okabe is introducing everyone, him introducing people Doe, Jane and Smith, John would just make him quirkier?

Meh, the two likeliest scenarios are that either it sounds better, or that Funimation just made a gaffe not thinking about the naming conventions and copied the Japanese script.
>> ARTICLE
Because we don't usually call people Last Name, First Name here in English-speaking countries.

In Japan, its normal to address people by their last names, but not so much here in the U.S, so in translation, names get changed and instead of introducing some like (completely random name) Tanaka, Yui their now introduced as Yui Tanaka in English.
>> ARTICLE
That's my point.  Houin Kyoma is Last Name, First Name.  It would make more sense for them to say Kyoma Houin in the American dub because that's the traditional way to order a name here.  But they left it in Japanese order.
>> ARTICLE
I derped majorly reading your question.

Honestly, I don't know why they didn't change the order. Probably because it sounds better in the Japanese order? Thats the only reason that comes to mind.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, exactly. He's wondering why they DIDN'T switch the names. Makise, Kurisu is still Makise Kurisu. Okabe, Rintarou is still Okabe Rintarou.

The laugh. It's not the same, but... it's acceptable, I think.

I disagree.  As a mad scientist, that was kind of his thing.  Now it's just gone.  

Seriously, the laugh Mamoru does is not *that* hard to replicate.  I wonder if Tatum even tried.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, it's pretty much impossible to replicate anything Miyano does, he's just waaay too unique. It would've just made Tatum look really bad if he had tried.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I can do it.  I just wanna know if the English team even tried to have Tatum replicate it, because the dub really has a completely different vibe from the original.  Okabe and Daru both have higher voices, whereas all the females (and Rukako) have lower voices.  I feel like they didn't even try to stay true to the original voice actors at all.
>> ARTICLE
It's not about trying. It's simply not possible for ANY dub VA's to live up to the Steins;Gate cast, I'm sure the only way to make it succeed was to kind of re-envision it to a certain extent. Attempting to replicate would've simply made this dub fail immediately. Better to play up to the VA's strengths, than attempt to copy the Japanese talent.

So if they were aiming to copy, they would've tried I'm sure, but I bet they didn't try, because it would've been futile.

I love the translation.

Okarin sounds amazing with the sort of crazy English he has that is so close to how I get when putting on an air of crazier than everyone else in the room.

Seriously, that word choice is brilliant and makes him sound perfect and I don't remember the more literal minded subs getting that across.
>> ARTICLE
They couldn't replicate the badassery of Miyano, so they substituted him with a "decent" VA and made the lines the badass part. His vocabulary was never that diverse in the sub, regardless of their translation, it was mostly the VA's work (though he still had a slightly off way of speaking). But since they couldn't replicate Miyano's awesomeness, they had to up the strangeness of his vocabulary.
>> ARTICLE
I have only watched the first episode but i totally agree, the script writing is phenomenal and i think it is totally going to make this dub.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 is out now.
>> ARTICLE
I love them. Honestly, there are things in the dub I like better. It's different, but I actually like Mayushii better in English. She just seems more airy and less... retarded? I don't know, but my friend's five year old sister does the same thing where she ends her sentence with her voice going up.

Okabe is pretty good. The original VA was perfect, and the dubbed one doesn't quite keep up, but does a hell of a good job trying. One of his funniest quirks is his tendency to speak in broken English ("sonuvabitch"), but even beyond that, the seiyuu's evil laugh and normal voice are perfect. Still, it's not "bad." Kurisu is perfect, both in Japanese and in English, and Daru is very good in both as well.

Overall, I'd say that the dub is very, very good. The original is in general better, but there are parts that I actually prefer the dub. Because the show is placed in Japan, the show lampshades a lot of anime culture, and the show has a lot of broken Engrish that won't be funny, it'll be nearly impossible to capture the glory of the original script. Nevertheless, the Funimation script seems just as smart as the Japanese one, and the characters are spot on.

I'd actually recommend the dub for those who strongly prefer dubs or are new to anime (can't wait to introduce this show, dubbed, to my friends who aren't into anime!), but for anyone who doesn't mind subs or prefers subs, I'd still prefer the sub. Also, watching "I am mad scientist, iss so cool, sonuvabitch!" in Japanese is mandatory.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. I didn't think my friends would have high enough power levels to fully appreciate Steins;Gate, but I think it's definitely safe to show them the dub.

(eg "That's Louise-chan's favorite line!" is now "Feel free to slap him if he gets too grabby.")
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, my power-level is dangerously low, and I still loved the S;G sub. In fact, that was my first sub. I think the difference is that I had a more open mind towards anime, due to positive experiences regarding other anime.

Would you mind explaining that "Louise-chan's favorite line"? I specifically remember thinking, "...what?"

Yeah, it sounds more like someone actually laughing and not like a mad scientist trying to encourage a lighting bolt to strike in the background so that his silhouette can be all dramatic.

Disagreed. It still sounds like "a mad scientist trying to encourage a lightning bolt to strike in the background," but less over-the-top. It makes him a little more psycho and a little less endearing, though, so yeah I prefer the Japanese version.

The two are very dissimilar so it hardly feels the same, though the japanese feels very hammy.

Like shatner hammy.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a more normal laugh. That sounds right. I'd argue it's still pretty villain-wannabe-y though
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but some people just naturally have laughs or looks about them that project such (I personally look rather like a Machiavellian schemer myself) and I feel the English dub feels like that, though Shatner levels of ham have their place.

The main problem with this is the voice acting in Steins;gate was one of my favourite aspects of the show. At least people who don't like subs will have a good experience. 

I'm really curious how well Okabe's actor will handle the emotional scenes, though.

>> ARTICLE
You should post this to /r/animedubs :)
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie I enjoyed the dub, I watched the first episode in japanese and it was quite slow, after that it has successfully sucked me in.
>> ARTICLE
I know early Steins;Gate gets flack for being really slow, but the exposition in this episode (and also in the visual novel) was what really hooked me to the story.

Okay  realizing that time was repeating, his beginnings of realizing he has a unique ability and seeing his ordinary life in spite of that is actually  really nice to watch upon finishing the story and revisiting it.
>> ARTICLE
to be honest the slow beginning it what really digs the bait hook into you. You think its slow and maybe kinda boring but looks very good in the first 4 episodes then **Surprise motherfucker** after episode 5 or 6 the show reels hard and the hook gets lodged deep in you as drags you across the wonderful occasional mindfuck that is Steins;Gate

>> ARTICLE
I can see how the beginning can be slow to some but I never felt that way when I first watched it. This series makes me laugh more than any other anime I've watched. I am new to anime though.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly never thought it was slow in the beginning. Its a chill, entertaining SoL in the beginning which is really necessary for exposition, as you mentioned. 
>> ARTICLE
We get to meet Luka, Faris, and Suzuha, meanwhile Okabe starts researching John Titor on @channel.
>> ARTICLE
Is it Luka in the dub or what? Always thought it was Ruka.
>> ARTICLE
It's like people calling Holo from Spice & Wolf, *Horo*. It's wrong, but people think they are doing the right thing by saying it the same way a Japanese person would.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, if I remember correctly from when I played the English version of the VN they use Luka.
>> ARTICLE
Which is correct.
>> ARTICLE
His name is Luka. The official sub and official dub both actually get it wrong and put Ruka. It's an understandable mistake (Ls and Rs being practically interchangeable in Japanese), but 5pb. has gone on record that it's supposed to be Luka.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of feel like given this is /r/anime it'd make more sense to go with the official sub and dubbing translation, inaccurate though it might be to the original authors intentions.  Or else just have this answer on copy/paste for every time you get asked this question, I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
My understanding is that /r/anime supports fan subs, particularly ones which're superior to official ones. That said, I pretty much do have that reply ready to go whenever I'm asked about it.
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting and I didn't know that. Thanks for a tidbit of info on my favorite show!
>> ARTICLE
I hope the fact that this rewatch was kind of last minute doesn't prevent people from joining in. Anime was a cool hobby until I watched Steins;Gate. I haven't experienced anything like it since and it really showed me what the medium is capable of. It may seem slow at first but just stick with it and you'll see whats up :D
>> ARTICLE
You may find that you like Shinsekai Yori too. It's hard to specify any similarities between the two, but [Possible S;G spoilers]( /s "they both have a similar feel to them in how the plot unfolds")
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode of *Shinsekai Yori* a while back, but then other stuff happened and I never got back around to watching it. Would you recommend it?
>> ARTICLE
I liked it enough to buy it. I don't do that often.

It's another "slow start" like S;G. That said, I've never fully understood why people think Steins;Gate is slow, because to me slow implies poor pacing. Steins;Gate definitely wasn't poorly paced and neither is Shinsekai Yori. It just grabs you with its atmosphere and pulls you in.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoyed S;G, then yes, absolutely. It takes a few episodes to get the ball rolling, but by the end, the ride will have been worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes i would. A couple weeks ago i made a poll asking what show i should watch blind and Shinsekai Yori won. After watching the first episode i realized that it was outside the type of show i typically like to watch, but i stuck with it and am glad i did! 9/10 at least!
>> ARTICLE
I've had it on my watch list for quite some time, but I'll have to put it on a higher priority. Thanks for the recommendation!
>> ARTICLE
Dont read anything on it! i just watched it blind (i had also watched S;G the same way) and it made it amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Rodger that. I watched S;G blind as well so I know exactly what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
I picked S;G "because it's got a semicolon in it's title, lets give it 5 episodes" boy was i surprised when everything happened!
>> ARTICLE
I picked S;G because I heard it had Dr Pepper in it. No regrets.
>> ARTICLE
[Maybe a slight S;G spoiler?]( /s "wait this show is about time travel????? *head explodes*")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, good call on the spoiler-tag. And I know, right?
>> ARTICLE
well i dont want to tell people anything i wouldnt have wanted to know when watching it!
>> ARTICLE
I picked it up purely for the mad scientist clip. 
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori is always relevant
>> ARTICLE
i'm glad i went into it as blind as i went into Steins; Gate, every single thing was a surprise!
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori is definitely a show you want to go into blind. The atmosphere and lingering sense of mystery are just unbeatable.
>> ARTICLE
yes!

[](/s "the best spoilers")
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing this is common knowledge around here, but I'm betting a couple people don't realize that the whole [John Titor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) thing actually happened: in the early 2000s someone actually became famous posting on the internet as a time traveler from 2036 talking about WWIII and the many world-lines theory of time travel.

It's one thing I find neat about the anime that someone took someone's crazy postings on the internet and decided to tell a whole story around it.
>> ARTICLE
John Titor was a big deal, back in the day. It was all my friends would talk about at the water cooler, while it was going on.

Now, this has been a minor point of contention among watchers, and I'm curious to your take. I've always pronounced his name as it is in the dub (ie, since 2000), but the Japanese pronounces it differently. It's actually a minor [plot point](/s " {one of the clues Mayuri uses to figure out who Suzuha's dad is comes from saying 'Hashida Itaru' five times fast, which slurs into sounding like 'Barrel Titor'}") in the VN. How do you pronounce "Titor"? Do you think it ultimately matters?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah; this is where translation/dubbing gets tricky, because you have a plot point regarding the Japanese pronunciation of the English word, but then you're translating that into English.

I think the dub rightfully glossed over that [plot point](/s 'because no English speaker is going to notice a connection between Hashida and Titor') and the last thing you want to do is draw attention to the fact that the characters are actually speaking a language other than the one that they should be speaking.  It wouldn't make sense for characters to pronounce all English words normally except one that they pronounce with a Japanese accent just because it's a plot point in the original material.

These are the sort of fun translation issues that keep translators awake at night, I think.  It's hilarious the lengths translators sometimes have to go to to deal with language-based plot points (e.g. "Tom Elvis Jedusor" instead of "Tom Marvolo Riddle" in Harry Potter).  But in this case, I think just dropping the plot point all together (since it was such a minor one) was a good call by the dub.

So, yeah, I pronounce it with a standard English pronunciation.
>> ARTICLE
The OP for this anime is the only one I've found so far that consistently gives me the chills no matter how many times I've heard it.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. And then [when](/s " the OP changes to the other half of the song for episodes 23 and 24"), super chills.
>> ARTICLE
I think [the] (/s "ED Change to  (Skyclad Observer), during Ep 23 or 24")  is more powerful, I think it defines the series more
>> ARTICLE
Is that considered an ED if the characters are still on screen and talking/doing stuff? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's easily one of my favorite moments in all of anime. I just wouldn't've called it an ED.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you could just as well consider it an OP, as it is the OP for the VN as well :P
>> ARTICLE
True that.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best and most fitting openings in any anime.
>> ARTICLE
Great timing. Just started watching this for the first time a few days ago. Can't wait to see what all the fuss is about!
>> ARTICLE
Keep coming to the rewatches! I love to vicariously "watch it for the first time" again through new people. And any spoilers should be tagged appropriately. So yeah. Let us know your thoughts/questions throughout.
>> ARTICLE
I like that you made the rewatch in tangent with the actual days in the anime. I've already seen the anime a lot as is, so I don't feel the need to watch it again, but I enjoy reading comments and occasionally talking about moments that I liked in here :)

This thread actually reminded me that I totally forgot about Makise's Birthday being on the 25th and I didn't celebrate it :(
>> ARTICLE
So, the Steins;Gate 0 website made special posts for Makise's birthday and for July 28th. The illustrious translator ReadingSteiner has translated both posts on his site: [birthday](http://tempusedaxrerumtl.com/2015/07/24/july-25th-kurisus-birthday/) and [July 28](http://tempusedaxrerumtl.com/2015/07/27/july-28th-kurisus/).
>> ARTICLE
Ah! It's nice to see that there is an official Steins;Gate 0 website up! Also thanks for showing me those, wish I could have remembered sooner. 
>> ARTICLE
* lecture about time travelling

* part about exorcism

* the girl working part time

* Titor info disappearing (down to 12 results, and then up to 56 if I'm right) and SERN changing time

* strange woman and her retro PC

* teleporting a gel-banana

So, uhmm.. When someone talks about time travelling I get always fired up, and so I did with the first episode
>> ARTICLE
you're watching this first time right? i saw youre comment on the first thread. you should make notes like you did before for each episode it will make it more awesome when you finish the series and you go back and read them
>> ARTICLE
Lol you're right! Recently, I noticed how superficially I watched deep/complicated anime and how more enjoyable it is this way :)
>> ARTICLE
If some have read/watched Chaos;Head, I'm fairly certain that Neithardt/Knight-hart is the MC of C;H. There is a crossover game called *Steins;Gate: Hen'i Kuukan no Octet* or Steins;Gate 8bit where he is supposed to appear, IIRC.  
[8bits OP is nice](https://youtu.be/1iVkTECSbqI).

I liked the [banana scene in the VN](https://youtu.be/vT3uuZZnaxw) better, although just a bit.  
Fairs is fun, Steins;Gate have some[ fun MADs](https://youtu.be/nVPnCrPALAs).

Third time I'll be watching this, and I also have the PS3 ENG version to read(already read the PC Ver).

And Suzuha is best girl!  
My [Amane Suzuha/S;G shrine](http://i.imgur.com/xIs7gyO.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
Nice shrine! Have you read the VN *Steins;Gate Darling Is An Idiot*? Suzuha's ending in that is super cute.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks ;)

Nah, unless there is an actual patch I can apply, I wont read/watch it(I guess you are talking of the YT TL videos).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, watching Zakobot's translation on youtube is pretty much all you can do for that one, unless you're fluent in Japanese. Worth it, in my estimation. But then, I'm a sucker for moe.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I'm a sucker for moe too, but I like to have control over that I'm doing, in this case, reading a VN.  
Maybe I'll cave in soon, who knows.
>> ARTICLE
For that particular VN, there's not much to do in the way of control. All routes share the same initial bit, and all branch off at the same time. So you could do the common start, then pick which route you want. None of them seem to have choices, from what I could tell.
>> ARTICLE
I meant more in terms of speed and such, at times I'm a real slow reader and at time faster then what most LP vids go at.  
As said, I might cave in later and just read it anyways, I still have [S;G 8bit](https://vndb.org/v9887) to read.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good one, too.
>> ARTICLE
You read it?  
I love old school type VNs, either real or made to look it 'em. Like S;G 8bit and Yu-No.  
FM synth and 8bit music rocks!
>> ARTICLE
I read transcripts. One of these days I'll get around to installing/patching it for a more proper experience.
>> ARTICLE
This was a sudden one. Looks like I have an excuse to rewatch this.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly I missed Ep.1 discussion. And now story will go kinda slow, so there are not much to discuss about actuall story for some time (I guess). Maybe I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
You really didn't miss any discussion. That whole thread was basically people lamenting the lack of an advance notice. And, for the slow part of the show, while there's not much drama there is a lot of character building/development. So there should be plenty to talk about tomorrow and the day after and so on.
>> ARTICLE
Good, that's good.
Well, I would actually like to discuss the whole anime with someone, but it's probably not possible here. For that reason I recommended it for my new to anime friend.
>> ARTICLE
If you got some stuff you just want to discuss outside of the rewatch threads, I'd recommend checking out /r/steinsgate.
>> ARTICLE
Well, thanks a lot. Will check it out. Sadly, there aren't a lot of people there, it seems like.

It's a small group, relatively, but still fairly active. Especially with *Steins;Gate 0* coming out soon.

Sadly, without cropping or stretching you can't get it to a proper 16:9 aspect ratio.

Wait a minute. I just did some research.

According to the image, they would be in the Beta World Line (between 1% and 1.99%). Meaning, anything that happens in the world lines within this range will converge to the same incident (unless the range of convergence is changed, say to the Alpha World Line).

With this train of thought, and using the picture as canon, we can confirm that our Steins;Gate gang will, at some point, become extremely fashionable and super ritzy, regardless of what they do, as long as they stay within the Beta World Lines.

I'm okay with this.

The 25th episode "OVA" that came with with the Blu-ray release and the movie are totally new content / expansion from the VN. But episodes 1-24 is pretty much the VN on the True End.

I hear it goes much more in-depth about his relationship with each member of the Future Gadget Laboratory. I think there is one ending for every one of the girls (including Rukako)

From what I hear the progression is similar, but rather than forfeiting their happiness to try to change things further, like the anime, you stay in their timeline with them.

I really don't understand why is /r/anime so tolerant to dubs, it has long since become a de-facto standard that anime is to be watched with original voices. Otherwise you might as well be watching western cartoons.

Why do you hate seiyuu? I love them and respect their work. It is what makes soulless chinese drawings alive.

[S;G timeline v:1.1](http://i.imgur.com/iwGhWkh.png) Fixed Daru's picture

[S;G timeline v:1.2](http://i.imgur.com/V3R2kPR.png) Fixed Suzuha's name in the AD 2036 column

[S;G timeline v:1.3](http://i.imgur.com/e7RbcSh.png) Fixed the misspelled world "father" in AD 2000. Also added some instructions and explained why the characters are there.

[S;G timeline v:1.4](http://i.imgur.com/mBFkYPP.png) Fixed  AD 2000's IBN being written as INB. Also credited the people that helped!

[S;G timeline v:1.5](http://i.imgur.com/HUBZP5N.png) Replaced Ruka's father with Feiris's father. It was a mistake to include Ruka's father in the first place considering he's not mentioned anywhere in the picture.


>> ARTICLE
I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but this is really awesome, but it would be easier to read and digest on a computer/phone if it was built vertically, not horizontally.
>> ARTICLE
Timelines are usually written from left to right... But I get your point.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so confused. Lol.
I finished the series like 2 weeks ago and I understand it. I'm just having trouble reading this xD
>> ARTICLE
Just a heads-up, you misspelt Suzuha's name in the 2036 column.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up. I fixed it. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/V3R2kPR.png) the newest version of the picture.
>> ARTICLE
You also misspelled "father" in AD 2002, Steins Gate
>> ARTICLE
It's in AD 2000 but still thank you very much. The new picture can be found [here.](http://i.imgur.com/e7RbcSh.png)
>> ARTICLE
I like this game of finding spelling errors.

in World Line #5, AD2000, INB = IBN.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... really sorry about that :P

My eyes weren't really made for checking errors... or functioning properly... at all...
>> ARTICLE
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/mBFkYPP.png) I fixed it!
>> ARTICLE
Tl;dr the new Steins;Gate will follow either the 2nd or 3rd line right?
>> ARTICLE
The first anime followed the alpha field mostly. I heard rumors that this next anime will focus on the beta field.
>> ARTICLE
That's what aka_someone said...
>> ARTICLE
What's the Attractor Field Omega -0.27?

I've seen the Steins Gate anime, the OVA, and the Movie. What did I miss?
>> ARTICLE
It's Feyris' ending.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, thanks, my memory was a bit dusty.
>> ARTICLE
Which is only in the VN.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy incredibly [S;G VN](/s "sad") things the VN is worth playing just for her ending IMO. I was going for 100% when I got around to her ending, and the "natural" progression of that is [S;G VN](/s "extremely heartbreaking. You decide to throw away everything you are working towards to give her her father back, eventually realizing this means giving up friendship with Daru/Mayuri/Kurisu entirely (with no way to get back at all, either). She is happy with Okabe, her father is alive, and everything is as good as can be expected for her. And then you load up the save just before and have to rip all of it away. Her father stays dead, and your only solace is that it's "how it should be" and how she shouldn't remember. Only she does remember, and you/Okabe basically have to live with being the person who decided her father has to die. Probably my favorite of all the endings as far as emotion goes, even if I prefer the true ending just for everyone being alive/happy together.") Basically everyone who enjoyed the show should SERIOUSLY consider playing the VN for all the extra endings, Feyris' in particular. 
>> ARTICLE
Where exactly do I buy or get a copy of the VN?
>> ARTICLE
There are a few links to sellers at the bottom of the official site http://steins-gate.us/
Looks like ~29.99 from the ones that have it in stock for digital download. And you don't even have to install fan translations, its an actual official localization!
>> ARTICLE
Perfect! Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Suzuha's route is also really fucking sad, with [VN spoilers](/s "Okabe going so crazy he even contemplates raping her.")

Not to mention the whole "festering semen" quote that he says in the first hour...the VN overall is a hell of a lot darker.
>> ARTICLE
What the actual hell did I just read?! That was sure a mindfuck revelation.

Looks like I just found the first thing I would buy on my 1st salary.
>> ARTICLE
Are there any spoilers here for the upcoming Zero? (Which is apparently based on the trilogy of light novels?)

>> ARTICLE
they spoiled it in the the anime already though, didn't they?
>> ARTICLE
They probably take place between 2010 and 2025 (when Okabe dies)
>> ARTICLE
Well, we don't know yet if Okabe dies in 1.048596.
>> ARTICLE
the sequel is taking place in -line not Steins;Gate. Plus Steins gate it's not out of the 1.XXX attractor field meaning there's a good likelihood he still dies
>> ARTICLE
Nope, this is all stuff from the preexisting stuff, VN, Anime and LNs
>> ARTICLE
What about the Attractor field Gamma? Where Okabe is a member of the Rounders.
>> ARTICLE
It was only in the drama CDs IIRC, so it isn't included here.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaaaand now I'm rewatching Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
I think I can speak for everyone here when I say;

"El Psy Congroo"
>> ARTICLE
Just don't say it too many times... Mayuri has a dark and sinister side and you don't want to annoy her: http://i.imgur.com/TFagfHT.gif
>> ARTICLE
Chop chop, chop chop...
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm. Don't remember that world line. Maybe it's for the best.
>> ARTICLE
when was this....
>> ARTICLE
It's a fan-made gif... It never actually happened.
>> ARTICLE
damn you op for getting me hyped up for the beta timeline. I thought she flips out and became the Tu-ru-ru serial killer 
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU3RzPQmlDY
>> ARTICLE
Ok so I'm re-watching the show to find it and I did it!

It' episode 10 at about 14 min in!

The blood was obviously added after.
>> ARTICLE
OP delivers 
>> ARTICLE
I always do!
>> ARTICLE
Only ever got the Suzuha end when I played through last year after release. [S;G VN Suzuha end](/s "The part where Okabe describes how easy it would be to get away with raping her and never being found out was some pretty disturbing stuff that I didn't expect.")

Rather interested in trying to complete the other arcs now that I've seen this timeline.
>> ARTICLE
that ending is just one massively beautiful depressing story altogether
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, thankfully it ends on a somewhat happier note. Not before having to trudge through more depressing story though. 
>> ARTICLE
Just an FYI, anime only fans should start getting used to the official spelling of El Psy Kongroo, and 'Luka', because now the VN is officially translated and there's nothing murky about it, there's no doubt the proper terms will be used in Zero.
>> ARTICLE
I only watch dub so spelling isn't really something I worry about. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember some of these things... like Ruka's time leap (That apparently led nowhere?) Or a lot of Nakabachi being put in to an asylum.
>> ARTICLE
Political asylum, meaning Russia is shielding him from being nabbed by Japan, see ends of ep 23/24, they mention it.
>> ARTICLE
The timeline thing says he gets arrested, but I believe you.
>> ARTICLE
Did you only watch the anime? These are from the game. 
>> ARTICLE
Did Okabe die in the anime at some point during the alpha line?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

Didn't know there was a game. I mean, we are in /r/anime :<

Funny, too. I was just thinking there should be a Steins;Gate game.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I thought it was common knowledge that Steins;Gate was an adaption. You should check out, it's commercially available in English, and there's so much more content inside! When I first got it my computer was too old to run it without lag and I got a bit depressed lol 
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good! That's a really good adaption, I must say.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this is really good. Now I have to go rewatch Steins;Gate again
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in the other timelines, check out this website I made which has links to all translated Steins;Gate content:

http://allaboutsteinsgate.host56.com/
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god this is really confusing
>> ARTICLE
Now take into account this:
C;H happens one year before S;G in Beta W1 and Kurisu's research is based on papers from N.O.Z.O.M.I. the evil people in C;H(horrible anime)
S;G and R;N are nine years apart and takes place in steins gate
>> ARTICLE
Are any of these worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
R;B maybe, if you want the story from C;H play the game.
>> ARTICLE
R;B? You mean R;N?

Mecha isn't really something that I... appreciate... to say the least.
>> ARTICLE
ya R;N and even as someone who grew up on gundams, and loves mecha, R;N wasn't that interesting to me either
>> ARTICLE
What is R;N? I can figure out Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate, but not that one. (unless I'm really messing up today)
>> ARTICLE
Robotics notes
>> ARTICLE
Thanks

>> ARTICLE
Still trying to figure out where Occultic;Nine and Anonymous;Code will fit into all of this.
>> ARTICLE
good luck report back when your research has yielded some resuts
>> ARTICLE
It really isn't, it's actually one of the most comprehensible good time travel stories. Watch the movie Primer if you want a really complicated one, also Donnie Darko, just because it's awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
After Final Fantasy VIII, time travel doesn't phase me.

Darko wasn't too bad...it was a single time loop where [DD Spoiler](/s "Donnie lived instead of being crushed by the jet engine brought from that freak occurence at the end/start of the movie. Maybe it was a way for God to show Donnie that his continued existence would not necessarily be good anyway...even if he did indirectly find the kiddie porn dungeon.")
>> ARTICLE
primer was very well done though. its complicated but worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Relevant XKCD

https://xkcd.com/657/
>> ARTICLE
That legit made me lol
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much for all the hard work you put into this :)

>> ARTICLE
No problem!
>> ARTICLE
I've seen the anime. Where can I watch/read the rest of the stuff on the time line? 
>> ARTICLE
This hurts my eyes
>> ARTICLE
Hey OP you are bananamancer flair guy! Hi!
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Already got the chain linked in this post. Go and find it!
>> ARTICLE
This is so much more organized than it is in my head.
>> ARTICLE
Mayuri's Banana... My brain it hurts sooooooo much.  Why, Op, Why did you do this, now i have to freaking watch this masterpiece on mindfuckage again... I love you still though OP
>> ARTICLE
Wait, could someone kind of tell me the plot without spoiling it? It looks interesting, but I want to know what world is the true one (I think you know what I mean).
>> ARTICLE
The true world is Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
I get it now, thanks man.
>> ARTICLE
Guy fucks around with a microwave enough to make a time machine. Accidentally fucks up and spends the rest of the series fixing his mistake. There is no "real world" these are all parallel worlds and each one is as real as the other.

The show is 100% pure awesome and you should watch it as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, man. Timeline looked confusing.
>> ARTICLE
I'll repeat myself watch it as soon as you can. You will not regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Play the VN if you can, a lot more detailed and explains more about the "science", characters and worldlines. also alternate endings.
>> ARTICLE
Sick man I really wish I watched that anime sooner IMO. Soooo good
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of Steins;Gate. How is it?
>> ARTICLE
GOAT in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's just say that I have over 150 animes watched and I only have 6 10/10's. Steins;gate is one of them. Just a heads up it starts pretty slow. The first 10 episodes are basically a slice of life with a twist but when it gets good... it gets REAAAAALLY good.
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching it, I'm on episode 4. I honestly prefer slow starts anyway, I find it allows for the setting of a particular universe to really dig its heels in before it takes off. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Almost all my top anime start slow.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda curious of your other 5 - 10/10s... 
>> ARTICLE
[See for yourself.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/TwistedBOLT&show=0&order=4)

I appropriate feedback on my list.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! What are your other 10's?
>> ARTICLE
Yep, agreed 4 of 6.... although now it seems I need to watch Tsumiki no Ie and Madoka. And trust me, I know all about needing to see Madoka... too much anime too little time.

We have similar tastes... although *Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku* seems low to me...I'd give it a 8, I really liked it... but I remember watching it back when it first came out in 99.
>> ARTICLE
I really dislike torture and the first half of Now and Then, Here and There is pretty much that... torture.

Tsumiki no Ie is only 12 min long. You can find it on youtube! Heck I'll just send you a pm of the thing. For me it proves that you don't need 300+ episodes to cause a powerful emotion.
>> ARTICLE
I hear ya... It has *Shawshank Redemption* feel for me. Can't break his spirit.. you know. 

Thanks for that link too, I'll watch after class tonight. 
>> ARTICLE
It's slow to start (only picks up after 12 or so episodes), but many regard it as one of the best animes of all time. It consistently makes top 10 on a lot of lists, and it has an average rating of 9.2 on MAL (for what it's worth). I personally think it's a bit overrated, but it's still an excellent show. 
>> ARTICLE
I also see it was originally a VN. The only other VN I've read is Fate/stay night, and the anime (UBW) operates under the assumption of the audience having read the VN. Is Steins;Gate anime similar in this respect?
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to read the VN to understand the anime - the anime is an adaptation of the VN. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I'll check it out then. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Which of these world lines will zero be set in, pretty sure it was one of the beta world lines but does anyone know which one in particular?
>> ARTICLE
I think the one where Okabe kills Kurisu so the second one.
>> ARTICLE
Knowing Steins;Gate, it will be set in most of them.
>> ARTICLE
Well, given the Gamma world line was unexplored in the main Anime, and it's divergence factor is zero, I'm guessing Stein's Gate Zero will explore the Ferris Ending.
>> ARTICLE
Does not explain why Suzuha exists in the omega line, nor why she has, the attractor field reading device. Or At least there's this giant black part for me that doesn't load.

Also absent are the time lines 2.XXX (Okabe takes over the Committee of 300) and 3.XXX which I can't recall either way they're both drama CD stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Oh the irony, the only timeline that everything lives is where the IBM is never found, thus meaning time machine isn't necessarily discovered. 

However it is a bit confusing as it seems based on the last episode Kurisu will eventually discover time machine? 

Or was that in another world line? ;). I love Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Saving for future reference, thank you very much. The time will come where I will meet newly confused Steins;Gate fans who will be in dire need of this timeline.
>> ARTICLE
Be sure to save the newest version of the picture!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, thanks, I saved the whole thread.
>> ARTICLE
So why exactly is it tagged NSFW?
>> ARTICLE
For Spoilers
>> ARTICLE
NSFW on this sub means spoilers inside. It prevents the thumbnail from spoiling anything. In this case you wouldn't be able to tell much but in same cases you can so it's better to hide all of it.
>> ARTICLE
Because of the spoilers 
>> ARTICLE
"Suziha"... "INB"... VN Daru with anime version of everyone else...

OP pls
>> ARTICLE
Check out the updated version in my comment. The one you saw is 5 versions behind.
>> ARTICLE
Aw, gamma is missing...
>> ARTICLE
You're absolutely free to add it yourself!
>> ARTICLE
I wish I had the skills to do so ;)
>> ARTICLE
Which of these timelines will the new Steins;Gate be? Also, what's the difference between the Attractor Fields above Steins;Gate and the ones below it?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "In the timelines below SERN creates the time machine at the end enslaving mankind while in the timelines above (the beta field) WWIII starts leading to Suzuha traveling back to 1975. In the 3rd field (gamma, not shown in this chart) SERN creates the time machine and enslaves mankind, but Okabe does not die, he works with SERN and becomes the ruler of japan.")
>> ARTICLE
Wow Okabe becomes ruler of Japan? Talk about evil scientist. Are most of these from the VN?
>> ARTICLE
The gamma one is not from the VN. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you really just spoil the exact thing that the person before you made sure to mark as a spoiler?  Lol shit man I mean I don't really care because I'm not gonna play the VN but jeeze
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think that the spoiler tag is needed since there is already a spoiler tag in the title. So it's quite obvious you are in spoiler territory.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a very good point, one I don't take into consideration.  You have one this round
>> ARTICLE
The VN is basically the same as the anime except with more detail and  extra branches for the Suzuha, Faris, Ruka, Mayuri, and Kurisu endings. The anime adapted the true route which is the same as the Kurisu route [anime spoilers](/s "but it adds the post-credit phone call from Suzuha.")

The gamma world line is from the drama CDs.
>> ARTICLE
Also, I saw that Okabe and Mayuri become a couple? I don't recall that or was it in the VN only?
>> ARTICLE
this contains a lot of VN spoilers

the anime cut away tonnes of details as expected
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think that the spoiler tag is needed since there is already a spoiler tag in the title. So it's quite obvious you are in spoiler territory.
>> ARTICLE
Theoretically, when arriving in the Mayuri route in the VN, checking the random noise D-Mail will result in unlocking the true route, don't you think?
>> ARTICLE
[VN spoilers](/s "No, because you have given up on saving Kurisu.")
>> ARTICLE
True. But if so, then that D-Mail wouldn't exist.
>> ARTICLE
If only I could get into Steins gate, I've tried 5 times to watch it :.(
>> ARTICLE
If you don't watch it tonight I will throw a banana at you!
>> ARTICLE
Idk its really borring for me
>> ARTICLE
I mean if you've tried 5 times then you might as well just blast through the first twelve episodes with 2x play speed lol.
>> ARTICLE
Lol what wesite lets you speed up the video?
>> ARTICLE
Youtube, but I was mostly referring to video playback programs like media player classic. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah so you download it?
>> ARTICLE
That is what I'm implying.
>> ARTICLE
It's worth it. You just have to trust me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Inmight start again. I am on episode 8..
>> ARTICLE
The thing is. This is one of those shows that's best watched in one sitting. I started re-watching it today and I'm almost done with it. The amount of foreshadowing and stuff i missed is outstanding.
>> ARTICLE
AD 2025... Human is dead, match. 
>> ARTICLE
What is a legitimate way to watch Steins;Gate?
>> ARTICLE
Normally. From episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to watch Chaos Head before I watch Steins Gate? It's been on my watch list forever but I'm lazy.. 
>> ARTICLE
No. I haven't watched it myself but from what I've heard C;H is a rather bad anime and they are not related almost at all. (Few minor characters make an appearance as side characters but it's insignificant.)
>> ARTICLE
I've never played the VN, but why is in the Attractor Field Beta - World Line #2, Kirisu dies, but there is also a Kirisu ending. I don't mind VN spoilers. 
>> ARTICLE
Late answer, but it's because the Kurisu "route" is just a cut-off version of the true route, ending after Okabe jumps to the Beta attractor field but before Suzuha arrives from the WWIII future. So Kirisu is the obvious romantic interest, but it ends in a world line where she's dead.
>> ARTICLE
Holy hell that looks like it must've been a pain in the ass to do...Good job.
>> ARTICLE
Only took me about 10-12H. If you think this one was hard to do just remember [my last guessing game](http://i.imgur.com/PtPLeyH.png) That thing took me about 40+H to make and barely anyone saw it. If you want to try and solve it [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2zyz0p/anime_guessing_game_3_bad_hair_day/) the post with most of the things already answered.

Whoa, why is F7 special? 
>> ARTICLE
Name everyone and figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Lol
>> ARTICLE
Well... that is the only way to solve the puzzle...
>> ARTICLE
I know haha that just sounds impossibru.  I got a couple from Eureka, a couple from Ghost in the Shell, the wolf girl from that Gibli flick, and I think a few Bleach ones.  I couldn't imagine solving the whole thing though
>> ARTICLE
Would it help if I told you I watched 94% of those and that they are on [my list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/TwistedBOLT&show=0&order=4)?
>> ARTICLE
hmmmm only ones I can think of are [I2](/s "Ergo Proxy - Daedulus") [D3](/s "Sena Bleach Memories of Nobody?") [E5](/s "actually no idea but reminds me of Ghibli somehow")
>> ARTICLE
1) Deadulus... Seriously... well you're close I can tell you that much.

2)... HOW THE FUCASGFILQO WJO F AWRPM XAGFKS  did you get it??!?!

3) Yup.


>> ARTICLE
>1) Deadulus... Seriously... well you're close I can tell you that much. 

........Oh son of a bitch why did I think it was Daedalus when I first saw that. It's clearly [](/s "Vincent fucking Law")........god I need to sleep.

2) Eh? I thought that one was pretty obvious.

3) [](/s "Ashitaka?")
>> ARTICLE
I've never really understood the divergence numbers. I understand that, at least in the story, the further they are from 1, the worse shit gets. Things go down, and so much changes from the original timeline.

But why is Steins;Gate 1.048596? What would, theoretically, a perfect 1 be?
>> ARTICLE
Because math reasons?
>> ARTICLE
Niceuuu
>> ARTICLE
I found Steins Gate to be super underwhelming... am I alone in this? The hype was not there
>> ARTICLE
You missed the worldline where SERN is called CERN :(
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that liked the first couple episodes a lot?  All the obvious time travel antics going on in the background of the first episode reeeally got my interest, that was a good hook IMO.
>> ARTICLE
No, I really enjoyed the first few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked the first episode.  I feel like it was episodes 2-5 that were slow to me.  The part where it seemed to be just random experiments and stuff.  It was still enjoyable, but definitely a bit of a slow period.
>> ARTICLE
Im with you. I was hook in the 1st episode cause it was funny as hell and interesting. I don't get why people give up right away. I mean i know it take longer for the plot to start but still.
>> ARTICLE
The first couple of episodes were quite interesting to me, it was a buildup to the back drop and the setting of the anime, I must say I was really interested because it gave off a really original atmosphere.  
When the story progresses with the completion of the microwave, and the show just turns into a monster - keeping you on edge continuously.    
I remember I stayed up till 6 am in the morning because I simply could not stop watching....   
The show captivated me like no other and the emotions it elicited in me - the suspense,  the love,  the desolation,  the blunt hilarity and also much kawii!     
Beautiful.  
Simply unique.
>> ARTICLE
first episode sold me
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem was people (myself included) started to get frustrated not knowing what direction the show was going for so many episode. All this about time traveling... What's the point? Sure there were a lot of random antics to flesh out the characters, but it took more than 1/3 of the series to set up. Of course, this was one massive climb before going down the proverbial roller coaster which made it so worth it to trudge through the first episodes. However, 10+ episodes is a lot to ask of an audience to sit through before the turning point and The humor before that wasn't all that appealing to a lot of people.

People came in for a sci fi thriller, but got some quirky harem with strange gelnanas for the beginning. This is probably due to the one girl one episode format they took after the initial exposition.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, was hooked after the 2nd ep 
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I actually thought it was better than some of the stuff that came after it (although in general the second half is...how do you out this delicately...stroke-inducing in its sheer badassery). But I loved the beginning and I always have this nagging suspicion that most of the dislike is due to the Internet's short attention span
>> ARTICLE
I fucking loved the first couple episodes. In fact, on my rewatch, I enjoyed the first half the most. The second half lost a lot of its impact because I already knew what was going to happen (though the romance still hit me pretty hard).
>> ARTICLE
Right there with you.  I was hooked pretty much from the start...it just got better and better as it went along.
>> ARTICLE
you're  not alone, I totally feel you. I don't understand the common opinion that it starts slow; I thought the first couple episodes had a really frantic, mysterious vibe that drew me in immediately.
>> ARTICLE
all of the characters, in the first episode, seem to be caricatures instead of characters. that was what left me a little cold. yet, the hype and most of the rest of the elements led me on, and it was madly worth it. where i'll give any anime three episodes to hook me, stein's;gate had me by the end of episode two.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that the common opinion stems from the hype the show has. Everywhere it is mentioned as "THE anime" and "om u gonna cri evritime" etc etc, so when new watchers go in they get a couple of really slow-paced episodes first off, while they were expecting action-romance-epic-thriller-combo since the first minute. 
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree. I even enjoyed the lecture kurisu gave. (or did that only happen in the VN?) 
>> ARTICLE
i'm pretty sure i remember her lecture in episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
She gave her lecture, Im not sure Episode 1, but when she does give its its severely cut down from the VN. Its pretty long winded in the VN, wouldn't really fit nicely in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you made the mistake of watching without drinking Dr. Pepper and wearing a lab coat, you are going to have to re-watch for the FULL experience.

>> ARTICLE
Starting to practice right now. This needs to happen. 
>> ARTICLE
Do it. It's SO COOL! 
>> ARTICLE
sunuvabitch!
>> ARTICLE
For the majority of the first half I kept saying "Well this is good and all but I don't see why this is as highly lauded as it is" and boy did I find out. Definitely a show that did not dissapoint in the slightest. If only I could say the same about Clannad...
>> ARTICLE
I thought the first half was great. I really enjoyed listening to the theories and thinking about it. The second half was a lot less thinking and a lot more scrambling to play the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
A popularity contest ran about a week ago to find the favorite anime of /r/anime.  Simple 1 on 1 single elimination tournament format.  Steins;gate won.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't do the show justice but if you want some more of steins;gate check out the OVA

Erm...Some people consider that OVA to be completely necessary to the plot, unless you're talking about something else.. I'd argue that it does do the show justice.

There is the OVA and the movie...you should go check them out ;)

I wouldn't bother with the movie, it reminded me of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, but not as good.

I still liked it. IMO it's definitely worth a watch. It's not like the movie is astronomically terrible by any means...it also has a twist that ties in pretty cleverly to something brought up in the anime, which I liked :)

It's not a bad movie, I just feel like it had a lot to live up to, and it fell short.

You don't have to watch the movie. It neither adds nor does it hurt anything in the show. The OVA added more to the characters then the movie.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why it is that anime has such a hard problem with hooks within the first 6 or so episodes. My rule of thumb is to give an anime 10 episodes if I'm not absolutely hating it.

Same here man, I gave up after about 3 episodes but checked it out again after everyone was raving about it, and I agree it was entertaining on every level.
>> ARTICLE
Did the exact same. Watched 3 and didn't get into it then saw people raving about it. I think it may have my favorite ending of any show. So perfect.
>> ARTICLE
The show was amazing, but the single moment that cemented this as one of my favorite anime of all time was Karisu's Xzibit meme reference.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that was a reference added in localization/by the fansubber, to replace the original reference to a 2channel meme.
>> ARTICLE
Did the same thing. Got to episode 5 or 6 and stopped. I hated the main character. Someone urged me to watch one more episode. And, I recently went to Kawaii Kon as Hououin Kyouma. One of my all time favorite anime.

>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, the first few episodes are good, it just wasn't that compelling the first time i gave it a try. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat with you there. I think my time from dropping to starting it back up was about 7 months.

Ehhhhhhhhhhhh, I literally just finished it yesterday. After dropping it a few months ago. After 2nd episode. And my reaction was exactly same as yours. Damn.

I personally felt the first 16 or so episodes were painfully slow.  Granted, I'm not one that enjoys time travel or time alteration too much.  Granted, the ending 6 or 7 episodes really spared a terrible show, in my opinion.

The movie really doesn't close it out, either.  Granted, I'm sure that's simply added fluff, but I do rate the final fourth of the series a 10/10, with the initial 3/4 of the show being no more than a 5.
>> ARTICLE
Ok.
>> ARTICLE
First 16? Shit really hit the fan and started the roller coaster at episode 12.
>> ARTICLE
Granted.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it. Didn't like, sorry.
If I am being honest, the first few episodes were the best, cause that actually got me hooked.
But then the series proceeded to follow up with gaping plotholes etc.
And I am just a S;G hater /kappa.

Inbe4 someone is trying to tell me that I just did not understand it and it is a great story for people who can understand it, wat?
Ergo Proxy does that way better anyway ;w;

There's a [Steins;Gate Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu) that aired earlier this year.  It's supposed to be subbed next month.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any chance of it being dubbed in English? One of the best dubbed anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Wow really? Now I'm exited haha. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The movie is going to be a Part 2, I think. So it won't be one of those summery-of-all-episodes movies.
>> ARTICLE
I just read the plot of it and it looks extrememly good to say the least.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished steins gate as well after being told how awesome it was multiple times and man it blew my mind! I'm so excited for the movie now!
>> ARTICLE
the OVA gives closure. The Movie looks kinda like a cash ploy to me.
>> ARTICLE
actually the movie was pretty good 
>> ARTICLE
From the preview I saw, it looked like they jumped ship on their Time travel theory to Destruction resolution hypothesis, whereas an object causing a temporal paradox is simply removed from the timeline, which is in conflict with the original content's basis on Temporal Modification Negation Theory. Not that i'm saying that specifically would make the story bad, but am I right?
>> ARTICLE
I honestly though that too, but [Minor Spoiler](/s "it isn't about paradoxes but it digs deeper into the idea of world lines") I don't want to give anything else away but it was a nice addition overall. It isn't better than the series but it definitely lives up to the steins;gate title.
>> ARTICLE
I know it was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
I actually started watching this show the other day, just finished the seventh episode. The pacing and acting are very well done; the show is constantly either building suspense or getting you more attached to the characters. The soundtrack is incredibly fitting so far as well. 

I'm pretty sure the entire reason I didn't watch it sooner is I saw it described as "People standing around having boring conversations about texts and microwaves" rather than "Mad science, time travel-induced paranoia and tutturu!"
>> ARTICLE
It's refreshing seeing someone who seems to agree with me that the first half of S;G is very good as well. Whenever people bash on the show they go straight for the beginning episodes and it annoys me because they are actually quite good.
>> ARTICLE
huh, I honestly don't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy the beginning of the show. I mean, the first episode is a crazy, almost hallucinatory timeline-shifting haze of cool things going on; if that doesn't draw you in, I don't know what would.

Plus, the part everyone seems to agree it gets 'good' is episode 12. I'm only up to episode thirteen, but it seems pretty clear to me that the Amazing Episode Twelve wouldn't have had nearly as much impact on viewers if the first half of the show hadn't been spent slowly building up a sense of background paranoia and getting viewers to care about the core group of characters.

(sidenote: I'm pissed about Mayushii, Kurisu clearly got saved from death in the first episode how come the permadeath rule doesn't apply to her jerk self?! fuck you Steins;Gate)
>> ARTICLE
Agree with you as well. For me the beginning was well done just as they performed it. The first episode was perfect, the transition to the second episode was smooth and nice, but still confusing enough to make you wonder "What happened in EP1?" The characters were introduced slowly enough so you could get to know them -what increased the surprise when you learn more about your "already well known characters" later. *cough* Shop-owner *cough*
I might be just a little fanboy. Still I love the beginning's pace and story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm stoked you enjoyed it so much :) Most my friends steer away from heavily recommended media (afraid of hype?) but people say stuff is good for a reason.

To answer your question ~ have you thought about the Visual Novel it's based off? It's going to be released in NA soon so you can discover all alternate endings for yourself.

Indeed, but it does refer to a [real 'event'/'occurrence'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) which is similar to that in the show.

^^also, I hope you don't mind me [linking to one of your comments here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1qkvg0/what_are_some_anime_that_you_dont_just_get_all/cddzub4?context=3)

I know it's a real event because *I actually remember it happening*. I actually saw the *original* John Titor posts.

After the OVA there is a movie that already aired in Japan called Steins;Gate: The Burden of Deja Vu (or something like that). It takes place 1 year after the events of Steins;Gate and apparently shit hits the fan. Its gotten pretty good reviews. You wont find anything beyond besides camrips right now but the Blu-rays come out in December so we got that to look forward to.

If you want more you can always check out the Steins;Gate visual novel which the anime is based on. The anime did a great job adapting the material but there were somethings that they just couldn't fit in so if you want more now then that's what you should check out. After that there is Chaos;Head and Robotics;Notes, which are very loosely connected to Steins;Gate. Unfortunately their anime adaptations are 'meh', nothing as good as Steins;Gate. But the VN's those anime are adapted from are very highly regarded.
>> ARTICLE
I did the same a couple weeks ago. Holy crap it's a masterpiece, I was blown away. There are times when the popular opinion is shit, but this is not one of them. It's ranked #2 on MAL for a reason, and it deserves it.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching it in less than 2 days, I basically pulled an all nighter to finish it after hitting episode 11. Easily one of the best animes I've ever watched, the plot, characters and storyline are fantastic, and the questions you have are all answered in the last 2 episodes. 

One thing I really liked was that unlike a lot of animes, it actually seemed to have some real basis for the science in the show as well, it explored real theories and ideas. Most of it was probably complete BS, but it really makes you stop and think about the limits of technology, which I've never found another futuristic anime that does that to any level that Stein's Gate did.

 [](/s "Oh, and you find out who John Titor is later on.")
>> ARTICLE
Well said. I've yet to watch an anime quite as good as this one to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
A good thing to note, when watching, is that the story adheres to Temporal Modification Negation Theory quite rigorously.
>> ARTICLE
Could you explain something for me then?

I didn't understand the concept of 'fixed events', like Mayuri's death. In the anime certain things *had to happen* no matter what, regardless of *how* they happened.

This makes little sense to me. A human being is just a collection of atoms that have ended up behaving like a biological machine/computer of sorts. How on earth could the fundamental workings of space and time be attached to something so insignificant? It seems like from an objective point of view Mayuri's different deaths were events entirely different from each other. Why would the fundamental workings of space and time bend to make sure a 'similar' thing happens to an arbitrary piece of carbon no matter what?

I loved Steins;Gate, but I personally filed its explanation of time travel and fate under deliberate suspension of disbelief. I accepted it as interesting and cool for the sake of the anime, but not plausible in any way. 

Many people talk like it was a good enough description of how time works that it 'could' be the case. Perhaps you can explain a bit more about the theory you mentioned, and why it's a bit more plausible than I would think?
>> ARTICLE
Ok, this is a result of causality... Why did he need to go back in time? To save Mayuri... well once he saved Mayuri, he wouldn't have needed to go back in time, thus creating a paradox in which he had no reason to go back in time now... so he couldn't have gone back to save Mayuri... And under the theory, the universe abhors a paradox... so it makes changes to itself to remove the paradox... so If Mayuri could not be saved, no matter what, he would always need a reason to go back in time, thus there is no Paradox... The idea is that if the Universe needs to have continuity, so the two scenarios that most fiction use to fix the problem is that either the Universe slightly steps sideways to solve the problem, or that the Universe just removes all traces of that problem (i.e. the person would never have been born to cause the paradox and the universe just rearranges itself accordingly).  
The methods of time travel are fictionalized... some of the psudo-science is real. Like time is effected by gravitational time dilation... In which that gravity causes time to slow. This is a known effect that has been seen in space shuttles and GPS satellites. Because they are further away from earth, the gravitational pull on them is less and their clocks become slightly out of sync with earth. This is also explained in the theory of relativity in that Time would slow down as you approach light speed, because as energy and mass is the same thing effectively, increasing the kenetic energy of an object towards light speed causes the mass of an object to become nearly infinite (i'm not good at explaining this -- but the point is that something with more mass has more gravitational pull, thus time becomes dilated).  
So to bring this back to the show, They use the LHC to create a black hole (which has tons of gravitational pull) to create an event they can use to travel through time (which isn't exactly how time dilation works, but whatever)...
>> ARTICLE
Also to be noted about the Paradox here is that You can't change events that you are aware of. To do so would mean that there is no reason you would be aware of them... and that creates the paradox... You can, however, cause changes incidentally (i.e. by not knowing the outcome of your actions) -- Doctor who likes to use this one in it's stories a lot as a means of adding some finality to the actions that occur in the show.  
Edit: Another thing to note, to your original concern about how humans are just physical parts to the universe and how can the universe need to be so effected by a person's effects on time... there is the Summerville's Timeline Theory that relies on the conservation of mass as a principle and when somebody travels to the past, they become made up of material from that time in the universe... and thus are can effect the universe in any way without creating a paradox... because they become part of the 'present' ... Steins;gate doesn't use this though.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a ton for explaining this for me, I think I understand a lot better now how that was all supposed to work!

But this couldn't be the basis for the fixed points in Steins;Gate, could it? If that's how it works then why didn't the d-mails become 'fixed points'? Wouldn't, say, changing Fayris' past actions to save her dad create a paradox too? Why was saving Mayuri paradox causing but not saving Fayris' dad?

And also, this doesn't seem to fit the Mayuri situation. Why would Okabe's actions risk causing a paradox? Because of his reset Mayuri would no longer need saving, so it wouldn't matter that he'd no longer have a reason to go back in time, right? 

This is bending my brain lol. Let's say he 'resets' to save Mayuri. Then he succeeds. Time carries on from there. When does the paradox occur? 
>> ARTICLE
You are right... the didn't play it straight on the Miyuri solution... but they did for the Karisu solution. They try to retcon this problem by saying that the main character is exempt from the cognitive dissidence caused by the changes. And that the reason he couldn't save Miyuri wasn't that he wouldn't remember his reason for going to the past, but that he wouldn't have considered to go back in the past to make sure that his changes stuck. AND that creates the paradox... Which in the Karisu solution, the older Protagonist fully understands... and that's why it works.  
Under normal circumstances, it's believed that the Time Traveler would alter their memories when they change their history... That's not a problem in this story for some reason (creative license)
>> ARTICLE
Okay, still confusing but clearer. Thanks a bunch, really appreciate the effort!
>> ARTICLE
That's kinda what I liked about Steins;gate ... that it was so complex... I'm currently watching 'Noein' and it's rather complex in it's own regard as far as I can tell... only a few episodes in, but from what I gather... There are 3 versions of the Main character... one in the present, and two versions of his future that travel back in time. It's kinda a macro analogy of Superposition.

Just a question, have you read the Steins;Gate visual novel? It goes much more in depth into its theories than the anime does.

if you enjoy Visual Novels the Vn it is based on is being translated by jast I think.

I have already pre-ordered from J-List for a collectors edition with the box, the art book and some Future gadget Lab Member badges. 

It lets you see the story from each of the girls endings and the 'true' ending which the Anime shows requires two playthroughs. 

Pretty neat package and due winter sometime.

I think Stein's Gate might be telling us something about the real John Titor. Like he might be an American living in Tokyo. I am Mad Scientist! S.O.B.!
>> ARTICLE
The things that I love are the little details that I missed the first time round, or forgot it by the time it mattered in the story like [Ruins the end](/s "at the start when okabe first meets kurisu she talks to him as though she met him before was because she spoke to the future him and the fuzzy message he got on his phone at the start was the message he later watches after he fails saving kurisu the first time.") also if you are watching it dubbed the subbed is so much better, I usually prefer dubbed but the voice acting is just perfect for the sub.

You have every possible reality, those are called world lines. Now many world lines, share some points in time, right? There are multiple world lines in which ,let's say, you become a lawyer, even though they have many differences. So you being a lawyer is a constant for all those world lines. Now if you take all the world lines that go through that constant, and group them together, you have an attractor field, let's call it Alpha attractor field, and imagine that there is a Beta attractor field, in which you become a doctor. 

Now there are points in time, in which you still haven't decided what you want to be, that point is somewhere where the alpha and beta attractor fields are still one. So if you are in the alpha world line, and you could send an e-mail to yourself, in the past, before the attractor fields split, and said "become a doctor", that would take you from the alpha to the beta attractor field.

That's basically what happened in Steins;Gate. They were in the alpha attractor field, where the constant is Mayuri dying, and they were so deep in it, that they couldn't escape it with small jumps to the past, they had to change it drastically. But that took them in the beta attractor field, where the constant is Kurisu dying. 

I'm not sure exactly how they managed to jump from the alpha attractor field, to one where both kurisu and mayuri stay alive, but I think the whole sci-fi logic is kinda flimsy and falls apart if you think too much about it 
>> ARTICLE
He tricked the world.  Instead of Kurisu dying, he knocked her unconcious with the taser and used his own blood to fake hers.  Thus, the major event bore some similarity to the attractor field key event (Kurisu looks like she's dead) and Okabe managed to also change minor details that averted the nuclear war - like changing the metal upa out for a plastic one.  The plastic upa doesn't set off the metal detector, so Kurisu's paper stays in her father's suitcase and burns up along with the other luggage.

>> ARTICLE
So they didn't really move to a different attractor field, they went through a world line that just slightly misses the constants of the beta attractor field, but not enough to be a part of a different attractor field
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, somewhere ( vn maybe? ) it is stated that the Steins;Gate worldline is "perfect" because it's "beetween" the Alpha and Beta attractor fields, taking the good things from both worlds. A world created by Future Okabe and Present Okabe together. Also 1.048596% divergence is the closest divergence to 1%, where the attractor fields split.
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate isn't real.  He didn't know about it in advance, he just made up all that mad scientist bullshit to stop Mayuri from thinking she could somehow follow her grandmother to heaven (something along those lines).  Steins;gate was one of the things he made up as this great big invisible force that was pushing him around.

The problem is, shit got realer than real.  And years in the future, a broken man haunted by his failures and the deaths of his friends, he finally succeeds in inventing a true working time machine to give Suzuha (his best friend's daughter) a shot at convincing his past self to change things for the better.  And to convince himself, he dons his Hoouin Kyouma persona one last time and sends a video mail to his old number.  He gives the operation a clever name (skuld) and christens the unknown goal "steins gate", a name that his past self will recognize as a loaded term: both one that aligns with his chuunibyou delusions, and one that he knows, underneath it all, is just something he made up.  It convinces his past self that he is the real deal.

>> ARTICLE
Every one of his mannerisms is just performed out of whimsy. "the will of steins gate" doesn't mean anything initially, but that is the name he gives to the "perfect" world line (divergence number 1.048596). If you listen to the [cellphone scene (potato quality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQYg4Pn2gk) you can hear okabe explain why.

Future okabe:"the target world line's charming little nickname comes care of me as well, which is to say it comes from you. Care to guess its significance?"

Present okabe: "There's none"

Future okabe: "bingo, there's none."

Aaaaaah they ruined it in the dub! D:

They're supposed to say it together.
>> ARTICLE
The original cast is probably one of the best that i've heard, i have no idea why someone would choose dub over sub for Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
The dubbed version was actually pretty fantastic. I love both versions and I think one can definitely get the full experience with the dub. They managed to capture Okabe's quirkiness perfectly without simply being a derivative of the Japanese version.
>> ARTICLE
Or any anime usually...
>> ARTICLE
Anything with Steve Blum i'll at least try the dub.  
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I generally prefer dubs to subs just because I end up focusing too much on the subtitles otherwise. That being said, the English cast was one of the best I've ever heard, right up there with Bebop and Code Geass. Just opinions though.
>> ARTICLE
Have you ever watched Death Note Dubbed. That's up there with Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I accidentally watched part of the movie in the dub, and it wasn't bad, but i just prefer the subs, and i don't have trouble reading subs, but i can understand why someone would dislike them for that reason.

It kinda sucks that they are forced to change one of the best scenes by changing the language, though (i am mad scientist, so cool).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah both the original and dub cast for Steins;Gate were great, except Mayuri's English dub which was horrible. Mamoru Miyano and J. Michael Tatum both make excellent Okabes, regardless of the language.
>> ARTICLE
There's a part in the true ending (WW3) where Okabe watches the video from his future self.  They both synchronize on the point of "why it's called Steins;Gate" and that it's "because it doesn't mean anything".  Steins Gate is originally just part of his fantasy like the Organization until he uses the name again for something concrete.

Also, the visual novel is awesome.  You should totally sink 25 hours into it and see all of the alternate endings for each girl[*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsYUa3JJwI).  The anime follows along pretty closely but I found it more enjoyable than the anime.  Mostly because I could fast forward through Okabe's bouts of chuunibyou, but still.
>> ARTICLE
[I had drawn up](http://i.imgur.com/99RsIFk.jpg) all the world lines and how they connected together after I re-watched Steins;Gate a few months ago. Your conclusion may be that I thought it was a clusterfuck.

I was supposed to create a proper image out of that but never got round to it.

I promise it all makes sense!

I actually glossed a little over the saving Mayuri and Suzuha's D-mail part.

There were a couple of questions which were still unclear to me when I made the above drawing:

* He goes from the Alpha timeline to the Beta timeline by erasing data from SERN. This was necessary because the Alpha timeline occured because of the very first D-Mail sent (which was intercepted by SERN presumably). However, it is not clear to me why deleting the data was enough. Wasn't it deleted loooong after Kurisu should have died in the Beta timeline?

* Why does Suzuha think Kurisu is the enemy? In the Beta timeline Kurisu is dead so she shouldn't know her. Suzuha is from the Beta timeline. Or actually is the Suzuha we see really from the Alpha timeline???

>He goes from the Alpha timeline to the Beta timeline by erasing data from SERN.

However, it is not clear to me why deleting the data was enough. Wasn't it deleted loooong after Kurisu should have died in the Beta timeline?

This is the hand-waving timey-wimey-brain-ow section.  My best guess on this one is a lot of effect-before-cause assumptions.  Sometime in the future, SERN would see the message in ECHELON and act on it as part of their efforts for time travel.  The effect of this involves altering events beforehand as part of their efforts to the eventual point that we get Suzuha crashing into the Radio Kaikan building.  The first event that leads directly to this entire chain has yet to happen from the sole cause of the D-mail.  By erasing it now, you erase all the events that transpire because of it.  

> Why does Suzuha think Kurisu is the enemy? In the Beta timeline Kurisu is dead so she shouldn't know her. Suzuha is from the Beta timeline. Or actually is the Suzuha we see really from the Alpha timeline???

Assumed evil.  Suzuha knows that Kurisu worked with SERN and is considered the mother of time travel.  However much of that is true doesn't matter, it simply makes her an enemy in Suzuha's eyes.

>> ARTICLE
> Assumed evil. Suzuha knows that Kurisu worked with SERN and is considered the mother of time travel. However much of that is true doesn't matter, it simply makes her an enemy in Suzuha's eyes.

If Suzuha is from the Beta timeline then Kurisu is virtually unknown to everyone because she died at the very start of Steins;Gate before she had published any work at all on time travel. Therefore Suzuha should not even know the name Kurisu. Since SERN stole that work andtherefore would not have left her name be on the paper.
>> ARTICLE
Suzuha is almost certainly from the Alpha worldline's future. For the reasons that you stated (Suzuha would never have known Kurisu)

Furthermore, the fact that when Okarin went back to the beta worldline (by undoing all of his dmails and erasing the ECHELON message) another Suzuha appeared warning of WWIII (which was the future of the BETA worldline where Makise Kurisu had died).

Thus the one we see for the majority of the series is from the Alpha worldline's future, while the one we see at the end trying to reach Steins;Gate is from the Beta worldline's future.
>> ARTICLE
So in the first episode when Okabe catches a glimpse of the time machine and Suzuha did he see the Beta or Alpha worldline's Suzuha?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely the alpha worldline Suzuha, as what that Okabe saw was actually Suzuha and him from the future (after those crazy 3 weeks had passed) coming back to save Kurisu.
>> ARTICLE
It couldn't have been the alpha time line because he was in the beta time line when he saw the time machine. He only went into the alpha time line after he left the building and had sent the very first d-mail.

The time machines don't cross world lines.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I got the world lines mixed up. She was definitely from the beta worldline. FutureOkabe came with her after he had undone his mistakes in the alpha worldline and returned to the beta.

She then came to him and said "Stop WWIII" and so he went back in time in the beta worldline that he had returned to.

The time machine Okabe saw at the start was his future self that had gone through the events of Steins;Gate and Suzuha coming from the beta future.
>> ARTICLE
Got it. I agree with this. So:

* In episode one it was her returning with Okabe from Episode 23 or so. In Episode ~23 (beta world line) she came from the beta world line future. She left with Okabe immediately after.
* In episode two (or something) it was her coming from the future in the alpha world line. So she *did* know about Kurisu (who lived and worked at SERN).

I was slightly confused in thinking that the Suzuha who appeared in episode one was the same as the one who appeared in episode two.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that is what I believe as well.

Yeah, the Suzuhas in each episode were actually different. The one in episode 1 (who came from 23) said that she knew that Okabe "would recognize the time machine".

If she were truly the Suzuha from episode 2, she would already know that Okabe obviously knew that it was a time machine.

This shows that the Suzuha from episode 1 and from episode 2 have to be from two different worldlines, as they have different memories.
>> ARTICLE
That just makes me think of xkcd's movie timeline for Primer. [link](http://xkcd.com/657/)
>> ARTICLE
That's dedication.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did! 

I would recommend you to also watch the ova and the movie. Both help a lot when trying to understand what was actually going on. The Steins;Gate visual novel is optional, but very recommended.
To be honest, I had to watch the anime more than once to completely understand it, so don't worry. The second time I watched it, I found out an alternative, open ending : just watch the anime until episode 22 instead of 25.

Have a great day!
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved it. I have seen the OVA, but I'm waiting for the movie to be dubbed since I've become so endeared to the English characterizations. I'll probably try the VN soon, before I get into any new anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe the movie adds as much as the OVA did in terms of closure.  You're really missing out by forcing yourself to wait - but hopefully Funimation should get on this one right quick so the wait won't be too long.
>> ARTICLE
Did some research, and it looks like Funimation is waiting until the end of this year or the beginning of next to license a dub, since they want to let the movie get as much profit from the Japanese market as possible before doing anything else. So subbed it is!
>> ARTICLE
The japanese characterizations are fantastic too.


>> ARTICLE
The VN has a few alternate bad endings which can be interesting to read.
>> ARTICLE
You should rewatch in japonese just for okabe, its worth.
>> ARTICLE
I'd watch all of it if it was dubbed by okabe trying to speak English 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen all that anime has to offer me. Have I seen it all, or should I read the VN?
>> ARTICLE
To add on to CharlesAdam's comment above, read some of the manga.  It covers the side stories.  Some examples of what it covers:

1. [Boukan no Rebellion](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/steinsgate-boukan-no-rebellion-r1006) (Rebellion of the Missing Ring).  The story of Suzuha in the future.
2. [Onshuu no Brownian Motion](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/steinsgate-onshuu-no-brownian-motion-r3693) (Brownian Motion of Love and Hate).  The story of Suzuha in the past, with Braun and Nae.  _Highly recommended._
3. [Aishin Meizu no Babel] (http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/steinsgate-aishin-meizu-no-babel-r8070) (Babel of the Grieved Maze).  The story from Kurisu's POV.

Also (in this order!):

1. [Heijikyokusen no Epigraph](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/steinsgate-heijikyokusen-no-epigraph-r8585) (Epigraph of the Closed Curve)
2. [Eigou Kaiki no Pandora](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/steinsgate-eigou-kaiki-no-pandora-r10109) (Pandora of Eternal Return) - sequel to Epigraph

These two deal with the beta world line in which Okabe kills Kurisu and doesn't go back a second time.

There's also a drama cd from Mayuri's point of view of the world line where Okabe kills Kurisu, and doesn't go back a second time.  It doesn't follow the same story line as the two series above.
>> ARTICLE
The VN has some interesting alternative endings. It's worth a try if you don't get bored in the first chapters. Well this happens in the Anime too, but VN takes a longer time to read, in exchange has more details and some scenes that don't appear in the anime. 

IMO it's worth it just for the alternative endings.

[This page](http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E6%A9%8B%E7%94%B0%E8%87%B3) says "." The difference being hakaa vs hakkaa
>> ARTICLE
So once he says two **k**s? Which one is the correct one?
>> ARTICLE
hakkaa is the correct version
>> ARTICLE
I hear it now! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
If you are interested, the linguistic term for this is [gemination.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination#Japanese) 

In English this is rare, but it does sometimes occur. Gemination is the difference between 'unaimed' [nemd] (not geminated) vs 'unnamed' [nnemd] (geminated). Or another example would be 'foreigner' (not geminated) vs 'forerunner' (geminated). Try pronouncing them aloud a few times and you can hear that the geminated versions are more 'drawn out'.
>> ARTICLE
Super Hak (, pronounced as it is) is a jargon from 2 channel, a Japanese version of 4chan. It usually implies a wannabe hacker (, pronounced like hac-car in Japanese), and Hak sounds stupid for Japanese people, so Daru corrects it to super hacker for his reference. And Daru uses a lot of other 2 channel jargon too, means he's a resident of 2 channel, a heaven for Otaku (it's @ channel in the show). Actually 2 channel community is like a hybrid of 4chan and Reddit, though 4chan appearance is much more like Futaba Channel. 

Originally Super Hak is an imaginary friend of an anonymous idiot who lost in a comment battle and ran away with "A friend of mine is a Super Hacker who can identify you in 0.0001 sec, ha!" Then nothing happened and others posted like, "When does his Super Hak identity us? lol." 

Besides, being a 2channel resident is regarded as a shame among "ordinary" people in Japan, so Kurisu tries to hide it, that is easily founded by Rintaro and Daru. But I'm a 17-year resident in it and no shame about it. 

2 channel, pronounced as Nichn-nru, shortened as 2chan (Nichn). 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Daru speaks lots of @chan references even in public, Rintaro sometimes. Others not. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
She slips her mouth out when she gets a kind of emotional, means @channel resides deep in her, so I assume she's a heavy user. She could just let it slide if she's a light user and @channel doesn't weigh a lot for her, but she refuses the suspicion with full force, it's a side proof. And she's not a person who uses fashion words, though @channel reference is never fashionable. 

2chan covers everything so many quality/professional people also use it anonymously, like Reddit, Kurisu is maybe that type of person basically but inevitably influenced by its jargon because she likes @channel. 
>> ARTICLE
4chan is the English version of 2chan not the other way around. 
>> ARTICLE
Right. 4chan follows 2chan in a timely manner. Channel 2 on TV has been vacant in Japan, used as an external input for VCR and a game console decades ago. So the name reminds of snow noise, implies something not-public, uncensored, what shouldn't be heard. 2chan is all about that, at least in its early days. 
>> ARTICLE
And 4chan to. 
>> ARTICLE
This seems the most likely explanation given the rest of the 2 channel references in the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I can identify all of 2chan refs in the show, so much actually...
>> ARTICLE
They sounded the same to my gaijin ears too. I've nothing to add other than that my meme subs translated it as "hacker, not hax0r".
>> ARTICLE
I think your sub group secretly visits @channel.
>> ARTICLE
This two word are pronounce not same, in word hakka- there is pause before k sound, haka- say with no pause.So it become ha kka-.In Japan when two same letter is repeat, you say word with pause before repeat letter.Sorry for my poor English.
>> ARTICLE
happy cakeday
>> ARTICLE
One example of dialogue that was fixed in the dub for non-Japanese audiences.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he called him a *hack*, didn't he? One other neat little thing they did in the dub is that everyone pronounces John Titor's name tee-tor, [Episode 15 or something](/s "but Suzuha pronounces it Tie-tor. (Until she hears other people say tee-tor.)")
>> ARTICLE
Woah, that's awesome!
>> ARTICLE
i always thought the joke was that his correction sounded almost similiar because he can't pronounce it himself
>> ARTICLE
Same as when Japanese say most English words they end it way differently than we're used to hearing.

Peanut butter turns into pinaatsu bataa. Or hamburger is hanbaaga.  It's just the accent, that's all. 
>> ARTICLE
But the two words Daru says sound exactly the same, but they are supposed to sound different. I know everyone in every anime pronounces every English word incorrectly, but my problem is that he's saying his personal "correct" pronunciation exactly the same as he pronounced the "wrong" pronunciation just two seconds before.
>> ARTICLE
This is confusing me :D


>> ARTICLE
Well, have you seen the scene in question?

Here's some examples: (And I don't care if this confuses you even more because this was fun to write)

**Example 1: The not weird example**

"Frank, let's meet on *Moonday*!"

"It's pronounced *Monday*."


**Example 2: The slightly weirder example where Frank is wrong**

"Frank, let's meet on *Monday*!"

"Uh, it's pronounced *Moonday*."

**Example 3: Whatever the fuck Steins;Gate did, where they disagree on the pronunciation but say it the same way**

"Frank, let's meet on *Moonday*!"

"It's pronounced *Moonday*!"
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Steins;Gate *yet* but is it like a running gag, right?
>> ARTICLE
It's sort of a running gag.

PS: Watch it right now. Open a new tab, find a way to watch Steins;Gate (wink wink) and just watch Episode 1 right now. After watching Episode 1, watch Episode 2-25. Is there a reason not to just start now? You got 20 minutes, right? Come ooooon! ;)
>> ARTICLE
I-I feel so pressured. I was saving it for a special time.

just know that many people feel it starts off slow but it gets much better and is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
yesterday you said tomorrow, just do it!^(I'm so sorry)
>> ARTICLE
Then it is obviously not **exactly** the same.

The KoiChoco protagonist is always correcting people that he's called Oojima and not Ooshima. The difference is very small for the non-native speaker.
>> ARTICLE
Have you listened to it? I know that they are not exactly the same, I just wanted to know where the difference is. And the difference between Oojima and Ooshima doesn't sound that small.
>> ARTICLE
Believe it or not, they aren't quite the same. Okabe says , which would be rendered in Romaji as 'haka'. Daru corrects him and says , 'hakka' with a small tsu in the middle. That denotes consonant repetition, and you usually pronounce it with a subtle pause. I guess the way Okabe says it makes it sound condescending, like calling someone a script kiddie.

In Japanese, 'kite', 'kiite', and 'kitte' (, , ) are separate words even though they're pronounced very similarly too. It's just how the language is.
>> ARTICLE
Count me in, I was actually wanting to re-watch Steins;Gate with more enjoyment recently, nice timing.
>> ARTICLE
I am also rewatching it because my friend was interested in Anime. We got through the first 5 episodes and luckily he was down with the slice of life-esque feel. I told him to read nothing about the show and just go with it. I can't wait to be able to hear his reactions for the second half of the season.

PEOPLE WHO CLICK ON THE LINK: VOLUME DOWN!!!

I warned you

Why not dubbed? is that not an option?

Funimation only put up the first six episodes dubbed on youtube. We want to stay legal, so thats why.

We allowing spoilers or do they have to be tagged? Gotta think about us first timers :/

Actually, no spoilers probably.

/sp Enter text here should do the trick

As much as I love Steins;Gate, I don't think I can take the first half of it - especially since this time around it will literally be waiting for things to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Ive watched it all twice already. I honestly never get bored of it, but maybe thats cause I also enjoy slice of life anime.
>> ARTICLE
The VN was way more interesting in that regard. It actually explained things in an interesting way that wasn't extremely difficult to understand, and waaay more things made sense. It wasn't just "hey guys time machine is working now"

Also, John Titor is a real person.
look him up.
>> ARTICLE
well, "real".
>> ARTICLE
Haha, yeah yeah.. but it's something that actually happened.
>> ARTICLE
I actually enjoy the first half of steins gate more on my second watch than my first. Everything Suzaha says was more funny to be the second time.
>> ARTICLE
for me after the first 3 ep it got interesting  but i thik thats mainly because of Hououin Kyouma!!! and all of his antics haha

Wasn't this done relatively recently? either way i love reading the reactions of the first time watchers in these threads  

Count me in too!

look out for me then :P i started watching it, im in episode 2, ill wait till wednesday tho

>> ARTICLE
It was?
>> ARTICLE
it was an independent rewatch but it was more than 7+ months ago judging by a post i saw after a quick search  but whatever if u decide to host this rewatch people will come im sure there are plenty of people who need that little push to watch steins;gate 
>> ARTICLE
I didnt know 7 months was a recent span of time

maybe thats just me  if i watch an anime series id think its far faaar too soon to watch it again 6 ish months later  a year seems somewhat short to me too actually (exceptions made for kimi ni todoke and toradora christmas rewatch clubs!)

You could probably throw this up on /a/ the night of and get a good viewership if you're having trouble getting a crowd.

Every night at 8:30 PM starting on Wednesday, we watch an episode of Steins;Gate, and we talk about it during the episode. It's fun!

Nope. Sorry.

It's 11:30am on Thursday if my conversion is correct.

Just curious, what would you say to someone who never watched this anime in order to make them want to watch?

"Do you like theoretical physics? Do you like Sci-fi and time travel? Do you like shows with ACTUAL PLOT and almost no filler? Then Steins;Gate is for you!"
>> ARTICLE
It was sold to me as Theoretical Physics with a Microwave.

Its very well liked by members of /r/anime  reason being it is a scifi thriller involving time travel and the morality of messing with time the consequences that may stem from it the main character is eccentric and and pretty dam funny/entertaining when conversing with other characters (gotta love MCs VA thats some great acting!) and get this... it ENDS  YES it has an actual ending which i believe to be very satisfactory.

I'll watch it then!

Just jumping in here randomly on "Objective" issue #12: Math major, here, and I actually don't think *you* understand what "infinite" means.  And since infinity is one of my favorite topics in Mathematics.... I'm going to post probably way too much about it.  ...sorry. 

As an analogy, there are infinite integers, but that doesn't mean that every possible set of conditions you could impose on an integer must be true for some integer.  For example, just because there are infinite positive integers, that doesn't mean there's a positive integer x such that sqrt(x) > x.  

It's *quite* possible for there to be infinitely many universes and yet not have a universe for every possible set of events.  In fact, it's provable.

You first have to be aware that there's different "sizes" of infinity.  There are infinite integers, and there are infinite real numbers between [0, 1], but there's more* real numbers between [0, 1] than there are integers.  

So imagine that there are as many universes as there are positive integers, and in each universe I have a machine that randomly picks a real number between zero and 1.  (This machine is, of course, magical)   

In the above, I have infinite universes, since there are infinite positive integers... but since there are "more" real numbers, even if no two universes pick the same number, I can't possible have a universe in which every real number is picked.

So, yes, the idea that certain events simply don't happen, despite an infinite set of universes, is quite possible.

----

*Mathematical aside: I'm using terminology like "more" and "sizes", because that's how it essentially works out, and makes most sense, but that's not actually correct terminology.  Correct terminology relates infinite sets and their "cardinality", i.e. the number of elements in a set.  

To show that two infinite sets A, B are the same "size" (have the same cardinality), you need to show that for every element in set A, there is exactly one corresponding element in set B, and vice versa.  To prove that A is "bigger" than B you need to show a that there is an element in A that corresponds to each element in B, but that there is no way to set up a correspondence from A to B.  
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for jumping in, and it's almost a guarantee I *don't* understand infinity, but I'll try to address my concerns as best as possible.

You specify a mathematical reason why a select item from an infinite list wouldn't be able to fit literally any condition, which I understand, and I suppose I'm being a *little* extreme in my verbiage, but my point was that it doesn't appear that there *is* a "reason" why she can't be alive along that timeline. Perhaps more specifically, there *IS* a timeline where she lives, but it's across an arbitrary line. The mathematical analog that you provide would mean that there *is* a circumstance in which there's a positive integer x such that sqrt(x) > x.

So for both of those reasons, I reaffirm my criticism- the show does not offer a sufficient reason why her death is necessary or why it was the sending of the first D-Mail that effectively caused it. There also exists a universe where she lives, which indicates that the model for time travel/infinite universes they use is not one in which events *are* fated to happen, but in which they're fated to happen *under specific and arbitrary circumstances*, which ultimately is still something I have a problem with insofar as it being an unsatisfying explanation from a logical perspective.

To be clear, I think you're right in that "infinite" is still limited by the scope of things that could feasibly happen, but it doesn't make sense why Mayuri couldn't feasibly stay alive.

As I remember (it's been about a year sine I saw the show), the explanation for why she *can't* be alive is attractor fields and convergence points; that her death is just one of the inevitable outcomes of the attractor field on that set of world lines.  The first D-Mail causes it because it pushes them into that attractor field.  

Sure, the show doesn't explain the logic behind exactly what causes attractor fields and what makes Mayuri's death one of its consequences... but I don't really think it needed to.  Explaining it's infinite-universes idea is complex enough, without needing to try to explain the rules that govern those infinite universes.

The *absence* of an explanation is not the proof that there is no explanation.  And this (and many other of your "objective" issues) is a situation where I think attempting an explanation would have made the show worse (more needlessly complex; and likely would raise as many questions as it explained), not better.

And this (and many other of your "objective" issues) is a situation where I think attempting an explanation would have made the show worse (more needlessly complex; and likely would raise as many questions as it explained), not better.

I was having a discussion recently with someone about Legend Of The Galactic Heroes. I posited the point that LotGH was one of the most realistic sci-fi shows I have seen both *despite* and *because of* its decision to not fully explain any of the aspects of faster-than-light interstellar travel.

It never attempts to fully explain how the ships work, how the various space-fortresses work, or how their warp travel works. I think this is a good thing. It would be like trying to properly explain how something that doesn't exist works. Having said that, these things which exist in the show are based on things which have the theoretical potential to exist in reality. But there's a reason why they can't explain those things well, i.e. they do no exist yet, and *may never* exist at all.

The person I was discussing it with said that things like the Gundam universe are more realistic because they attempt to give scientific explanations for the things they show. I take issue with pseudo-scientific explanations in shows. It's one of the more fundamental gripes I have with various science fiction. Attempting to explain things which have the distinct potential to exist, but don't exist yet, or that might never exist, is always something that I find is more likely to damage the narrative of the universe in your story than it is to benefit it.

Rather, I prefer when a show attempts to show a realistic depiction of what human life would be like in a different setting. It might say to you "Here are the things for which you must suspend your disbelief. We're not going to explain the inner workings of these things to you, because (1) it isn't interesting, (2) it doesn't benefit the narrative, and (3) we might not supply a satisfying explanation for it, because it doesn't actually exist." I think that's the best way to do things. I can accept some things in a story's narrative without needing a scientific or mathematical explanation for why those things are caused. A writer can't be expected to explain everything in a time-travel story. That would be ludicrous.

It's like Thor's Hammer... only Thor can lift his hammer. But what if Thor holds it and you raise his arm? Or if the hammer is in zero gravity? What if you grab the strap but not the handle? Is it because it's heavy, magic or else?

It's the little debates like that makes these things fun.

Maybe think of it as a fundamental law of the universe. In other words, sure, maybe we don't understand *why* there can be no other version as shown by the measurement of the attractor line, but were the consequence never to happen, the world would not exist.

As example: There are fundamental rules to our universe. Should one of these rules not exist, our universe simply could not *be*. The physics/math wouldn't work.

I always figured that this event in S;G was akin to such a foundational force.

Some of your objective issues are based around the show not explicitly telling you how something worked, which I can understand but disagree that they are "objective problems" with the show. One way I look at it is this show was all about establishing an emotional ambiance of fear/despair/confusion rather than present a perfect time travel plot, and it would really defeat the purpose to spell some of these points out when they occur. And I personally really dislike shows where the last episode or two becomes a checklist of "this is how X, Y, Z happened." You can certainly argue that the tradeoff of gray areas of storytelling for emotional impact is not a good one, but judging from your comment of crying during the middle of the show I think the show's goal was met fairly well. It is true that the story can seem weak in retrospect, but in my opinion it worked out for the best.

I really like that the show leaves a lot of questions open to interpretation. Concerning SERN, it definitely would not make sense to answer how SERN worked (such as the time stopping point) or what its actual reach was since at no point in the story do the characters learn anything substantial about the organization. I think this is especially true for point 5, where you say that a "throwaway line" would be sufficient to answer this complaint (although in my opinion a line that is a throwaway should go unsaid). But how would anyone in the show even know Kurisu was forced to work with CERN? Perhaps they could have elaborated more on the organization, but SERN was more bogeyman than actual antagonist - suffusing the show with a sense of dread that would not have been possible if more details about it were known. A sense of tension is derived from the unknown, and I prefer the approach of not deconstructing the organization after the climax of the show.

A lot of your points are definitely spot on, but I want to answer a few specifically:

1. Since the first D-mail Okabe sent to Itaru was the one that alerted SERN, it stands to reason that a lot would change as a result. Such as the satellite crash. *EDIT: someone else answered this better

2. I always assumed SERN had a group that just focused on gathering IBN 5100s, and as big a computer collector as Feyris's father was supposed to be, it seems natural to me that they would check him out. But in timelines where he passed it to the shrine they didn't find it. Could be off base here since it has been a while since I've seen it.

3. Sort of addressed this above, but want to also point out that they couldn't have left out the time stopping and acheived the same effect. The purpose of time stopping is simply an emotional device, since there is a major difference in impact between Mayuri just suddenly dying vs KNOWING that she is about to die and being incapable of doing anything about it.

4. Okabe's first D-mail changed the world line from the Alpha to the Beta - these world lines are completely inconsistent with each other, since it is such a major jump between the two, with the exception being that SERN develops time travel in both world lines. Titor's different appearance dates highlight how major the changes are early on for the viewers. In the Alpha worldline John Titor arriving in 2000 has nothing at all to do with Okabe, since he is not involved with time travel. In the Beta worldline SERN still develops time travel, but Okabe is directly linked due to the D-mail and eventual rebellion against SERN so Titor travels to his time instead. I thought this was pretty clear honestly.

5. Addressed above - no one would necessarily know if she was coerced or not, and I prefer having to infer that without the show holding my hand and telling me so.

8. You see this as a problem, but to me this was one of the show's strongest points. Okabe in reality was definitely not a scientist, and during Mayuri's deaths he was certainly not logical. The fact that he was panicking for so long without actually thinking about how to fix the problem (or ask for help doing so) really fit his character well, and honestly is the point where I most sympathized with Okabe. Who would actually respond well/logically under those circumstances?

11. Could be wrong here, but I am fairly sure the show states at some point that if a significant event is changed in the present of any timeline, history will realign with the world line where that event occurs. 

12. Technically, the show is based around a time travel theory of fixed point infinite multiverses - where there is still infinite parallel worlds, but certain key events that cannot be changed distinguish between worlds on certain "branches." But again, this is another case where the emotional setup is more important than science fiction theory.

Subjective Issues:

Completely agree about Itaru.

1. The show takes place over, a week(?) for every character but Okabe. I thought Kurisu grew but yes relative to Okabe everyone was fairly static, which makes sense since he lived through hell basically while everyone else forgets everything that would have made them change.

I liked the ending, but I can understand why you wouldn't. To me it just makes sense that someone now exposed to time travel would not stop until he could figure out a way to save someone he loved, regardless of the consequences. And since the show had already established that you can jump between world lines and change major events, I didn't have a problem with it logically.

TL;DR - Stein's Gate's strength is emotional impact and delivery, which was arguably traded for plot integrity in some ways - but based on my enjoyment of and investment in the show when I watched it, the tradeoff was totally worth it :D.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding #14, I think you may have missed a major point regarding this, one which was one of my favorite parts of the show.

First of all, in episode 1, no one knows anything about the world lines or anything, so no one has any concept of which world line they are currently on, and this is never explicitly stated to the viewer either. 

Now, when Kurisu first meets Okabe in ep1, she asserts that they had already met. Furthermore, you hear Okabe's scream when she is later "stabbed" in ep1. This means that future Okabe was already there in the very beginning. ~~Basically, that means Kurisu *never actually died* in the first episode. (This is rendered moot by the first d-mail he sent right afterward, which then causes a world line shift for the first time in the show)~~ see edit

That means the only world line where Kurisu did die is the one which came about after finally undoing all of his d-mails. This also means that her death is also a result of his time travel shenanigans, and he has an obligation to fix her death as well. This creates a closed loop of causality where all the events that end up kicking off Okabe's trials throughout the show are left in place. They actually end up back where they started, without changing the past.

It's not a matter of tricking Okabe (or reality itself, as you say) into thinking she's dead. The point is to ensure that the events which ultimately caused everything in the show to happen will still happen. I can't think of a better way to phrase that sentence, but there it is. 

Say what you will about the emotional impact of this ending, but it was pulled of quite cleanly for a time travel show. 

EDIT: I just realized I may be wrong about the whole "she never died" thing, because Okabe swaps out the metal oopa in his successful attempt, but Mayuri still gets it at first. This mean that the first episode contains his failed attempt (where he kills Kurisu). The main point is the same, though: In order to change her death and avoid the unfortunate future where she died, he has to change the event without changing the effect it had on himself in the past. 

The effect on him is the important part, not whether she died. Much like Mayuri's death, He would never be able to change her death by directly preventing, since her death is what caused him to get there in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually kind of get why Okabe did that part. Because everything happened when he saw that she died and when he sent a dmail, he transferred to a world line where she is alive I think? Then the events unfold.

But I'm confused, when Okabe tricks his past self that Christina is dead but actually not so that the events would take place, did he do it in a world line where she is supposed to be alive? Or did he somehow transferred to a world line where she is now supposed to be alive?
>> ARTICLE
The world line in the first and second last episodes is the line where Kurisu dies. 

When he was successful in saving Kurisu, he went to a different world line (the "Steins;Gate" line, in fact) after getting back in the time machine to return to his current time, evidenced by the fact that Suzuha disappeared on the way back.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so how is he able to save Christina in that world line where she dies? Shouldn't she die no matter what he tried to do like where he tries to save Mayuri over and over again?
>> ARTICLE
That's the interesting part. After he fails to save her, he assumes this is the case like you said. But his adult self informs him in the video message that he can't change the event (her death) because that same event is what triggered the events of the entire plot and got him to where he is. Completely stopping the event would be breaking causality (even more so than it already is. This is time travel we are talking about...)

But, if he recreates the scene that he witnessed in the past, then past-Okabe's actions from there would be the same, and everything would happen just as it did the first time around. Past-Okabe has to *think* that some girl just got stabbed. It doesn't matter whether she is dead or not, because he will think she is, and he will proceed to send the first d-mail. 

It's similar to Mayuri's case. Presumably the "attractor fields" such as Kurisu's and Mayuri's death are events that, for whatever reason, must happen because of the events that they in turn cause. In Mayuri's case, he simply backtracks to return to a world line where she never did die. In Kurisu's case, he gets around it by slightly altering the event such that the other critical events still occur, but it so happens that she lives.  
>> ARTICLE
I see. So are you saying that her death, or being presumed as dead, is a cause rather than an event? If I'm getting it right, the plot will happen due to Okabe's reaction and not necessarily because Christina lived or died?

I'm seeing it far more clearly now that the world lines have some constants, like for example Mayuri dying, albeit in different ways. So is the events of the plot the one thing constant in the Steins;Gate world line and that the way Christina died or appearing dead is the variable in the world line?

If you look at this [timeline image](https://i.imgur.com/LDlqWQW.jpg) (from the VN) it should clear it up a little.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to try to answer as many issues as I can. To preface this, I'm a huge fan of steins gate and consider it to be one of my all time favorite anime. Score wise I consider it to be somewhere between a strong 8 and a weak 9. I've rewatched the series many times and read the VN. Having said that, it has been a little while since I've seen the series, so I aplogize if I accidentally confuse an event from the VN as something that happened in the series. I believe I have a pretty firm grasp on the distinctions.

Objective Issues:

1. Answered

2. Ferris is kidnapped before her father is rich. Her father isn't exploited into giving up the IBN, he has to sell it in order to raise the ransom money to pay to get Ferris back from the kidnappers. As heavily implied by the series, SERN forms as close to possible of an absolute monopoly over available IBNs. They have agents in place to buy one as soon as it becomes available on the open market.

3. Time doesn't actually stop. Mayuri's watch stops every time, but that's both for symbolism and foreshadowing. There is a sense in which Okabe's time stops (which the series uses a lot of visual imagery to convey). Time itself does not stop.

4. The John Titor that Okabe mentions from 2000 is from the initial world-line where Kurisu dies. Remember all of Okabe's memories are from the original timeline, not the timeline that most of the series takes place on. What he remembers (in the case of Titor) did not actually happen in the world-line he's on.

5. SERN has a complete monopoly of information in Suzuha's time. She has no clue about the specific pasts of Okabe and Kurisu and recall that she never actually met Okabe or Daru to give her the truth. Your supposed to assume that she was kidnapped and forced to work for SERN. I will point out that the future actions of the characters is heavily foreshadowed by their first reactions when Moeka has them at gun point. Kurisu's first response is to do give SERN what they want so no more of her friends get hurt. Okabe's first response is to fight an impossible battle to avenge Mayuri.  This is more than sufficent to explain what happened in the future. In the VN there is something more concrete, but it's really not necessary.

6. Okabe and Daru were terrorists. They're portrayed like heroes in Suzuha's memories because that's how she perceived them, but the general public would view them like we view al qaeda. SERN controls information, so to the media makes Okabe look like the bad guy and most people don't know any better. Also the leading structure of terrorist organizations are often kept secret. While Okabe would be well known, everyone bellow him would be kept as secret as possible. Suzuha doesn't know her father because she likely grew up with her mother in somewhere more safe. By the time she was old enough to join, Daru was dead.
You seem to fundamentally misunderstand how jumping world lines works in Steins Gate. Suzuha couldn't see the divergence numbers changing, because to her they have always been the same in each world line. Okabe is the only person who can see the difference since he's the only one that retains memories between world lines.  Suzuha is unable to notice the differences while they occur. Further her mission is in 1975, she has no reason to reveal herself in 2010 where she's not supposed to make changes.
The time machine isn't use by Daru because he had to invent it first. He didn't finish inventing the time machine until the world has already become a dystopia. He also couldn't even start making one until Okabe and him got away from SERN's prison. It's hard to say why he himself didn't go back in time, but there's plenty of plausible reasons.

7. Steins Gate intentionally throws in a lot of misinformation regarding time travel. A lot of what Suzuha says about time travel (Grandfather Paradox, Butterfly Effect to an extent) is actually wrong. This is done intentionally, as she is not a physicist or anyone who should understand time travel beyond having used the machine. Kurisu is the character that actually knows what she's talking about. In reality steins gates operates on an expanded version of consistent multiple timeline timetravel. The butterfly effect is not as relevant as it is presented to be.

8. This is more of a subjective complaint than objective. Anyway it's not that Okabe couldn't send more D-mails (he could, and did), but each D-mail he sent got him further away from the IBN. It's very reasonable to think that any further D-mail would get you further away, not closer. In any case this was where the series wanted to go thematically, them just fixing it with D-mail would send a much weaker message.

9. All they needed was Daru at the lab to turn the machine on. In the VN they show that's the case, but skipping this for sake of time is really not a big deal.

10. I think there is answer in the VN for this, but i can't recall off the top of my head. This is a fair complaint about the adaptation. A lot of stuff was cut out of Faris' and Moeka's arcs, which can make them a little hard to follow if you're looking at all the details. This still isn't enough to be considered a strong plot hole, more just an oddly unanswered question.

11. This is the biggest problem with the series in terms of logic. It's not entirely clear how deleting SERN's log changed the past, but if you listen the time machine is on while they're doing it. I presume that they're deleting it in such a way that it deletes the entire past entry of the log (It will be like the log never happened even in the past), which then does make sense. If the log didn't happen then Okabe is never captured, this you end up on the other world line. I think this explanation is satisfactory, but if you want to be a stickler, this is probably the only fair plot hole.

12. Remember our characters our working with incomplete knowledge of how time travel works here. Yes, philosophically speaking there should actually be a time-line where Mayuri survives in the time-travel timeline. It's quite possible there is one, and Okabe just never found it. They say it doesn't exist, but that's based on empirical knowledge. Based on the way they later save Kurisu, I would say this is likely the case. The other possibility is that there actaully isn't an infinite number of time-lines and merely a great number. There's a lot of philosophical interpretations of multi-timeline time travel, they could likely find one to fit. In general it's very hard to pick-apart this type of time-travel as inconsistent.

13. The Steins Gate VN had 6 endings. One of those endings (called the Kurisu End) is just the steins gate anime that stops at episode 22. I personally agree with you that thematically that is the best ending. The anime decided to go with the True End, which is the Kurisu End + episode 23 & 24. It's a happy ending, but in the context of the VN it's a happy ending that comes after 5 relatively tragic endings. It fits more there. It's not even that happy of an ending (without episode 25), so I think it's fine. It's weaker thematically, but makes the series romantic element stronger.

14. Refer to my answer to 12 here, I think the best interpretation here is the fatalism of time-travel is not actually true.

15. I believe it's assumed that SERN lost most of it's power during WWIII. Daru only made his time machine after that, so he's working in a very different socio-political climate than in the other timeline.

Subjective Issues

1. I just disagree with most of this complain. I'll give you that really only Okabe developed, but considering most of the show takes place in a time-loop where only he retained memories, it would really be impossible to develop anyone else. The rest of the cast is well fleshed out, especially Kurisu.

2. I mostly agree with you here, the VN aspects are by far the weakest points of steins gate. It's what keeps at a weak 9 at best for me.

3. It wasn't meant to be transphobic (I don't think it came across that way). Ruka is largely used as a comic relief character, so there's not really any room to tackle gender issues in a more serious way. Ruka has her own ending in the VN where her issues are viewed in a more serious light.

4. This is a fair complain, but I think it's handled well. I think it's worth pointing out that Kurisu most likely subconsciously liked Okabe from the beginning, it's the only reason she would have hunted down his lab. I believe Okabe is the person that really needed to warm up to her, which is what happens. They also did have three weeks of time together from Kurisu's perspective, which is enough to convince yourself you've fallen in love (especially for someone who doesn't know what love is like Kurisu).

5. I disagree completely, I found him refreshingly different as a character.

6. I addressed this in prior answers.

7. I wouldn't call it awful. The transition from slice-of-life to thriller has a powerful affect that was really impactful on a lot of people. I personally love the way steins gate is structure, but that is also subjective. I think the fairest statement here is that the pacing isn't perfect, but it is well thought out. The structure they went with doesn't appeal to everybody, but certainly has it's merits.

I hope I this long reply can resolve some of your concerns about the series. It seems like some parts of it just aren't for you, but it also seems like you have some genuine misunderstandings which i hope I helped you with.

I was gonna do something like this, but you did it better than I could on most points. However I would like to add some things about time travel which they actually do go into in both the anime and novel.

Firstly, [John Titor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) was a real phenomenon. Complete hoax, but it was craftily weaved into the plot. More of a tidbit than an addition, but I flipped my shit when I learned that.

Secondly, Time travel. They use the attractor field theory. The theory isn't real, but it instead combines multiple worlds theory and the single timeline theory. There is one timeline, the one that Okabe is on and can percieve via Reading Steiner and all the rest exist like train tracks able to be switched onto. However, the major points of these time lines cannot be avoided (Mayuri's death in WL 0.XXXX Kurisu's death in all but WL 1.04-I can't remember the rest AKA Attractor fields). In fact Okabe and Kurisu have an argument about attractor field theory on the roof because he believes that he will end up killing her if he deletes the data from SERN's database and she argues that she will go on living her life in this timeline (seemingly not believing herself).

Thirdly, why deleting the text information works. SERN had yet to discover the text message since they're tracking all data everywhere, but if you think 3-dimensionally time is simply moving forward to the time of discovery. In fact you'll notice once they delete Moeka's text message Mayuri is no longer killed by the Rounders but by diabolus ex machina.

Fourthly, How Kurisu survives. She is Schrodinger's Cat in this case. She can be viewed as both dead and alive as she has been viewed in both states. She was dead in the first jump back and alive in the second. Past Okabe opens the figurative box and views her as dead. In a sense what they are doing is changing her superposition! It's not optimism or fatalism it's scientific! The fourth dimension very much cares about how something is viewed when it is observed. It's kind of a linch-pin in Quantum Physics.

>> ARTICLE
>  They use the attractor field theory. The theory isn't real, but it instead combines multiple worlds theory and the single timeline theory.

As someone who has studied time travel, the attractor theory is a multiple timeline time travel theory, not a single timeline one. Even if only timeline was to exist at a time, the fact you can just between timelines means it should be understood in the multiple timeline sense.

I roughly said this before, but the attractor field theory is formed empirically by the testing done by Kurisu, Okabe, and Daru; in both the present and the future. It's not meant to be something inflatable, but something that perfectly explains all the evidence they have gathered thus far. For example, if it actually was possible to save Mayuri on that timeline, but extremely unlikely (something like 1 in 10^12 changes her live), it would still seem impossible to our cast (because they didn't try to save her 10^12 times). 

Kurisu is not doubting her own theory when she says that she may live in this timeline when she dies in the one Okabe heads to. She's pointing out that there entire system of understanding time travel is schemed from Okabe's perspective, so they really have no clue if the other timelines continue or not when they make changes. They lack the evidence to understand the full picture.

> Thirdly, why deleting the text information works. SERN had yet to discover the text message since they're tracking all data everywhere, but if you think 3-dimensionally time is simply moving forward to the time of discovery

I'm not quite sure I understand how this is a solution. If they delete the log on the timeline that they are currently on, they have merely changed the present, not the past. There is no reason for them to change timelines at all if they didn't use the time machine. That is the complaint here.

> She is Schrodinger's Cat in this case. She can be viewed as both dead and alive as she has been viewed in both states.

I'll say that I view time travel from a philosophy background, not a physics one. But going from there, there's no reason perspective should matter in time travel. If the world is actually inevitably approach Kurisu's death like it was Mayuri's (fatalism of time), then there should be nothing that can save Kurisu. Her death has nothing to do with how it is observed, it has to happen on that timeline, and not merely look like it happened. That is of course if fatalism is actually right on the steins gate universe, which I don't think it is.

Wow I have no idea where to start. Once again, in real life there is no such thing as attractor field theory. This is something created solely for Steins;Gate. I have never read anything about it and I also read quantum physics and theoretical physics which is the current scientific basis for time travel. If you want to say you've studied time travel that is the pre-requisite, yet you have admitted you do not come from a physics background. What you're talking about is more closely the Many-worlds Interpretation or MWI where all the worlds exist simultaneously, but do not communicate. Their attractor field theory means there is only ever one present all the others do not exist until a shift in divergence. Think an alternate form of the Copenhagen interpretation where instead of parallel worlds being inconsequential after the present is observed they have no consequence until divergence shifts.

>Kurisu is not doubting her own theory when she says that she may live in this timeline when she dies in the one Okabe heads to. She's pointing out that there entire system of understanding time travel is schemed from Okabe's perspective, so they really have no clue if the other timelines continue or not when they make changes. They lack the evidence to understand the full picture.

She uses the MWI to help Okabe press the button heading to the beta world-line, but then and I may be confusing the novel and anime here, she's shown depressed about it as if she's accepted her death.

>I'm not quite sure I understand how this is a solution. If they delete the log on the timeline that they are currently on, they have merely changed the present, not the past. There is no reason for them to change timelines at all if they didn't use the time machine. That is the complaint here.

So let me define some terms here. Alpha world line is the one where Mayuri dies, beta is the one where Okabe originated and lets call date X is where SERN observes the first D-mail and confirms time-travel.

Okabe sends a D-mail to Itaru on the beta world-line and this shifts him to the alpha world line because SERN now has the text-message in their system but they will not observe it until date X, but the fact that it will be observed is now guaranteed. However, as long as you delete the message before Date X it cannot be observed and thus you shift back to the beta world-line where that information is not observed. Now you're probably going to ask, "but why did it change before it was observed?" Think about a glass being pushed off a table unless it is caught and put back on the table the glass will fall and break. It is that very situation just in the fourth dimension.

>I'll say that I view time travel from a philosophy background, not a physics one. But going from there, there's no reason perspective should matter in time travel. 

As I said before time-travel is a physics thing specifically quantum physics in which observation is a gigantic part of.
>> ARTICLE
> As I said before time-travel is a physics thing specifically quantum physics

Time travel is also a big philosophy thing, particularly in metaphysics. As I said I've studied time travel a lot from a philosophy background. I'm not saying this is incompatible with the physicists views (it's not, at least not entirely), but philosophers use a completely different methodology in their approach to understanding time travel.

> What you're talking about is more closely the Many-worlds Interpretation or MWI where all the worlds exist simultaneously, but do not communicate.

I think the best way to analyze Steins Gate (or any multiple time-line time travel story) is through [Goddu's Hypertime](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9329.00203/pdf) time travel analysis. This theory does not suppose that observance is of chief in importance, as opposed to MWI. I will clarify that hypertime is not in principle inconsistent with MWI, but in this context I do not think MWI is most appropriate, as there are better ways hypertime can make sense of the attractor field theory. The reason i say this is a multiple-timeline time travel story, is just because the timeline changes at all. Even if two timelines don't exist simultaneously, jumping time-lines is enough to count as multiple.

> She uses the MWI to help Okabe press the button heading to the beta world-line, but then and I may be confusing the novel and anime here, she's shown depressed about it as if she's accepted her death.

I can agree with you here. I think Kurisu has doubts about the MWI (hence the depression), but isn't completely convinced. I don't think she was completely lying to Okabe when consoling him,  but also hoping.

> However, as long as you delete the message before Date X it cannot be observed and thus you shift back to the beta world-line where that information is not observed.

I see where you're coming from on this. They're basically deleting the message as it's received so it has no impact. That makes complete sense. For some reason I thought you were saying they were deleting something in the present of the beta world (without the time machine) and somehow jumping world lines based on that.

Sorry it took me so long to reply I was busy yesterday.

>Time travel is also a big philosophy thing, particularly in metaphysics. As I said I've studied time travel a lot from a philosophy background. I'm not saying this is incompatible with the physicists views (it's not, at least not entirely), but philosophers use a completely different methodology in their approach to understanding time travel.

That's cool and all, but Steins;Gate is something that deals more in science (specifically science fiction), not Philosophy and I believe many of your issues with the series stems from that. Especially when it comes to observation.

>I think the best way to analyze Steins Gate (or any multiple time-line time travel story) is through Goddu's Hypertime time travel analysis. 

I realized something; we're arguing more or-less the same thing. It's just from my studies when you said "multiple time-line" you're saying the same thing as "multiple universes/worlds." In Steins;Gate there is no way to ever return to the exact divergence and when divergence changes you are changing the universe itself. You can get infinitely close, but never exact this part is actually discussed in the game and I thought it was made clear in the anime though never explicitly stated. You can be sure there is exactly one timeline the one in-which divergence is measured.

Now, maybe I can explain why there is no fatalism and that fatalism is actually addressed now that I understand where you are coming from. Once again I cannot recall if this is from the anime of the game, I really need to do a re-watch, but I'm pretty sure it's discussed if briefly. He talks about grabbing Kurisu and running, but figures it would result in her getting hit by a car or just falling down dead like Mayuri did. Instead he has to make sure that Past-Okabe sees her as dead so past-Okabe sends that text message to Daru to preserve cause and effect and remain as he is now. Otherwise, she would die and past okabe would observe her to send the past text message. So you are correct that they may have been able to save Mayuri had they a complete back-forward time-machine. However, once Mayuri's death forced him to use the time-leap machine her death was inevitable. Her death was observed, like the spin on a quantum particle, and there is no way to put her in Schrodinger's Box. Thus, the only way to save Mayuri is to escape the attractor field.

Hey sorry it took me forever to reply to this. I've also been pretty busy and I forgot I hadn't responded to this.

> That's cool and all, but Steins;Gate is something that deals more in science (specifically science fiction), not Philosophy and I believe many of your issues with the series stems from that.

I think you misunderstand how most philosphical theories mean to interpret time travel stories. The theories are meant to be used universally to interpret any time travel story (baring some distinctions between single timeline and multiple timeline) regardless of what infrastructure that story has going on inside, scientific or otherwise. So Steins Gate repeated use of scientific theories poses no barrier to it being analyzed under a Goddu style (or almost any style) interpretation.

Also, I don't have many criticisms with the series. I've always though of the series as mostly consistent, with a few worrisome points that require generous interpretations. And you have reconcile some of my concerns on some of those points even, so I'm firmly in support of the series as a solid use of time travel principles.

> multiple time-line" you're saying the same thing as "multiple universes/worlds

I think you misunderstand the distinction I'm making between single timeline and multiple timeline. A consistent single-timeline story is one in which the past is never changed. A time traveler goes back in time and takes actions that they in fact have already done. The future will remain exactly the same after there trip. Any consistent time travel story that changes the past must be interpreted as having multiple timelines. This is not the same as, but not inconsistent with a multiple worlds interpretation. Multiple timeline is more of a categorization than a specific theory.

> Schrodinger's Box

I consulted with a past professor of mine to get a better understanding of the Copenhagen view. I now see what the story is going for in it's attempt to save Kurisu. I still find this solution to be highly implausible, along with the Copenhagen view altogether. I  highly prefer my original interpretation of the Schrodinger's Box indecent being another instance of an unreliable narrator in steins;gate, where Suzuha and future Okabe are actually confused about the mechanics of time travel. In any case you don't have to agree with my interpretation if you find the Copenhagen view plausible.

I believe you're right that at this point we do mostly agree with one another and the major difference of our views is points of the story that we agree to interpret differently.

Number 14: Because Okabe thinks Kirisu is dead, he takes the same timeline he did throughout the show. If he didn't think Kirisu was dead, his actions would have been different, leading to an entirely different future, one where they wouldn't have ever created the time travel machine in the first place, leading to these current events.

It's been a while since I've seen it, but I'm pretty sure that's it. Future Okabe actually explains why he must see her 'dead' if I remember correctly.

Also for number 12, there is also an infinite number of universes where Mayuri dies. Technically you're right, but I believe they just couldn't find a way to get to another World line. The alternative would be Okabe practically living for all of eternity trying every possible combination events. 

Number 5: Kurisu is interested in the science above all else, as shown through her initial decision to even come to Okabe's lab. I assume she simply was there for science's sake, to learn something new.

Number 3 subjective: I actually feel like that would be a common reaction for anyone, though you seemed to want it to make some social commentary on transgender people.

I'm pretty sure if I had infinite time I could explain just about everyone of you're faults with the show, but alas, I do not. Though I do agree with you about having a happy end, but such is just about all television. In the VN there were a huge number of bad endings and 'bad' endings, with X living but Y dying.

The complaint I have is that their rules for time travel indicate that some events are arbitrarily fated to happen, including the death of Kurisu, which they got around by tricking Okabe. That's the part that doesn't make sense; not the explanation for him needing to send the text when he did.

And frankly, that also doesn't make sense. If the purpose of that was to make him send the first D-Mail, they could have done that through any number of ways. Her survival was waved off as "necessary," but it didn't explain why, and it didn't explain how it was possible to trick time as a dimension. They weren't just tricking Okabe, they were tricking the inevitability of her death.

On 12, while it's true that they'd both be infinite, the number of ways she could live ought to have been significantly easier to come by by virtue of the statistical likelihood of death. While a person can technically die an infinite number of ways walking down the street, the odds are still almost insurmountable that you *won't* die. The same ought to be true with time travel. In the end, my problem is that their explanation of fatalism was unsatisfying.

On 5, it was made abundantly clear that she wouldn't want to work for SERN. I don't think even she would do *anything* for science at the cost of morality. Really, it's a problem with explicit expectations and results. 

On S3, you're right, it is a relatively expected reaction, and this amounts to me expecting too much from shows, but I don't think it's a healthy expected reaction for an individual or for society. A more topical example of my problem would be if a show posited that you could pray the gay away and no one really corrected that problem.

Yes, it's technically a realistic expectation someone might have, but I don't think it's a great goal post to have your show emulate bad aspects of humanity without remarking on it. By having that aspect of humanity embedded in the heroic main character without anyone calling him out on it, the show is effectively suggesting that it's acceptable behavior.

I still don't get your transphobia complaint at all. When was there ever any transphobia? Ruka wasn't even trans.
>> ARTICLE
Being transgender is identifying with a gender that does not correspond to your biological sex. So, being that she identifies as a girl (or at the very least wants to), I would say she certainly is.

Turning to a trans person and adamantly denying that they're a girl is pretty much directly denying who they are as a transgendered person. Which is borderline transphobia.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I'd call Rukako trans when he only thought he *might* like being a girl better, and only wanted to do it by changing his gender from birth, but okay.

Okabe still didn't turn to a trans person and deny they were a girl, he turned to a girl and denied they were a girl. And if we're looking at it from Okabe's perspective, Ruka either never made the request (after changing world lines) or gave up on the idea after it failed, and outside of that one instance has never voiced a desire to be a girl nor has he ever once requested that Okabe not think of him as a guy. I don't see how there was anything even close to transphobia in Okabe's reaction.

You misunderstood, it wasn't that Kirisu's death was fated, it was that changing Okabe's reaction to Kirisu's death was too dangerous. Okabe needed to think Kirisu was dead to send the D-Mail and complete the loop.

> And frankly, that also doesn't make sense. If the purpose of that was to make him send the first D-Mail, they could have done that through any number of ways.

His actions throughout everything were impacted by that, changing that fact of his past could significantly change the future which they wanted to avoid.

> Her survival was waved off as "necessary,"

He deemed it necessary, no one else did. They could have let her die but he didn't want it to go that way.

> In the end, my problem is that their explanation of fatalism was unsatisfying.

As others have said, the fatalism was core to the grouped time lines. Her death triggered other "important" events, for some intentionally nebulous definition of important.

> On 5, it was made abundantly clear that she wouldn't want to work for SERN.

People change, and if she was offered a powerful position she may have believed she could affect the organization enough to provide a positive impact on things. There were a lot of years between the two after all.

> I don't think it's a healthy expected reaction for an individual or for society

I consider the reaction Okabe's own and nothing more. He verbally to everyone heavily acknowledges that the gender thing isn't a problem, even if on some level he is uncertain (which his inner monologue reveals).

> By having that aspect of humanity embedded in the heroic main character without anyone calling him out on it

What did he do to have someone comment on it? I don't think he took any action that was objectionable, the only objectionable parts were his internal thoughts (unless I am forgetting something).
>> ARTICLE
> His actions throughout everything were impacted by that, changing that fact of his past could significantly change the future which they wanted to avoid.

This is the key here. The quality that sets him apart (Reading Steiner) means him sending the D-Mail is only part of the problem. The entire "rest" of the series plays out as it does because he believes Kurisu dies there. If that doesn't happen, he doesn't invade her personal space before her lecture, she doesn't find them afterwards, and nothing important they do together happens (like perhaps inventing D-Mail). 
>> ARTICLE

I don't think they actually did claim that she "needed" to survive. His main goal was to prevent Kurisu's dad from getting the paper she had written. However, adult Okabe also determined that there was a chance to save her while also achieving the real goal.

In order to save her, he does have to see her dead, even if she's not. It isn't about "tricking" him or anyone else.  It's about ensuring that certain events stay the same. My post below has my full thoughts on this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wvwoi/spoilers_my_criticisms_of_steinsgate/couomnu
>> ARTICLE
on 3 subjective: From the way it is said i see the "is a guy line" a qualifier of their own attraction/jealousy, a resignation of the fate of this universe that someone this attractive and feminine is a guy. Remember up until their D-Mail it is assumed they identify male, so the introduction of the making it overly clear that they are a guy is not really transphobic. Even the show shows Okabe getting over his prejudice when he goes on a date with female Ruka. 

The movie when Kurisu says it while Okabe is missing she says it from the point of view of the D-Mails never happening. Thus in that time frame the known/assumed gender identity of Ruka is male.

Actually it was cancelled before that, otherwise Okabe would have been there when it happened. The reason I remember (possibly from the VN) is that Nakabachi cancelled it. In the original world line he just stole Titor's ideas to use in his press conference, so presumably in this new time line (where Titor didn't exist yet) he couldn't come up with anything to write and cancelled it in a panic.

I'm just going to go out and say it: transphobia, homophobia, racism, or any other kind of prejudice are not necessarily a bad thing in the context of a narrative. Humans are flawed and as such I expect my characters to be flawed. I am by no means a S;G fanboy but I don't think your statement on casual transphobia is valid criticism.
>> ARTICLE
Imagine a narrative where a character was a raging pedophile and no one brought it up and it was never addressed except that the main character independently half-realized he was being a shit.

It's the extreme version of the same thing; if a narrative doesn't highlight complicated human morality or shade it socially one way or another, then it's passed off as normal/acceptable.

As a documentary of human existence, it would be accurate to have reactions like that with little to no pause, but I think our media artifacts influence us enough that it's our obligation to carefully handle issues of social volatility. I don't think they handled it carefully, having him go as far as to grab Ruka's crotch, which is an act that would rightly make most people stop talking to someone forever because that's *goddamned uncomfortable*. They played it off like a ha-ha awkward moment though, rather than him doing something legit barebones offensive, hurtful, and harassing.
>> ARTICLE
"They played it off like a ha-ha awkward moment though, rather than him doing something legit barebones offensive, hurtful, and harassing."

Sorry to reply to an old post, but I would like to disagree with this. I just watched that scene again (of Okabe grabbing Ruka). They went to the effort of showing every other character in the room's negative reaction, Ruka's trembling, teary-eyed face, the fact that Okabe was severely punished by Kurisu, etc. I'm not seeing where you're getting the idea that his action wasn't portrayed in a blatantly negative light.

Severely punished my ass- sexual harassment like that is, again, bad enough that you stop talking to someone for doing it. Their reactions weren't positive, but it was definitely played off like it was an awkward situation that they just moved past- hence never bringing it up again.

From what I know from someone who lived in Japan, the Japanese aren't the type of people to bring up negative stuff after it's happened. They would prefer to forget rather than relive negative emotions. This video talks about it (from 3:15-5:20): https://youtube.com/watch?list=PL54734B4601A97FC7&v=of_R1NHn9Ss

And in any case, I wouldn't classify this as transphobia, since everyone reacted to Okabe's action knowing Ruka was biologically female.

I'm glad to see criticism of Stein's Gate instead of the usual circlejerk, but I would like to disagree with you here.

>It's the extreme version of the same thing; if a narrative doesn't highlight complicated human morality or shade it socially one way or another, then it's passed off as normal/acceptable.

I don't think an author needs to tell their audience what is good or bad or cater to the audience at all.  I think morally ambiguous stories are the most interesting because they can make you think for yourself and can challenge you outside of your comfort zone.  If every narrative was good vs bad with no ambiguity, things would get very boring.

I don't think media has a significant effect on society's fundamental morality: GTA doesn't make kids start murdering people, people who like rape porn don't go out and rape, etc.

Off-topic, touching someones crotch is probably more socially acceptable in Japan, where bathing with strangers is normal and sticking your fingers up someones ass is considered a prank[[1]](https://www.google.com/#q=kancho).

Good job with the thread, carry on.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry for responding to this old post, but I have to say something about this.

You have to take into account where society is today. Right now if you have a movie where one character is racist and calls black people the n-word, everyone would clearly associate that character with being the bad guy. It wouldn't be considered "morally ambiguous", that guy would clearly just be a piece of shit. The exact same thing in the 60's would have been morally ambiguous, and even earlier the majority would have considered it completely normal. 60 years ago if you make a movie with a casually racist character, and he's the good guy in every other way, it normalizes his racism. There's no consequences because he's the hero, and that's just how *normal* people act.

You may see it as being morally *ambiguous* now, but in 60 years people will look back and think "how the hell did anyone think this kind of thing was ok", because it's not.

I don't care what the viewer thinks of something, I just don't think that in every story the antagonist has to be pure evil and the protagonist has to be flawless.  If an author wants to make a flawed protagonist, I think they should have that freedom.  There's a manga called Ichi the Killer where the main characters is a murderer, but you can also sympathize with him, and I think it's an interesting manga.  I want authors to have the freedom to make interesting and entertaining stores like that.

He can be flawed but there has to be some kind of alternative viewpoint. No characters in the show seemed to have any idea what transgenderism even is.

Even the transgender girl herself doesn't seem to understand what transgenderism is, and no one even mentions it.

I'm not sure there was anything transphobic about the story. Okabe was just disappointed that such a cute person couldn't be someone he could go after considering he is definitively straight. Ruka is still Okabe's friend and Ruka isn't denigrated for it. Okabe just likes teasing Ruka because Ruka is so naive and pure. The VN also does very interesting things with Ruka and I don't think the anime really did Ruka that much justice. But I think 'transphobic' is too much.

3 I think you're reading a bit too much into it, but her watch stopping is just meant to be a sign that she is going to be killed, just an odd consistency before her death, can't remember about the hourglass doing the same thing (i'll have a look) but it's probably just the animation for dramatic effect i'd imagine.

4 Remember that there will still be a world war in the original timeline regardless because of sern, though I haven't read it i think the LN may or may not cover this since there's a series of events ahead of Okabe deciding not to save Kurisu (where he eventually makes the video) that may cover it. So perhaps something happened there, or as you said just a coincidence.

I'll keep reading through these, 2 is too confusing to remember so i'll have to watch back but i'd imagine it'd be Moekas doing somehow.

The hourglass does specifically stop. If it were just her watch, it'd be easy to say it malfunctioned at the same time in each timeline, but that's not the case.

I agree a bit odd then. Unless this dj vu has an effect on gravity which is absurd though not impossible (standard model of physics is kinda missing gravity, so if time travel's mixed in, who knows). Or maybe its was done for drama sake? Just animated that way i mean.

To me your 'Subjective issues' are more objective than your objectives ones actually, but that's just subjective.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but this comes across as a troll thread because many of your "objective" complaints are essentially, "I don't understand, so it sucks." Labeling any complaint as objective is usually a red flag, especially since there is a huge bias here.

I think your issue is that it is generally very well received by most, and you don't believe it deserves the praise, when most people do.

So, a lot of this seems to be you actively looking for something to complain about, even if you are grasping at straws.

Some of the subjective issues you really can't argue since they are just your opinion, but I really must say that I disagree about the transphobia thing. He is straight, and Ruka is pretty heavily implied to be close to being gay when a male, due to Ruka's love, regardless of gender. The only issue with this is that Okabe is straight. He isn't attracted to Ruka when Ruka's a guy, because he's a guy then. 

Actually, seeing him as a guy, even when Ruka's a girl is sort of the point. It isn't transphobic, it is about how it is okay, but that doesn't mean everyone is going to be attracted o each other. I guess I am finding it hard to concisely word what I mean. But, essentially, just because Okabe is not attracted to Ruka, doesn't mean there is transphobia. Okabe is straight, and is attracted to girls. It is a personal issue with Okabe, and one that other characters try to sway.

Also, I didn't find anything really wrong with Daru, I thought he was really likeable and a surprisingly good father.  

As for number 14, it wasn't so much about the fatalism of Kurisu, it was more about making sure everything Okabe went through still happened.

As for number 11, I don't think you fully understand what happened. The log was what lead to the official invention of time travel, which is what caused Suzu to be sent back in time (Reversing SERN's rule). When Suzu is sent back, she crashes into the building, so undoing all this is why Kurisu dies, bla bla bla. But the whole point of the show was that the world lines can be changed enough to significantly alter what happens in the future. The line with dead Kurisu/no time travel stuff is different enough from the beta line (since it is considered the alpha line) to have Mayuri survive there.

15, your perception of the timeline of the show is stuck on being linear to the worldline itself. Or so I think. Basically, the only thing that caused the events of the show, in their appearing order, was seeing Kurisu dead. Itaru's time travel stuff doesn't change the fact that that happened at all, and has no effect on the show repeating. The show is the timeline of events in Okabe's perception that leads him away and then back to the original timeline he started in, where after the events in that worldline's time occur, there is still time travel, but it has nothing to do with Okabe's journey. Which is why after Okabe's journey, he encounters the results of the other time travel stuff.

Also, the pacing was all done purposefully to properly set up the emotional responses later on. It is a literary device. So calling it "terrible" is very inaccurate. You should instead say that you didn't like it. Upon a rewatch I think you'll notice just how carefully crafted the entire show is. Just because you didn't notice the detail early on doesn't mean it wasn't there. But that part would not have hit as hard without the long set up and mystery unraveling of the beginning. Which makes it well crafted as a whole, as well.

I would recommend posting this on /r/steinsgate , most(if not all) of your "plotholes" should be explainable (at least I haven't seen anything they hadn't been able to explain).

It's been a while since I last watched/played Steins;Gate, but about this point here.

>Why was there a loophole around fatalism? That Kurisu could be saved by tricking past Okabe into thinking she was dead? That makes no sense. Why would the 4th dimension care about what someone thought? That's like suggesting that I could walk through walls if I tricked myself into thinking the wall wasn't there. Our perceptions of dimensions and reality don't change how reality actually functions. It's like the last 2 episodes were written by someone entirely different who didn't have the benefit of talking to the first person about their views on time travel.

You mean the scene where when in the beginning Okabe sees "dead" Kurisu, and in the end its revealed that she could be saved/was safe all along, right?

The thing is, her death didn't have a significant enough affect on the worldlines to be predetermined by the contractor fields. What had a significant effect was the paper she has writteen (written prior to her death) and Okabe traveling through the timelines. The last part only happened because Okabe saw Kurisu's "dead" body. However, he only had to *believe* Kurisu was dead to travel through time. Whether she was actually dead or not did not matter, as it was in the attractor field's realm(not sure if that is the right word) of possibility.

I'll just adress every point I personally have an explanation for until I am bored or out of explanations.

>[never tell the] audience why Nakabachi's conference is cancelled.

It's from Okabe's point of view and it didn't matter for the story itself, so they skipped it. There are many possible explanations, no need to go into one of them.

Mind elaborating what scene you mean with the third point? I have no idea where time was supposedly stopped.

I am not sure if I understand your fourth point completely. From what I get, why wouldn't John Titor be affected by the d-mai?. When he sent the first d-mail it ment that Suzuha came to his timeline, in which he would have prevented her from going back to 1975 either way by preventing Daru from going to the convention.

As four your 5th point, really? They *actively tried to kidnap her during the timelines you experience to force her to work for them*. Why wouldn't they on other timelines? There was also a line explicitly stating that (at least in the VN).

I am pretty sure there was an explanation (again, at least in the VN, it's hard to destinguish between the two, but chances are there was also one in the anime, there weren't many differences) for why she didn't know her father, but I can't remember. Try asking the subreddit, some people know a ton about it. Or try rewatching the show/reading the VN.

Suzuha knows that everything she does can affect the future for the worse, and she sees Kurisu being with the group, so she is extra careful not to mess up. There was also a part about the laboratorium being bugged I think. I also think she doesn't know how they change the timelines as she can only observe the results in the future, and that too only as a kid.

I think Daru died before he finished the time machine which is also the reason why the time-machine could only go to the past.

She also thinks her going back in time for the IBM is a safe bet with little to no possible complications, something the d-mail isn't. The d-mail has the power to change from entire attractor fields which results that could even lead to the d-mail (or time travel in general) never being invented.

The 7th point is about the attractor fields. Points like the sern ruling the world are things incredibly hard to change, meaning they have to move at least one, possibly several attractor fields away from their current attractor field. While small parts might change, the outcome wouldn't change. Things like the moe culture is relatively small in comparison to a group ruling the world for possibly forever.

Okabe saw what all his d-mails did to his near environment, so he decided to never use them again, having no idea what other possible consequences could happen. Original Okabe wouldn't believe any d-mail he sent himself so he had to stop them through other means. Again, d-mails have very big power that could change things like the very invention of d-mails, and if he changed that without destroying the Nakabaki or whatever its called document he would have no more means to stop anything he did.

Though I think the main reasoning for him was that he didn't want to further fuck up andj ust go back to status quo. That's not the most rational explanation, but humans are not rational, especially Okabe.

FOr Maoeka's point, thep hone itself doesn't have to be at the appartment. What is important is that the receiver is connected to the phonewave and that the phonewave is online. As long as he can call the phonewave, he doesn't have to be in the same room. Kurisu pressed the button to start the phonewave.

He didn't have to necessarily teleport, he might have just walked. Okabe looses his memory of seconds before, and since he got a call, he might have gone out of the building to answer it. That is when the information of his conciousnes got transported back. There is a logical explanation, though I am not sure if it was explicitly stated, it was at least implied earlier.

I think I have heard your 11th problem somewhere before and saw an explanation for it. It might have been somewhere [here](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=546501&show=0), but I am not sure. Either way, manym any "plotholes" are adressed here with logical explanations, yo you might want to read it. It has two pages, read both.

There is either only one world in the steisn gate universe that keeps changing, or an infinite amount of worlds where Okabe just travels to. They don't know, and Kurisu even mentions how she is scared of him just standing there after phoning the phonewave while a copy of his conciousness is sent into another world. However, there are some points that make me believe, and many other fort hat I *want* to believe, that its only one world that keeps changing.

Besides, Okabe's unreasonable andk ind of selfish in soem aspects, so as long as he doesn't know for sure that somewhere Majuri suffers and she is fine in his world, he'd be okay.

There doesn't have to be a point in it. Sometimes the very foundation is that there wasn't a point.

That aside, there were at least two. First, Kurisu was probably dead in the original timeline, and in the Steins;Gate timeline she isn't, so he saved her. The second one is what Okabe has gone through and how he changed as a result, being more mature (even if he still likes his fun alternate personality) among other things.

I think I already explaned point 14, right? If not tell me.

Daru was at a place where he he (at least for a small amount of time) outside of Sern's reach, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to rebel against it in the first place.

And again, Daru never finished his time-machine so Suzuha could only go *further* into the past, meaning her tries to change the world were very limited. Also Daru was dead, I think.

If my counters weren't to your satisfaction please either tell me, read the link I posted earlier or go to the subreddit. Also, if you don't mind explaning, what is Fatalism?

As for your subjective problems, I don't have the time and energy anymore to even read them, and since you even admitted they were subjective I don't think giving arguments against it will benefit anyone anyway.

Besides, this is my longest post ever with almost 8k letters and I still have homework to do...

Fun (but exhausting) read as far as I came though.

Also I am terribly sorry if anything I said is outright wrong, it's been a while after all and the Anime isn't the same as the VN, so some might be adaption issues, though I think there weren't any.

>> ARTICLE
I agree with all your subjective issues (didn't pay enough attention to have an opinion about your objective ones). The harem and character development is the biggest one for me. Some shows get so much flak for having girls interested in guys for no discernible reason and to me there is no real reason for so many girls to be interested in Okabe, especially Kurisu. 
>> ARTICLE
The only other one actually interested in okabe was ruka. None of the others had a real interest in him. 
>> ARTICLE
12: This goes into paradox repair theory, Miyuri can't live in that timeline as her living would prevent the future events that were interacting with their time, without relieving the reason that future events were interacting with their time. This is also the reason why he had to fake Kirisu's death, so there is some consistency here.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding, but that doesn't appear to answer the issue of a literal infinite number of universes. There isn't (at least as far as I can tell) anything about the possible futures in that timeline that necessarily prohibit Mayuri from being alive; it's just a plot device to kickstart Okabe's subsequent actions.

I can't think of a theoretical instance offhand where the possible events of the future necessarily prohibit the altering of events of the present. In all circumstances, there should be a possible future that can account for that. What about Mayuri living would create a paradox?
>> ARTICLE
expanding a bit more. In universe it is pointed out that while there are basically infinite universes, they tend to not butterfly, but stay close in ultimate outcome. Suzuha's description of how timelines work is the only one that matters in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;hate seems to subscribe to a combination of Self-healing theory and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_paradox#Temporal_modification_negation_theory for dealing with temporal paradoxes, the alpha beta timelines being a way around the self healing theory. Basically in universe the butterfly effect is kept in check, most actions can not induce a radically different future as the universe will first try to subscribe to the self healing theory. changes need to be "unhealable" to induce a change between alpha's and beta's
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Ruka is that you're imposing today's values on a show from five years ago from a country with different values (and actually the visual novel was released on 2009, and the writing probably started before that). 

Japan isn't nearly as progressive when it comes to actual gay rights, much less trans rights, despite what you might think from watching anime. So basically no one "learns" about trans people in this show because it's a Japanese show from 2010, not an American show from 2015.
>> ARTICLE
11 is probably the biggest plot hole in the show (as well as the VN.) They simply delete the data that SERN had and it changes not only the future, but also the present? To the point that Kurisu isn't even in the room anymore? It just doesn't make any sense and seems like it was a huge oversight. If anyone can explain this, please do, it's been bothering me for a while.
>> ARTICLE
They delete the data so Sern can't track them down. Since Sern can't track them down, Sern never takes over the world. Because sern never takes over the world Suzuha never goes back in time with an incomplete time machine. Because the time machine doesn't crash the conference happens and Kurisu is stabbed.

You got to look at time 3 dimensionally, in a story about time travel, the future effects the past
>> ARTICLE
Except that it wasn't a plot hole at all.

Deleting that meant SERN never knew time travel was possible. This means no dystopian future by SERN's hands, which means no Suzu time travelling and crashing into the conference building which means no cancelled conference which is where Kurisu dies. 

The explicitly also said episodes prior that the invention of time travel itself was a big enough change to hop from the alpha to beta lines. So, that was the huge change they needed. But as to how what they did changed everything, they stopped the time travelling in the first place, which meant the past was never changed.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the late reply. So did the "jellyman" news reports that Daru found happen before or after they intercepted Rintarou's first D-mail? Obviously the reports happened before, but when were the rest subjects sent? I was under the impression that they were researching and experimenting with time travel long before Okabe and co. started messing with the microwave, also making SERN interested in monitoring possible time travel activity. So did Okabe's D-mail really give them the extra push to complete their time machine? Sorry if I'm coming off wrong about this, I've just been having the feeling that I've been missing something ever since I read/played the VN.
>> ARTICLE
They were, but Suzu says that they only figure it out when they learn from Okabe. And they only take notice of what he is doing after noticing the first D-mail, which says something that doesn't happen, and comes out of no where.

I haven't read/played the VN either, so I might be missing stuff too. But in the show she says something about how the way they figure it out is after taking notice of Okabe.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I've watched it but I'll give it a shot.

By changing something that they *knew* would alter the future they changed it. Knowing what's going to happen in the future doesn't change it, but by using the knowledge you can.

So they change the future, but how does that change the past or present? Well in this world there exists those who've come from the future to their past/present. By changing the future you stop them from sending those people back. But if they never got sent back, then the present/past changes back to whatever it was originally.

So to clarify, the only reason this is possible is because they know that in the future people change the then past.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the response, I'm going to try to reiterate your statement to further clarify, because I'm getting confused as fuck haha. It doesn't help that I also haven't seen it in a while, and it's been even longer since I've played it.

Anyways, what you're saying is by deleting the data in the "present", they enabled their "future" selves to change "past," thus changing the worldline their "present" selves are in? Is that basically what you were saying?
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly.

So let's say I live in a world that I don't know will have time travel. I don't know it, but part of my timeline has already been influenced by people travelling to before I was even born. This is an altered timeline, but it's the one I'm familiar with.

But now I know time travel exists, and I know people have been sent back in time. Now I can stop that from happening so long as I stop people in the future from having time travel.

So that one action stops them from having time travel and sending everyone back. Now the present, the one I'm familiar with that had time travel, is changed. It's changed to a timeline where no one was ever sent back to change the past.
>> ARTICLE
Okay this is starting to make more sense. But, which party is stopped from time traveling? SERN? Would deleting records of Okabe's first D-mail prevent them from completing time travel technology? I probably need to watch the series, my memory is getting a little blurry of what actually happened.
>> ARTICLE
They said in the show that SERN finds out how to properly time travel by Okabe's experiments, which they only find out about by the log with the first D-mail. So preventing them from ever seeing the log by deleting the d-mail in their log, they never figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Technically everyone is stopped from going back. I'd recommend re-watching it anyways 'cause it's an awesome show despite any flaws.

>> ARTICLE
Agreed.
>> ARTICLE
That's the only decent explanation I could think of, but the problem is that they shouldn't have needed a time machine for most of the story. For example, Suzuha could have walked up to their apartment, smashed their time machine, and the show would have ended, since they didn't understand how it worked in the first place.

But, as we saw, knowing what happened in the future and physically doing things contrary to what you were originally going to do wasn't enough to change the future. Okabe traveled back in time dozens of times using the time leap machine, and during that time, not once did his actions have that transformative effect on the present that deleting SERN's log did.

That said, despite the number of times that he went back in time with knowledge of the future, the *only* time an act changed the present was the deletion of SERN's log, which represents, most reasonably, an inconsistency in how they approach time travel.
>> ARTICLE
To be specific, that log was how SERN found out time travel was possible, as they said, but the change that has is that it means Suzuha never goes back in time and crashes into the building, which means the conference happens, and we know that when the conference happens, Kurisu dies.

So there actually is no inconsistency at all. It is hinted at throughout the episodes and the pieces are all given for you to figure out in the episodes before it.

Edit: this is what is explained in the show, and if you make an actual timeline of events, it checks out and makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Well, for your example, the only reason why Suzuha is there in the first place is because Daru knew how to make a time machine like the PhoneWave (name TBA). If they didn't know that, then the world line would split off and arguably become even worse since now they wouldn't have a hope of going back in time to acquire the IBN 5100.

As for why only the deletion of SERN's log changed the world line, it was probably because they needed that log to figure out who else had made a time machine (Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru) and then capture them to perfect their own one. Once the log is deleted, they can't find them any more, and hence their own time machine fails to exist. Presumably they must have went back in time to then cancel Nakabachi's Time Machine presentation, in order to save Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru who would have been inside that building when Suzuha's machine materialized.

As for Okabe's other actions during time leaps, if you notice how he was always returning to the same general outcome within each world line, only a D-Mail which could change a past event would be able to break out of the groundhog day loop (since those events are what lead up to the loop in the first place). Every single D-Mail that got undone changed something on a day well before he would be able to time leap back to. Due to this, my guess it that the general chain of events in each time loop were already "locked in stone" by the earliest time he could leap to.
>> ARTICLE
Well as I said it's not about just knowing what happens in the future, but acting on it. And obviously if that *wasn't* enough to change things they would've done more. 
>> ARTICLE
Number 11 bothered the fuck out of me for the longest time.  Then I came up with an answer.  Admittedly, this is what I made up, but bear with me.

> The final step in saving Mayuri's life was to remove SERN's log of their original time travel activity. I am confused at this perhaps more than any other problem I have with the show. The removal of the log in the present should not have changed the past; that makes fundamentally no goddamn sense. Moreover, anything they do in the present shouldn't change the future, since it's implied that whatever they do in the present causes the future. The only established way to change the future was to change the past, which they didn't do when they erased the log from SERN's database. Because they didn't travel through time by deleting that log, Okabe shouldn't have crossed the 1% Divergence line. I'm just fundamentally confused by how they think this worked.

The only way deleting information in the present would change the present is if at some point in the future, SERN used that information to travel back in time.  Deleting the information in the present *can* change the present, *if the information was to be used in the future to alter that future's past*.

And of course, that is exactly what happened.  We know this.  The first hint comes early in the series - SERN's time travel experiments *don't work*.  They produce gelatinous green people stuck halfway through walls.  But the Phone-Microwave does work, and from that the FG-201 (and SERN's time machine) is derived.  (Daru creates one and Kurisu the other under duress.)

The invention of a time machine (that led to a SERN dystopia) can only lead to said dystopia if SERN uses the time machine.  And there's evidence of this throughout the series.  SERN has been logging phone traffic since way back - they must have been for the IBN-5100 to be relevant/necessary to read and decode the mainframe data.  Why the heck would they even be doing this, unless somebody from the future tipped them off?

After Okabe's text message, he bounces to a timeline below the 1% divergence, in which Mayuri dies, that is essentially the years leading up to the onset of SERN's dystopia - so they are living within SERN's manipulations.  The recording of their cellphone traffic is one such manipulation.  The entire rounders structure and the grooming of Braun are another.

So yeah.  It didn't make sense to me at first.  Then I realized that everything started from the log.  Without the log, SERN is tipped off (presumably by their future selves) to a smoke signal that they never see - this is the world line above the 1% divergence, in which Kurisu dies.  Okabe still sends the text, and it's captured... or not, depending on how you percieve the following paradox: it is deleted out of the system before SERN gets their hands on an IBN-5100 and reads of it's existence.  Therefore, SERN never gets their hands on a time machine, never goes back in time to warn itself, never starts logging texts...
>> ARTICLE
It has been quite some time since I've been this interested in reading walls of text.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your complaint about the final 2 episodes nullifying the heart wrenching decision Okabe had to make in episode 22. If the show ended with that episode 22 decision and its aftermath, I would have given Steins;gate a solid 9/10. But the fact that it was undone, just for the sake of giving us a "happy ending" made me annoyed. 

Okabe struggled through the series and a major lesson for him was: if you're going to change things in the past, be ready for the consequences. He eventually gains the conviction and resolution to sacrifice Kurisu (his love) to undo the death of Mayushi (who died because of Okabe's tampering of the past). The impact of his resolve for the decision is watered down by the fact that he saves them both in the next two episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Went through some of the things you have issues with didn't finish reading as I will come back to it later, but from what I get so far is, you don't like the fact that no one is describing every little detail to you and therefore it's BS. A lot of what pieces things together is implied or symbolic and could very well be thought up on your own leaving to your imagination because overall it's not as important to the main story being told here.

Edit: You know what, never mind, most of your "objective" arguments are rather very subjective. All I can say is you were looking for something entirely different and failed to enjoy it in that aspect. Basically Steins;Gate just doesn't suit your tastes, which of course not EVERYONE has to love it.
>> ARTICLE
one thing to note, is that your "objective" complaints, are simply "subjective" interpretations based on your own personal knowledge and observations, just saying

with that in mind, your post is commendable and could spark some good conversations, however, the fact still remains that Stein's Gate was a show from several years ago, and a show with a very complicated plot, so you are best off asking people dedicated to the show, like people in the Stein's Gate sub. because if these so called "inconsistencies" ruined the experience for you, then it is much more prudent to ask people who have studied this topic more

however, since i do not want to leave with a whole a bunch of nothing, i will resolve your some of your "objective" complaint s

12: no, fatalism is not completely incompatible with infinite timeline multi-verse. this goes back to the logical definition of "infinity", which a school of thought believes that "infinite" is not truly "infinite", for they believe it would be "illogical" for the "infinite" to incorporate the "logically impossible" and "blatant contradictions". so under this premise, "infinite" can logically not include the events of "Mayuri surviving the time-travel timeline"

14: you are confusing knowledge/information with reality, and the show illustrate the classic anti-thesis against the common definition, and now debunked, of what exactly constitutes knowledge. "Kirisu is dead" is not the reality, the event is "Okabe saw Kirisu lying in a pool of blood", and the information of "Kirisu is dead" was not verified at any point. Tricking past Okabe has no effect on reality, the "reality" is simply time traveling Okabe resolving the events that "Kirisu is not dead" (as observed by T.T. Okabe) and "Kirisu lying in a pool of blood" (as observed by P Okabe). This resolution hinges on the philosophical world views of dualism, monism, and materialism, in which people debate over whether or not the "realty" we live in, is a concept that truly exists, or simply an illusion. 

I do want to firstly apologize for such short and minute explanations while throwing such big concepts without further explaining them. however, if i did, it would just be too much effort and do them too little justice. i find that your more "philosophical" and "conceptual" complaints, stem from your pretty secular understanding of the broad branch of study known as philosophy, and a pretty unfair take on plot holes or inconsistencies. 

sorry for rambling for so long in a quite messy manner, but i will give you a skill i believe is pretty useful in exploring such topics: is understanding the concepts of "contradiction" and "resolution". if any inconsistency has happened in any story-telling or philosophy, as long as no blatant contradictions has appeared, we should operate under the understanding that then there still exists the possibility of a logical resolution

we can nitpick even the most achieved story-telling in cinema or literature, that is why a certain suspension of disbelief is required, and we might not necessarily agree with whatever resolution is presented to us, but logic simply needs to be "logical".
>> ARTICLE
Regarding a couple of your subjective opinions, I think no one should really expect a whole lot of character development for characters other than Okabe. This whole thing takes place in a relatively short time period, and none of the others are the ones performing any sort of time leap. They're there just living the same week over and over again, so I wouldn't really expect a whole lot of development. They exist to support Okabe and only that, and it's hard to write character development for characters that live the same day over and over...without remembering what they went through.

That transphobia stuff is just a joke, the [trap](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtokonokoGenre) joke, and there's really no use in trying to look so deep into it. Plus, it's not even transgender. Ruka is simply a crossdressing guy, and Okabe constantly has to remind himself that Ruka is a guy despite looking so cute.
>> ARTICLE
The issue is that if they knew they were going to write characters that experience no development, they should have written them to not be so flat.  
>> ARTICLE
You have a point, but that sounds more like a problem with the original visual novel...and I would be hesitant to tweak some personalities and have people riled up because they don't stay true to the original material. I didn't mind it, I can certainly see why people would be upset with it, though.
>> ARTICLE
It is a problem with the VN, but because of that it was entirely avoidable.  Tweaking the characters so that they are better written would have been an improvement.  Likely the only people who would have been riled up would be the purists.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think Ruka is well written personally. But he/she plays more of a role in the VN and I don't think it was going to be possible to elaborate too much on Ruka on a very shortened anime conversion. I thought they still did decently. But they would have spent more episodes fleshing out Ruka's side of the story if they were more loyal to the VN.
>> ARTICLE
> Plus, it's not even transgender. Ruka is simply a crossdressing guy

Her one wish in the world was to be reborn as a biological female.

That's like... The baseline definition for transgenderism- not identifying with the biological sex you were born as.
>> ARTICLE
[Minor Tatami Galaxy Spoilers](/s "The Tatami galaxy has a timeloop, spends 90% of the show in the MC's head and it still manages to develop a few characters and make all of them the very antithesis of flat.") Don't get me wrong I don't expect all these shows to have good character development across time lines but it's definitely possible.

I wouldn't call this "anti" or "hate" towards S;G. I finished the show at the end of the week, gathered my thoughts, and posted about it comparable to the high expectations I went in with.

I really commend you for this post, It was well thought out and brought up some nagging questions I've had with the series for a while. I do feel bad for the people who are victims of the S;G hype on this thread, thankfully I watched the show before I started visiting /r/anime as hype is a dangerous thing. However Ive still given this series a 10/10 plot holes and all, but that's because while it has its faults I still enjoyed the heck out of it. (Plus I am a sucker for anything having to do with time travel and the theories involved) To further prove my point, my favorite film is Back to the Future, and that movie has a bunch of silly inconsistencies. Anyway long story short, I really do admire you for taking the time to write down all the problems you had with this series, and it always intrigues me to see what negative things people have to say about this series, because no show is flawless.

True enough, at least by most user's standards. When seriously rating something, I like to treat each number as a valid option.

none of these are really issues for me, you are obsessed over the details instead of the overall story. but i do agree with the fact that krisui and mayuri both lived. that was wack, no consquences at all. thats the only reason it is a 8/10 to me otherwise id give it 9-10/10
>> ARTICLE
I'll try my best to answer some of your questions:

Objective Section:

2 - SERN is just outwardly searching for IBNs.  Feyris' Dad probably put everything up for sale when she was kidnapped and someone related to SERN found out.  They swoop in and purchase IBN.  They don't have to be related to the kidnapping or know about the IBN previously.

3 - I think the Hourglass stopping is just use of artistic liberties as a metaphor for Mayuri's death.  The stopwatch and the hourglass are both symbols of her death throughout the show.  Okabe is visually seeing the foreshadowing of death.  The show tries to avoid showing too much gore and violence and uses methods like this to avoid it.

5 - In the VN, Kurisu is essentially tortured by SERN and eventually helps them build a time machine.  This isn't overtly stated in the anime.

6 - Suzuha doesn't come right out with it because she isn't supposed to be in the year 2010 anyways.  She was supposed to go straight back to 1975, but takes a detour to look for dad.  I don't even think she has the intention of telling her dad that she's their kid.  She seems like she just wants to 1) help Okabe realize the IBN is important via John Titor alias, 2) see her dad, and then 3) buzz off without butterfly effecting the future too hard.

8 - Okabe has just watched his lifelong friend die.  He's entitled to behave slightly irrationally.  His first round at trying to save Mayuri is beyond dumb -> he takes her to the train station that he knows was shut down by a bomb threat after spending hours running around looking for her.  He's so emotional he can't think clearly and he states it later by saying something to the effect of "I didn't think that through" in his next run-through.  Okabe's fumbling through his predicament highlights the emotional turmoil he feels.

9-10 - The teleporting to Moeke's front door is odd.  Okabe does lose time during world line transitions though (30 sec lost standing after sending lotto D-Mail).  He may have just wandered there in a stupor.  Who knows.  You're over thinking the details.  The anime was probably just trying to condense the video to fit their episode length, and saw the teleport as an opportunity to save 20-25 seconds on their episode.  Doesn't happen in the VN to my recollection.

Subjective Section:

1 - No one can grow besides Okabe in the world they created because the others have no recollection of the other world lines.  The individual characters do show growth within their arcs (Ruka and Mr.Braun especially), but revert back after a world line shift.  If they did grow, it would be incoherent with the plot.

3 - I interpreted the "but he's a guy" joke differently at the end of Ruka's D-mail reversal.  Okabe's tone changed.  Okabe seemed more relieved that his plan was working than mocking Ruka.  To me, the show was transcending gender binary by restating a phrase from the past in a different context and tone.  It even suggests that maybe being a guy is easier for Ruka.  That way Ruka has a physical reason to not be with Okabe in addition to accepting that Okabe doesn't feel the same.

5 - Daru's stereotypical representation doesn't bother me.  I find it pretty entertaining to be honest and I have a similar nerdy gamer background.  Stereotypical characters are there to make use of an audience's preconceived notions.  Daru himself doesn't change much in the story, but we get a lot of information via Suzuha about who Daru eventually becomes.  While the show used him for some "stereotypical" jokes throughout, the writers want us to believe Daru's a good guy.

6 - There were real consequences for Kurisu's revival -> She has no recollection of any of the events that happened between her and Okabe.  That's pretty heavy handed consequences.  A lot of people would choose living in a world where your loved one is dead rather than a world where they live and don't love you back.  The movie touches on some of that struggle for Okabe even if it isn't canon.  It's not as Deus ex an ending as you make it out to be.

7 - The plot pacing is a big complaint from most people.  What makes the show great though is the emotional engagement.  The first 10 episodes aren't plot crazy, but they really do pull you into a believable world.  I mean I'd be trying to win the lotto too if I thought I had a time machine.  The story wants you to feel like these are normal people who just stumbled on a time machine.  It connects you to Okabe so that you can feel his struggles more intensely later.

That's all I have for now.  The show is definitely without flaws.  Your overarching opinion of the show might be tilting your perspective to see more negatives and not look for solutions.  Most of your objective complaints are answerable.  

Your subjective complaints are just how you feel about the show.  I can't change how you feel about it, but maybe seeing how others perceive the show will help you understand why others rate it so highly.

In general, the anime adaptation glosses over several plot points that are further explained in the VN, which is over 30+ hrs long. Many of your "subjective" concerns about character development and pacing are because of this. I'll give a brief summary:

- Faris and Ruka's storylines are cut by at least half. All 4 extra endings are omitted. You are basically seeing <50% of the story. 
- Moeka is especially hard to do in the anime because almost all her interaction with the protagonist is via text. 
- The anime starts out slow but the VN starts with a bang. There's an introductory monologue from Okabe about how he fucked things up spectacularly by messing with causality. Then after the switch to the Alpha worldline, there is the opening video with crazy shit going down. 

I'll go on to your "objective" concerns next.

>No one grew except Okabe.

Well, in the end Okabe was the only one who experienced the whole thing, so there's no reason for the other characters to grow.

 Think for a lot of people, it isn't the story that makes them like the show but the themes it presents and the drama in it. Plus all that otaku pandering. Sci fi shows, especially those about time travel usually have some pretty noticeable plot holes in it. 

I enjoyed the show, but admittedly didn't watch it for the super cool and realistic time travel, I watched it for the drama and characters if you know what I mean. To me, a show taking a few liberties that make the story itself a bit wobbly doesn't bother me (but keeps it from being a 10), what does bother me is the fact that there is quite a bit of otaku pandering and that the harem elements are too prevalent. I also found some of the reasons why shit changed to borderline insanity. An entire town changed because of Feryis? Bullshit (unless I missed something here). Character randomly changing gender? Bullshit, but j know nothing of how fertilization and the choosing of the gender is, so if it was totally random, I suppose it's passable). But I'll never get the whole Feryis BS, unless I watch it again. 

To me steins gate uses time travel as a means of telling a dramatic story, so I feel like the drama in it should be judged first and foremost (basically how they handled each character and the romance and stuff), with the fucked up time travel aspects being less important. That's how I view the series at least. Of course, I saw the series fairly early on in my anime watching career, so I don't know how I'll feel about the show during a rematch.

Feyris was personally responsible for bringing moe culture to the city (theoretically). Her dad was against it, so she didn't do it in the timeline where he was alive, but where he had already died in the normal timeline, she used what was presumably a large inheritance to influence the direction the culture of the city as a whole had taken.

it wasn't *too* unbelievable to me, so it wasn't something I really sat on.

Ruka becoming a girl because the mom ate vegetables is suspect, but I'm also no biologist, and I didn't really want to research that going into this criticism. For the purposes of the story, it wasn't the worst thing to suspend my disbelief on that, though now that you bring it up, I kind of want to amend my post to include it.

My problem is how she single handed OG brought otaku culture and moe to an ENTIRE CITY. That shit fucked me up. I remember all the reasons they gave us, I just felt like those 2 were pretty bullshit even with their reasons.

I think they made it clear that the vegetables had nothing to do with it. Ruka's gender just happened to change as a butterfly effect that D-mail had.

Just a little about number 4, John Titor originally goes back to 2000 to warn the world about world war three as in the actual John Titor hoax. There's also a reference to it in episode 23 if my memory is right. 

In the timeline when the Dmail was sent she goes straight to 2010 to warn about Sern. 
>> ARTICLE
John Titor existing at all in the year 2000 makes no sense (aside from as a cultural shoutout). That's a nonsensical time for Suzuha to go back to regardless of context, particularly when she shows up in 2010 to enlist Okabe's help in fending off WWIII by saving Kurisu.

That said, I think she had a throwaway line about visiting 1975 and 2000 before 2010 in the WWIII timeline, so I may need to go back and edit my post to reflect that.

Thanks for the reminder.
>> ARTICLE
She can't try to change things ahead of time? She most likely went back to then to try to give people enough time to prevent WW3, like Titor IRL. 

But, it must not have worked in S;G, so they have Titor go to the most appropriate time for Okabe to be able to directly stop it. This is most logically after she already made the attempt in 2000, showing up on forums like IRL.

As for why the beta worldline has Titor not show up in 2000, it is because the technology for time travel was different, and we know what happened because of it.

Edit: I'm not saying the Titor IRL was the real deal, in case you were wondering, I'm just saying what Titor said in the 2000 forums posts IRL.
>> ARTICLE
There is also the possibility that she went back to 1975(to get the IBM) and then wrote the stuff as John Titor in the year 2000. She wouldn't have a reason to kill herself on that timeline. 

And Suzuha was never seen before the first d-mail, right?
>> ARTICLE
Incorrect.  Kurisu's father is the assumed catalyst for this. Kurisu's stolen research is assumed to be his life's work as a scientist who defected to Russia and started the time travel arms race that culminated in WW3. They retroactively made the titor of 2000 the original basis for okabes interest. The father is the motivation for tutors 2000 visit per the stories logic. 
>> ARTICLE
I think what you're missing here is that John Titor actually did show up on forum boards (in real life) in the year 2000, and also the early 90s I believe. Since they are basing John Titor in the show on a real (fake) person, those facts about when he appeared and posted on forums obviously has to be the same as real life. Then when the show's worldline differs from the original, John Titor's timeline changes.

Not saying you're right or wrong, but when I watch an anime, i am far from that level of criticism, and i'm pretty satisfied with that. That probably helped me liking Steins;Gate a lot, enjoying what the show proposed instead of only looking for flaws.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a few months since I watched the series, so my memory could be off, but I thought that the show covered some of these things fairly explicitly.

**#4 - About Titor -** In short, John Titor existed in both of the major world lines presented in the series, but moved through them each differently.

In the Alpha Attractor line (which I'll call "Kurisu Dies") Titor was bouncing back and forth through time as necessary to try to prevent WWIII.  This line is what the show "starts" in and only stays there very briefly.  This is why only Okabe seems to 'remember' about Titor posting in 2000 (and even had books about the guy, that went missing) once the show shifts its primary focus into the Beta Attractor ("Mayuri Dies") line.  Kurisu knows of Titor in this line, but only because she actually talked with 'him' online in the current time period of the series.

In the "Mayuri Dies" line, the time machine that Suzuha/Titor has is more flawed, likely because it was developed within a secret rebel/terrorist organization underneath an extremely oppressive global regime.  It's incapable of going forward in time, only backward, so her first stop had to be 2010.  On top of that, she went *off-task* to do it -- the only reason she stopped there was to try and meet her father however briefly before going further back to secure an IBN that would eventually fall into the hands of the Future Gadget Lab.

Once we get back to the "Kurisu Dies" line near the end of the show and Suzuha shows up with her gambit to save Kurisu and prevent WWIII, even Okabe gives a confused "Wait, this one can go forward in time, too?" and she mentions all the other times she's stopped in already, including 2000.

**#5 - Kurisu working for SERN -** It's at the very least heavily implied that she was under duress while working for SERN.  The company uses her research and even uses her as the "face" of time travel, but Suzuha says that both Kurisu and Okabe are already dead in the time she comes from and the context suggests that it was at SERN's hands, not the hands of each other.
>> ARTICLE
5. Actually, SERN held Kurisu's parents hostage. I'm fairly sure this is implied in the anime, since I knew it before playing the VN, but maybe I just read it somewhere on the Internet.

7. The butterfly effect is used once more at the very end, with the Metal Upa (I totally called that it would be important somewhere down the line, btw) being the reason Nakabachi wasn't let aboard that plane that caught fire, thus saving the paper he stole from Kurisu, leading to WWIII.

13. That one is subjective! Well, you said it was, but still, I personally like happy endings, so...

14. Well, by doing that, he technically changes nothing to his past self's actions, which means the first D-Mail is sent, and that's what triggers the separation between the alpha and bta world lines. I thought it was cool...

15. What makes you say Daru building a time machine is inevitable? You'd think in the S;G world line, Okabe would stop him, and likely tell him exactly why in order to convince him.

About subjectives, now

1. I agree that the characters were weak, except for Kurisu and Feyris, altough that last one is less noticeable. I thought Kurisu was a great character mainly because of her beliefs as a scientist and as a person. I'm not sure anymore how much time the anime spends on that, but in the VN at least, when Okabe asks her why she doesn't want to send a D-Mail, she explains that she doesn't want to deny her past because everything, even the mistakes, make up who she is right now. I find that very admirable about her, especially if you consider the whole story about her dad. Actually, now that I think about it, her character was much more developed in the VN... I know the anime has to stand by itself, but it's just to let you know.
Feyris is interesting because of the fact that she's a Stepford Smiler. I like Stepford Smilers because they have a dark secret, and hers was pretty devastating. That's why I empathize with her and admire her, for being able to smile, and also basically manage Akiba, despite her shitty past.
The others were bleh, but Daru is funny, Suzuha's letter made me cry, Mayuri is rather touching sometimes, and Luka... uh, his chapter in the VN is freaking hilarious...? I don't have anything about Moeka, though.

4. This is also a problem that I have, despite shipping them *to death*, but I think Kurisu has quite a lot of dj vus about the other timelines. This is adressed a little bit in the OVA, but in a manga spin-off, she gets a weird flashback-ish thing when Okabe time leaps and she somehow gets the feeling something terrible happened.

6. No real consequence, but hardcore PTSD. I like happy endings. :)

7. I can see why a lot of people complain about the pacing, but I tend to like slow starts.

Well, OP, this was an awesome thread, I can tell you put a lot of thought into it. I love Steins;Gate because it fits my personal tastes ridiculously well, but I agree it certainly doesn't deserve the second spot on MAL, or a 10/10, and thus I love discussing it with other people.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take a shot at points 8, 9 and 10. Great post by the way.

Regarding point 8 the reason Okabe would decide to go back and undo all the d-mail's is that his goal is to prevent Mayuri's death.  Something which is occurring because he sent a D-mail that prevents Kurisu's death.  Thinking about it Okabe has no knowledge of how many d-mail's he will have to send into the past to find a timeline where the outcome is optimal (Mayuri alive + Kurisu alive) he could wander through timelines effectively making him lose sense of his reality.  In episode 22 this is basically the conclusion that Kurisu helps him come to, even if means losing her, Okabe has to get back to some sort of balance in order to save himself before he can save others.  The easiest way to do this is clearly to go back to where it started and remove the effects of all the d-mails.   Even if he ended up effecting the lives of some his friends to an extent the benefit of going back to the original timeline vs trying to send another d-mail and hope for a lucky jump isn't that efficient.  You also have to remember that Okabe's survival and sanity is pretty important since he is the only one that can fully remember the previous timeline he was in after a jump has been made.

Hmm can't solidify my thoughts about 9 and 10 at the moment.  Btw [here is a picture of the timeline](https://i.imgur.com/LDlqWQW.jpg) from the VN booklet (scanned it kinda quick) dunno if it'll help.
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile since I watched the show, but I think I can address most of your complaints. Many of what you think are contradictions are actually fully consistent. You either missed the explanations or didn't connect all the breadcrumbs to see how they connect together.

Point 4:

In the original timeline, where Kurisu was stabbed, Suzuha travels from the future to the year 2000, posts on some web forums as John Titor, then continues on to the year 1975 to purchase the IBN 5100. After the first D-mail is sent, the world changes to one where she instead arrives in the year 2010.

Okabe remembers the original timeline, while everyone else only remembers the altered one. There's no conflict here.

Point 6:

Suzuha did know her father's name, but not his real name. She only knew his net handle: Barrel Titor. It's implied that he and Okabe are deep in the resistance so it's very likely that they went mostly by fake names in the future.

> Their time travel is lowering the Divergence number, which is the exact thing she's supposed to reverse.

Because Suzuha lacks the Reading Steiner ability she can't tell when or if it's changed. She even mentions this in Mr. Brawn's flashback. She doesn't retain memories perfectly across time line jumps so to her the numbers appear to be forever unchanging.

Point 7:

> Why is it that none of their time alterations change the future enough to alter anything about Suzuha's presence, appearance, or purpose in any way?

The same reason that Okabe has such a hard time preventing Mayuri's death. In this universe the butterfly effect is limited. Certain events can be altered but other events are set in stone and seemingly protected from change by some force that Okabe dubs the attractor field. Mayuri's death and Suzuha's appearance in 2010 are both protected events.

Is this lazy storytelling? Maybe. But it is still fully explained and consistent with the rest of the story.

Point 9:

Several times in the story they send a D-mail from a location outside the lab. The only requirement is that someone starts up and programs the phone wave in person. At some point in the middle of the story, Kurisu mentions that she changed the phone wave to be programmable from any location via cell phone.

At the construction site, you see her on her phone presumably doing just that while Okabe is typing up the D-mail to send.

Point 10: 

> At the conclusion of Moeka's subplot, Okabe teleports to the spot outside of Moeka's door after the D-Mail is sent. This is the first and only time that sending a D-Mail causes him to teleport

While that's the only time he changes location, it's fully explainable and justifiable why he does. Even though his memories stay intact while hopping across timelines, physically everything is moved to the location it would be in in that other timeline.

Since Okabe spends most of his time at the lab and that's also where he sends most of the D-mails from, it makes sense that most of the time he'd find himself still at that location once he moved to the other timeline. In the case of Moeka though, he was only at the construction site because the two of them were trying to track down FB. 

Since the IBN wasn't taken by FB in the timeline they jumped to, obviously he wouldn't be at the construction site in that timeline.

Also, while his location doesn't change after sending the first D-mail, how he arrived at that location does change.

In the first time line, he was at the building, saw Kurisu dead, then went outside and sent the D-mail. That jumped him to a different time line where, several hours earlier, Suzuha crashed the time machine into the building. This caused the event to be reported on in the news and made Okabe declare it some conspiracy and to rush to the building to see.

When he arrived in the second time line after sending the first D-mail it changed his recent history so that he had not met Kurisu because they were never in that building together.

Point 11

This is all thanks to Suzuha. Because she travels from the future into the past, making changes to the present can alter past events.

> Moreover, anything they do in the present shouldn't change the future, since it's implied that whatever they do in the present causes the future.

What you do in the present causes the future, yes. Unless of course you have knowledge of what you are going to do and specifically do something different. That's what happened here. They used the knowledge about the future brought to them by Suzuha to alter the present, which changed the future.

Point 12

> Philosophically, their explanation of having infinite universes is ill-thought out. Specifically, they don't understand what "infinite" means.

I'm not sure that YOU understand what infinite means.

Just because there exist infinite potential worlds does not mean that every imaginable outcome is possible. There could be an infinite number of worlds but Mayuri dies in every single one. To simplify even more, there could be an infinite number of universes in which I roll a 6 sided die, but in none of them do I roll a 7.

Points 13 & 14

They didn't nullify anything.

When Okabe sent the first D-mail he changed the future to one where SERN controlled time travel and ruled the world with it. He only knows about this because of Suzuha, and only meets her because of the altered time line.

He doesn't know the future of the other timeline when he makes the change, and only after changing it back does he learn that its even worse, where multiple countries obtain time travel and use it to fight wars against each other.

> Why was there a loophole around fatalism? That Kurisu could be saved by tricking past Okabe into thinking she was dead?

Because to avoid the time travel wars future he needs the memories about time travel that he obtained in the other timeline. He only knows the time travel wars are coming because Suzuha traveled from that future to help him avoid it.

She was only able to travel out of that future because Okabe and Daru made a time machine capable of physically transporting a person. And they were only able to make that time machine because Okabe thought Kurisu was stabbed and sent the first D-mail, which of course kicked off the whole events of the show.

Point 15: 

Because it's not inevitable. Ignoring the events of the movie, reaching the steins;gate time line means that the final time machine will never be invented so there's nothing for SERN to log. 

As for why the use of the time machine to reach that point doesn't cause them to switch back to the other timeline with SERN's dystopia, once again it's Suzuha. At the very end she mentions having just come from the year 1975 where she acquired the IBN 5100. With that she can keep SERN from ever noticing her use of the time machine.

Subjective point 7:

Personally I loved the pacing of the show. The first half is fun with hints of a growing darkness under the surface. Then in the middle that whole mess erupts and throws Okabe's mostly normal life into chaos. The second half is about him trying to undo all the little mistakes he unknowingly made in the first half and to return to his simple, fun life.
>> ARTICLE
I can respond to some of these, though it's been a while since I read S;G so I won't try to tackle some of the more complicated time travel "issues" since I don't have the details fresh in my mind. I've only seen a few clips of the anime, but I've read the VN so hopefully the details aren't too different.

>time stops, but it's incredibly unclear by what mechanism this occurs

If you're referring to the scenes such as when Mayuri is hit by the train and everything seems to freeze, that's very obviously done for dramatic effect. Time isn't actually freezing, it's just a directing choice that emphasizes Okabe's shock.

>John Titor, the alias used by Suzuha ought to have only existed in 2010 when she came back after time travel had first been created (caused by the first D-Mail being sent). However, Okabe goes through some grief about John Titor's original appearance in forums in 2000 to warn of the exact same future that the 2010 John Titor is warning of. However, the original Titor disappeared as a result of the first D-Mail being sent ...  John Titor shouldn't have existed until 2010, since that was when Suzuha arrived.

I'm not 100% sure if you're arguing about Titor's existence or the existence of the name "Titor" so I'll cover both bases. In the timeline where Okabe doesn't send the first D-Mail, SERN creates time travel and "rules the world." Suzuha comes back to 2000 to warn the world. In the timeline where Okabe DOES send the first D-Mail, the Future Gadget Lab discovers the secrets of time travel and SERN steals it. Suzuha comes back to 2010 near the date where SERN breaks in to the lab in order to prevent it from happening. Suzuha/Titor did NOT only exist in 2010.

As for the name, Itaru and the rest are still rebels in the Beta world lines, and thus he still takes on the name "Barrel Titor," leading to Suzuha taking the name. Hell, she even knows that Itaru is her father in this field, so it actually makes MORE sense that she would take on his name.

>I realize that for consistency and ease of understanding, including a real, substantive butterfly effect emulation in the show would have been incredibly difficult, but they chose to make it a major theme and then barely half-assed it instead.

This is just silly nitpicking. Accurate representation of the butterfly effect would have resulted in the entire show being a loop of the changing divergence meter. They did plenty when they showed how seemingly innocuous D-Mails significantly changed the world.

>Okabe goes back to just before the completion of the time leap machine a number of times, but never considers sending another D-Mail to try to solve the problem.

Mayuri's death and the capture of the Future Gadget Lab is a major event in history that all the Alpha timelines naturally converged on. Why risk making matters more complicated with more D-Mails when he has a surefire method of leaving the Alpha field and avoiding that event?

>The final step in saving Mayuri's life was to remove SERN's log of their original time travel activity. I am confused at this perhaps more than any other problem I have with the show. The removal of the log in the present should not have changed the past; that makes fundamentally no goddamn sense.

Why not? SERN's discovery of the Future Gadget Lab's activity is ultimately what decides the fate of Alpha worldlines. If they don't see the message, then the events of the Alpha field do not occur. I'm not sure if they went into this in the anime, but in the VN there is some ambiguity here; it is implied that perhaps that worldline simply ceases to exist since the events that define it can no longer occur.

>Why was there a loophole around fatalism? That Kurisu could be saved by tricking past Okabe into thinking she was dead? That makes no sense. Why would the 4th dimension care about what someone thought? That's like suggesting that I could walk through walls if I tricked myself into thinking the wall wasn't there. Our perceptions of dimensions and reality don't change how reality actually functions.

The point of tricking Okabe was that he would send the initial D-Mail and repeat the actions of the series to "close the loop" so to speak, it has nothing to do with the world line's "fate". Kurisu's death was not necessarily one of the Beta field's convergence points. Rather, it is more likely that Nakabachi stealing Kurisu's research was the convergence point, and Kurisu's death was just a likely occurrence considering she was not willing to simply let him steal her research.

John Titor shouldn't have existed until 2010, since that was when Suzuha arrived. There's an argument to be made for John Titor existing from 1975 onward, but that would only be in the timeline after the first D-Mail. The fact that a John Titor exists prior to the first D-Mail, warning of SERN's inevitable future conquest of the world is indicative of either a fairly glaring plot hole or else a hilariously improbably coincidence.


I'm just spitballing, but in the original timeline (before the first d-mail is sent) the John Titor handle could very well exist because of future Okabe's plan to get to the steins;gate timeline. Suzuha mentions that she stopped in 2000 and 1975. Due to future (original timeline) Okabe knowing about what transpired in the timeloop, he could've sent suzuha back to 2000 to appear as john titor to put forth in motion the events that cause the timeloop in the first place (aka original okabe's obsession with time travel/interrupting the lecture/starting the lecture since that idea of time travel was copied by the lecturer) , even if the future in question was the not the future of the original timeline's timeline

> 15) An extension of #14. Why doesn't Itaru's inevitable exploration into the field of time travel cause the events of the show to repeat themselves? Obviously he builds a time machine in the future, but this time around it doesn't cause SERN to log his behavior? How is that possible?


Okabe still has knowledge of what happened in the other timelines, they could easily stop their detection since they know about the monitoring system in 1975

My root issue is that this is a weak explanation meant specifically to allow the show to connect a pop culture reference to it. Okabe wouldn't have been reading that board unless he was interested in time travel in the first place, and the little bits and pieces of information Suzuha leaves on the board service to do nothing except give a wink and a nudge to the audience that the pop culture reference is relevant. An explanation about that being where his original interest developed would have to surf around the fact that 8 year old Okabe was on what was effectively 4chan, which isn't explicitly outside the realm of possibility, but again, I think it's a weak explanation that has more cultural reasoning than plot reasoning.
>> ARTICLE
what if suzuha wasn't there to spark okabe's interest in time travel but to give Dr Nakabachi the information needed to base his lecture on in ep 1? By getting called out, he was in a bad enough mood to whip out a knife and cause that altercation lol
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Steins;Gate in about a year and a half so forgive me if I make any mistakes, but I think I have a better grasp than most on the mechanisms underlying the plot. One of the first rules when examining Steins;Gate is that there are virtually zero plot holes once you fully examine it. If you think you've found one, chances are that someone has already thought of it and explained it.

Objective Criticisms:

3. I don't recall this happening with any clocks other than Mayuri's. If you can show me any specific instances of this happening I might be able to address that. As for Mayuri's watch stopping before she dies, this isn't meant to be examined very realistically but is instead symbolic of her time running out. It is as much an inevitability as Mayuri's death.

4. The original world line is on the Beta attractor field in which Suzuha successfully travels back to 1975 without losing her memory after a short pitstop in 2010. This is the Suzuha we see helping Okabe at the very end of the series. Presumably she sticks around and is unable to find the IBN 5100 in 1975. In 2000 she gives up hope on finding it and emerges as John Titor. 
After Okabe sends the first D-mail he shifts to the Alpha attractor field which causes the time machine to crash and lose functionality. Since she is now stuck in 2010, she emerges as John Titor in the present day instead of 2000.

6. This seems more subjective to me. There's a lot I could write about this one but I think I'll leave it at this: Suzuha's main goal (during the series on the alpha attractor field) was to find a way to alter the divergence enough to shift to a different attractor field. She had no knowledge of what the lab was doing at that time and she didn't want to screw things up any more by telling them the truth (if they'd even believe her). Note that she did warn Okabe about Kurisu, so its not like she did nothing.

7. This is adequately explained by the attractor field theory. Though minute changes can shift world lines, world lines making up attractor fields converge to a common point and on both major attractor fields, Suzuha is born. I don't think the butterfly effect was nearly as prevalent as you make it out to be. Definitely it was a factor early on, when Okabe was starting to learn the consequences of time travel, but as they made more and more changes, fewer of them actually had a noticeable effect. I really didn't feel like they stressed the butterfly effect once you got past the first few episodes that they played around with D-mail.

8. Don't think of Okabe as a real scientist (he's a fairly average college student with big ideas and big talk), especially during the period when Mayuri was continuously dying. He used the time-leap machine because it had the biggest immediate effect and gave him another chance to try saving Mayuri. Eventually he did realize that it was impossible and confided in Kurisu, a real scientist. They realized that sending d-mails in the past only made things worse, so undoing them seemed to be the most logical thing to do. I don't think sending new ones would have helped since they only seemed to lower the divergence.

12. Again, attractor fields. The show explained this pretty well, I don't see why you have to question it.

13. That's partly because this is a VN adaptation. The ending we see in the anime is called the true end which can only be unlocked in the VN by raising certain flags and you generally have to beat the game with a different ending first. Adapting games like this to anime is tough. Essentially the true end acts a reward to the player for slogging through all the bad ends. Beyond that, I don't know why you have a problem with it. Why does Okabe have to make an emotional sacrifice? Letting him win and overcome his problem is the best thing they could have done in my opinion, and I think this fits with the tone of the series. 

15. Uh what? Daru makes a time machine during WWIII in order to go back and prevent it from happening. We have no idea if time machines will ever be invented in the Steins;Gate worldline at the end. Clearly you are very confused on that point. 

Subjective

1. That's fair, but don't you think Okabe was the one most in need of growth? After all it was his ego and curiosity that caused all this shit to go down.

2. Also fair. Anime adaptation of VNs are always rough.

3. Japan is definitely pretty homophobic and transphobic. Okabe just finds the idea of being with another man revolting despite being attracted to Ruka and doesn't have the liberal attitude to allow himself to think of Ruka as actually being a girl. Its a very touchy subject of course, so don't expect a somewhat culturally backwards place like Japan to show it well. 

4. I think this one can be chalked down to the admittedly somewhat confusing way passage of time is handled in the second half. Sure Okabe probably spent years worth of time with Kurisu which gives him an edge, but Kurisu still spent plenty of time with Okabe as they went through those weeks. I think because of the stakes they were dealing with, and the fact that Okabe was constantly confiding in Kurisu and she saw the amount of pain he was in, she was able to develop a strong bond as well. 

5. Agreed. I don't know if you watched it subbed or dubbed, but the dub definitely saved Daru by getting a voice actor that actually sounds like a human. That still doesn't fix his character, but it makes him a bit more tolerable.

6. Its not deus ex since the pieces to do it were introduced in the first ten minutes of the series. Also, if you seriously think there was no cost for Okabe, you are very mistaken. The experiences he went through left a huge scar on him even if it did work out in the end. If you haven't seen the OVA and movie, go and do that right now as this is the main topic of them. 

7. I don't understand this complaint at all. The first half of the series is so rich in details and character growth. Rather than throw some shitty exposition at us and then toss us into the good parts, they showed us everything we needed to know naturally and let us grow to like the cast. It also has lots of details that are important later on to put the whole thing together.

I really hope this helps you to reconsider what I believe to be one of the best shows ever.

1. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9pgFoFO2kw&t=19m16s
This happens with fair frequency during his time trying to save Mayuri. The argument I'm hearing right now is that it's just symbolism done for dramatic effect, but I consider that a really bad directing decision to use an ambiguous time-based symbol in a show about time travel.

2. My problem is that her showing up in 2000 doesn't make sense insofar as character immersion goes. It's a plot device meant to make a pop culture reference relevant, but it feels very shoehorned.

3. For someone from the future, she sure had a flimsy idea of how to help. I guess at that point you could say it's more an issue with the writing.

4. The butterfly symbolism was present in virtually every episode. Whether or not Suzuha was born regardless of circumstances (which I consider suspect as well), the fact that nothing at all about her changes is bothersome, though I consider that an issue of format more than anything. A 24 episode show probably can't delve into it as much as I want, but suffice it to say, I think it is an unsatisfying explanation to note that despite how much they fiddle with the past, so few details actually change.

5. He didn't know about the divergence until halfway through his experiences trying to save Mayuri. It's an explanation, but like a lot of them, I'm not satisfied that it makes the most or even a lot of sense. A person in an adrenaline-filled and emotionally-crippled state is more like to see things in black-and-white, extremes, and binaries. Noting that there are exactly two ways that they know how to change the future, I can't believe it didn't occur to him even once to try changing history the second way.

6. Because "attractor fields" is basically yelling the word "science" and calling it an explanation, with just a tiny bit more meat on the bones. Mayuri's death as a necessity only makes sense if you say it "had" to happen, but you can't just say it "had to happen," and then walk away, there has to be a reason, and "attractor fields" isn't an actual reason. It's hand-waving.

7. Because the human experience doesn't have much in the way of straight up victories where everything winds up hunky dory. I find it an unrealistic portrayal of the human condition beyond making light of the sacrifice he had to make. It's the same reason I was pissed win Lin got her bending back in The Legend of Korra. It nullified her sacrifice, which was a huge and moving experience. Being human means accepting the terrible, awful shit that happens along with the amazing and beautiful stuff. That "oh thank God, everything worked out" moment doesn't usually happen, and it makes an experience fall flat at the end by removing the impact of the journey that led up to it.

8. Daru starts making a time machine. SERN was set up to catch time travel so they could progress their version of it (which they had clearly already been working on). Why didn't SERN catch him while he was making it the same way they caught the lab members in the beta timeline?

1-4 all fair.

5. There's a dub?! I normally go for that first. Welp.

6. He was emotionally scarred yes, but everything *worked out*, which is what I mean. It's a deus ex, regardless of whether or not they were planning it from the beginning. They had a way to turn his traumatic time travel experience into a situation where everything worked out despite all indications being that he would have to sacrifice *someone*. I haven't decided if I want to watch the OVA/movie yet. I probably will, but I'm pretty conflicted.

7. I have enjoyed and growing with the cast in more shows than I care to count. S;G is one show where I did not enjoy watching them, and I don't consider their time together growth. Kurisu had some forced growth to accept Okabe and Itaru. It's true that that the pacing would have felt *FAR* better if I liked the cast, so I suppose this point is null in light of other points I've made on the topic.

Unfortunately, this thread has only bumped my overall opinion of the show up by maybe half a point. My chief complaints being aesthetic choices with their cast and the final two episodes were the vast majority of my problem.

The rest of my complaints were things I wanted answers to, and the thread has given me a better sense of where I stand, but ultimately, they were items that, while confusing, were not large contributors to any downgrade in score.
>> ARTICLE
1. Huh, I'd forgotten about that. I think at the time I did assume that it was SERN tampering with things and I admit that is a bit of a problem that never gets explained. You've piqued my curiosity, so I'm going to take a look through the VN and see if I can find anything out about that.

2. Fair enough. I had no problem with it but I can understand how it might seem out place to you.

3. I think that just shows the desperate situation the future was in. Humanity was enslaved and knowledge was very limited, especially since Okabe and co. were dead or enslaved. Suzuha was part of the rebellion but probably didn't have a lot of knowledge about the specific events that led to that future. Remember that in the last couple episodes, the Suzuha we meet on the beta attractor field knows exactly what went down and exactly what to do to get to Steins;Gate. If we'd met this Suzuha from the start, nothing would have happened and the show would be pointless.

6/7. Look, Steins;Gate is a sci-fi show. Don't expect it to have a realistic scientific explanation for everything. The attractor field explanation makes a lot of sense following Mayuri's string of deaths in which Okabe begins to see her end as inevitable. In the end, Okabe overcomes this inevitability and saves Mayuri and Kurisu. The attractor field theory is the vessel to lead Okabe into depression and despair. Overcoming that, and beating the will of the universe, makes sense for his character growth. 

8. First of all, Daru and Okabe become leaders of a large faction. They're not just college kids who can easily be caught by SERN. Second, in the alpha attractor field, they actually do get killed by SERN. Third, SERN built a time machine first (with the unwilling aid of Kurisu) so it wasn't really an arms race at that point but a last effort Daru made to try to fix things.

2. I don't think you totally get the meaning of deus ex. The first episode laid the foundations to save both, therefore it can't be said that the solution came out of nowhere. Admittedly, I think the VN does show this a bit better since it takes more effort from the player to get the true end. And seriously, if you still think everything just worked out for Okabe with no lasting consequences you need to continue the series.

3. That's fair I guess. Steins;Gate was one of the first anime I watched that had a significant slice of life portion so it may have been easier for me to grow to like the cast (and again I really think watching it dubbed helped with some of the characters).

The scene where Mr. Braun kills Moeka and then himself isn't actually supposed to be in a construction yard and it's part of what is probably the largest difference between the anime and VN.


[VN Spoilers](/s "In the VN they don't go to a construction yard, instead the scene takes place at Mr. Braun's house and Nae is sleeping in her room. They have a similar conversation and like the anime Mr. Braun shoots himself in the head, however he doesn't kill Moeka.")

[VN Spoilers](/s "Okabe and Moeka go back to Moeka's apartment and meet Kurisu. She tells them that she saw Nae fleeing from the house. Shortly after there is a knock at the door and Moeka answers. It's Nae who casually greetings them and enters. Nae then steps behind Moeka and stabs her in the back with a cleaver. She tells Okabe that her father died because of him and that she'll never forgive him. She tells him that she'll kill him in 15 years and leaves, laughing as she goes. Moeka dies. Kurisu says that Okabe should send the D-mail but if you choose not to Okabe will jump back to before the meeting with Mr. Braun.")

[VN Spoilers](/s "This time Moeka talks to him alone, and Okabe and Kurisu wait outside for Nae. Mr. Braun kills himself and Nae jumps out the window and runs away. Okabe chases after her, Nae eventually gets tired and stops. Okabe asks her is she's going to kill Moeka and she answers and smiles. She tells him that blames Okabe and Moeka for her father's death. She tells him that she can't kill him now but that she will kill him in 15 years and Okabe asks what she means. ")

[VN Spoilers](/s "She answers that she killed him 15 years from now. Okabe doesn't understand. Nae tells him that she remembers the next 15 years. Nae suddenly pulls out a knife and stabs Okabe in the arm. Nae tells Okabe about how he was a resistance leader but she captured him and proceeded to torture him until she got bored then she killed him. She sticks her fingers in his wound to torture him.")

[VN Spoilers](/s "She tells him how SERN confiscated the Time Leap Machine and kept it locked up. After she killed Okabe she used the Time Leap Machine to jump back 15 years in 48 hour increments and that it took her 2738 leaps but she messed up a few times so it was really more like twice that. Earlier in the VN Okabe finds evidence that someone had used the Time Leap Machine. Nae tortures Okabe some more. Okabe realizes that he and Moeka ruined Nae's life and robbed her of 15 years. Nae eventually lets go and runs away. Okabe regrets building the time machine. Kurisu runs up and gives Okabe Mr. Braun's phone. Okabe sends the D-mail and undoes Moeka's D-mail.")


[Someone's Let's Play of the Above. Watch Ep. 70 and 71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6pZPQ-FL2M&index=79&list=PL1c48vsSrgUQx9V6KwWa8PSKV-NV1CVxp)

9: they don't need to be in the lab to send a D-mail. In the VN they send multiple D-mails from outside the lab. Someone, usually Daru is in the lab and prepares the Phone Microwave (turns it on, ensures the TV downstairs is on, etc.). Also in the VN Kurisu specifically mentions that the Phone Microwave is ready to send a D-mail.

10: When Okabe sends the D-mail and changes the world line he ends up exactly where the Okabe from that world line was. He often ends up in the same place he was before for plot reasons but there is a reason for that world line's Okabe to be there. However there are a few situations where this isn't the case. The situation you have pointed out is one of them because there isn't any reason for Okabe to go to that construction yard. In the VN he doesn't "teleport" to Moeka's apartment directly he finds himself in the middle of Akihabara and then goes to her apartment.

11: Having read the VN, the way I interpreted it was that deleting the log of the original D-mail changes everything is because SERN hasn't read it yet. SERN was running a large scale monitoring operation in an attempt to detect time travel communication. The D-mail was logged by an automated system but it hasn't necessarily been seen and investigated. At some point in the future someone investigates the message and it leads to SERN building their time machine and taking over the world.

Additionally if SERN is unable to build their time machine it means that Suzuha has a properly working time machine rather than the half-finished backwards only rebel time machine she had in the alpha attractor field world lines. As a result she doesn't crash into the building where Nakabachi's conference is being held and the conference isn't cancelled. This leads to time travel knowledge being published which starts the arms race that leads to World War III.

So if SERN doesn't see the original D-mail and Dr. Nakabachi isn't able to publish Kurisu's paper on time travel then we end up on the Stein's Gate world line and avoid both the Alpha and Beta attractor fields. As for Kurisu's survival I can't remember if there was a reason why that was necessary; it might be to avoid Okabe trying to build a time machine in an attempt to save Kurisu.
>> ARTICLE
> I realize that for consistency and ease of understanding, including a real, substantive butterfly effect emulation in the show would have been incredibly difficult, but they chose to make it a major theme and then barely half-assed it instead.

Wasn't it the opposite? Unless you change something big the world will keep converging to the same world line. That's the entire reason Okabe pulled the whole Operation Skuld thing.

> Philosophically, their explanation of having infinite universes is ill-thought out. Specifically, they don't understand what "infinite" means. There ought to be a universe for literally every possible thing happening, which means, there should be universes where Mayuri survives in the time-travel timeline. Fatalism in time travel is logically/inherently at odds with an infinite timeline multiverse theory.

Is dealt with in the same way. The whole idea of world lines is that they are quasi-quantified sizes of change, and that each "larger" world line will cause anything within a certain size of change to converge. 


>> ARTICLE
> and that each "larger" world line will cause anything within a certain size of change to converge. 

Except that they didn't qualify this part, which was my problem. Obviously moe culture wasn't "important" enough to warrant convergence, so it went away. How many lives were changed because of that? Being born a different gender apparently isn't important enough? And what about Feyris' dad? Why wasn't he important enough to converge?

The thing is, this notion of "important" is arbitrary and based on human attributions of value. Time is a dimension and gives no fucks about what happens to one person.

The only reasonable explanation along this line of thought is about the likelihood of finding a universe based on the statistical probability that certain elements in it will come to pass. For example, SERN becoming ruler along the beta timeline. I'm willing to accept that SERN wins in virtually all timelines sprouting from the beta timeline. I think the idea of "infinite" allows for situations where they don't win, but it's statistically much more likely that they find one where SERN *does* win because in all versions of this timeline, they have time travel.

But a single person's death? That shouldn't be any more or less statistically likely than it is normally (which is to say highly unlikely).
>> ARTICLE
Personally I had 2 main issues with Steins;gate.  From a sci-fi perspective I found its treatment of timetravel to be a bit too much on the fantasy side of things and not on the science side.  For instance, Reading Steiner, an ability possessed by Okabe that lets him and him alone detect changes in the timeline has no explanation.  Later in the series they put forth the concept of emotions and memories from other timlines leaking into eachother for no clear reason.  Why are emotions able to defy space-time barriers again?  

The second issue I had was with how conspicuously the supporting characters were targeted at particular fetishes.  You had a tsundere (an admittedly very good one), a meido, a trap, etc.  It felt too much like pandering to me.

These things didn't stop me from enjoying the series but it made me fall short of calling it a masterpiece.  8/10
>> ARTICLE
I agree entirely with your criticisms.
>> ARTICLE
Objective 3

Literary elements are a thing, and just because its a SciFi show doesn't mean that everything that appears on screen is actually physically happening. When Mayushi dies, it's like the world and all of time have stopped in Okabe's mind. That nothing matters to him without her as his best friend, and the viewers experiencing the events through his mind see the clocks stop. It doesn't have to literally mean the clocks have stopped. Even when series don't heavily use literary elements, many will still use some during a climactic or central point to create a certain mood or impact. I would argue this is one of those times.

Objective 7 

The butterfly effect is also shown in the arc where okabe first uses the dmail and changes the (shrine maiden trap I can't remember his name)'s gender. It's relevant because it shows a branch of world lines that diverges only slightly and based solely on that character's mother's eating habits. In other words, the butterfly effect is relevant because it causes the world lines to diverge into observable sections.

Objective 12

The way they lay it out, yes everything is possible, but without going back a certain amount where possibilities branch out further, certain things can't be changed. What can and can't be changed is arbitrary, but it is spelled out that the parallel universes work that way. There are an infinite total, but certain paths in certain branches have specific constraints. Mayushi can't be revived because the world line would need to be reversed much further to the point where it could branch out far enough. There is only one or a few very specific world lines that span a different branch within his reach that happen to have a "happy ending", and those are explained by being within divergence.

Subjective 3

This is a valid point, but I took it more that he pulled it off so well and so effectively that he was really effectively feminine and cute and okabe thought he was attractive and the joke was that he would want to date him if he weren't biologically male, which isn't really transphobic (especially because I don't think he actually identified as female or trans but was simply a very feminine male). I could see it interperated that way though.

~~~~~

Just as a side note, you're getting down votes in your posts because you are basing some of your criticism on things you simply didn't understand or refused to understand about critical plot points. Its hard to take you seriously in some cases where your criticism seems to stem from simple confusion about certain things (or at least a willful refusal of suspension of disbelieve given this multiverse's rules which is a big nono). Not that it doesn't speak something about the anime that it confused you (or somehow insulted your interpretation of multiverse theory), but at the same time it really hurts the points you make.

I don't think s;g is a 10/10 either (my problem is also that the first 8 or so episodes are drawn out), but it matters if you experienced it in a similar frame as everyone else did.  Its like criticizing starwars and complaining that their FTL drives aren't physically possible and that it detracts from the entire piece as an experience, when most people are going to assume that in the movie's context that FTL is possible and interpret it that way.

The hourglass stops several moments before the first time Mayuri is murdered. Okabe takes off of the shelf and looks at it oddly after Suzuha runs from the room.

If that's a literary element, it's done *VERY* much like an actual storytelling element meant to be taken at face value.

> What can and can't be changed is arbitrary, but it is spelled out that the parallel universes work that way.

That's an unsatisfying explanation to me. That sending the first D-Mail is the root cause of her death does not make sense, and the fact that it is arbitrary is incredibly bothersome to me, hence my complaint.
>> ARTICLE
Also, to address the second point, is it really implied that if the email hadn't been sent that mayushi would be okay? I don't remember. 

My impression based on what I remember is that the situation in which SERN doesn't find out about the microwave (or decides not to seize it) is essentially arbitrary and based on seemingly unrelated circumstance that leads to the correctly branching world line.
>> ARTICLE
> is it really implied that if the email hadn't been sent that mayushi would be okay? I don't remember. 

Well, they explicitly state that crossing the divergence line should allow her to survive.

But then is it implied that the dmail is directly related to the divergence line? I'm just not properly equipped to argue this since its been so long, I just feel like it made sense when I watched it.
>> ARTICLE
The whole show after episode 15 or so, when he gets the divergence counter from Suzuha, becomes about crossing the divergence line which requires undoing the first D-Mail, which would imply that they are inextricably linked (which makes sense, since the first D-Mail gave SERN the ability to research time travel enough to rule the world apparently)

I edited a lot of things and stuff, because my mind is always all over the place. I didn't edit that part though.

My memory is not fantastic, hence not addressing that specifically, but it could easily be a coincidence meant to foreshadow or deepen the impact of the next scene. The fact that you are looking for it to be literal or caused by something is perhaps the underlying shortcoming in the direction of the piece and a weakness of using those kind of elements sparingly.

I concede it is presented strangely. Maybe its the kind of thing that was more clear in the VN and didn't translate well during animation.

My guess is still poorly directed foreshadowing intending to build suspense, but there could possibly be an unstated technical reason. The SERN hit team is pretty spooky after all. Maybe they'd been experimenting with time tech or something strange. I agree its weird that nothing is stated if that's the case.

This was posted a while ago but I just finished watching now, so if you still feel like reading I thought I'd give you my take one of your  points.

-

>**8**.Upon Mayuri's string of deaths wherein Okabe attempts to change the past 48 hours in order to prevent her death, there's a conspicuous lack of consideration for sending another D-Mail. They never explicitly state that the time leap machine was created at the expense of the Phone Microwave, which allowed the sending of D-Mails, and even if they did, Okabe goes back to just before the completion of the time leap machine a number of times, but never considers sending another D-Mail to try to solve the problem. It seems odd that the "obvious" solution would be to undo the previous D-Mails rather than send new ones. For a scientist, he sure didn't expend all of his options before systemically ruining several peoples' lives in order to save Mayuri.

My thoughts were that using the D-mail was unreliable/unsafe/unpredictable due to the butterfly affect(although it's not like they showed any concern for that before with the previous D-mails.). If Okabe decides to send a D-mail back telling himself to not send D-mail or something similar, butterfly affect could possibly result in consequences such as people(Okabe, Hashida or Makise) dying or failure to produce the time leap device. Which ultimately means failure to save Mayuri and also D-mail as the only way fix things, which is again unreliable and likely to lead to more problems. 

Basically D-mail doesn't return him to the past, if he fucks up shits likely to be really fucked up. Seeing as he was at most 48 from Mayuri's death and the D-mails lead to her death 1 day earlier, they could be possibly killed/captured by that point.

Okay, I didn't think this through enough, since I now have about 30-50 people talking to me all at once. Rather than respond to each person individually, I pretty much have to just make an additional post, and that sucks, because virtually no one will know I saw their post and actually thought about it.

But, to address the most common answers:

1. Covered.

2. You guys aren't really understanding my problem here. It comes down to a hilarious coincidence. Feyris' dad gave away the IBN 5100 when she was a kid. Him having to sell it when she was taken "hostage" means that he still had it shortly before his death (since he died on that trip). If an "agent" didn't buy it from him in the original timeline, it means he gave it away pretty much *right* before he died. Meaning that he had to have been given an offer for the IBN 5100 basically right when he got the ransom demand. It's an issue with suspending my disbelief that a SERN agent just so happened to be in the area that day (or that week, or that month) but never before that point. That amounts to crazy happenstance.

3. The stopwatch is not the only thing that stops. The hourglass also stops. This could be for dramatic effect, but I think in a show about time travel, they chose a shitty dramatic effect to use, since it creates ambiguity as to what kind of time control actually exists in their universe. If it's not an unexplained time travel mechanism, then it's a poorly-conceived directional device.

4. You guys aren't getting my issue again. Suzuha went to 2000 to post on some forums about stopping WWIII, even though she could have gone pretty directly to 2010, picked up Okabe, and stopped WWIII that way. There was no point in doing it other than to satisfy a pop culture reference. That's a shoehorn if ever I've seen one.

5. So she was working under duress- awesome. I'll amend that in the post. The show doesn't really address it, which I maintain is something of a problem, but whatevs.

6. The answers I'm getting on this one are pretty much telling me that either the VN might handle it or to stop reading into it; neither of which are particularly good counters, since my post is a critique of the show. Her not knowing who her dad was is asinine. Her not telling Okabe who she was because she was afraid of changing the future makes less sense, since she befriended him and got a *job* pretty quickly into it. For someone who was afraid of the butterfly effect, she sure didn't mind inserting herself around Okabe's life in other ways.

7. I actually didn't catch much in the way of responses on this one- I'll have to check back through the hundred messages on this post T_T

8. The response that he was being irrational is fair, but it strikes me that the first thing someone would try after a time leap would be a D-Mail to change the past, and it strikes me as such an obvious second step, that I'm not sure how willing I would be to believe that it just never crossed his mind.

12. What I'm getting here is that most people seem to accept the show's vague-ass non-answer about Convergence Fields or whatever. Look, if you can suspend your disbelief on issues like that, awesome, more power to you. I have a harder time with that, and that's part of why I wrote this post. What the show did was effectively shout the word "SCIENCE!" from atop a building and then dust its hands off, congratulating itself for a job well done.

You can't just *tell* me that there's a very good reason why that specific and *very* apparently arbitrary aspect of time can't be changed, but then not tell me what that reason is. That's a parent saying "because I said so."

13-14. I see the explanation you guys are offering, and I hadn't given that much consideration. Kurisu being dead in the original timeline only because Okabe killed her would explain things for me. That having been said, it was a deliberate move from start to finish in order to make the audience feel good, which still functions to negate the entire emotional affect of the first 22 episodes. I would, at that point, relegate it to a more subjective complaint.

I'm sorry, I know some of you have probably even addressed *these* responses, but there are 100 comments in this thread, and many of them are *very* long, so getting to them is a process.

Except nobody is saying that. The show/VN gives reasons and explanations for how things work, and those explanations are pretty damn consistent. If you don't want to accept them then that's your problem, not the story's. Suspension of disbelief is critical for a science fiction story because (surprise!) it purposefully integrates elements of actual science with fictional science.
>> ARTICLE
The show tells you a very small and very vague amount about Convergence Fields and indicates that her death was somehow triggered by the first D-Mail.

That's not an explanation. It's a parent telling you "because I said so."

Whether or not the VN goes into real depth on it is irrelevant, since I didn't watch and write a critique on the VN.
>> ARTICLE
As a huge S;G fan, I wanted to thank you for giving such an in depth criticism of the show. You really made me think about the show on another level and actually made me appreciate it more.

I'm sure you're really overwhelmed with replies and responses to your points, so if they aren't already cleared up/don't get cleared up soon I'll post my take on them. But in the meantime, just wanted to say I appreciate you starting a good conversation on the show :) 
>> ARTICLE
The amount downvoting OP is receiving for this post is retarded. I like Steins;Gate, but wow. 

The hivemind mentality of circlejerking as hard as you can about how great this series is to just downvote /u/Janube's criticisms of the series is, sadly, expected. I enjoyed the read, thank you.  
>> ARTICLE
Appreciate it. Frankly, given the voting pattern for the other S;G criticism threads I saw, I was expecting this to be a firm 0 and another write-up I could ignore after the fact.

And several of my criticisms were either not worded well enough, or had reasonable answers to them that I either forgot or missed in my first run through.

Lastly, I'm also using "objective" in a non-traditional sense, and it probably comes off as pretty pompous. So, I understand the hesitancy by the community to take my criticisms of a beloved show at face value.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it is that as much as that a lot of the criticisms are based on misunderstandings rather than truly being objective. Also, it got gilded, so I think it is okay. 

There is a pretty prevalent anti S;G circle jerk that you see just as much these days, as there is with anything in the MAL top 25, aside from Gintama. I don't think I've ever seen people talk shit about it even for being popular. I guess that is something. Maybe it is because not a lot of people have actually watched enough of it due to the episode amounts.

I don't know. I just know that a lot of S;G knee-jerking is popular, and has been just as noticeable as the circle-jerking since it has been in the MAL top 3.
>> ARTICLE
I disliked Steins;Gate more than you for a lot of the same reasons, I would have given it a 5 or 6 out of 10. it certainly has potential but I feel like in a show that is trying to be some kind of hard science fiction and have an internal logic for how time travel works, it has a few big plot holes.

And also I really dislike the cast. Intensely.

Anyways, fantastic critique, you really do cover a lot of the major problems with the show.

As you have seen a lot of people are going to say you have shit taste, say you are just bandwagoning on the Steins;Gate hate train for karma (even though a large majority of this sub seems to love the show and accepts no criticism).

Don't let the haters get you down.
>> ARTICLE
Damn man, it's like you wanted Steins Gate to publish an entire journal on time travel instead of using plot devices here and there.
>> ARTICLE
I indeed rated this show a 10 and I know why it was a 10 for me.
This show had (imo) an amazing story, likable characters, one of the most well-done endings i have seen and it made me think. It nade me think extremely hard, since I did not get everything the first time I watched it. After 1 or 2 rewatches I kept seeing new things, came up with my own theories for "plot-holes" to stop them from being plot-holes and it made me think about time traveling as a whole.

And one thing I loved a whole lot was:
In movies there are large time traveling plotholes: when you kill someone in the past to set things right in the future, you wouldnt need to go back in time to kill him, so that that someone can become weird again so he has to be killed creating a loop.
What I loved about steins gate was that the end seemed to 'perfectly' overlap with the first episode. Okabe would always have to go back in time, even after the last episode, not creating such a weird loop.

I dont know, I learnt to appreciate this series more and more after some think sessions and rewatches. It will always be one of my alltime favourites.
>> ARTICLE
Almost all of your "objective" complaints are you not understanding what happened. Just because you didn't understand (what other people do, need I mind you), that doesn't make a show not good. 

Your criticism should be updated to: they need to explain things easier. And then you could list the specific details of what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
You misunderstand my use of objective vs. subjective.

It's the distinction between technicals, logic, and explanations vs. aesthetics and direction in this context.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean, but most people are going to assume it as the meaning of "factual" vs "opinion."

I know it would be weird, but labeling it Technical complaints would be more accurate.

That being said, most of your "objective" complaints could be turned into one complaint, and then details given to explain the contexts in the show. I know you didn't know ahead of time that many of those complaints were actually explained/made sense in the show, but if you were to change it, that would be a nice overhaul and would help with the size of the post for those who may not read it because of that.
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, did you even watch the show?
>> ARTICLE
My 2c to most of your complaints is you missing the point of the show completely. Your most fatal flaw, apart from long winded sentences, is your point #1. Sure it's been corrected, but *come on*, I can't take you seriously if you missed that initially. You insist on some rules you yourself make, showing us your suspension of disbelief is close to null.

How much you care about Kurisu's death, for example. She was dead. Okabe did suffer. He thought of a solution that works for most of us, and makes sense. You were dead set from the get go to see a show that you didn't get to see, because you had expectation that weren't met. Too bad for you, sorry. I enjoyed the show, and I realized it's a show about time travel, where a certain degree of disbelief is required.
>> ARTICLE
I'll assume you've read the responses to your objective and subjective issues (and hopefully acknowledged that just because you think something is incorrect or unexplained doesn't mean it is necessarily so). 

With that, I would like to ask why you would give Steins;Gate a 7/10 if it really was "close to a truly amazing show" without many red flags. While the pacing of the show is slow initially, it certainly doesn't extend to the first 10 episodes. The harem issue wasn't even an issue, since it was hardly flaunted like other anime. I don't understand your issue with Itaru, and I don't think you will truly understand how the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe was developed, as well as the "negated" effects of time travel, until you've watched the OVA and the movie, both of which do an extremely nice job of wrapping up the series, as well as addressing your subjective issues 4 and 6. 

I don't expect you to change your mind and give the series a 10, but it certainly does not deserve a 7 because of your misunderstood "objective" and your insubstantial subjective issues (especially numbers 4, 5, and 6) 
>> ARTICLE
Look, if you can't relate to any of the characters and you think they're terrible tropes, and it doesn't bother you, that's cool.

It made me *hate* the first 7-10 episodes, and I only kept watching because I knew there was a good plot hiding underneath.

That's enough to drop it 1.5 points. A half point for what I consider to be a bad job explaining a number of issues or phoning in some issues. The third point is because of the happy ending that was written to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy, even though it inadvertently invalidated the struggle and sacrifice that was made throughout the last ten episodes or so.

You can disagree with me if you want, but the ending and the characters are a huge part for me. If the whole show was like the middle chunk, easy 9/10+. It wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not going to argue with you about the characters because clearly we have irreconcilable opinions. But once again, you can't expect to be fed explanations for everything in the series, especially when a good number of your "objective" issues are either misconceptions or adequately explained by other people.

But even if you refuse to budge on that, I'll respect it. What I don't understand is your third point deduction for the ending, because the ending did NOT invalidate the struggle of the entire series just because Okabe made it to the Steins;Gate world line and no one else remembers the struggle and sacrifice. I agree with you that the ending and the characters are extremely important. If anything, the ending is a validation of Okabe's struggle and sacrifice, even if at the cost of everyone else's dreams (which I actually find to be less warm and fuzzy, and more realistic). If you watched the movie, you would understand how time travel and its effects have not left Okabe unscathed. I am willing to understand, to some degree, your first and second point deductions, but I strongly disagree with your third point deduction.

Well anyway, I hope you do watch the movie and the OVA, because I really enjoyed both (and neither feature much of the other characters you found annoying).
>> ARTICLE
Where is teh TLDR; ?
>> ARTICLE
TL;DR: Relatively minor technical or explanatory problems in conjunction with awful characters and an unsatisfying ending make Steins;Gate mediocre despite the amazing 10 episodes that comprise its middle.
>> ARTICLE
Now make one about SAO! 

2/10
>> ARTICLE
SAO would be a bit harder for me. I have a degree in philosophy, and the logic of time travel is something I feel like I can go through with logic and precision. With SAO, I pretty much have to take them at their word that the game world can function the way it does, even when it doesn't make much sense.

If you want me to, I completely will though, since I loved the first half and hated the second half of the first season (that seems to be one of the common reactions)
>> ARTICLE
Well, SAO world is based on a rpg game, and it is beyond crap.
>> ARTICLE
I actually really liked the first half of the first season. I thought they mostly did a good job, other than a few things that really stuck out to me as a game designer as being impossible or problematic in a game world. They too had the harem problem goin' on everywhere, but I liked in general what they did with it all.

How can someone like an english no-name over Hanazawa Kana is beyond me. "Mad scientisto" is not even in there, so dubs being better is arguable.

I hope you're a troll, because J. Michael Tatum isn't an "English no-name". He's one of the more prolific voice actors that Funimation has. Most of what he does is either on par or better than the original seiyuu.

Just check out his credits: http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/J-Michael-Tatum/

I was talking about Mayushi's VA, unless HanaKawa voiced Okabe.

Because the English voice actor is incredible. He sells Okabes descent into madness a lot more than the original Japanese voice actor. Tatum has a lot range and he really captures the emotional journey Okabe goes through. I've seen both versions and was blown away by how much I preferred the dub.

The best part of that scene is that the black guy avoids pretty much all of the "dumb black guy" stereotypes by speaking back to him in perfectly acceptable Japanese. I kind of wish the black guy had more of a reaction to it, though. An "are you fucking kidding me" face would have been perfect.

It's an interesting and unique show from the beginning and although I don't want to say it starts off slow, I will say that there will be an episode in which it goes from a good show to one over level 9000 real real quick and the show just stays intense through the ending.  

I've watched the series a few times with different groups of friends and every time after the same episode their disposition goes from a "lets binge watch something" mentality to a "I need to watch this and only this until there is no more."

Funny, you're like the opposite of the majority which loves the second half but thinks the first is too slow. (i personally loved every single moment)

Also though for what it's worth,okabe was never actually supposed to be passed off as a highly intelligent character. His facade comes off that way but it's not actually who he is. He's just a normal person stuck in a not so normal persons hell.
>> ARTICLE
Do people not like the first half? I loved it, more so than the second. I liked it's slice of life feel that's leaps and bounds better than other totally slice of life shows. The way the characters just HAD fun, they were just a group of friends who liked to hang out. I have a hard time getting into that style of story but Steins;Gate pulled it off spectacularly. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that Okabe isn't supposed to be highly intelligent. I guess thinking about it now, he wasn't "smart" smart, but I still think he was intelligent. He knew a decent amount about the time travel stuff, or at least picked it up quickly while he was going through the whole ordeal.

By the end you do see him admitting that his alter ego and things are actually just a load of crap. It shows that he is just a bit of a regular guy, though I guess you could say he's still a little crazy.

Hey guys, my watch is broken...

Edit: 

Also here's a little anecdote, when I first heard of steins gate I thought it was a horror anime which i suppose isn't far from the truth in the end. I muddled up the word "steins" with the german word "schwartz" which means black, aka "Black;gate". So I held off on watching it because I thought it was a so and so horror series. Not only was I wrong but it became my favourite anime. :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha, nice one. At least you ended up watching and enjoying it. I suppose you could say Steins;Gate is a bit of *psychological* horror, but certainly no demons/death/gore here.

The character interaction is what I loved most from it.

Like I said, I did think it would go another way, but regarding character interaction, Steins;Gate definitely succeeded.

No. Not yet. Are they good continuations of the show?

**edit** -- I watched the OVA. It was quite enjoyable. Slightly confused as to why Kurisu was friends with everyone. I thought she wouldn't know them that well since she hadn't yet met them in that worldline, right? It still made sense though, and the ending was nice.

The movie was quite good. Well worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the OVA, and everyone is saying the movie is good too. Looking forward to watching, but I might wait a little bit for the dub since that's what I've watched so far.

She was friends with them in the OVA because of [](/s "her pseudo reading steiner. everyone has it, okabes is just an extreme case where he remembered everything. you see this pop up during the date with Ruka, where "she" remembers when "he" was pestered by guys for looking like a girl.")

[](/s "when Kurisu ran into okabe in the end of the series, her memories came back of the other world lines.")

edit: also, read the Epigraph side stories. you learn more about daru's interactions with the person who ends up being suzuhas mom.
>> ARTICLE
Ok. That obviously all makes sense. I just wasn't getting how much she actually remembered, especially because she seemed to be confused about her "dreams." It felt like she was as friendly with them as she'd ever been, but it does make sense.

And I'll go looking for those side stories. Thanks!

>  Still, I cannot believe that's how two (Okabe and Kurisu) brilliant scientists would conduct experiments ON A TIME MACHINE! Something essentially brand new to science.      

IIRC Kurisu was the only "brilliant" one. Okabe was fairly book smart, but he was also immature. Even after creating the microwave time machine, he mostly just dicked around with it to see what would happen. He was too caught up in the excitement to consider the possible repercussions of his actions.       

However, the key word is "was." Over the course of the show, he matured and took responsibility for his actions, eventually saving everyone.      

> The Okabe from episode one thinks he sees Kurisu dead, but he later becomes the person to "kill" her. That's an endless cycle that will keep occurring, right?      

Only in THAT world line.
>> ARTICLE
> Only in THAT world line.

Oh boy. Now I'm a little confused again. Maybe. Help me out here.

The worldline from episode one, let's call it worldline A. It branches out each time someone sent a dmail. So after the first one that was accidentally sent, there was one branch. So Okabe was now on Branch 1 of worldline A. With each new dmail, there is a new branch. Now, is each new branch stemming from the previous branch? If I'm being unclear, I'm thinking of it like a tree. The trunk is worldline A, the original. Branch 1 is attached to the trunk. Branch 2 is not attached to the trunk, it's attached to Branch 1. So Branch 3 is attached to Branch 2, and so on.

By the end, Okabe worked backwards and destroyed each branch until he was back on worldline A (the tree trunk). Right? Or is it technically different, because in this new worldline he destroys Kurisu's research and stops SERN.

I guess, what I'm asking is how different is the original worldine from episode from the worldline in the final episode? I may just be overthinking this here, but I'm definitely a little lost.

I'm not trying to put you on the spot, /u/magnificent_schlong. Anyone can answer this.
>> ARTICLE
How I took it was that there were say two trees. Tree A and Tree B. In episode one, before the first D-Mail was sent (the Kurisu one), Okabe is in Tree B, The Beta Line. But when he sends the first D-mail, it takes him to Tree A. The reason for this is because Okabe will always, always, always send this D-mail. This is why they call Tree A, the "attractor" line, because so many possible variants stem from tree A because of how many possibilities are created from the three (or four) other D-mails after the Kurisu one. 

Tree B (the beta line) is actually, technically, never different from the first episode to the final episode. Okabe is always there watching his past self look at a totally not dead Kurisu, but still old okabe will always send the first D-mail because he has to. As much as Mayuri's death was written in stone, so is every single D-mail Okabe and his team will write. 

So to sum up, Tree B is technically Steins;Gate from the first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
> So to sum up, Tree B is technically Steins;Gate from the first episode.

But in that same worldline, WW3 occurs, does it not? Only after Okabe uses Suzuha's time machine can he correct the worldline at which point it becomes "Steins;Gate."
>> ARTICLE
so when he says THAT WORLD LINE, he means that [](/s "in the beginning, okabe goes to the conference. other okabe is there at the time, sees Kurisu, freaks out, so she asks regular okabe, and he doesn't know. other okabe ends up killing her, despairs, gives up, returns to his time. this leads to Epigraph, where he gives up. later, other okabe in 2036 sends the d-mail  that is viewable after main okabe fails to make sure he tries again, preventing a cycle. this instead causes okabe to go back a second time, cut himself to fake the illusion of the okabe that isn't him from seeing what main okabe saw, but keeping her alive.")

...I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's the world line fuckery for the main thing.

TLDR

[](/s "pre Epigraph okabe kills Kurisu in main okabe time, gives up, Epigraph happens. sends back d-mail so main okabe retries. success, saving Kurisu, cuts self so the okabe that is him from the past still sees her bloody, but ends up living, true end.")
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but feel like it actually is a cycle. I'm not sure if anything of what I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3cm0nz/steinsgate_i_recently_finished_the_series_and_id/csx28tc) is true at all, but this is how I'm now seeing it.

Although after reading your post, I'm trying to think of a how far-future Okabe fits into it. I haven't read Epigraph, so for now I've only to go on what you've said.

So on the worldline from episode one, that original Okabe without all of the reading steiner memories is the one who eventually sends the text back in time to tell the reading steiner Okabe (our Okabe) to continue fighting, and to save Kurisu?

So the 2036 Okabe somehow eventually finds out about his reading steiner. However he wasn't aware of it when he was in 2010, or rather had no opportunities to use it yet. So 2036 Okabe sends a text back in time in hopes that eventually a version of himself that has been using reading steiner would eventually fall into (in this case, back into) the same worldline in 2010 (the original one from the first episode).

I sincerely hope I'm making sense. I'm writing so much.
>> ARTICLE
you're mostly there I think, but not all the way. or, I'm messing up.

[](/s "pre-Epigraph future okabe went through almost the exact same situation main character okabe goes through, but gives up after he goes back in time once and Kurisu dies. that scream okabe hears at the beginning is pre-Epigraph future okabe failing. then, main okabe gets the d-mail from 2036 Epigraph okabe on how he should not give up. so main okabe re-does the events of episode one in a way that past-Mayuri doesn't get a metal upa, Kurisu doesn't die, and shes all bloody because main okabe cuts his abdomen open. instead of the scream of terror from Epigraph okabe seeing Kurisu dead and bloody because of him, it's a scream of pain from main okabe that past okabe hears.")

this causes past okabe to see almost the exact same thing that main okabe did, but causes the world to enter the Steins Gate worldline AKA end of the series.

edit: i see what you're getting mixed up

you thought I meant Epigraph okabe had a separate life from main okabe. they had almost exact experiences before the crucial moment. then Epigraph okabe goes to his normal timeline and lives "normally", with [](/s "Kurisu dead.") this causes Epigraph to happen and then in 2036 Epigraph okabe sends back the d-mail to main okabe.

it's confusing, but I can pm you if you need more understanding!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I read a quick bit about Epigraph to help out here. I love what you've written. That's all so cool.

Still slightly confused. When Okabe fails the first time to save Kurisu and gives up, he returns to the future (on the same WW3 Beta worldline) with Suzuha? He grows old, nuts up, and creates a message telling his past self to try one more time.

I think my main confusion is that, um, how is this occurring on the same worldline Okabe? If that's even correct.

Maybe I'm also confused. When they use Suzuha's time machine, does that change the worldline like using the Phone Microwave? I don't think it does.
>> ARTICLE
okay, I actually don't know the answer to that. I'd guess it's like this, not sure:

it's not on a separate world line, just the future of that worldline. when main okabe succeeds, the changes the worldline to the Steins;Gate worldline, and Epigraph okabe doesn't really matter anymore. edit: maybe he just becomes the future okabe of that worldline and remembers the events of Epigraph?

suzuhas machine doesn't change the worldline like the microwave, just takes them to the future or past of that worldline.

also, thanks for what you said! glad i could help explain!

edit:pretty sure you are right about the return. he goes back to his time on his worldline, and since it's the beta worldline, WWIII happens in the future of that worldline. I think that's what Epigraph will lead up to in part 3.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just wondering how the Okabe who failed and lived in 2036 never received a message himself telling him to try one more time. So it's not a cycle? OH MY GOD. Ok. I kept thinking it was a cycle of Okabe going back and faking Kurisu's death. I'm an idiot. You even said it yourself. The first time Okabe sees Kurisu she actually is dead. The second time he fakes it.

So he's not changing the worldlines anymore to fix things, he's rewriting history within that worldline. So that worldline technically is the same exact one in the first and last episode, but Okabe was able to successfully utilize Suzuha's form of time travel to change the outcome. (/u/Reptile449 you were right, I guess. Same worldine.)

I think that 2036 Okabe existing on the same worldline as our main Okabe is the only thing that I'm still struggling with, but other than that I think I've understood everything.

Once again, thanks. You (and everyone else here) have been a big help.
>> ARTICLE
Man the mind-fuck doesn't stop after the watching the show 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently not. This is worse than just watching the show alone, but it's all so interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, if I remember correctly...     

Everything you said is correct, except for one crucial detail: there are TWO "tree trunk" timelines. During episode 1, Okabe jumps from trunk A to trunk B by accidentally sending the first Dmail. We see this when, after he texts Daru about Kurisu's body, the people disappear from around him. He spends most of the show on Trunk B, and gets back to Trunk A by the end.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, reading [this entry](http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Attractor_Field) helped solve some things.

It seems like what I was calling the tree trunks are actually Attractor Fields. Attractor Fields are a grouping of a bunch of worldlines that have different events, but they all lead to the same end result.

After the accidental first dmail, Okabe didn't just shift worldlines, but shifted Attractor Fields. So he jumped to the Alpha Field, yes, maybe? This is where all worldlines lead up to the point of SERN creating a time machine and taking over the world. The worldlines all take place on the divergence meter between 0%-0.99%. Future Okabe and Suzuha help Okabe stop this Alpha Field from happening. By undoing the dmails, Okabe gets back to the Beta Field (from episode one).

In the Beta Field, all the worldlines lead up to WW3. These worldlines exist from 1%-1.99%. This is why they were trying to get the meter above 1%, to get back to the Beta Attractor Field. This was lost on me a bit while I was watching, sorry if it was obvious. Ok, so even in episode one, something bad was going to happen even if Okabe never sent the first dmail. However, they somehow learn about WW3, and Okabe prevents Kurisu's father from stealing the research. Okabe has created a worldline in the Beta Field that does not lead to WW3 like all the other Beta Field worldlines do. This worldline is dubbed Steins;Gate.

/u/Morthra, help me out here. You seemed to have knowledge about the Attractor Feilds and stuff. Any chance you know if I'm making any sense at all?
>> ARTICLE
That's basically correct, with some minor alterations.

According to the original VN, the Steins;Gate worldline isn't part of any attractor field at all. However, with inferences made through supplemental materials (most notably the Phenogram of Linear Restraint VN) it's highly likely that Okabe's interference with Suzuha on July 28th unknowingly shifted the divergence closer to 1%.

My own personal theory also revises attractor fields from being discrete outcomes to being more of a continuum, similar to how worldlines within attractor fields exist on a continuum (as eventually, even the Attractor Fields converge on some outcome, but that could take centuries to show up)
>> ARTICLE
> According to the original VN, the Steins;Gate worldline isn't part of any attractor field at all.

That's cool, and it technically makes sense since it doesn't end up converging at the same point as the others.

> as eventually, even the Attractor Fields converge on some outcome

So, just increasing the scale. Attractor Fields essentially become worldlines for even bigger Attractor Fields. Once I realized what Attractor Fields actually were I thought about this. You're making me want to think about it more. That would be wild, and incredibly depressing. How many worldlines and Attractor Fields would you have to jump around to and fix in order to make sure the "super" Attractor Fields didn't end badly?

That would make for an interesting sequel series.

Thanks for your help with all this. Definitely cleared a lot up for me.
>> ARTICLE
I think the original worldline is the same as the ending one, if you compare the first episode to the last the same events happen. Whereas in the other worldlines there are variations on the original.
>> ARTICLE
The Steins;Gate worldline (at least according to my theories substantiated by the Phenogram VN) isn't unique though. It's the result of two attractor fields (Alpha and Beta) bleeding together to create an outcome that is different from both, similar to how the Alpha worldline takes on some traits from the Omega worldline after Faris' D-mail.

However, the way that the VN describes it, is that there is only one worldline in existence at any given time. Think of it like a bunch of train tracks running in parallel, but only one train at a given time. D-mail and physical time travel cause the train to change tracks, thus altering causality in a way that Time Leaping cannot.
>> ARTICLE
Your train metaphor is a good way to understand it. Nice going.

So the theory is that there aren't infinite worldlines? This is what I thought was the case because of the way the show portrayed it (when they literally showed a bunch of lines). You're saying only one worldline is active at a time. Then that would mean there are an infinite number of possibilities for it to diverge, but still only one is active?

Ok. The whole picture is starting to come together a bit. As long as I'm understanding it correctly.
>> ARTICLE
It's there **can be** an infinite number of train tracks, but there's only one train, and thus only one track can be used. Therefore, there can be an infinite number worldlines, created by different actions, but only one can exist at a time.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting write up! For some of the confusion points:



>So, what exactly is Steins;Gate? Is it actually anything or just something Okabe made up?

Steins;Gate is essentially something Okabe made up to refer to the Beta world line.


>Suzuha's mother? Please tell me it's not Mayuri. Please.

I'll give you it's not Mayuri but for any more clues you have to check out the OVA and movie. Both are enjoyable additions to the original.


>Time travel stories always bum me out because it feels like the characters have no control over their actions.

I think this might be part of why you didn't enjoy the show as much as others. I personally love time travel stories so that added to my enjoyment but part of every time travel story includes the lesson of accepting the limits of humanity as well as accepting the past. That's what the second part of the show is for me, each character accepting what they can and cannot change and coming to terms with those limits.


>If I'm understanding correctly, SERN was monitoring Okabe's time machine.

Nope, Daru deleting information on the Phone Microwave from the SERN database stopped SERN from monitoring the lab. I believe once SERN realized that someone hacked their system they hacked the lab's system and 'directly connected' with them (it was mentioned around episode 11/12). So SERN is at least stalled on making the time machine and the lab is safe. 


Hopefully, that cleared up some of the confusing points. I enjoyed reading your write up and I hope you check out the OVA and movie! They're definitely worth it if you liked the show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Steins;Gate is essentially something Okabe made up to refer to the Beta world line.

That's what I figured. The beta worldline though, is that just the alternate worldline in which SERN takes over the world?

> I'll give you it's not Mayuri

Relieved for now. I'll watch the OVA and movie soon. **edit** Oh what! It's pretty much Suzuha herself? Or those genes are incredibly powerful for the two of them to look/sound exactly alike.

> That's what the second part of the show is for me, each character accepting what they can and cannot change and coming to terms with those limits.

This is a good point. Definitely one of the reasons why the second half was good. As much as I thought the series was going in another direction, I enjoyed learning about the characters and seeing how they all tied together in the end.

> So SERN is at least stalled on making the time machine and the lab is safe. 

Ok, so Okabe and co. could still be making a time machine, but Okabe knows that they can't hack into SERN's database this time around. Ok. I forgot about SERN hacking them back being the reason they found out about the Phone Microwave in the first place.

Thanks for the response! Glad you enjoyed my write-up, and you definitely helped clear some things up. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
>That's what I figured. The beta worldline though, is that just the alternate worldline in which SERN takes over the world?

The alpha field ends up with SERN taking over the world, the beta field ends up with WW3. Steins;gate is a special variation in the beta field where neither happen.

>Relieved for now. I'll watch the OVA and movie soon. edit Oh what! It's pretty much Suzuha herself? Or those genes are incredibly powerful for the two of them to look/sound exactly alike.

Yeh, good genes.

So that's where they are now? The show is named after the special worldline. Neat.

It's where they start and where they end up, at least in the original show as I haven't seen the movie.
>> ARTICLE
I made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3cm0nz/steinsgate_i_recently_finished_the_series_and_id/csx20u8) after I just read about some things. I'm now under the impression they didn't start on the Steins;Gate worldline. While watching the show I was definitely confused. It seemed like all the had to do was get back to the worldline of episode one. Like if they had never done anything at all, everything would've been fine. I think that would've been the case if they were in the Attractor Field where SERN takes over the world, but it looks like they started in the Attractor Field where WW3 happens. They had to go through everything they went through in order to come back and save Kurisu and stop her father.

So essentially, Okabe had to suffer. He had to send the accidental dmail in order to be confused as to why Kurisu still appeared to be alive after seeing her dead. He had to fall in love with her so he'd want to save her. Then when he realizes she isn't actually in danger of dying, he has to set-up his past self so the whole process repeats itself. He had to get to the point where he "saved" Kurisu from dying so that he could stop her father and prevent WW3 in the Alpha Field.

Holy crap. Is this what actually happened? I don't even know, but I'm having a blast thinking about all of this / disucssing everything.

Cheers.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly correct. The original worldline would have ended in WW3 because of Kurisu's father stealing her research notes. He had to experience everything leading up to him going back in time, and then undoing his original D-mail. Then he had to make sure that his past self DID send the original D-mail, so he would have the knowledge and experience to stay in the Beta attractor field, but then diverge from that point to prevent WW3, effectively landing in the Steins;Gate worldline, while saving Mayuri and Kurisu. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the original is the same as the final due to things like him picking up Mayuri's toy and bumping into Makise being the same in both.

If he never sent that first dmail the world would have been fine, but because he did it forms a paradox where the events keep repeating themselves.

I also love all the theories and stuff, I really need to play the VN :)
>> ARTICLE
I think the worldline from the first episode and the last are the same, but that worldline still ends with WW3. Everything that happened (like you said with Mayuri's toy and bumping into Kurisu) was the same up until Okabe stopped Kurisu's father.

What I'm trying to get at (I think) is that if Suzuha didn't take Okabe back in her time machine, Okabe would never have been able to sabotage Kurisu's father. He would take the research notes, and WW3 would begin.

So since Okabe stopped that from happening, it was a new worldline. Steins;Gate. Different than all the others in that it doesn't converge at WW3.
>> ARTICLE
The original is not the same as the end. WW3 would have happened if it was.
>> ARTICLE
But we don't stay in the original long enough to know, the first dmail is sent very quickly after Makise's body is found.
>> ARTICLE
Yes but they consistently talk about how they started in that timeline (the beta timeline). [Here's a site that goes into more detail about each world line if you want to read it.](http://ibm5100.net/steinswiki/story/chronology/#steins)

Do you feel the real ending was better or wish it would have ended at episode 22?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, hey. I was wondering if you'd seen Steins;Gate. You don't have an MAL or Hummingbird or whatever so it's always a mystery with you. Though there is a dub, so I guess I'm not surprised.

I had to go back and watch it, and ending on episode 22 is an interesting thought. I probably would be completely ok with it, but since that wasn't how the show was supposed to end there wasn't enough closure there. If they had reworked it to be the real ending it would've been fine. Although, I don't think I'd prefer one ending over the other.

Curious, is this a typical question people have? Is there usually debate over what would've made the better ending?
>> ARTICLE
> You don't have an MAL or Hummingbird or whatever so it's always a mystery with you.

I'm an enigma; a shadow that always keeps you guessing. That and I'm too lazy to set one up.

> Though there is a dub, so I guess I'm not surprised.

Kurisu's English VA is so amazing. In fact, all the actors delivered top with that one. Fucking hell, Funimation, hurry up and dub the movie already.

> Curious, is this a typical question people have? Is there usually debate over what would've made the better ending?

Oh, yes. There a lot of people (masochists, I call them) who feel the show would have had more depth or meaning had Okabe not been able to save Kurisu. I don't get it, but I'm also the guy who believes Lelouch is immortal and making sweet love to C.C. on a daily basis, so I sort of have a bias for happy endings.
>> ARTICLE
> That and I'm too lazy to set one up.

Your anime watching history probably goes back quite a way. I'd imagine that'd take some time to properly set up. I'm a weirdo though. I love keeping track of things/organizing so keeping an MAL is fun.

The dub for Steins;Gate was fantastic. I'm actually mad I didn't mention it in my post. "When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." It was an all around good dub. You've also saddened me that there is no movie dub yet.

Might want to tag that CG stuff, just in case. Though I am in agreement with you on it. As for the Steins;Gate ending, I really can't say. I guess I disagree that Kurisu's death would've given the show more meaning. I wouldn't have minded if that's the way it turned out, but I do like the real ending as is too.

I actually just watched the OVA (thankfully dubbed), and I was surprised at how chummy Kurisu was with the gang. While I don't think she should have died, I think the meaning that people are looking for with that ending could be satisfied by the fact that Kurisu should not have had much of a memory of Okabe. They would've went their separate ways, and Okabe would be left with loving memories of her that could never be relived.
>> ARTICLE
> They would've went their separate ways

Well, there was that post credits scene in episode 24 of them finding each other again. And, going by how the show made it clear that Reading Steiner is not unique to Okabe (he just has a really advanced form of it for whatever reason), I'd say it's not too hard to believe that she remembered knowing him, but clearly didn't remember the specifics, until he told her in the OVA.
>> ARTICLE
The feeling I got from the OVA was that the final scene from the series was Kurisu thanking Okabe for saving her life. Unless I'm remembering the final scene wrong.

I agree with what you said though. I can understand how Kurisu remembered them since she (and others) were able to retain memories of other worldlines, but I just didn't get from the show that they were going to go on to be friends. The OVA made it seem like Mayuri talked with Kurisu a lot. Eh, ultimately not a big deal. It did make sense. I think it's just a "me" problem on this one.
>> ARTICLE
>You don't have an MAL or Hummingbird

I've been wondering about this- what sort of previliges/advantages would I get by making a MAL account? I'm generally not into anime discussions that much so I'm not missing out much, am I?

I don't use MAL for discussions. I pretty much just use it to have a complete list of all the shows/movies I've watched and those that I plan to watch. You can also keep track of when you watched them or write notes about how you felt about a show. Others can also view your list so they know what you've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. Might give it a try when bored then. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate is good. That is all it is. 

It's premise is interesting and the story goes an interesting way BUT

it's pacing is somewhat jaring as its slow then gets super fast and never really slows down to embrace the big point of the whole show. Also

Someone should have died. Just gonna say it. Ending was too damn happy for a don't mess with time travel story. 
>> ARTICLE
While normally I'd agree, I don't think anyone needed to die permanently because the trials Okabe is forced to endure in seeing Mayuri die over and over are a deterrent enough to not mess with time travel. The constant moments of hope and subsequent losses of said hope and how they effected Okabe are great to show why one shouldn't mess with time travel.
>> ARTICLE
I think overall the show is enjoyable. It's probably tough for anyone to not find something about it they like. The pacing is an issue, but nothing too bad.

In terms of someone dying, I'd say it doesn't matter either way. Both options would have been acceptable so I don't mind that everyone lived. Technically they didn't. Mayuri kept dying. Anyway, Okabe knew you shouldn't mess around with time travel. That's why I think it made sense they he went to such lengths to make sure everyone was alive in the end and make sure the same mistakes weren't made again.
>> ARTICLE
For okabe yes he learned not to. However the viewer sees that you can in fact use time travel correctly to get what you want it's just hard. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched the OVA? cause im gonna spoil a bit:

im gonna reply to the confusion part:

Steins;Gate is the ultimate worldline where no one dies and nothing bad has ever happened. Okabe made up the name before and assigned it to it, like most stuff in the series

[OVA Spoilers](/s "Suzuha's mother is some girl they meet in the OVA, she isnt really important")

Okabe created the Meter in one worldline, but when suzuha came back with it, she went to a different worldline, thus no paradox is created. Okabe did not need to make it because he had it in this worldline.

Not ancestrally, in the upcoming sequel, Okabe will have given up on saving Kurisu, instead of saving her, thus the loop continues because of him seeing her dead, but it splits off at the end, not to mention the multiple endings of the visual novel, mostly ending in the alpha worldline.

Okabe didn't try to stop SERN, that was just a "bonus", all he really wanted was to save Mayuri/Kurisu. SERN has found a "spike in time" of sorts when the first D-Mail was sent, and started investigating, thus leading them to proceed with time travel business much faster.

Hope this helped! Glad you enjoyed the series, and i will just recommend the other Science Adventure series because they are also good (not close to steins gate but whatever, you may like them)
>> ARTICLE
All helpful, thanks.

One question maybe you might have an answer to concerning Suzuha's time travel and the divergence meter. When Suzuha uses her time machine, is she crossing worldlines? Your post makes me think yes, because that's how the divergence meter comes into Okabe's possession.

What confuses me then is the worldlines in the final episode. When Suzuha and Okabe go back to save Kurisu, are they switching worldlines or just simply moving backwards along the same worldline?
>> ARTICLE
Suzuha crosses owrldlines only when she changes the future, as she did in the first episodes, but in the final episode she changes the past, which has already happened.

Glad i could help!
>> ARTICLE
I actually just finished watching it today for the first time. Went through all the episodes back to back. I did get confused in a few areas near the ending, but I really enjoyed it. Honestly I don't really watch many new animes I prefer manga. Most times if I do watch anime its to see a fight scene that I loved in the manga.

I loved the characters in the show, Mayuri is my favorite. I liked how they all got plot development.....minus super haxor. I mean we know he is going to be a father...but his story is really shallow compared to the rest.

My question is near the end when hacking the SERN it made Kurisu disappear. I thought that them hacking into SERN is what made them aware and triggered the time machine race and lead to WWIII. I don't fully understand how she was connected to that. I thought only her D-mail could do that?

Also the current Okabe only had to believe she was dead. So that means the very first email he sent about her being stabbed is what put him into the alpha world line? So the first episode up until then and after he saves her in the end are the only parts of the beta world line? Am I correct in that?

Also the Metal Upa in the end what was the significance of that? I know the paper burned up in the fire without it. However I thought everything had to be the same?I thought the present Okabe would have got it for Mayuri, she would then lose it or drop it, and future Okabe would then pick it up.

Now to watch the movie and wait for the game to come to vita in NA.

The character development was well done, and now I'm thinking that we did get a lot of info on Daru from the future, so there is that.

> My question is near the end when hacking the SERN it made Kurisu disappear. 

It's been two weeks so I don't remember all the details. I'm not sure if they were hacking SERN or if they were possibly deleting any information SERN had on them (which I guess is technically still hacking). So I guess SERN doesn't have their time machine information, they don't take over the world, Okabe goes back to the beta.

I don't remember Kurisu's dmail, sorry. You're right in that hacking SERN alerted SERN about their time machine, but I think at that point they were in the Alpha Attractor Field, so SERN uses the time machine to take over the world. The Beta Field is where WW3 happens (the beta is the worldline in episode one).

> So that means the very first email he sent about her being stabbed is what put him into the alpha world line? So the first episode up until then and after he saves her in the end are the only parts of the beta world line? Am I correct in that?

Yes, I believe so. Although some users have said that the final Steins'Gate worldline isn't technically inside any Attractor Field (not in alpha or beta).


>> ARTICLE
Some of my sentiments are similar.

Throughout the series, I kept thinking to myself that Okabe isn't a 'mad scientist', but a 'bad scientist'.

He casually conducts experiments which produce ridiculous results, and rarely takes a moment to think about things or observe the impact of his actions. When the entirety of Akihabara changed, he basically went "oh, that's nice", and continued on his day of randomly trying things, even sending another d-mail that same day if I remember correctly. Okabe's apathy or lack of curiosity towards incredibly pertinent questions like 'why did Kurisu get stabbed?' and 'what text messages did others send back?' made moments in the anime incredibly frustrating to watch.

That, along with the show's penchant for information hiding between characters and Mayuri's lack of contribution to the story as anything other than a plot device really detracted from a potentially fantastic story.

I actually have a pretty long rambling wall of text that I typed up immediately after finishing the anime which points out some issues I had with the anime, if anyone is interested.
>> ARTICLE
The mad scientist is definitely a persona. Bad scientist is an interesting way to put it. Smarter than the average person, but dumber than the real scientists. Still, he was part of making/using the world's first time machine. That's gotta count for something.

A lot of the questionable decisions Okabe made (and as you said, his lack of curiosity) were frustrating, but I guess that's just storytelling. Especially in anime, it seems that a lot of problems could be solved if everyone just talked things out.

> I actually have a pretty long rambling wall of text that I typed up immediately after finishing the anime which points out some issues I had with the anime, if anyone is interested.

If you'd like to share, by all means. I don't know how much through traffic this thread is getting a day into it's life, but I'll still read it.
>> ARTICLE
To clear things up, Okabe is a normal person. Kurisu is the genius here, Okabe is just a normal dude stuck in a not-so-normal situation where he has to unfuck everything cause he's the only one that can. 

So I didn't find Okabe letting people send texts back into time too bad, he's still a teenager after all (and pretty immature at the start too, regardless of his 'mad scientist' persona) and he was just a little to trusting towards strangers with his new 'toy'. Kurisu is also noted to love experimenting too, and sending small messages back into time to see if any minor things would change in the present isn't the worst approach at testing whether the time machine would work. 

EDIT: Honestly they spent so much time building up the characters and how they interact with each other for the first half of the show it would have been a lot more jarring to leave Mayuri dead and make it a story about escaping from SERN facilities. And buying into any sort of hype usually sets you up for disappointment, which I was lucky enough to avoid with S;G (probably the main reason I gave it a 10/10. The only expectation I had was that it was going to be a good thriller/scifi). 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, both you and /u/bigfoot1291 have said Okabe actually isn't that smart. I honestly didn't pick up on it that much. I knew he didn't actually seem as smart as Kurisu, but I thought he was at least a bit more knowledgeable than you're claiming. It makes a little more sense now that he'd be lenient with the texts, but Kurisu should've said something. I don't think sending texts back in time is a bad way of testing their new machine, but having a little more control over them would've saved everyone (or I guess just Okabe) the headache.

Them being captured and escaping SERN was just one thought. I'm not really sure that was the best way to go. Probably not seeing as the show as it is now gets near universal praise. I just always like thinking of the "what could have been" scenarios.

I agree with the hype usually setting you up for disappointment. Not much I could do about it though. There are still plenty of shows that are hyped up/get high praise that I haven't seen so I'm sure my opinions will end up differing again.

Thanks for the response.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Okabe has an intelligence comparable to Kurisu's, he just doesn't have her background in science, instead preferring to dick around with friends.

Just think. He designs and builds the type C-204 time machine, as well as the divergence meter, on his own, without any help.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's more of the potential that most people pretty much have, just that Kurisu's death (and staying dead in the original beta world line) motivated Okabe enough to research and design things on his own (also didn't Daru help with most of the stuff in the future?). 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, isn't there like a small part where he's researching stuff at the University of Tokyo? I'm not from Japan, but couldn't only students be able to do that?
>> ARTICLE
See, everyone's saying he's not that smart, but I agree with you. I don't necessarily think he's as intelligent as I originally thought. Kurisu is probably a bit smarter, but Okabe knows his stuff. He's just a little crazy; he thinks he's a mad scientist and is being hunted by the organization or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
In the VN Okabe seems a lot more intelligent since there's a lot more dialog between Kurisu and him. A lot of the dialog was cut in the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
>  He's just a little crazy; he thinks he's a mad scientist and is being hunted by the organization or whatever.

No. Okabe is not a mad scientist and he does not think he is hunted by the organisation. He only pretends to be a mad scientist.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I meant.

> he thinks he's a mad scientist

He thinks (pretends, like you said). I don't believe he actually he was.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... Steins;Gate. My flawless 10/10 anime... because I will ignore any flaw with all my love :D

I see many discussions around here about some points, so I won't address them here - don't want to write a wall of text. So I'm just going to the one point, I want to discuss: Your expectations about the second half. Actually while watching the series I had the hopes, that something like that might happen, too. It would be quit interesting seeing them as prisoner, forced to work for SERN, seeing Kurisus betrayal, etc. But there is one point, that wouldn't work out and it would be the ending.

One of the strengths of Steins;Gate is their "own" theory on time travel. They use the image of the human as an entity in space/time. And for the whole series we are going with the same entity. This way, Okabe can keep his memories and develop as a character. Every jump between the world lines happenes at the same point in time. That's quite important to avoid a paradox, but also for the conclusion of the whole series. 

If you would let them work long enough at SERN to show these events, Okabe traveling back in time, changing the past events and going forth again would lead to an ending at the same time. So if they worked there for one year, the end of the show also would be one year after he saved Kurisu. Otherwise if we would stay at the past point in time after the changing, the Okabe going back to the future would "vanish" and the new one would have none of the experience - so no character development or romantic happy end. Even if we as viewer might know the truth, the ending would be quit unsatisfying. There would be no reward for Okabe, no smile, nothing. He just wouldn't knew at all, what just happend. Or we would travel back to "one year later", missing all the new development that might have happen to find just a glimpse at the new world line... 

Bringing in "real time travel" over a long time together with the focus on a few explicit points in time is quite 	confusing for the viewer, because there are many changes in what a character can remember for a specific time. They avoid all this with "real time monitoring" through all world lines, but the price for that is, that they couldn't move freely in time. It's sadly the price for not being confusing (or stupid) as hell... xD


>> ARTICLE
You make a good point. They truly did a decent job of explaining time travel. It wasn't too difficult to follow, and I think you're right that if they had done things differently in the second half most viewers might get lost.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who fucking hates Mayuri? ;-;
>> ARTICLE
You brought up some agreeable points. I watched this series essentially because Kurisu won best girl contest and my friends (also reddit) have been saying it is the best anime ever. However, overall I was disappointed but it's still a good anime.

I found that the show does its dramatic moments really well and was able to make me feel for the characters, which is more than i can say for certain shows. I felt like the show, all in all, did the idea of time travelling well and it was a very refreshing plot. However, like you said, the part on Okabe going out with Ruka and the bit with Feyris felt like a drop off. They probably included this part because Steins Gate is adapted from a VN and y'know, VNs have this kind of stuff.

I loved Okabe's character, but Kurisu didn't feel like much (and definitely doesn't deserve to beat out Senjougahara or Holo, imo). She just felt like a pretty typical tsundere-type character. I'm not saying she's a bad character, she's a great fit with Okabe and all but she's just not THAT good. I guess I'm still salty about the contest.

It's a great show all in all, and I gave it the same rating as you. It has been awhile since I've seen this show so whatever I've written down here is just according to memory which may be inaccurate.


>> ARTICLE
Good to have a sympathizer for some of my points.

> However, overall I was disappointed but it's still a good anime.

Really the most simple way to put it. I would never call Steins;Gate bad by any means.

> Steins Gate is adapted from a VN and y'know, VNs have this kind of stuff.

I knew that it was adapted, but I'm not sure exactly what visual novels are. Are they like a combination of a book and video game? You get to make choices as the story progresses? Any particular reason visual novels have the harem/relationship type stuff or is that essentially what they all do?

> She just felt like a pretty typical tsundere-type character. I'm not saying she's a bad character, she's a great fit with Okabe and all but she's just not THAT good.

Straight up truth. Well said. She fit very well with Okabe, but she just couldn't accept her feelings towards him. Those feelings even felt a bit weird to me since she only knew Okabe for a few weeks. Love at first sight type of situation, I suppose.

I don't know who those other two choices for best girl are, but I guess I understand the salt. I'm really hoping Kaori from Your Lie In April does well this year, and I'm probably gonna be upset if she doesn't go far.

Anyway, thanks for the response.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually not very sure with VNs, so it might be just generalizing. But i think that they would want to flesh out all the characters so they may include stuff like that. I've only played the Fate VN and for Steins Gate I heard that the adaptation of VN may be the reason why they included those parts when i questioned about it.

You also just reminded me that I should go and watch Your Lie in April now. Heard from my friend that it is heavy on feels.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, well thanks for the slight VN info. I truly have no idea. I've never played any.

Yesss, first time I can recommend Your Lie In April (if my recommendation means anything more than anyone else). I guess I'm more of an advocate. A strong one. Your Lie In April was wonderful. I've only seen 21 series since I've really started watching anime, but it's my new favorite. I don't think that's going to change for a long time. The music is wonderful, the artwork is gorgeous, and yeah, heavy on the feels. Haven't had a cry like that in quite some time.

Of course, everyone's different. There's a chance you won't like it as much, but I still think it's overall objectively enjoyable. Definitely worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for sharing. I'll probably watch it within these two or three days. I'll keep you updated on my thoughts of the show when i finish! :)
>> ARTICLE
Nice! I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please, send me a pm anytime. I watched it over the course of three days myself. I hope you enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is though, that Kurisu is a lot more deep of a character than the anime gives her credit for. The VN paints her as a character actually a lot closer to Asuka from NGE (but with less hostility). This comes as a result of Kurisu's past with her father, who rejected her because of her capabilities, so she tends to push other people away.

Similarly to how many of the Fate adaptations fail to capture the depth of its source material, so too does this adaptation fail to capture a lot of the characterization, although some characters (like Suzuha, Faris, Moeka, and Ruka) suffer from it more than others.
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to Kurisu as in the Kurisu in the anime, though. I've not read the VN so i wouldn't know if she's actually deeper than that. Her character's backstory does make her different from typical other anime girls but again, as great as a character she was in Steins Gate, I feel that Okabe is the character that kinda defines the show. To me she isn't deserving to be voted as a better character than someone like Holo, who is a character that carries Spice and Wolf.

Oh but if we're not talking about the contest, I would say that she's a good character, and maybe I'd feel different if I wasn't already a little biased against her when i watched the show.
>> ARTICLE
One of the first anime I watched. Loved it, started kinda slow but after the first few episodes it's a masterpiece worth watching

>> ARTICLE
Now that you've finished the show, why not play the visual novel? there's multiple endings that the show didn't touch on, and it goes into more detail about the events in the show. im playing the s;g vn right now, at the lottery ticket scene, and I'm loving how you get to understand okabe more.

also, there's some easter eggs to Chaos;Head, so maybe play that beforehand. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm considering playing them, but in all honesty I don't know if I ever will. Not because I wouldn't enjoy them, but simply because I have so many other shows to watch, games to play, real life things to deal with. There's always a lot going on so not a lot of time to do everything I want to.

I will say though that if I ever decide to try a VN, Steins;Gate will be first. There's always a first.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it! This may or may not be your thing but if you feel like it you should check out the [Steins;Gate Visual Novel](https://vndb.org/v2002), what you would get out of it: Better art, music, alternative endings, the story pacing is slower but a lot more comfortable than the anime's, the scientific aspects are explored further, the characters ,especially Okabe, are just amazing, and personally the emotional aspects are greatly enhanced. If you decide to check it out, or need some help with it feel free to ask!
>> ARTICLE
Well since you're offering I may as well get some info, thanks.

How do I go about playing it? The english version is windows only? I have a mac and unfortunately don't have access to a windows pc at the moment. Does that pretty much halt my efforts for now?

And just for the future, would I be able to find somewhere to download it for free? No need to post the links or anything in the thread since that's probably not allowed. I just, sadly, don't see myself paying 30$ for it from a site I've never used.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, there is no OS X release, but according to [this tread](https://www.reddit.com/r/steinsgate/comments/2hwu5o/running_steins_gate_english_vn_on_mac_os_x/), it should be possible to run it using Wine. 

And the game is paid, but then you'd have to get it straight from the Japanese website and find an English patch. Fortunately, there are ways to *acquire* it already translated for free (I'll PM you if you're interested). If you do decide to go ahead, here's an [walktrough](http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Steins;Gate_100%25_Completion_Walkthrough) (when I played it, I ended up making a big mistake and basically doubled the lenght it took me to finish it ^^worth ^^it ^^though ). I can't really promise you'll enjoy it seeing as Visual Novels are just not everyone's cup of tea, but compared to the anime (which is already good), you can really notice a huge improvement. Hope this helped!
>> ARTICLE
Well thanks for the help. No need to pm. I'll hold out until I get my hands on a pc (which may be in the near future). In the meantime I may just read the walkthrough or search elsewhere for some text. There must be some written up version of some of the events in the VN.

Well, a couple of things. 1) Glad you enjoyed it nonetheless and 2) Maybe consider reading the visual novel? The visual novel has much more scenes/details the anime doesn't, and has really cool alternate endings that the anime doesn't show.

>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'll let you read the VN and find out~
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit late to the party, but I just wanted to add that I had the exact same experience with regards to your "expectations" section. I too felt that the first half was excellent in building up a lot of mystery aground SERN and time travel, but the focus then shifted and never resolved what I considered to be the most interesting part of the show.

I'm interested in what you thought about the ending, in particular the lessons/motifs concerning time travel. I remember the show being somewhat inconsistent about this, in that it seemed to switch between the messages:

1. Time travel can have large unexpected consequences (I.e. Feyris)
2. No matter what you do, things can't be changed (I.e. Mayuri)

And then ignores them both to deliver a happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
Better late than never!

Your first point about Feyris' dmail, I think that's still incredibly important. That example is, I guess, a negative outcome. Okabe uses time travel to create a positive outcome when he creates the Steins;Gate worldline though. So time travel is good and bad.

Your second point sort of fits into that as well. I think it was an important lesson for Okabe to learn. He just couldn't prevent Mayuri from dying, but by the end (with the help of his future self) he keeps fighting and eventually is able to change fix those problems that were previously inevitable: Mayuri dying, WW3, SERN.

So I think the lessons were incredibly important at the time Okabe experienced them, but I don't mind that by the end they're sort of nullified. Time travel can be used to change things for the better, just as they can be used to royally mess things up. I liked the happy ending because Okabe still dealt with all of the bad effects of time travel while attempting to achieve that happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
You do bring up some good points. I highly recommend you watch the movie, as it does show us the aftermath of messing around with time travel. 

I personally really enjoyed both halves. The first half was full of wonder and mystery as they figure out how time travel works. Then the second half is just paranoia and Okabe having to go through hell and back to fix everything. It also proves the concept of the butterfly effect, how a small event (faris's dad not dying) lead to a very big change (no otaku culture and akiba changing). Though I am fortuante to have watched this with no prior expectations or hype as I only heard about the mad scientist clip beforehand.

Steins;Gate is just a name for the worldline they reach where everyone is alive, the name itself has no actual meaning and was just made by Okabe.

This show uses the concept of worldlines to alleviate the endless cycle thing. Every big change that happens causes a new line to appear, like one where WW3 happens, one where Kurisu is dead, etc. Smaller changes cause the world lines to shift slightly, and with enough changes, the lines can shift away from major events.

For the last episode thing, I think the series of events has to happen. Okabe sees Kurisu dead, he works to time machine, etc.
So to keep the chronology intact, they just had to trick Okabe into seeing Kurisu dead without actaully killing her. Though it has been a while since I saw the show.
>> ARTICLE

Yes, through everyone's comments I've come to understand this. It was a very interesting way of thinking about time travel. I haven't seen anything else that uses this type of theory (but I'm sure they exist).
>> ARTICLE
I liked the fact you thought of Steins;Gate as a show that has flaws, and didn't blindside your opinion as lower or higher despite your expectations.

I personally found the deconstruction of Okabe to be my favorite part of this series because it made me realize what motivations and dreams he wanted to fulfill. 

I gave this show a 9/10. I think the flaws of this show are too apparent with its lack of rewatchability, and giant plot holes that stem from the giant gap of the first to second half. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the kind words! Just because I thought it'd be something else doesn't mean I didn't like it. I quite enjoyed Steins;Gate, just not as unconditionally as it seems most people do. I tend to rate things based equally on how much I enjoyed them and how good they objectively are.

Watching Okabe break because of the situation he was forced into was great. I loved that he had to stop being a mad scientist in order to fix the world. He really ended up being a good person.
>> ARTICLE
I find that interesting that you'd say that the show lacks rewatchability, as I've rewatched it no less than 6 times (more than any show I've seen). Every time I rewatch it (usually I'm watching it with a new viewer), I catch new nuance and foreshadowing, and find more detail that helps close any gaps that I thought existed in the plot.
>> ARTICLE
I think this show relies too heavily on foreshadowing and the viewer being clueless about what's going to happen. With that sort of mystery and thrill gone, my rewatch felt lackluster. 
>> ARTICLE


The visual novel also has even more replayiblity what with alternative endings the anime doesn't have! 
>> ARTICLE
About Okabe - People are saying he's normal, but he's actually probably below normal intelligence. He's a NEET. The only things he learns about time travel are what we see him read during the show. His knowledge on technology is just from it being a hobby of his, but it seems most of the technical side to it is done by Daru. This is why Kurisu is hostile to Okabe at first; to her and any outsider he is basically an unemployed loser raving about being an awesome scientist. 

So when Okabe is going around trying to fix everything, he could easily go around like a psycho assaulting people until they do what he says to get back to the good timeline. However, he chooses instead to try fulfill the wishes of the people who altered the timelines so they will feel that they won't need to alter the timeline anymore. This is what makes people love Okabe; he goes the more difficult route to fix things because he cares that much about his friends, even when you can see it's mentally breaking him down.

As for the OVA/Movie - I enjoyed the OVA but I didn't enjoy the film. But it seems most people enjoyed the film so I guess give it a go.
>> ARTICLE
I don't personally agree that he's below normal intelligence. He seems to be smart enough. Though I will agree on your point as to why Kurisu acts hostile towards him in the beginning. Okabe likely comes across as over-confident to her.

> he could easily go around like a psycho assaulting people 

That would be interesting to watch, I guess. It'd be a whole different show, but hey. Gotta do what you gotta do to get to that Steins;Gate worldline. I get what you're saying though. Okabe is a good guy, and he helped out his friends even if it didn't matter for the most part. Though I think once he realized others had a toned down version of his reading steiner, he may have accepted that there's a chance they would remember everything anyway.

Okabe technically isn't a NEET as he is a university student.

I've heard that this show is really good but I never got an answer on why. So two questions, why should I watch it and is there an English dub or only a sub?
>> ARTICLE
I see you have already been helped by someone else, but I feel I should give you my two cents as well. I am also a little confused as to which show you are referring to, so I will tell you about all of them.

First, Steins;Gate (because this is the show you actually made a reply comment to) is a fantastic show about mad science, time travel, and intrigue. It does a very good job illustrating the personalities of its characters and has a fantastic English dub with J. Michael Tatum taking the lead role. This show is very interesting and mind-bending.

Second is Baccano. Probably the best way to describe it is if Quentin Tarantino directed an anime, you'd probably get something similar to it. While it doesn't have characters spouting the n-word every other sentence (in fact it doesn't have much in the way of strong language as-is) it does have a very unique style of storytelling. Once again, it has fantastic characters and a very good English dub (with J. Michael Tatum playing a major part). This show is incredibly fun and often times very light-hearted while still being able to keep a serious tone.

Lastly, Mirai Nikki is my favorite anime. It has fantastic pacing, giving the viewer enough details to get by without really giving much away which makes for great suspense. All of the characters are interesting in their own ways and the show really shines when it shows the interactions and developments between the two main characters. I actually despise the English dub for this one, though I think it's because they just didn't do a very good job with the casting. This show is incredibly dark and is probably one of the most mature shows I have seen besides Berserk.

Sorry for wall of text, but these three shows are in my top 5.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I just realized he was referring to Steins;Gate. Now I feel like an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing a little D-Mail can't fix.

>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate has a great dub, (I actually prefer the dub personally), as to why you should watch it, I really don't want to spoil anything, its an experience in of itself. Though I highly recommend it, I went into it completely blind, not knowing what to expect and was completely blown away.
>> ARTICLE
The show has a pretty good English dub (the English dub is named The Future Diary). As for why you should watch it, it's got action, an interesting premise, a little romance, good characters, and some good plot twist. It's a pretty amazing show in my opinion. It can't hurt to check it out.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I'll give it a shot!

Last question. How is it on comedy? I don't expect it to be a laugh a minute but I'm warching Code Geass for the first time right now and although it's a decent show it's so ridged and serious all the time.
>> ARTICLE
It's not rigid and serious all the time. It has some funny parts here and there.    
Edit- also, after you watch it shoot me a message and let me know what you thought of it. I may think it's amazing but everyone has different opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic, thanks for the info! I'll definitely send you a message once I finish it. It shouldn't take too since for the next two weeks I'll just be watching anime (hurt my leg at work so I'm in a cast)
>> ARTICLE
Haha, talk about a silver lining. Anyway I hope the leg gets better, have fun with your time off.
>> ARTICLE
Good idea. I actually did this after I saw one that was done for Baccano.
>> ARTICLE
I'd love to see one for The Future Diary (Mirai Nikki). Not sure what pose would lend itself to the style though.
>> ARTICLE
I actually made a portrait where I mashed Yuno and Yuki's faces together. I [posted it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1c5vkk/a_mirai_nikki_vector_portrait_i_made/) a few months ago, but people wound up not liking it nearly as much. Also, Mirai Nikki is my favorite anime so far.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I can see why people didn't like it as much. It's creepy but I like how it blends Yuno's crazy smile with Yuki's terror. Also, on a list of my favorites Mirai Nikki comes in at number two.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks op, I might use it as a phone background as others were suggesting.
>> ARTICLE
You should do another where it's a minimalist picture of a Dr. Pepper bottle with steins;gate written on the poster somewhere.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but I probably won't be doing this.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I figured, worth a try though

Perfect for a Win 8 metro tile. Awesome. :D

Fucking Steins;Gate man. This floored me. Was not expecting much and it skyrocketed to my top 5 anime spot.

The moment flat and minimalistic design goes out the window is the moment everyone's creativity comes back.

Yeah, I don't know why they're doing that either, though I have to admit that Okabe might look a little like Tenant if he put on a blue suit.

Maybe. A little.

silhouetting him makes him look way more like Tennant than he actually does.

I know you're gonna be disappointed, but I decided to make a [Gurren Lagann](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1pxg7f/people_seemed_to_like_my_steinsgate_post_so_i/) one first.
>> ARTICLE
YO I LOVE TTGL. That's pretty good, nice use of colors! I like how the weapons crossover into each others' sections too.

Only thing that could use some editing would be Yoko's section. Maybe change the background color cause her arm is missing lol, and change the color of the gun since blue seems a bit odd

edit: or you could keep the background black, but change the gun to yellow? idk, do whatever you like best :)
>> ARTICLE
The reason why her arm appears to be missing is because she wears a black sleeve. I also wanted to keep a smaller color palette this time which is why her gun is just straight up blue. Blue is the closest color to the actual gun without it being black.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh ok that makes sense. The blue just stood out cause Simon's section primarily uses blue, so it seemed out of place for there to be a bunch of blue in Yoko's section. Otherwise, seems like you're getting better at this!

Oh yeah, I forgot about this show.  I really should finish it.  I'm about halfway through the sub on youtube.
>> ARTICLE
If you ever re-watch it, I suggest you watch it dubbed because J. Michael Tatum is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know how Feasible this may be, but if you can somewhat separate the backs of Okabe and Kirisu, you can make a pretty sexy 3840 x 1080 wallpaper where their backs are kind of leaning on the partition between monitors.  Just a though, and might take some time, but it would reach the levels of cool those portal wallpapers that move from monitor to monitor.

I just want to let everyone know that I made this image as a pin idea for a local convention. If you would like to acquire this pin (or a multitude of others that a friend of mine and me will be making) and if you live in the Milwaukee area, come to Concinnity.

This is so bad, it looks like you made your first vector and it was so boring and bad that you had to compensate by calling it "minimalist". 

Edit 1: There is no texture or a semblance of good taste in color. The background looks like throw up and the colors are so boring and clash so much. Ew. 

Edit 2: The faces, and her shorts are the worst parts of the piece, I find my  eyes regretfully drawn to the awful color of blue that is sandwiched by a muddle of colors that look like someone barfed up s'mores.

I don't agree with your language, but I agree with your points.

There's a difference between criticism and being fucking rude, not everyone is born an artist so cut the attitude.

That said, yeah, the colors are clashing and some of the elements (mostly on Kirusu) are too much to be called minimalistic. If it were minimalistic, I think it would have to be less than 4 colors/shades, i'd go as far as cutting the text too, or simplifying it.

If he/she did it again, I'd suggest getting a different pose of Kirusu where you can't see the clothes underneath, except the tie. I think that's one of her key character design elements and I'd make it the same color as her hair.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your tips! I kept them in mind when I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1pxg7f/people_seemed_to_like_my_steinsgate_post_so_i/).
>> ARTICLE
[Is this a little better?](http://i.imgur.com/oVLwCk2.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Much better, the text is hard to make out though, and I would still change the color of the background still.

Edit: Use something analogous or complementary to her hair. Also, the text shouldn't be the main focus. Try putting the text slightly behind Christine and orient it vertically, like [this.](http://www.flicksnews.net/2010_09_01_archive.html)

I won't be making any more edits to this image specifically. However, if you like [Gurren Lagann](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1pxg7f/people_seemed_to_like_my_steinsgate_post_so_i/), I made a wallpaper for it while keeping in mind some of the criticism I received. I'd love to hear if I've improved a little.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your constructive criticism! I have a little criticism to give you as well. You used "still" twice in your post.

I probably won't be making any more changes to the image in these regards. When I first changed the color, I didn't notice right away the tearing effects it had on the objects around it, and while I'd hate to be a faggot, I actually do have other things I should be doing instead. There's also the fact that I actually like the look of the colors I chose. I chose the background color because it seemed to be similar to a color that was common among many Steins;Gate images on google.

I will be sure to make note of the things you have said for the next time I make an image like this one.

Thanks and have a nice day!

I imagine something like this is going through people's heads who are paranoid over "traps". I suppose it goes deeper than that, psychologically, but there's no use discussing it on anime subreddit. 

It's just as you said, it's just a picture. :)
>> ARTICLE

The funny part to me is that there are people who think they might be gay when *they're attracted to female traits.*

The more you do that the greater chance you have rejecting femininity traits as attractive.

Had me cracking up, along with the shower scene. This was my favourite episode of the series so far. Hououin is really showing a bit of a human side, attempting to reunite father and daughter.

What version of the subs does this appear in? It seems that in each version its translated differently. Including the dubs.

That's from WhyNot subs. That line was a 2channel meme, so everyone just localized it differently.

yeah, I've also seen it done as "All Your Base" which was pretty good, but did not fit the single word response she gave, lol.

In the dub they just turn it into a chaos;head reference.

"Whose eyes are those eyes"?

See the OP. That line is actually a mistake. Not a huge, major one, but it is noticeable if you read The Distant Valhalla.
>> ARTICLE
What was the line. I have read The Distant Valhalla and have watched and played Chaos;Head, but not seen the dub. Also I'm willing to bet almost no one watching the show for the first time as the Dub got the reference.
>> ARTICLE
It was the part talked about in these comments, here said as Lurk... moar. It's when Okabe sneaks up behind Kurisu when she's on the computer. In the dub, Okabe says something like "Neidhardt's been busy lately," which Kurisu says "yeah" to.
>> ARTICLE
hahaha that doesn't even make sense to her reaction afterwards. I don't remember Valhalla that well, but I'm guessing she didn't know who Neidhardt is in it.

Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head are set in the same universe but that's it. They don't really have anything common besides that. Chaos;Head had great ideas but failed to deliver in the end. You don't have to watch Chaos;Head to enjoy Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
> Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head are set in the same universe but that's it.

Don't you mean the same *multiverse*? :P
>> ARTICLE
If you play the steins;gate VN, there are ALOT more references to Chaos;head. They take place in the same japan, only C;H takes place a year earlier and in a difference city. Robotics;Notes will take place 8 years after S;G in yet another difference city.
>> ARTICLE
*different
>> ARTICLE
To clarify, the anime adaptations for S;G and C;H had entirely different production staff. The only connection between them is that they're both adapted from nitro+ visual novels set in a shared universe.  The studio and creative talent behind the Steins;Gate anime did not work on Chaos;Head (apart from those within nitro+).  S;G and C;H have similar source material but are cut from entirely different cloth.

It's like comparing The Dark Knight to [Batman and Robin](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1077027-batman_and_robin/).  They're set in the same universe, and draw from source material set in the same universe, but the chronological link between the two is pretty loose and the people involved with the production are completely different; the quality of one in no way reflects on the caliber of the other.
>> ARTICLE
>Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head are set in the same universe

TIL. Shame on me for not knowing this. Is it just set in the same universe and that's it or is there some kind of hints in either of them or something ?
>> ARTICLE
iirc okabe knows the main character of C;H
>> ARTICLE
They are set in the same universe, there are a few shout outs in Steins;Gate to Chaos;Head but nothing really important or noticeable. 
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head was a poorly animated harem masquerading as a sci-fi mystery story. 

>> ARTICLE
How about the VN? What does it do differently, I hear a lot of praise.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, but its no anime
>> ARTICLE
But what's different? There must be a reason Steins Gate and Clannad(it seems, never watched it) rocked but Chaos Head, Fate Stay Night and Tsukihime did not. Also, fuck unnecessary punctuation. Japan need to cut on those.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad and Steins Gate are both relatively easy to adapt because there is a primary storyline that is the most important and they are fairly linear. Fate Stay/Night and Tsukihime are harder to adapt because there is more branching in the storyline and more important secondary storylines. I've never played Chaos Head.

Although if they had made a 12 episode adaptation of the Fate route, I bet it would've been much better than what they ended up making. Maybe with separate seasons for UBW and Heaven's Feel.
>> ARTICLE
UBW had an OVA that was amazing - but you could really tell that a 1 hr 45min  movie wasn't enough to capture the sheer amount of awesome in that route. There was a lot missing still, but it's much better than the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't played the VN, so I can't say for sure. But it seems to be the usual VN anime problems: combining of routes, cutting content(some VNs are 10x the length of an anime), and haphazard character focus.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, let me handle this, as someone who likes Chaos;HEAd.

The Chaos;HEAd anime is very flawed, in a way that leads people to not like it. I saw around this flaw, hence my liking it.

This flaw is, well, they don't handle the main character right at all. Takumi comes off as a jerk, and rightfully so, but WHY he's a jerk is handled poorly in the anime as opposed to the Visual Novel. In the VN, he's narrating to the audience, so you get a lot more of how he actually ticks, and in addition his delusions take more than 15 seconds. On top of that, his bad delusions are seriously fucked up sometimes. For example:

>When his sister first appears at his Storage Bin home. In the anime, she asks for a drink of soda. He sees her drink from the bottle, he comments on it, but then sees her actually using a cup. In the VN his crazy has two settings: Ecchi and Grimdark. You get to choose each time. For this delusion, the Ecchi one is "She drinks from the bottle, and then goes all 'I love you imouto moe can we have a direct kiss, not an indirect one let me take off my clothes-DELUSION ENDS." In the bad delusion, she grabs a new bottle out of his minifridge, drinks from it and then START TO COUGH OF BLOOD AND FALLS ONTO THE GROUND DEAD RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. Delusion ends.

>And a second example, When Yua visits his Stroage Bin home, in the anime he briefly sees her in the swimsuit from his Seira figurine. In the Visual Novel, Good Delusion: "I love you." She takes off her clothes, revealing her school swimsuit underneath. "I wore this for you. Let's have sex." DELUSION ENDS. Bad Delusion: "I love you." She pulls out a knife. "So I'm going to cut you up and eat you, so we can be together forever." DELUSION ENDS.

So yeah, like I said the anime doesn't do a good job of explaining why he's an antisocial jerk. I mean you would be too if there was a high chance every time you talked to someone that you would see them either dead or wanting to kill you. There's a bad delusion later where he leaves home for 10 mins to grab some dinner and ends up in the middle of a hostage situation. As the person holding hostages. "Why do I have this bloody knife!?"

There are also other problems with the anime, most of which came from it only have 12 episodes. Many fans of both agree that the Steins;Gate anime was better because it had time to actually let it's characters develop.

Also, Chaos;HEAd and Steins;Gate are more then just taking place in the same universe. Trust me on this. Several people who hate the C;H anime don't want S;G and C;H to be more connected then just the same setting, but I know better. I don't want to get into more details due to spoilers, but I will link you to [The Distant Valhalla](http://tempusedaxrerumtl.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/the-distant-valhalla/), if you want a good read that helps explain part of the reason I'm certain that they are more then just the same setting.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, that was quite the read. But I thought there would be some sort of connection between the two since steins;gate is set a year in the future and involves sending texts to the past. Maybe I'll play the VN's instead!
>> ARTICLE
I suggest it. Be warned, though, the Chaos;Head English patch is really bug and incomplete in some parts. And it ruins your save if you save in chapter 7.

I can get into more of a connection, but it involves either expanded universe stuff I'm still reading/isn't translated yet, or outright spoilers for Robotics;Notes.

And sorry for the length, but it was shorter than my panel on the sciences of S;G and C;H I ran at a con this year. >.>
>> ARTICLE
btw, the unofficial Steins;Gate patch is incomplete, and the main translator from the fan translation project took his work and went to work for JAST. So, there will be an official English release of S;G, but it will likely have stilted English. ( ,_)
>> ARTICLE
I know, but the Chaos;Head patch is very glitchy whereas the Steins;Gate works a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
Hehe No probs :P I enjoyed it!

Thanks. If you don't want spoilers, avoid the Robotics;Notes Wikipedia page, just so you know.

I found Chaos Head a little bit less convincing/fluid. It had good ideas but for the most part failed to deliver, it just didn't excite me.

Pretty sure there isn't any particular connection between the two....always open to research though
>> ARTICLE
Weird I don't know why a game/anime company would chose the same naming convention for all their completely unrelated projects. I suppose Robotics;Notes will have absolutely nothing to do with Steins;Gate either :p
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Daru from Steins;Gate is going to be in Robotics;Notes, and so is Nae (Mr. Braun's daughter) They do all have something in common, they are all science animes, hence "Science Adventure Series" Chaos;Head was more about neurology or something to do with the brain, maybe psychology, Steins;Gate was Time Travel, and Robotics;Notes is about robots, all are science related, I am sure there are more things that make them in relation to each other, I just haven't really looked into it that much.
>> ARTICLE
They all take place in the same world I think.  Robotics;Notes is supposed to occur after then end of Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head just wasn't as exciting and plot-delivering as Steins;Gate was. Not as amazing character development or, in my opinion, characters in general. I didn't really like the main guy or girl so much. While Okabe and Kurisu may be one of the best anime duos of all time.

I'm not someone who says Chaos;Head is horrible or something because it's not. It's just that for me Steins;Gate was more interesting. I know people who hate Steins;Gate and who love Chaos;Head, and that's totally fine. Both series are great, I just found Steins;Gate more interesting for me. A new series, called Robotic;Notes is coming out this fall, which also takes place in the C;H and S;G world :)

* Because S;G is better.
* Because they are barely related.
* Because Chaos;Head was aired in 2008. /r/anime was taking it's first baby steps back then.
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;head could have been great. The concept of a deluded main character who see and interact with his delusion had a lot of potential for a great story (think Welcome to the NHK), but before you realize it, the anime series turned into every harems with main lead that has super power.  Boring. 

I still enjoyed one thing or two, but it was wasted potential. 
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head simply didn't have the excellent writing, characters, artwork/animation, or pretty much anything else to the caliber of Steins;Gate. You can tell it is on a significantly lower budget compared to Steins;Gate. It has a great premise but it gets too caught up in itself to create a coherent, fluid and compelling story. Plus I feel like some of the elements introduced into it really take it away from the psychological thriller aspect it was hoping to achieve. I can't say without spoiling it, but I think you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.
>> ARTICLE
The Chaos;Head anime was way too short to make a decent adaptation and the studio botched it. It was way too rushed.

The Chaos;Head visual novel was actually pretty decent and it's a lot like the case with the Fate/Stay Night anime adaptation and its visual novel source.

If you do have the free time, never watch the anime and try playing the visual novel instead.
>> ARTICLE
Chaos;Head started well, but the later part of the series was done really shit. I think if they weren't rushing everything it would have been epic.
>> ARTICLE
Caos;head was utter shit. Also Steins;Gate is not a sequel to Caos;Head! Don't let the names confuse you, they have nothing to do with eachother. 
>> ARTICLE
Weird, the wiki said Steins;Gate occurred a year after Chaos;Head in the same place. Stupid misleading animus >.>
>> ARTICLE
No, they do take place is the same universe/city, technically.  I think all that comes of the connection is a tiny irrelevant shout out in one episode and that's it.
>> ARTICLE
They were originally both visual novels by the same developer. Therefore, it would make sense to reuse an already developed setting in a later work. So the two series are definitely related, but only subtly. The point is, Chaos;Head has no influence on the plot of Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently the long-term plan is some cross-over between all the Science Adventure titles. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I really hope they do something like that. They do make subtle references to Chaos;Head in Steins;Gate, but I'd like to see them tie them together more. I saw Steins;Gate first, so I didn't catch them my first time. It didn't take anything away from the experience.
>> ARTICLE
I personally liked Chaos;Head. It was not nearly as good as Steins;Gate and it had many large flaws, but I feel like way too many people compare the two series to one another. I think this is the main reason for the Robotics;Notes anticipation - it could either be a huge hit or a huge miss. Though it looks to me like it's going to be the former, just saying.
>> ARTICLE
Well, this is topical. I just started watching Steins;Gate today.
>> ARTICLE
Because Steins;Gate is so much better than Chaos;head.

Chaos Head starting off great to me, but the ending got rather lame. The characters weren't quite as good either. I don't get the hate for CH that some have, but I enjoyed SG a lot more.

It's not though - people on the internet seem to love logical fallacies. In so far as Steins;gate being the best anime of all time is an opinion and MAL is an aggregate of opinions, it is reliable. The fallacy would apply if I were telling you MAL is the definitive answer and no one could disagree - I'm not though. I'm telling you it's reliable.

So, in other words, you agree that S;G is not the best anime of all time just because MAL says so.

"Eye tracing"? What? Do you mean using a reference? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't heard of it. It's a technique that's only used by, oh, every artist in the world.

>> ARTICLE
...Um, what, every artist I know [and I am an artist] only uses references as *a reference point*. Not, ya know, to completely copy it 90% accurately. Unless they're doing it for a class or a study of some sort. 

There's nothing wrong with what OP did, but you're wrong, most professional artists do not copy/'reference' *other artist's work.*

Thanks! Shading is one of the very few things I'm good at. It took me about an hour maybe to do this. I tend to take longer on things then I should mainly because something will seem off or not quite right to me and then I have to fix it.
