Really? A friend of mine works for them still according to him and his facebook page. They did change their name to 4K Media though. Maybe I'm confused though as he did say he used to work at 4Kids and now works at 4K Media Inc.

 whoa

 that might be the first time I've ever heard of Konami getting into television . .or at least, I've they've ever been involved in TV before I didn't hear about it.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly! It's so annoying having to retread that ground when it's so far behind us that the only people who still see it are the ones that are trying to champion some kind of cause that has long since been irrelevant. It's even worst when I have to hear "But doesn't 4kids still dub One Piece? Last time I saw One Piece on tv Sanji had a lollipop instead of a cigarette" on the One Piece subreddit! You'd think they would know better.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they want to know better. They just want their own opinion thrown back at them, especially if they insist on using arguments like this. I tend to just move on.
>> ARTICLE
That's definitely true for some, but I've ran into some people who were legit unaware of the goings on behind the One Piece license, or anything revolving around dubbing because you know "all dubs are shit LOL". Plenty will keep themselves blind and turn away, but I'm hoping for at least 1 person to be awakened to the facts.

That's kind! I hate subs vs. dubs debates here, as a half-sub/half-dub viewer. They never really go anywhere.

I Still love that song, so catchy!

Best part of the 4kids dub was the [intro song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTB-_4LAVQ), worst part was Sanji's voice.

that was a pretty rad intro

honestly, that worst part could easily become the best part if Funimation hires David Moo to be the voice of Duval. Impostor Sanji voiced by the worst Sanji ever? It would be the best joke ever.

This needs to happen. How do we make this happen.

I say talk to the One Piece Podcast and get them on board with the idea so they can bring it up with the funimation guys whenever they get to interview them again or have them as guests. They have the most access to them.

I believe they also tried to cut/dub Card Captor Sakura so that Syaoran was the main character. 
>> ARTICLE
http://actar.wordpress.com/2011/05/28/the-%E2%80%9Camericanisation%E2%80%9D-of-cardcaptor-sakura/
>> ARTICLE
Did they? When I watched it as a kid I still got the impression that Sakura was the main character. 
>> ARTICLE
They didn't exactly try to make Syaoran the main character, but they wanted him to be more pronounced than he actually was because you can't have an action show with just girls! Also, I don't think that was 4kids. I think that was done by Nelvana, unless Nelvana was just a licensor or something different.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, 4kids had no involvement in Cardcaptors. Fox also did something similar to the tv version of Escaflowne. Did even air the first episode and tried making Van the focus of the show. That only lasted about 7 episodes before being cancelled.
>> ARTICLE
No, that was Nelvana. Nelvana cut the first 5 or so episodes out so Syaoran would be introduced earlier, cut any subplot involving Sakura normal friends, cut any subplot involving her brother or his friend, and would cut random episodes entirely. An average episode only about 10 minutes long.

I..I've always heard the 4kids dubs were bad, but wow. That's just...wow

I actually didn't know this. Had no idea. I don't watch One Piece though so that probably doesn't help.

4 Kids Legitimately RUINED one piece for me 11 years ago. I hated it for the following 10 years. I marathon'd it in Sub'd last year, And its now my top anime. 

I've hated them ever since. 

God, I remember the days. Nartuo was the shit, I would make fun of one piece daily. 

oh boy.... Its the other way around now. 
>> ARTICLE
I hated the 4Kids dub, but I liked Sanji's lollipop...
>> ARTICLE
While I do enjoy dubs one reason I've watched the show for so long is because of the great character voices especially Luffy (ZOOOKEH ZOOOOKEH!)
>> ARTICLE
No duh. Who hasn't even got the memo yet? smh
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they suddenly change all of the voice actors around that sky island arc?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. That would be when Funimation got One Piece from 4kids. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember it being terrible because everyone sounded the same and luffy sounded like a serious 30 year old man.
>> ARTICLE
That's so untrue dude, you're not even trying to sound correct.
>> ARTICLE
It was a huge shock when it happened, as I had no idea what kind of stuff was happening behind the scenes. After a while I got used to the new voices and came to love them.  I think Chopper's voice changing with the form he was in was something that 4Kids did really well, though, and wish they would've kept.
>> ARTICLE
That's just what I remember, one week Luffy sounds like a kid and the next he sounds way older.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you watched, but alright. I honestly don't care about people's opinions on the Funimation dub. I just want to make people aware that 4kids doesn't have it and that there are dual audio dvds available so even if you don't like what they do, you can still have it in japanese. Of course you can just download it too but then this wouldn't be the thread for you to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
I did see some of the 4kids dub back when it was airing, long ago. But that's not what keeps me from watching One Piece. I don't know what you'd call it, the character design? It just looks too stupid to me.


I know there's gotta be something to it, though, considering how ridiculously long it is, and the fact that it's still quite popular.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. I was really turned off by the drawings at first too. I am sure if you are able to watch at least 10 episodes, you will fall in love with the characters and story.

I think I've said before that I do not care about people's opinions on dubs and that the only thing that people really should unanimously be thankful to Funimation to is the fact that they put out a dual audio product. I personally believe Funimation's dub to be good. I like it. Also, is the belgian tv airing of One Piece done in belgian/another language or english? Just curious. 
>> ARTICLE
Best worldbuilding, character development, story, premise, and art of all of the big three that doesn't have the MC as an OP character who always wins because of his nakama. Hell, One Piece has an entire *saga* related to this topic. It's world is hella extensive as well and tops both Naruto and Bleach in this regard while still not succumbing to power gaps that Bleach and Naruto had in their late-game.
>> ARTICLE
Better planning is probably the biggest thing. It's more consistent and there's some foreshadowing as well. Also, as far as the manga goes (which is where most of the popularity stems from), superior art. You may have seen [this](http://8.asset.soup.io/asset/0725/5704_3375_960.jpeg) image floating around the web at some point, but if not, that hammers that point home.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the art is a huge deal for people. (Look at Hunter x Hunter *sigh*) I think it's more about the world-creating and the consistency (Oda-sensei is also a really cool dude)
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I disagree on the art. For example, while I agree that Bleach's story is somewhat... "iffy" at times, I still prefer Kubo Tite's type of character design plus artistic layout compared to Oda. 

If you factor in the anime as well, Toei really can't match some of the amazingly slick animation they have in Bleach or Naruto. The Kakashi and [](/s "Obito") fight along with the last battle in Bleach are both very crisp and well done and I prefer it over Toei's stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I just think Toei needs to improve its animations, other companies are far better in fight scenes and stuff or details that Toei isn't good, like Madhouse who made an amazing work with Hunter X Hunter 2011 (recommended) and other titles like, Highschool Of The Dead, Nana and even Trigun who is old as it gets.
>> ARTICLE
I like Kubo's character designs, but I think Bleack is pretty lacking as far as backgrounds go. There's a reason it gets so much flak for all-white/-black/-blur backgrounds. This isn't as much of a problem with Naruto, although I still find One Piece to be, on average, more detailed.

As far as anime goes, I don't disagree.
>> ARTICLE
The background thing is true, but, although a lot of people give him shit about it, I think some of what Kubo says about having simple backgrounds to emphasize characters and to make it more "artistic" can be true. 

That said, it's really a taste thing, I think all three artists are equally impressive, Kubo's style just appeals to me more.
>> ARTICLE
>The background thing is true, but, although a lot of people give him shit about it, I think some of what Kubo says about having simple backgrounds to emphasize characters and to make it more "artistic" can be true. 

Current art spoilers: [This guy](http://imgur.com/ZrnBwqR) stands out in a way he wouldn't with an overdesigned background.

This, I agree with. I really prefer Bleach to One Piece when it comes to art, with Naruto falling somewhere in between.

>> ARTICLE
Ah, I'd forgotten that Kubo had once said that. Can't fault him as an artist for his style, I guess, although I think that simplicity has its place and Kubo can go a little overboard with it. But to each their own.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, he does tend to overuse the random white room with pillars theme and having the Shinigami fight in the sky certainly doesn't make for complex backgrounds. It is worth noting though, that, unlike One Piece, the characters in Bleach don't really go to any sort of exotic land to fight, there's like 4 settings max, and I can respect him using a simplistic style in order to make it a bit more unique.
>> ARTICLE
Superior art is a bit much. 

Naruto and bleach look good/great the whole chapter, not just one single (obviously dedicated page)
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't really saying that Naruto and Bleach didn't look good all-around. Maybe I didn't post the best example. But I just skimmed a few OP chapters on average, and it still looks decent to good on every page, if not every panel, so it's also good all-around. Plus, Bleach in particular, while having well-drawn characters, usually, is pretty lacking in the background department.

Bleach at its best is generally like [this](http://i61.tinypic.com/2yuyv6g.png), for instance. I think there's better, but I had trouble finding anything. But anyway, not only are pages like that rather uncommon, One Piece's best still surpasses that. I wasn't trying to knock on the art of the other two, but I definitely think that One Piece's art is superior on average. Plus, the majority who prefer One Piece feel the same way (I usually hate this copout argument, but it's relevant here), which is what the OP asked about to begin with. 
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree with everything you have said about the art.

I consider One Piece to be the ugliest, messiest one of them when it comes to artstyles. Every character that isn't a main character (and even some of those) are butt ugly, the chapters messily drawn and there is a sense of "overdesign" where too much stuff is thrown on top of each other all the time.

Bleach on the other hand keeps it simple. It uses strong contrast, rather than a ton of lines to make simple, powerful images. 

Imo, the current arc is absolutely [gorgeous](http://imgur.com/SWY24Ef)
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is very broad and covers a lot of themes that you won't see get exposure in Bleach or Naruto. Much bigger world and you really feel like you are on an adventure. A lot of things are also planned form the very beginning and there is a lot of foreshadowing. It never feels like the creator is pulling something out of his ass randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the One Piece world is way bigger, explained, and trust me when I say it, the evens happening at the very beginning MATTER even hundreds of chapters later. Bleach is very straightforward, its a battle shounen at its finest, it has great fights, reasons behind them may be shaky, but the fights itself are very good. Chapters for the most part don't even have background, so they are easily animated, and contrary to popular belief that I've read here, the filler in Bleach far outscale the filler in Naruto, not like it's a hard thing to do..(Ninja ostrich..) Naruto on the other hand has a bigger "story" than Bleach, it has its reasons for doing this and that, however it drowns in it's plotholes and Talk no Jutsu of the main character. Still, it's a little bit better than Bleach. One Piece, well, the characters are great, each with it's own personality, the story is pretty straightforward at first, but then it escalates into things and themes that you wouldn't expect from a shounen, yet alone a seinen sometimes. Compared to Bleach or Naruto, the plotholes in One Piece are pretty much non existant, it's long, that's true, but the author cares for the world and if they are things unexplained, be prepared, because they will sooner or later.
>> ARTICLE
I'd personally heavily advise against watching the anime of any of those three. They all suffer from terrible pacing, poor animation and long, badly done fillers. Read the manga instead if you want to experience any of those stories, they are the superior choice for all three.

In any case, One Piece is usually considered better, because *it is.* Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to excessively cheapen Bleach and Naruto here, though for fairness sake I have to admit I have grown very disappointed with those two over the years. There are parts of Bleach and Naruto that are wonderful, the Soul Society Arc remains one of my favourites from all three and I adore pretty much everything related to Gaara, but the truth is simply that One Piece beats its competition in most aspects. Characters, plot, action, setting - especially the setting and the amount of world building that goes into it are incomparable to pretty much anything else.

And then there is the simple fact that after a certain point, the writing very much drops in quality in both Naruto and Bleach. When and where they go bad is debetable - personally I'd say that the Great Snake Escape was the shark jumping moment of Naruto and that Kubo's last remaining talent died during the extended stay in Mexico.

I could write (and have done so in the past) a long essay on the greatness of One Piece, but it's 4am and I've already written far too much. As a final point I'll just mention how much I adore the scale of the story Oda has built and how interconnected the entirety of it is on a fundamental level. As a quick example, the current arc villain was introduced into the story a decade and about 500 chapters ago, and the arc itself continues a subplot Oda started 15 years ago.
>> ARTICLE
I think the One Piece anime is very much worth watching. There isn't that much filler, and a lot of the filler is as good as the actual stuff. The pacing isn't really an issue until 500 episodes in and even then it's not even that bad. The main reason that I think the anime should be watched over the manga is the music. The music just makes some scenes so much more epic. I've gotten goose bumps from scenes in the anime that made me feel nothing in the manga. I haven't seen/read the other two so I can't comment on them.
>> ARTICLE
Finally someone who actually agrees with my opinion of the anime. I tried reading the One Piece manga but having no animation/music/voices makes the moments that would be amazing/great in anime form just decent/cool in manga form.
>> ARTICLE
Obligatory - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-2pNWspRo
>> ARTICLE
One of the reasons why that arc is in my top 3
>> ARTICLE
A punch so hard, it punched all the color out of the scene.  
>> ARTICLE
At first I didn't really give it much of a chance, I suppose the artwork really turned me off

In my first year of university I was caught up with both naruto and bleach anime's and I think this is the time that the CP9 arc for One Piece just ended and all my friends were just floored with how well it was done. So I decided to watch it.

Quite honestly, the back story that Oda attempts to make for every character and the level of depth that he wants for this project is astonishing. Even at this point where it started before naruto, and is still going longer than naruto, there isnt really a point in time where you feel as if you're "borred"....I use quotations because I'm not quite sure what adjective to use to describe the infinite possibilities that could may still happen with One Piece, and thats crazy because he developed such a intricate back story that he's given himself a lot of valleys as to how he can move this foreward.





 
>> ARTICLE
Seems really interesting. I do agree that a show is way more interesting when you can't predict what exactly will happen next.
>> ARTICLE
Better writing, actual planning, slightly less filler.
>> ARTICLE
From my experience with Naruto, if you have a huge backlog you can skip filler!
>> ARTICLE
One Piece doesn't lose it's charm later on unlike Bleach and Naruto. Instead of feeling like it's "dragging on the story and the story should have ended a few arcs early", One Piece keeps building upon what it's built in a beautiful way. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about Naruto and One Piece, but I can tell you why Bleach *isn't* considered the best. I've been following Bleach for about 7 years now, and I still do, but the only reason I haven't dropped it is because I want to finish it. I don't want to *see how it ends*. I honestly couldn't are less. I've just been following it for so long that I don't want to just outright drop it, and that is the only reason I haven't.

There used to be a wide array of characters I was quite interested in. My favorite was, and is, Rukia, and I maintain that she's the only character in the entire manga that would be considered a legitimate character in a serious story for the entire length of her character history. There are other somewhat compelling characters, but even the more appealing ones (Soi Fon, Kyoraku, Kenpachi) are woefully underdeveloped. For a long time the show has been skating by on its steadily declining fandom and by exploiting the massively popular characters of its earlier days like Urahara and Aizen. These characters don't even do anything special once they show on screen. Their presence is enough to give the fans over at /r/bleach hype because at least this week's chapter isn't a *complete* waste.

I don't know why One Piece is considered the best of the Big 3. But as a long-time Bleach fan, I can tell you that in the state it's been in for the last few years the manga would not be considered the best of **ANYTHING**. Yosuga no Sora had better story in its 12 episodes than Bleach's last 150 chapters, and I'm not even kidding with that. Kubo took Gin away from us and gave us the Vandenreich, the Royal Guard and whatever the hell Fullbring was all about. That's not cool.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach's first proper arc when they enter the soul society for the first time was amazing, easily one of the best arcs in shounen anime along with the Marine ford Arc from One Peice

Hunter X Hunter didnt really have any stand out Arcs but was overall good

and Naruto has some really amazing fight sequences the first Naruto vs Sasuke fight was so well done especially good job by the animation department they really stepped up their game.
>> ARTICLE
The Chimera ant arc isn't a stand out arc? 

I thought I heard it all when someone on here told me he liked Nozaki Kun's Art over BERSERK of all things, but this might take the cake. I've heard great things about the soul society arc, but I have a hard time actually believing that it's that much better than the Chimera ant. Yeah, it's long, has pacing problems and narrator issues, but Even counting all of that it was still an amazing arc. Even if you didn't like that arc, the Yorknew City arc was arguably just as good, and didn't have any of the narrative problems of The Chinera Ant arc. 

I mean, I like HxH but it's not my favorite shounen by any means, nor is it in my top 5, but I'll be damned if someone mentions the best shounen arcs and doesn't include one of these guys. 
>> ARTICLE
The pacing for the chimera ant arc is what made me stop watching, it was that bad.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, I also don't see any arc in HxH that stands up to the soul society arc. LOVE HxH, but the SS-arc is just that damn good and solid.

As to the chimera ant arc? It didn't feel contiguous and smooth enough for me to give it that level of praise, it jumped around too much. The game world arc would be the one that stood out to me as a solid full arc (instead of the show as a whole and the ride).

I don't think HxH works to split it into any of it's arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I found greed island to be he worst of the three main arcs, by a long shot really. 

The Chimera ant arc had its narrative and pacing problems, but as far as stories go, it's probably the most solid I've seen. 

Good character development from the main cast and it's villains. 

A likely takeover scenario of earth. 

Great battles in every sense of the word. They all carried a lot of weight and emotion, and most were very original and unpredictable in how things would play out because of the varied fighting styles. Not to mention all the mind games. 

An unexpected ending that deviated from you typical shounen ending, but was more powerful in delivering it's message (a message that was hampered by the bad narration). 

I still need to see the Soul Society arc but this is seriously up there in terms of writing with the best Shounen anime have to offer, along with The Yorknew City Arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh you misunderstand, I will agree that the story of the chimera arc is fucking fantastic, it's really interesting and deep...but condensed. It's paced very poorly, has a bit too much of what I would consider filler, and loses momentum too often to be what I call a complete arc in and of itself on par with the SS-arc (another disclaimer: I fucking hate bleach).

I also agree the story in greed island is lacking. But it holds itself together as a contiguous arc better than most of them.

Trick is that much of the chimera arc falls on the previous arcs and draw story from everything that has happened thus far to really bring it together and make it shine. Soul Society is a fantastic story self contained, without pulling anything else in. It's also paced fantastically, doesn't introduce many frivolous side characters and back stories that don't really drive the plot, and generally just keeps momentum and has a badass climax.  And you mentioned fight scenes, sorry...bleach is fucking stupid, boring, drawn out, GROSSLY edgy, etc. etc. etc...but it's hard to beat bleach's (the anime) action. Top tier shit right there.

HxH blows anything bleach throws forward but that arc out of the water imo, and even then the whole of HxH overshadows that. It's just a very classic arc, and I don't personally feel (although I love it) that any one chunk of HxH shines through in quite the same way...even though the show itself is a fantastic ride and written SO much better, with FAR more memorable characters.
>> ARTICLE
That's fair, I can't say otherwise as I haven't seen it yet. 

I didn't think the arc relied too heavily on other parts of the series though. I mean, yeah it did a bit because it was a mid show arc, but all the threats and characters were newly introduced, and it had very little of other villains or car tees from another arcs (2 episodes with the troupe, no sign of hisoka, only main dude to come back was the Chairman, who we learned very little of since his introduction). Yeah the start of the arc had to do with the ending of greed island, but that was pretty insignificant. 
>> ARTICLE
Biggest thing about chimera Ant arc was that during the time it was being published in Jump, Togashi's health not being what it used to be, the art did suffer. Of course that doesn't apply to Madhouse's adaptation. 

disclaimer - I love HxH, one of my few 10/10s and Chimera Ants are one of my favorite arcs of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I've read all of Naruto and Bleach, watches a most of the Naruto anime and up to the first filler arc of Bleach and although I love both of them the little exposure I've had with One Piece blew me away. It has much deeper themes such as prejudice, slavery and human testing in it, and although it looks like a big melting pot of a whole bunch of story's and backgrounds almost everything is connected to one another. Also Fairy Tail is shit
>> ARTICLE
> Also Fairy Tail is shit

Now that's just uncalled for. Let's not just start randomly throwing around irrelevant insults.
>> ARTICLE
Out of the three bigs in Shonen Jump, One Piece is *by far* the most popular. That's why it's considered the best. It's not about how well the anime is, but more about the popularity of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, looking at the numbers, I don't see anything passing up One Piece for a LONG time.(unless AoT retains it's popularity for 50+ chapters)
>> ARTICLE
I don't even think Attack on Titan is gonna last another 50 chapters.

I read something about the writer wanting to end it at around 3 anime seasons worth of material, which would be around 30-40 more chapters.
>> ARTICLE
No, it's not. The Big 3 is a concept of the US and One Piece isn't by far the most popular there.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in mainstream media bleach, naruto are more well known and bleach lasted the longest on TV also.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach did not have then longest TV run - it ended in 2012 with 366 episodes. Shippuuden itself is on episode 404 and is still airing. Plus there is also the 220 episodes from the original naruto series to add onto the total. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah in japan. In the usa bleach lasted the longest, i replied to the guy talking about the us so good job on keeping up.
>> ARTICLE
have you been to japan? there's one piece shit fucking everywhere. it's probably the most popular anime currently airing/manga currently publishing, more popular than stuff like sazae-san and doraemon. it's definitely more popular than naruto, bleach, gintama, fairy tail, dragon ball, probably detective conan, maybe even pokemon too. everyone knows about one piece over there.
>> ARTICLE
But OP didn't ask what the most popular in Japan is (out of the Big 3). Nobody denies the dominant position One Piece has in Japan. But as far as popularity in the West goes, it's not as clearcut as it is in Japan.

And why are we talking about popularity anyway? It's not like the most popular anime equals the best one.
>> ARTICLE
You go to Japanese forums, they also use the concept of Big 3. Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece are (or was) considered the three top "kanban" manga, meaning the face of Shonen Jump. Now that Naruto has ended and Bleach is down in popularity, One Piece is the only face of the magazine.

And One Piece *is* by far the most popular manga. It consistently ranks at the top of Shonen Jump's questionnaire system, and it was the top-selling manga of all of 2014 (11,885,957 copies), with the largest circulation of all time (300,002,000).
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I didn't know the thing with "kanban", thanks for the info.

But I think OP's question relates to the western community. So the popularity in Japan isn't really the question here, although you're right that One Piece is the most popular manga there.

I don't have any sales figures right now, but afaik One Piece isn't significantly more popular than the other two here in the West.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, well, yeah...in the US, probably none of that matters.

Guess I kinda got mixed up, sorry about that. If it's here in the US, I would think the American adoration of ninjas help boost the popularity of Naruto, but I really don't know any stats for America.

I don't have Western stats on hand either, but I think you're right. Just based on personal observation alone, Naruto and Bleach are probably close to its popularity if not moreso in the US. 

I don't think that abomination of a 4Kids dub did One Piece any favors over here, either.
>> ARTICLE
Far enough, outside America though there really isn't a big 3. Just One piece and everything else.
>> ARTICLE
Big 3? No! There are only two, imho:

1.- Hiatus X Hiatus

2.- OP


>> ARTICLE
For me there are the anime I watched when I was a child DBZ, Hunter X Hunter, NGE. 

Then there are the Big 3, Naruto, Bleach, OP which reintroduced me to anime and got me into subs rather than dubs.
>> ARTICLE
Its apples and oranges. There's always differing opinions its just more popular in Japan
>> ARTICLE
Really just has to do with the story in general and the direction it takes.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the way the writer ties in the character stories is perfect. He doesn't just place characters there and forget about them. There was a cool tie in from when they first entered the Grand Line and how that tied in with the Thriller Bark Arc 300 episodes or so later. Everything happens for a reason. Naruto always won fights because of the Nine Tails, but Luffy isn't OP at all and there's progression to his strength. I've watched all of the Big 3 and I dislike Naruto the most. One Piece is just amazing, you have to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Because Naruto and Bleach sucked.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto was pretty good up until around the Chuunin Exam arc, and then it went really downhill really fast.
>> ARTICLE
Idk man the chunin exams is one of my favorite arcs in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Shippuden is pretty solid imo.
>> ARTICLE
Without filler, it's not bad. To be honest I hated Naruto, other than Gaara's section. So I would say shippuden is a big upgrade.
>> ARTICLE
The first arc was actually fantastic! The potential was there.
>> ARTICLE
> I just decided to watch Naruto Shippuden

> I might watch [One Piece] after I finish Naruto

F

I think it's considered better because it relies less on tropes. Not that it's perfect, but of the three it's more unpredictable. The characters also stay true to their personality.

I've watched like 30 episodes (and read until the chapter with the whale) so don't take my word for it.
>> ARTICLE
I already started it years ago, so I felt I just needed some closure on the series. Plus if you're like me and have a back log of 200+ episodes of Naruto, then you can skip the filler, and then it's not so bad :)
>> ARTICLE
Things are just done better. The cast is done better and so is the world building. Things come together and feel connected story wise. It's got ranges of emotions. I mean atm it's been meh (i'm behind a few chaps tho). But it generally does those things better than naruto and bleach.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest most manga would do better if they had ability to have there work left alone like Oda does. 

Even bleach with all its sales was tampered with. 

Medaka box, psyren are just two examples of series that could of been huge if they weren't threatened with cancelation every month.
>> ARTICLE
One piece stands out from the other big 3 simply because it is better planned out and a more refreshing story. Lets be honest here [naruto spoiler] (/s "akatsuki>pain>obito>madara>kaguya villain scale coupled with naruto and sasuke scaling in power to match was pretty bland and repetitive"). I honestly believe that all 3 are living in the shadow of DBZ when it comes to longevity and execution of the story but, when it comes to surpassing DBZ only hunter x hunter can be mentioned. Extremely well executed manga and anime (2012 and old).
>> ARTICLE
Can we please stop this hivemind thinking? Just because 260.000 people of /r/anime enjoy One Piece more than the other two doesnt mean it has to be the best.

If anything /r/anime should know best that commercial success is not equal to the quality of the show.

In all seriousness i think if you gave One Piece, Bleach, Naruto and Dragonball (why are people not counting db anymore?) a chance and watched the first 25 episodes you can decide what you think is better based on your need of enjoyment.

Some people like stylistic emos fighting each other with feelings and tears in Bleach others like the more basic approach in Dragonball with big blasts and oldschool fights or you like the concept of Ninjas with magic powers doing missions and having to defeat an enemy of the past or maybe you like to have a certain set of characters where you want to explore their pasts and future adventures together as a crew on a ship or even in a guild full of mages in One Piece and Fairy Tail.

Dont base your identity on the shows you watch and instead find shows that base themself on your identity.

Its popular in japan, outside of it bleach and naruto reign supreme. 

One piece is good but its status often shields it of the same complaints people say about other shonen like bleach, naruto, fairy tail ect ect.
>> ARTICLE
Hell no. I have an equal amount of complaints for One Piece as I do with the others you've named. The difference being that the rest have problems that break immersion and/or the story.

Naruto has a main character whose resolution was flimsy, lazy, and a failure (though broadcast as a success)
Bleach has a main character that has absolutely no purpose
Fairy Tail has no grasp on itself as a series and is shown time and time again by the main character's lack of any kind of competent writing. (He defeats people by eating their powers, which is outside the confines of his own ability and never explained, he doesn't care about anything but retaining the status quo, and is essentially as one dimensional as you can get.

One Piece has a main character that lacks character development (in comparison to the other main characters in the series) his reason for being the way he is is explained however which gives room to prolong this status. He is the enigma that ties the crew together.

The difference being a lot more is thought out in comparison to the rest. I didn't mention Toriko because I believe that in a lot of ways it is superior to One Piece, however of the "big 3" One Piece is without a doubt the strongest.
>> ARTICLE
Use spoiler tags and please explain how it's explained why Luffy has a lack of character development. I'm caught up on the anime, and I have no clue what you are talking about (although I don't find him a very shallow character to begin with, just "pure" I guess would be the word...Luffy is very consistent).
>> ARTICLE
I can't remember exactly where, and it might have been in the Arlong Park arc so there's no need to spoiler tag really, but Luffy essentially admits his lack of capability by telling someone that he can't do all of the things that his crew does. He can't draw maps, he can't swing a sword, or tell lies (usopp) or cook. All he can do is kickass. He depends on his crew as much as his crew depends on him. Of course I'm paraphrasing but yeah.
>> ARTICLE
That IS character development for me. Luffy is a Goku, maybe more Goku than Goku.

He is pure, and sticks to his ambitions and morals, which it shows how he gained. He is what a captain is supposed to be, he truly relies on his crew and friends. 

I don't see that as a very flat character.
>> ARTICLE
No no I'm not saying that isn't character development, I'm saying that is the reason for his lack of character development in comparison to the rest. He has his role and sticks to it, he protects his "assets" where as in comparison a character like Zoro will suffer dilemnas in which they have to trust their mortal enemy. Luffy hasn't had to go through anything like that on multiple occasions like the rest, which is why I say that it is uneven.
>> ARTICLE
From what I have noticed, people who have watched more Anime appreciate One Piece for its (surprisingly) little filler. Naruto is better for the ones who haven't seen as much. In America at least, Naruto is easily far more popular. One Piece wasn't shown nearly as long as Bleach and Naruto. And Bleach is absolutely horrid with how they do their filler episodes. I feel like that is why it is considered "the best" by most of the veterans.

Personally, I find the characters in One Piece as amazing. Better than Naruto. However, with that being said, Naruto's world building is far better. You get a real sense of how large and connected the world is. In One Piece, it feels like each arc can be its own story. Besides abilities and characters, not much carries over. (However, I think this is starting to change since [the](/s *"time skip.")

In the end, it is really just a matter of preference. As far as anime goes, I appreciate world building more and so I prefer Naruto. Plus, I actually don't mind the characters. Naruto is definitely more Shounen.


>> ARTICLE
They're just opinions. I like bleach and naruto waayyy better. 
>> ARTICLE
I am going to give my less than popular opinion, OP isnt as good as people think it is and for me is impossible to get into simply on the Art, which is god awful. The character look disgusting, and there is no explanation on the inconsistency in certain non giants highs, the female character designs are absolutely vile. That being said it is a post DBZ action shounen series, where everyone the main character meets has a "sad" back story to force emotion on the readers/watchers, instead of letting is happen natural. The action shounen genre is basically all the same now, which is why I dropped most of them, they unnecessarily extend the storys throw is a sad past per arc, and beg for their readers to attach themselves to the characters. OP fans also think of the series as the Holy Grail, and are basically as crazy as SAO so beware.

>> ARTICLE
I'm offended that you compared me to a SAO fan. Those are definitely crazier.
>> ARTICLE
It's not. One piece has the worst pacing I've ever seen. Rather just watch fillers 
>> ARTICLE
In two hundred chapters we will see dragon again for two pages which resulted in nothing... 

The fact one piece isnt even close to ending is a huge put off. I dont want to wait 7+ years to get close to a ending. He is (or SJ probably) milking the money like they did with dragon ball (akira wanted to end it at freeza)
>> ARTICLE
DBZ is different though. Buu saga was actually pretty good and they finally ended.

When your show goes pass 600 episode I think its time to start wrapping it up.
>> ARTICLE
Buu saga IMO is very good. The quality improved immensely, and we got to see Vegeta's character come to terms with himself.

I don't know probably because it has the most fans. In the end the big 3 are very basic anime. I don't really like anyone of them.  Pain from naruto was a fucking beast tho.

Emilia from The Devil is a Part Timer became one my favorites when she [Devil is a Part Timer](/s "breaks down in front of Maou about how he can be so kind in this world. About why he would flood their cities, and burn their lands in the old, yet he is so kind to this world.")


Really fleshed out her character a lot, and I thought it was very impactful. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish they made another season, one of my favorite animes

Or something like that
>> ARTICLE
And it really does warrant a fucking explanation.
>> ARTICLE
It's explained in the LN that [Spoilers](/s "Maou never really understood how extreme the pain and suffering was that his generals wrought upon the rest of Ente Isla. He understood that the world was being conquered, but he was kept in the dark about how horrid the atrocities committed against the humans were.")
>> ARTICLE
That is such pathetic explanation to make the mc look more "nicer"
>> ARTICLE
I never did read the LN, but watching the show i never needed the explanation as i think it is rather logical. Remember, Maou was 100% demon back on Ente Isla, and he was exterminating humans from the realm as humans would with any animal who had bred out of control and taken over an ecosystem. You might say that this is a bad comparison because humans are intelligent, but look at dolphins. Humans kill and eat them in hordes and no one really bats an eye. All of this is redundant though, as Maou could only start emphathizing with people when he came to earth, as he is now part human.

>> ARTICLE
I feel like they each represent one aspect of what a good leader should be. Archer is the judge who passes laws and decides what is and isn't right. Rider is the general who leads people to victory and gives them a symbol to strive for. Saber is the self sacrificing leader who works to serve her followers.
>> ARTICLE
And I think just  as importantly, there are flaws in each. [Major F/Z spoilers](#s "Berseker/Lancelot") was totally unable to come to terms with Arturia's decisions and she ended up alienating one of her greatest allies.

Gil in F/SN couldn't see past his own ego in calling Archer a faker and paid the ultimate price for it, failing in his ambition and rulership.

Ultimately, Rider reduced his most loyal subject to a helpless, crying child because he chose to fight an unwinnable battle in order to prove his strrength as king, as a man to be striven after.

When Kamina explained to Yoko that it was always Simon that turned his shouting into reality.

Before that he was a cool, inspiring bro that rushed in head first more often then not - but afterwards he was so much more.  
His entire "Who do you think I am?"-personality is carefully and deliberately crafted in order to push Simon. Sure, Kamina probably was always boastful but in this moment, in this scene you could see that he amplified this part of his personality.

He trusted Simon completely and unlimited and he found a way to help him basically every time he ever showed off.  
Truely the bro of bros.
>> ARTICLE
truly explains that "believe in the me that believes in you" line. Simon never had much faith in himself but Kamina had more than enough for the both of them. 
>> ARTICLE
And I think the best part of all that is how it eventually evolves into "Don't believe me in who believes in you. Believe in you who believes in yourself"
>> ARTICLE
Or in simpler terms, don't worry about what others think, just believe in yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Since this line developed from a line which baisicly meant:

"Even if you cant on your own, I will be here to make you do it!"

I think it should mean more of something like this:

"You dont have to rely on me any more, you can and are strong/experienced/old enough to look out for yourself now" 

the "Don't believe me in who believes in you" gives also the nuance that he still belives in him and has someone watching out for him even if he should not need it.

Since Gurren Lagann is a coming-of-age story this version fits more imho.

Well all the speeches Kamina held in TTGL are qualifying here. Same goes for all badass scenes of Luffy and simply all scenes with Onizuka-sensei.

But I remember in the original Naruto series the fight between Lee and Gaara at the chuunin exam from the point when Lee dropped the weights... that made him one of my all time favourites!

The line that solidified Kamina as a badass and one of my favorites was when he finally said "WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE SIMON!".

All he ever says...

You believe in me Simon and I believe in you! So believe in yourself! Or something among those lines!

Yeah, but his catchphrase was "Who the hell do you think I am." Simon always looked up to that, and never really got the whole "believe in the me who believes in you" thing.

>> ARTICLE
well, no new shows for a couple of years then i guess

 (well, Bleach ended. . . .right?? so how much more do they have left to go?)
>> ARTICLE
No new shows? There's 6 slots in the block that can be lifted for new shows by the end of this year alone, and Soul Eater will be done by next year (and Bleach will follow suit a few months afterward (?)). Not to mention the possibility of expansion into earlier hours, which seems likely considering that Bleach and Naruto keep beating the hour before them.

Besides, the big 3 are ratings gold, and good ratings = bigger budgets. Toonami needs that to get newer/shorter series (for example, we probably wouldn't have had Outlaw Star and Big O without DBZ's success). I have a good feeling that Michiko e Hatchin, Birdy the Mighty: Decode, Tiger and Bunny, and Panty and Stocking/Black Lagoon will come this year (or at least one of them).

>> ARTICLE
I think part of the problem is, One Piece is really really LONG.  It's a daunting task to get involved in the show/manga.  There is over 600 chapters currently to the manga and over 470 episodes to the anime.  That's not a small slice of time to devote to a anime series that comes from an environment where series have difficulty maintaining quality (The Shonen Jump Universe).

Series that are that long and manage to stay half-way decent are very rare. Shows that somehow keep getting better and better as time goes on are incredibly rare. In fact I'd say only a handful have ever managed to pull it off. Most start slipping after a couple of years.

All that being said, stick with One Piece it's really worth it. After Sanji joins the crew the show really takes off. There are scenes that will have your sides splitting with laughter and scenes that will damn near bring you to tears (Robin's rescue anyone?) Avoid the fillers like most Shonen Jump properties and you won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Well more than that, it's also got a rather simple plot.

And then take that plot and stretch it over 10x it's normal length, add a bunch of filler.

And all you really have left is characters, and character interactions.
>> ARTICLE
You'd think with all that space for character interactions they'd show what happens on the weeks they spend on ship. 
>> ARTICLE
Well K-On has also been accused of weak plot as well ;D

But atleast with that, they do a really good job with the character interactions.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible to like something and still not think it's the greatest thing ever.

They do enough with the plot to add depth. I.E. all the foreshadowing you notice later (if you look on whitebeards medical bag when he meets shanks, you can see law's symbol on it. there is a ton of shit like that). Also, there is definitely a meta plot that is evolving arc over arc, so you can't say there is no plot. The entire idea of the pirates, the yonkou, the marines, the gorouseki, the vice admirals, the void century, one piece, the pirate king, the will of D, these are all plot mechanics, not characters and character interactions. imo.
>> ARTICLE
>The entire idea of the pirates, the yonkou, the marines, the gorouseki, the vice admirals, the void century, one piece, the pirate king, the will of D, these are all plot mechanics, not characters

I'm confused.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't these ideas part of the plot? Shit like the marines run the world and are the largest organization, the void century that was created when the marines wiped out 100 years of history, the revolutionary army, the will of d, are all items that are slowly coming into focus as the story progresses. I think of the plot as being more and more visible as you follow luffy and co along. What are you confused about?
>> ARTICLE
Because I gave up after about 30 chapters.
>> ARTICLE
oh...onepiece.wikia.com. read the plot there if you're interested but not interested enough to sit down and read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
It has much more of a plot than DBZ ever did in my own opinion though.
>> ARTICLE
Well, yeah. Is there any anime with less plot than DBZ?
>> ARTICLE
I like the replies here so far, even the crtitcal ones. Sorry I, made it sound like I'd only liked the anime. This is r/anime after all but I too prefer the manga. Although there are scenes in the anime that I would seriously consider some of the most well-done, emotion provoking scenes in anime history. (choppers backstory? The music I think was what topped that for me)

My gripe here is that people tend to get impatient with one piece. I agree that its kinda lame when you gotta watch 30+ eps to enjoy it, but it's honestly worth it. But for me, episode 36/37 was when One Piece went from upbeat, all-ages fun adventure, to holy shit, I didn't see that coming. (Spoiler: Nami's mental breakdown which caused her to repeatedly stab herself in the arm, and luffy stopping her like a boss)

But I think you nailed it. One piece (manga and non filler anime) appeals to me in the way that other Long ass shounen mangas have failed: it keeps getting better. After 10 years, it's still getting better.

I just wish more people would see past the surface, endure a bit, and experience it for what it is. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the anime has a problem with taking too long in getting to Luffy's backstory arc. I realize the decision to start with him jumping out of the barrel was to probably to get the story moving faster, but from most conversations I've gotten into about One Piece, that was a deciding factor in them being turned off.

For me One Piece will always be my favorite manga. The anime has some problems in terms of conveying Oda's pacing, but does of good job of compensating for this with music. At the end of the day though Oda is just too great a master of manga for his work to be translated to an anime all can enjoy.

To say though that the characters are one-dimensional rings a little bizarre. Every character has a pretty damn solid motivation for his or her goals, heart-wrenching back-stories, and the bond of their camaraderie is what motivates them beyond their initial stories and onto their larger than life adventures in one of the most original worlds a manga's had since Dragonball. So yeah, no clue why someone would ever say the characters in One Piece were underdeveloped.
>> ARTICLE
I just read the manga to be honest, same with Naruto and Bleach (though those are much less common for me.).
>> ARTICLE
One piece is the best manga i've read. I love how intricate the plot can be with tons of foreshadowing, the character depth, the battles, the way they use their powers, and especially the humor. I also love how everything keeps escalating 24 style and is only getting better and better. Easily the best manga i've seen. This is a terrible write up of it's accolades. Just read it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. I think people are just unwilling to devote the time, really. I don't think there is an anime that even comes close to how good One Piece is.

In fact, it's so good that I find most other anime to be a little meh simply by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't watch a lot, but I could tell it wasn't really my thing. I guess I prefer anime that's more subtle and stylized, and I would have loved a pirate anime with more attention to detail. I thought the characters, especially the villains, were one-dimensional and silly. Like you said, maybe it's because it's meant more as an all-ages adventure show and less of a gritty character study, but for me to enjoy it on that level it would've had to be less battle-centric and more exploration-centric. Maybe I didn't watch enough episodes, but I don't think I should have to watch hundreds of episodes of something before it starts to pique my interest.

But it's not like I look down on people who enjoy One Piece, or consider it a "lesser" anime. Likewise, maybe you shouldn't assume that the only reason someone could possibly dislike it is because they're pretentious?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't assume that. It was more a provocation to hear a critique from someone who ISN'T pretentious.  I agree with you on most counts. I for one, other than One Piece, also prefer shows that are more stylized, compact and to the point. The classic 26-episode series' is my favorite. Maybe even two of those seasons. 

But one piece stands alone. If you ever get the time, I recommend continuing the anime without the fillers. The attention to detail increases dramatically, and a lot of events and scenes occur that you wouldn't expect from this anime. Oda is truly a genius. Something someone says or does in episode 20 might come back to have a huge impact in episode 200. There's really not a single misplaced word. 

I guess, like I said in another comment, I liked it (the manga/ non-filler anime) for it's ability to actually get BETTER as the story progressed and never die out. I read naruto / bleach. They fucking suck. They died out and sold out so long ago. And I'm talking about their mangas. 

Because of the reasoning you  gave, is the same reason i watched a couple eps and told my friend that I didn't like it, and put off watching it for two years. I'm not saying you have a naive uneducated opinion; I'm just saying that if you have the time, you should give it a shot.

I tried to like One Piece, I really did.  I stuck with it for a whole season.  What got my attention was the unique character designs, I really like how they are wacky and original.  Unfortunately, the pacing was way too slow for me (saw it coming).  To top it off, the writing was hit and miss.  Sometimes it was pretty good and had me moved, but at other times I was sitting there waiting for the stupid one-dimensional characters to go through their predictable one-dimensional storylines that I knew was going to happen because I had so much time to think about it between the repeated frames going at a snail's pace.  The manga is probably better, but I don't care, we're talking about the anime right now.  I was hoping it would be the neverending shounen that would break the stereotype that all neverending shounen have to have terrible pacing and animation shortcuts.  I don't want my anime to be a slower version of the manga with sound and color, the anime should stand on its own as its own medium rather than a way to bring a manga's story to the mainstream.
>> ARTICLE
what do you mean you stuck with it for a season? you mean an arc? The biggest knock you can say is it does take its time before getting going. It takes until they hit the new world to really start moving, and until i'd say they are fighting Crocodile until the show has really hit full stride. Judging before that point is stupid. 
>> ARTICLE
Why?  There are entire anime series that can tell amazing stories and create fully fleshed characters in less than 26 episodes.  What makes One Piece so special that I have to give it 100 when I can be watching 4 other series instead?  Also, I'm less concerned in my criticism with the actual content of the story than the anime as a whole.  Sure, later on the story gets better and the artwork gets a fancy HD upgrade, but it's still hard to watch because it's so terribly slow.  I'm not watching an anime so that the characters can take their time making poses, staring at each other while giving monologues about the power of friendship, and powering up, that's boring, and unfortunately, a lot of the screen time in One Piece is devoted to that.  

Yeah, I've seen some episodes past the initial 26 I watched myself.  Unfortunately, my argument still stands.  Just like everyone says, the content gets better, but everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that the presentation stays the same, and I'm big on presentation when it comes to anime.  

To make it clear: YEAH IT'S PRETTY COOL AND HAS COOL CHARACTERS AND IT IS MOVING AND STUFF BUT IT SUCKS AS AN ANIME!
>> ARTICLE
Well first off it's totally unfair for you to judge seeing as how you haven't seen it in it's entirety, or even close (I think). It has way way less filler than most manga->anime transitions, which is a huge plus considering the nightmares most people still likely have from the extended DBZ powerup and chi chi scenes. You are really off base when it comes to criticism for filler and dragging shit out because the show doesn't do that at all. Between major arcs a few times there were isolated tiny arcs of 5 episodes about but they were totally tolerable. Also, Oda has a more direct hand in the anime than most manga creators do, which makes it mesh well with the manga and keeps everything in cannon. The music score kicks ass. Really, you are being an idiot. Just because the show doesn't hit it's stride until they hit the new world isn't a big negative. The show has been going on for 10 years and you would hope it improved past the initial year greatly. Everything is rough when it starts and improves over time. One Piece improves way way more than anything else I've ever watched and continues to do so. There is a reason it is the number 1 manga in Japan.
If you are judging the anime based on the dubs, then you are watching a butchered version.

I never said anything about filler.  I can skip fillers.  I said that on an episode to episode basis, they spend a lot of time being intentionally slow so they can make more episodes for less money.

If I had the time and patience I would watch a quarter of the anime just to prove a bunch of people wrong or to find a new series that I like.  Unfortunately I don't have either.  Is it really that unreasonable to have an anime be enjoyable before 100 episodes have passed?

That's not fair to say, they don't puff up the episodes really. It sticks closely with the manga. 

>If I had the time and patience I would watch a quarter of the anime just to prove a bunch of people wrong or to find a new series that I like. Unfortunately I don't have either. Is it really that unreasonable to have an anime be enjoyable before 100 episodes have passed?

Ever listen to the band explosions in the sky? The songs start out very slow and slowly rise to the climax of the song for 10+ minutes. This is pretty unusual and would throw a lot of people off, but the ones that have the patience to stick around for something that takes slightly longer to crescendo get to hear some amazing music. Or, take the Tv show The Wire. There are a ton of characters in that show, much like one piece, and it takes hours before you even have any proper backstory and understanding of the characters before you can move forward. Lots of people will never be able to weather that, but the ones that do will get to watch one of the greatest tv drama's ever made. One Piece is the same way. There is a lot to build up before you are in the right setting for the show to progress. I enjoyed the early episodes but it takes you a while to dig into the meat and potatoes of the show. I think this actually is better this way, it provides a richer environment. The pacing and the timing of how the plots pay off is actually very impressive, it is rarely boring and pays off consistently more and more. If you haven't read an arc when they are in the grand line you aren't in a position to criticize the show. Enels Lobby and the war arc are both fucking fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
>That's not fair to say, they don't puff up the episodes really. It sticks closely with the manga.

Not with extra content, but with extra frames of the same image, no movement, and easy to draw camera angles.  Yes, it really does bother me that much.  

>...There is a lot to build up before you are in the right setting for the show to progress...

I'm the guy who tells people the first ~15 episodes of Eureka 7 are shit but they should watch it anyways.  I tell them Gurren Lagann is still worth watching after [Kamina Dies and Simon turns emo because it does get better](/spoiler).  I understand this concept, but really, 100 episodes just to start enjoying it?  I tell most people after recommending anime that if they don't enjoy it after 3 (in most cases), it's probably not for them.

I've seen bits of One Piece here and there before and after my attempt to get into it as well.  I have a half-assed but working knowledge of most of the character's backstories.  The later episodes are still plagued with the same problem the earlier ones are - they don't have enough content per episode.  Call me an OCD ADHD raging moron if you want, but for me, using the same camera angles as the manga (assuming, maybe they came up with their own unoriginal angles) for long lines of dialogue so you can zoom in and pan the same frame with a little mouth movement then cut to a picture of a building for a few seconds is just unacceptable.  I watched episode 264 (start of the Enels Lobby arc) just to make my point valid, and sure enough, all of those elements are present.  It's not a every once in a while thing, animes that do this, do it consistently to save money and it adds up until I can't stand it.  It's my anime pet peeve.  

That being said, let's talk about the manga for a second.  I've avoided talking about the manga because I didn't think it was fair for me to judge it without reading it first, but (despite everything else) no one will call me out for saying the manga is probably really good.  I actually think a lot of the content in One Piece is pretty interesting, and the character designs sold me (hence, why i tried to get into it that one time).  But I'll say this one last time - the presentation of the **anime** SUCKS BALLS.
>> ARTICLE
ahhhh you just spoiled gurren lagann for me! Also, I definitely enjoyed one piece before the 100th episode mark. I always liked it, I just thought it got a lot better once it got a chance to establish the main characters. If you don't like the anime fine, you aren't alone. I see people bitch about it all the time on one piece forums. Just read the manga, if you are into that sort of thing. You definitely can't complain about unnecessary filler at that point. Also, I don't think they do this to save money. They are on a tight time schedule and try to stick to the manga pretty close, which is likely why some scenes look the way they do. That's always been my take on it. I would think if you were going to bitch about the anime you would bitch about the music soundtrack. It's fantastic IMO but definitely gets repetitive. Why not read the manga then return to this discussion? I'd like to see what you think once you see the full story thus far laid out in front of you.

This falls under anime as well. And I was looking for a discussion, which is what is happening. Thank you :D
>> ARTICLE
Akin to MMORPGs in gaming, 100+ episode shounen anime are transparently designed to waste your life for the profit of the creator. This is not about delivering messages, themes, or art. This is a piece of cheese they hang before your eyes so you'll run. And while they occasionally let you nibble the cheese, their interest is to draw things out.

And what is the cheese they hang before you? Juvenile power fantasy. Five years ago I might have agreed that I watched Bleach/Naruto for the "immersive atmosphere" or "themes and issues". Bullshit. The whole genre thrives on immature self-projection and wistful thinking. It's masturbation, and while there's nothing shameful about masturbation, neither is there call to be proud of it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry you were being downvoted simply because you aren't a rabid One Piece fan.
>> ARTICLE
I always saw that as a result of people making One Piece knock-offs for the most part.  One Piece consistently ranks as one of the most popular anime/manga of all time, so of course Shonen Jump is doing its best to repeat that success . . . in every other series.

The lack of originality in everything else I feel brings One Piece down as an unfortunate result, since on the surface it is quite the same.  That being said, pretty decent stuff, and I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
That's what OP has a problem with.  People ASSUME One Piece is like that just because it's from Shonen Jump and it's really long and don't give it a chance. And that is just not the case.  One Piece actually gets better as it goes on.   

Don't get me wrong a lot of shounen anime is exactly as you described (unfortunately). But there are a few titles out there like One Piece and Hajime no Ippo that are really long but at the same time keep the story and characters fresh and interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. On a side note, I'm currently watching Ippo for the first time and plan on reading the manga. I hear it gets surprisingly good. 
>> ARTICLE
The manga is VERY long (something like 1000 issues and counting). My friend read it all and said it's awesome the whole way through. He stated reading it really fast was like watching a flip book. Hajime no Ippo is excellent and really increased my awareness of standup fighting skillsets.

Nothing in this thread can change the fact that you would have to dedicate over 10,000 hours of your life to see this series up to this point.



That = Fail

I'll agree with that! It is quite the time sink.

I wish they would do something similar to Dragon Ball Kai, where they cut out all of the filler and just get straight to the point.

Of if there happened to be a way where I can skip filler episodes and not miss anything important.



That would be the only way I could watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Well actually you can. Every filler in one piece completely stands alone. When I watched the series for the first time, I skipped every filler. And it was as if they didn't exist. It picks up after the filler arc right where the filler arc began.

It's not like other animes where some fillers are half an episode or they add characters that stay in the show like bleach. You can skip them and they will be never spoken of again. 
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes does watching it like that cut out?

**a lot** actually. Google one piece wikia and look for the episode guide. It labels which eps are filler and you can skip them without a second thought.

I can't believe you're so delusional as to think something like that.

If I didn't know better I would hate One Piece because of that pretentious section of the fanbase you're in. Not even Oda thinks his series is a commentary on mankind like you do.

Can you elaborate on your *opinion*?

Edit: thanks for editing your post by the way. It woulda been hard calling me pretentious when you sounded so pretentious yourself :)

I think the burden of proof would be on the person making such outrageous claims like One Piece having "innumerable allusions to real-world themes and issues." You don't even attempt to back them up but you're quick to call people who disagree stupid. 

I'm not acting pretentious at all. You're putting your favorite manga on a pedestal and parading it around as the greatest thing in the industry and that is has some profound message for everyone who reads it. I find it amazing how you imply my opinion is so insignificant merely because I disagree with you. You call me out on not backing it up while you do nothing of the sort to your own claims. 
>> ARTICLE
.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I'll bite. But if you continue with your straw-man arguments this could go on forever. 

I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for, so I'll give you two cut and dry specific examples of how Oda alludes to real life situations or philosophy. 

Spoilers below for people who aren't caught up. 


1. If you've ever seen One Piece, this one is obvious for anyone peering even slightly below the surface... "The World Government" and "Void Century". An all powerful organization controlling and censoring everything, including history itself. You seem intelligent enough that I don't need to remind you of how many real world organizations/governments this relates to.  

Not to mention the acts they committed against against people who attempted to learn the truth. The Ohara "demons"? Cmon man. Thousands slaughtered in cold blood, all for the sake of peace and "justice".  

2. A couple of character philosophies. All of it is very diverse. You have Zoro... The typical embodiment of Japanese stoicism. But Zoro takes it to the extreme. 

And Luffy? Is the straw hat alone not enough of a red flag to scream "Huckleberry Finn"!  And what was Huck Finn? An existentialist western adventurer. Loyal only to his goal and his comrades. Look at every single thing luffy says and does and tell me this isn't true. 

I could go on about every character and every backstory and every villain and named pirate and their relationships with one another. 

I don't know If you truly watched One Piece. Maybe you were turned off by it's pretentious fans. But I don't see how can't see these things and enjoy for what it is. I'm putting it on a pedestal 'cause you're forcing me to. But the purpose of my thread is to invoke this very discussion. 
>> ARTICLE
You just listed reasons for me not to like it.  Countless other stories are told about the same type of situations, and you say that it is deep?  Oh look, another unoriginal and cliche plot.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. He's listed nothing but common elements in shounen manga. All his post does is show that the characters are nothing but gimmicks.

I haven't read One Piece in a while but I remember the point I dropped it was during the Chopper recruitment arc,  the part where they find days-of-the-week group and get turned into wax, or the Arlong Park arc - all of which I'm sure is relatively early in the series. 

Another thing. How can you have a pirate manga and not have at least a little focus on the characters' interactions on the [many] days they spend alone on their ship? That's just poor storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
I listed a couple basic references among many more  to appease the K-ON man... But yes, it is deep. It's about the presentation of said references and to the extent of which they are told. Oda presents it in an original way, immersed in a very unique world. 

What's up with these stringy arguments?  Have you seen the show? It's almost like some of the people against One Piece have some personal problem with it. This is why I use the word "elitist".  Everyone thinks their favorite animes are the most profound creations ever made. I'm guilty of this too, but I don't go in other threads and shoot them down without giving them a chance. :x
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I think K-ON is is trash also.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the only thing I like about K-ON is the L4D2 mod. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you like? (I've never seen K-ON anyway)
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is definitely deep. I think the most intriguing thing about it, for me as an american, is the exposure you get to the entire way of japanese thinking and culuture. Their language structure shows you how they have different priorities.

Beyond that, one piece is still pretty deep. It tackles the morality issue pretty well.

Also, it's extremely hilarious. I think it's even funnier than earthbound.
>> ARTICLE
Might I inquire for specific examples?
>> ARTICLE
Read the replies I actually responded to K-ON dude with a couple examples. 
>> ARTICLE
The reason I don't watch One Piece is because I watched the first couple episodes and they sucked.  People always say "well, the first 30 episodes suck, but then it gets better" or something like that.  I don't want to watch 30 episodes of shit before a series becomes bearable.

If something takes 30 episodes to get good it simply isn't worth the time.

Funimation has the cook (Sanji) sounding like someone that smokes, and the 4kids one sounds like a jackass doing a bad Brooklyn accent. That should be a good indicator =) Also, the 4kids version has all of the guns replaced with supersoakers, and Sanji's cigarrete is a chewed up lolipop.

Also, the 4kids dub has the Pirate Rap as the intro.

All of the properly dubbed episodes from 1-205 are available at http://www.funimation.com/one-piece/videos, unless they took them down for some reason, for free.

If at any point you feel like the show starts getting too slow for your enjoyment, read that arc in the manga and pick up with the show at the next arc. Also, do not skip the G8 filler arc. It's great!

To tell you the truth, you should probably read the manga. The anime starts off pretty good, but it gets worse and worse as ir goes on.

I started with the manga, switched to the anime, then switched back to the manga 50 episodes later.  It's pretty much the only manga I read, but I definitely prefer it.

I personally feel, to really understand and get attached to the characters personality and such you have to stay away from the dubs and watch the subs. The english voices don't do the anime justice.

Why did you choose One Piece? There is a lot of better anime, just ask if you need a recommendation.

I watch tons of anime.  I just like to keep my options open and check out everything that I come across.  I usually give a show at least 20 episodes before I judge it.

At least 20 episodes? Does that mean you finish every anime you watch, haha.
>> ARTICLE
He meant for One Piece, not every anime.  It's really slowly paced.  what FLCL can describe in one episode, One Piece describes in 200.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the anime's pacing is prettyy whack. I read manga first so finishing anime was a struggle (still ok if you skip I suppose)
>> ARTICLE
No, for the longer animes I watch around 20,  for the shorter series I watch about 5 before judging. 
>> ARTICLE
I would suggest, that if you didnt completely hate One Piece after those 20 episodes, you should keep watching till you reach the arlong park arc. Its from episode 31 till 44 and in my opinion one of the best arcs.

Alabasta and the CP9 arc are by far my favorites.

I liked thriller bark the best but those are definitely up there as well!

Ohhhh my gosh, Thriller Bark almost made me quit One Piece.

Yeah a lot of people tell me they didn't like thriller bark all that much. Do you mind letting me know what you didn't like about it?
>> ARTICLE
Well it was dreary and the enemy was annoying.  It took for ever to get to the "boss" fight, and the sense of dark humor(?) is not something that I think One Piece should have really tried. It also didn't really fit the setting of the show at all and I had to trudge through it.  I love Brook though, so at least there's that.

Sabaody Archipelago and Whitebeard War are my favorites!

Its not about being a good or a bad show, its about the viewers preferences. If One Piece is what he likes, let him enjoy it. =)

I am not preventing him, it was not supposed to be "stop liking what I don't like." Maybe he just wants to get into anime and grabbed the first thing he knows is famous. Maybe we can give a recommendation he might like.

I have been watching anime since I was 8, I'm 25 now. I just got back from my 8th Anime Boston.  And almost every year I feel like I see so much cosplay for this anime.  So its peaked my interest for a while now, and I know 4Kids fucked it up and have been hearing that Funimation has done some justice to it.  Normally I would just watch subbed, but I'm lazy right now and don't want to read.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, OK. I am also angry at dubbing if it devaluates the original work.

Though the downvotes of my comments are like if I insulted you and wished death to your dog. /r/anime can be pretty strict.

Also, a little correction: interest is piqued, something culminating peaks. :-)

''People'' who like dubs always cry when they get downvoted for praising their dub and call the downvoters ''sub fanboys'' and other shit. But as soon as someone says something bad about their dub, they dowvote the other person to hell... stay classy lazy dub watcher. 

I begin to hate people who watch dubs.
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth; I watch a whole bunch of anime and while One Piece isn't amazing, I really enjoy it just because the characters are so much fun. 

Very little happens per episode, because it's one of those that wants to go on forever, but to counter that, I just stop watching for a year or two, then catch up in a massive spree, skipping intros, outros, recaps and fillers :) 

Luffy is probably one of my favourite fictional characters. 
>> ARTICLE
This is gonna sound probably in bad taste but by the time one piece ends a lot of the voice actors won't be alive. 
>> ARTICLE
I admit that it's taking it's sweet time, but at least we have a clear story progression with a set destination we are slowly working towards. I'd say we are at least in the final quarter.

I hope.
>> ARTICLE
Each 20 minute episode has 5 minutes of recap at the start, and each arc has huge amounts of filler for the secondary characters they introduce and are never seen again.  

The main story is not bad, but Christ, it takes ages for it progress at all.
>> ARTICLE
But looking back at the earlier episodes by comparison there is a lot less filler right now. There was that one bit with the guy who controlled animals, but that was only three episodes. Even that two year jump was a big chance for filler, and they just skipped it. I think it's gotten a lot better at moving the story along.
>> ARTICLE
(why are you not reading the manga)
>> ARTICLE
When the Marine HQ war, Oda said he hit the half point of the story. 


Or something like that, I remember calculating 10 more years, minimum...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but I am wondering in what terms he is using to mean half way. I mean, he could mean they were half way across the grand line, which is true. But I feel like as far as actual adventures go they are well past a lot of the stuff that filled the earlier episodes. They are on the level where it won't be uncommon to be fighting a warlord or even an emperor every arc. 

So what I mean to say is that I think the next 'half' will move much more quickly. In other words I doubt there will be another 600 episodes, but more closer to maybe two or three hundred to represent the entire half. Which is what I meant to say.

We were in the Grand Line from episodes 61-522. That's 461 episode to approximately match on the other side.

Also, I'm being generous and counted Fishman Island as part of the New World.
>> ARTICLE
I always assumed that although it's being called the second half that it will move a lot faster than the first half.
>> ARTICLE
but we also have to tie up each member's dreams:

Luffy giving the hat back, Zoro beating Dracule, Usopp growing a pair, Nami making a world map, Chopper curing every disease, Robin finding the the history of the Void Century, Franky having his ship conquer the New World, and Brook going all the way back to Reverse Mountain. 

On top of that Luffy wants to dethrone all 4 of the Emperors. 
>> ARTICLE
And Usopp has to still visit Elbaf.
>> ARTICLE
I figure that when they reach One Piece it means Luffy has defeated the emperors, given the hat back (though I keep feeling that Shanks will die before that happens), and that Robin will discover the history at the end like Rayleigh hinted at, and naturally by reaching it Thousand Sunny will have conquered the world, Usopp will have proven his manhood by reaching it, and Nami will finally finish her map being in the only place left completely uncharted.

I mean the entire point of them being on the ship originally was that their dreams coincide at least a little bit with Luffy's plans.

And I wouldn't be surprised if One Piece was located in All Blue on an island where a plant that cured all disease lived, but that's just a guess.

Also I keep feeling that maybe Zoro already defeated Dracule...I only watch the anime, so don't give me any manga spoilers, but I don't remember them showing how he parted ways with Dracule. At the very least I also figure they have to defeat the warlords before even getting to the emperors, so obviously hell have to defeat Dracule. 

Done in a proper way it could all be wrapped up pretty quickly, not that I want to rush it.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's likely that Zoro has defeated the monkey king copying Mihawk, though that doesn't mean the monkey was on the same level as Mihawk himself. Also pretty sure Zoro had gained the fame as the strongest had he beat him. Can't wait for the showdown as Mihawk has been one of my favorite characters ever since Baratie :D
>> ARTICLE
I just think it's very odd that they never revealed what happens with Zoro on the island. With the exception of Robin we have a very good idea what everyone else was doing. While I don't think it is as likely that Zoro defeated Mihawk the last season has been a lot more about sudden surprises, so I am starting to feel like it would be in their style to just suddenly say that Zoro actually won somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Extremely doubt that zoro already defeated the greatest swordsman in the world. Especially since its only half way into the story. Also don't you think the WG would have known? It would be plastered all over the grand line
>> ARTICLE
Because the WG is always so forthcoming?
>> ARTICLE
Got a point there, but it still wouldn't make sense for one of the straw hat's dreams to come true only half way through the story. Don't take it personally dude, its just my opinion
>> ARTICLE
I actually had that same thought about Zoro too. What if he's already the strongest? I am a manga reader but nothing has really pertained to what happened there. I believe personally someone will take down Mihawk, probably a Blackbeard crew member, and Zoro will have to defeat them
>> ARTICLE
Nah, we're like a little over half way.
>> ARTICLE
We're in the New World, unless there's the New Ultra World and the New Ultra Platinum World I am at least hoping we are in the final quarter. That would still give us what over 150 episodes to finish the series?

.......actually you're right, there's no way they will wrap it up in just 150 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Oda said that the new world marked the second half of the series

Already discussed, please pay attention.

okay, chill out

I just think that they'll spend way too long on the New Ultra Platinum Ring Long Land arc

isn't entering the new world the literal halfway point?  at the least i don't think it's the last quarter.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, Oda said so himself. So we're just a bit after halfway
>> ARTICLE
i just mean, disregarding anything oda says, the new world starts at the halfway point of the grand line - i'm not sure how someone interprets that to be "final quarter" considering they intend to sail the whole way around.

Maybe if they skipped all the islands and just sailed straight for the end. But yeah it doesn't really make any sense

You're absolutely right.  One Piece will probably be airing for another 10+ years.

Franky's VA is 54, Sanji's is 50, Nami's is 45, Usopp's is 48, Brook's is 56, Luffy's is 59, Robin's is 48, Zoro's is 46, and Chopper's is 48.

The odds are not in our favor.

So, basically Luffy will go mute by the end of the series. Shit.

Thankfully One Piece is, and has always been progressing at a reasonable pace (not to sound selfish of course). What's really frightening is Berserk. It's one the best manga out there and has been on hiatus for way too long. The author is only in his late 40s, but it's kinda scary to think about a series completely stopping with no ending.

New chapter came out a week or two ago.

Huh, thanks for the heads up.

Yes, it's official, after 2 years, the next issue of Jump,will have a new chapter of HxH. And this Monday, in theory, they posted some kind of advance in the Japaneses Shonen Jump site.

It is returning in June, but Togashi isn't exactly known for his [ability to release chapters every week](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130824144559/hunterxhunter/images/c/c7/Hiatus_Chart.png)
>> ARTICLE
Damn! Also head that the anime will carry on where the manga left off and will follow Togashi's ideas instead of drawing future HxH. Another manga that I have missed that has been on hiatus is D.Grayman, does anyone have any news on that?
>> ARTICLE
No news on that but I believe there was a new chapter of Berserk recently. 

HxH anime will probably go on hiatus for a bit to give the manga room.

A least he's having fun with his idols.

idolm@ster one for all is coming out in two weeks and it's after golden week, so it's probably not coming back from hiatus, until at least a year from now.

there is going to be a new chapter late May, it said so at the end of the last one.

Why? He's only 39.

He also gets only a few hours of sleep every night and smokes. He was hospitalized last year too since he was ignoring his health to work on One Piece.

Well I'm willing to bet that this caused the current circulation of three chapters a month instead of four.

Sad. I love his work.

Lately though, Shounen is making him take breaks. As a result of what you mentioned, probably.

Ah, then I can see why people are worried about him. I just hope that out of Game of Thrones and One Piece, I get to see the ending of one.

They have been taking more breaks with One Piece though. So we can only hope he's taking some time out to chill

Weird I just started watching the show and finished the restaurant arch. 
Crunchy roll went down while I was getting to the end, it almost feels like one of those "bad omen" moments in anime. Like when a character dies, and at the same time picture of them falls.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, you're only past the Baratie? I envy you so much. So many amazing things ahead of you friend!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even seen the show yet. Heard good things though, I'll check it out in a few hours.
>> ARTICLE
As I stated to another user:

- The beginning is slow, takes a bit to pick up. As much as I hate to say it just sit tight through the first few arcs. I fell in love during the Baratie arc about 25 episodes in or so. 

- Skip filler. EXCEPT FOR THE G8 ARC BECAUSE G8 ARC IS GREATNESS.

- Get ready for tears.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really watch anime, I've only really seen Dragon Ball Z. What is filler? 
>> ARTICLE
I'll explain!

The creator of One Piece obviously started making the series as a manga in 1997. The anime began it's run in 1998. That leaves not so much room between the release of the chapter and the release of the episode that adapts it.

That being said, studios will add additional content that wasn't in the manga to the anime to make a wider gap between the 2. In One Piece's case it has the characters arrive to a different island and embark on a task for 3-4 episodes usually. Then they continue on where the manga would have had them just going straight from island to island.

One Piece has filler episodes, but not a TON of them. Good thing for you is that they're easily skippable and don't have any impact on the main story. They're also usually not top quality, with the exception of 1. 

Here is a guide of the episodes you should skip if you want to have a faster adventure through One Piece http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=453655 it's how I watched and it definitely doesn't ruin the experience.

Think of it as skipping the Driver's License episode of DBZ so you could see episode 1 of the Android Saga next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, i get it now. They're pretty much just giant bottle episodes. I think I'll soldier through them though, I want to get the full experience. Thank you 


>> ARTICLE
No problem. It makes me happy seeing more people get into the series. 

One last note, you might think it comes off as a kids show at first. Just keep going... it's far from that.
>> ARTICLE
I got you, I'm gonna take your word for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm just away to Little Garden for the first time, been putting off starting One Piece for around 5 years, now I have loads of catching up to do!
>> ARTICLE
You have NO IDEA what you're in for man. You haven't even seen the good stuff yet. 
>> ARTICLE
I am 4-5 episodes before reaching Fisherman's Island(after time-skip). I am too afraid to proceed. 
>> ARTICLE
Fishman Island is... slow. Don't be prepared for an incredible arc. However Punk Hazard gets a little better and then you get Dressrosa which is my favorite arc of the entire series so far. It still isn't over. Hope you enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I got burned by the 4kids dub being the first thing of it I saw so I never really had interest getting into it.

I've caught episodes here and there on the new toonami but never bothered to actually watch all of it.
>> ARTICLE
I was also a product of the 4kids dub. I was younger so it didn't really occur to me at the time. 

I always kinda looked over it in looking for series when I met a guy (my best friend now) who told me he had been watching for years now. Said he recommended it to me.

So I started out with the first few episodes, having very little knowledge of it, etc etc. I got through the first few arcs and enjoyed it despite it being a little slow.

Then I hit the Arlong Park Arc and realized that this was more than a kids show. It hits some rough water (heh) and things get a little violent. From that point on ([literally this moment with the track Overtaken playing (spoilers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxmuF6mbpck)) I had laughed, cried, and smiled like an idiot all because of this and I decided to stick with it.

Best adventure EVER. I can't even say the length matters to me. If the show sucks you in, you'll want it to be double the length it already is. It's that good.

I don't really think I can change opinions because most people seem to have an incredible resistance to trying One Piece, but maybe my post could do that. I don't know. I just want others to experience all the excitement/tears/laughter that I got to. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I had another friend show me the differences.

I might like just read it since that will be faster. I just don't know if I can sit through that many hours of an anime to catch up now.

I've done it with Naruto but that's because I watched it weekly from the start so it wasn't all in bulk.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is really good, most agree it's better than Toei's (lacking) anime adaptation. I didn't really realize the "problems" that people claim the anime has until I finished catching up.

I'd personally suggest the anime still. Just remember a few things:

1. It has a SLOW start. It does. The first few arcs are setup time getting the crew together. It's kinda tedious at times but you just have to know that it gets exponentially better over time. The Arlong Park Arc is where most say that it reaches a good point.

2. Skip filler. Seems pretty obvious for anyone watching a series like this. One Piece has some filler yeah but it's just a fact of the matter with the anime. There are several guides to skipping it online, google is your friend.

3. Get ready to cry.
>> ARTICLE
I know when I first watched the dub I actually stuck with it for a decent amount of time.

It was before (Robin? The black haired girl) but after the Reindeer guy that I can't remember the name of because it's been years.
>> ARTICLE
You were probably in or after the Alabasta Arc. That's about 100 episodes in or so. The first "big" arc to happen in the series.

Funny you mention that, I actually stopped watching the old dub around that same point as a kid. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, binging like crazy at the moment! Looking forward to just getting up to date, it's a lot funnier than I ever imagined :)
>> ARTICLE
It is, isn't it? There are specific episodes that had me absolutely keeled over, sides exploded in laughter. It comes as a surprise to some. The comedy really is top notch. 
>> ARTICLE
Like the "mushroom" in the Amazon Lily arc. Funniest episode in the whole series, manga too. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to say my favorite is the Duval reveal... I... never even imagined...

But there's too many to pick from:

- Sogeking Reveal

- Thriller Bark episode where Luffy pushes zombie back into his grave

- Usopp vs Perona

- Luffy's impressions of the Crew

- Usopp vs. Mrs. Merry Christmas ("FIVE TONS???")

- [Dressrosa Manga Spoilers](/s "GOD USOPP/Usopp freeing the Toys. Funniest fucking thing.")
>> ARTICLE
The face faults in Dressrosa are.... impressive to say the least. 

But OP is probably one of the most consistently funny animes, while still having good action despite the somewhat poor animation quality. Did I mention the well-done and consistent plot development and world building, with a story that rarely looses steam and is able to put a tear in your eye.

Yeah, the manga and anime are just so worth it, and I'm no where near a big anime fan.

Damn, there goes a defining part of my childhood. The first manga I ever read was One Piece, when I was around 9 and the series was relatively new (In the middle of chef arc). I was in the process of moving to a new town and had to leave the safe comforting world I knew so well. Very scary and stressful and whatnot. Anyways, I got to the part about chef and what he did to help Sanji when they were stranded. It was striking to see something so... heroic and it gave me courage. I remembered that a lot over the next couple years. R.I.P.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. My brother and I started watching One Piece a few days ago and we watched some of the episodes Chef Zaff appears in (up to E.21) just yesterday. What a strange coincidence.
>> ARTICLE
I think his role as Dr. Gero was more prominent, no?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. No sane person would watch One Piece.

Even if armed with hundreds of weapons there are times when you just cant beat a man with a spear of conviction in his gut.  :(

Which is why you shouldn't force yourself to finish it in one go and instead... take it one piece at a time.
>> ARTICLE
We have a winner.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in pretty much the same boat as OP, though perhaps not as far as even 140. What I've been doing is watching an episode here and there between more focussed animes and other activities, and it's been working out fairly well. 

I tried doing the mini-marathon method with Naruto + Shippuden a while back, and while it is fine during the really action-heavy arcs, during the less-interesting ones you start to begin hating the show in parts, which can sour the whole experience.
>> ARTICLE
Ahahaha...I see what you did there.

Yeah, but I have been. I started watching about a year and a half ago.
>> ARTICLE
Take it in arcs. you can break it up into mini 40 episode journey's as you go. But One piece just hit the half way mark.  So catching up isn't really important, just enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
It may not be your medium, but if you want to catch up reading the manga would probably be the most efficient way to do that. If you want to watch the filler too, find out where it is in the story and take breaks when you reach that point in the manga. Watching the entire anime would take almost 200 hours or so. Reading the manga would probably take less than half of that depending on how quickly you read. Otherwise, take it in chunks. You'll catch up eventually.
>> ARTICLE
I too stopped watching the Anime and read the Manga instead. I did this for Bleach as well. It is so much easier to stay caught up when you read 5 min before bed once a week as opposed to watching a 20 min episode trying to stay awake.
>> ARTICLE
I say "I'll read for 5 mins then sleep", 3 hours pass and realized I still didnt go to sleep yet.
>> ARTICLE
I marathon-ed it in about 2 weeks and a half up to episodes 515 at the time. I regret nothing.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga instead, took a week or 2.
>> ARTICLE
Try catching up to Gintama. It'd be like trying to swallow an albeit very tasty whale. But by the time you finish, you'd realize that the world has already ended.

Twice.
>> ARTICLE
Quick question, are there fillers for Gintama like how I hear there is for One Piece? 
>> ARTICLE
I did that in 2 weeks!

Well, that was pretty much all I did... In 2 weeks...
>> ARTICLE
It's just that One Piece is two times as big as that Gintama whale :3
>> ARTICLE
I was lucky and found the series when it first came to America (it was relatively short then.)

I recommend reading up on the arcs of each saga leading up to the final one. From there watch the final arcs in Anime form, it goes much quicker and you get the same general feel.

Do this so that if you are ever curious about what came before you can catch up on those while you wait for each new episode.
>> ARTICLE
One piece's romance of adventures makes it so compelling to watch. When I started I'm sure it took me a few months and my summer  break to catch up, but it was totally worth spending hours a day to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I swallowed that whale.  But seriously, I had a lot of free time over break and just spammed as many episodes as I could in a day.  Absolutely worth watching though, incredible series.  

Oh I did skip some filler arcs though.
>> ARTICLE
It's perfect for the ~3 month break between years at uni.  Took a lot of time to get through it all, even when watching at quite a fair pace.  Also, if you get part-way through an arc (or section) you dislike, you can look up when it ends so you can skip it (Davey Back arc was terrible).
>> ARTICLE
Listen man, wait till summer, quit your job and dedicate every waking moment to watching one piece. It is possible. It is.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest i read the manga on my phone when i didn't have power for a week, and got up to around chapter 600(which is somewhere around episode 530), so when i got power again i picked up from where i left off in the manga, which went much faster because it doesn't have some of the extra arcs that aren't completely relevant to the story.
>> ARTICLE
I devoted last summer to catching up on what I thought was a big hole in my anime resume- the Big Three of Shonen- One Piece, Bleach and Naruto. Never got to Naruto, but I inhaled the other two by Xmas. 

You owe it to yourself to keep going from beginning to end. Every episode. The show's not going anywhere, and as long as you watch more than one episode a week, you're still technically "catching up."
Maybe, if you have a regular schedule, you could watch an episode and another from one of your other shows per day? That's the method I use to get through other long shows like Maison Ikkoku and Ranma.
>> ARTICLE
Find a filler-list of Naruto and skip those episodes. One Piece have some fairly enjoyable fillers but Naruto and Bleach do not.
>> ARTICLE
I will admit to skipping a chunk of Bleach after having to watch something involving..Soccer?
>> ARTICLE
I think the Bount Arc was terrible. The Kendo, Soccer, and the Kurakura Town Ranger episodes are the best filler, possibly the best filler of all anime.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I remember groaning about that one too. One of the worst fillers I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to disagree; that was probably one of the best filler episodes I've ever seen!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure about you, but once I got about 80 episodes in the rest flew by. I'd say skip the fillers since they aren't important.
>> ARTICLE
If you're not marathoning it you won't catch up, simple as that. If you really want to get up to speed you'll have to take up a couple weeks(spread them out) of ONLY watching the show.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly dont worry about it. You get so hooked that you will run out fast and theres probably going to be a few more years of it, and its hard to watch that show week by week.
>> ARTICLE
I sat down and decided to start it, then it changed my life. I watched all 579 in a month and a half. I regret nothing.

Don't rush it man, you'll get there. And when you do get there, you'll regret getting there so fast.

I think during summer vacation I re watched the original naruto (220 episodes) and got to episode 380 in one piece. Summer vacation was 3 months long so I was probably watching around 6 or 7 episodes a day. Bad affects of this is that you will literally waste away your entire 3 months watching anime and also gain a shit ton of weight. Hope I helped
>> ARTICLE
i started from episode one about mid summer and got all caught up. there were days where all i did was watch like 30 episodes of one piece though, i assume you don't want to do that..
>> ARTICLE
At first, I caught up to where you are, then I stopped watching it for a about a year, then I picked it up again and got super hooked. Watching about 10 episodes a day. I believe it is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Sometime in senior year of college I watched 1-400+. I was working a graveyard shift warehouse job, living with my parents, going to school full time. I didn't have any spare energy for a lot of socializing or even really gaming, so I'd come home from work/school and just sit down and watch the show with all of my free time.
>> ARTICLE
Was it worth it?
>> ARTICLE
I think so. I didnt have the energy to do much else, I kept up with my classwork, and it was a good way to relax and involve myself in a story for a while. I haven't kept up with the show since, but I enjoyed it's world while I was into it.
>> ARTICLE
I moved to a new house in the last 2 weeks of summer, only had computer for entertainment, no internet for a week and a half. Had a screenshot from a list of the episode arcs, so I could skip the filler. Marathoned it like a champ and caught up from 1 to 545 or so in those 2 weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Fast Forward and subs are your friends.
>> ARTICLE
I watched a little bit of One Piece when I was in middle school. I'm a graduate from high school now. I decided about 5 months ago that I was going to watch every episode from episode 1 until I was caught up. I managed to do it. I believe it took me 2-3 months. I love it. I think it's worth it. (:

Skipping the filler helped me.

I'm catching up to Naruto, from episode 1 to whatever episode Shippuden is on right now. I'm around episode 100 of Shippuden, and I'm taking a break.
>> ARTICLE
When I started watching One Piece it was around the 370 episode mark, so I ended up marathoning it in about a month. I know people who have still done that, but in your case I'd suggest take it one arc at a time. Without looking too deeply, you can use [this page](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Arcs) to figure out where you are, and around how many episodes are in each arc so you know where to stop if you want to. I believe anything with an asterisk is filler so, you can make a choice on whether or not you want to skip that.
>> ARTICLE
well, if i was you i wouldn't do that, show just lose his 'thing' after cp9, then got again on ace's execution then back to annoying not funny scenes and weak fights.

I think I skipped all the filler arcs. They were so pointless and boring.
I just couldn't stopped watching it and marathoned it in about 2 weeks.

"I watched K-On and all adaptations."From a 20yo single dude.
>> ARTICLE
GochiUsa's source material is considered seinen - targeted towards teenager/adult males. However, it doesn't surprise me the cutesy nature of the show also appeals to younger girls. K-On, another seinen manga adaptation, became pretty popular with girls as well.
>> ARTICLE
So it's like MLP?
>> ARTICLE
You guys down vote this guy but I totally see an overlap between people who liked my little pony and people who like slice of life anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I almost wrote a long post explaining why the situations are different, but I guess that you could say the appeal of GochiUsa to younger female viewers is *sorta* like the inverse of the appeal of MLP to older male (and female) viewers.  Neither show is targeting those secondary audiences, but there are aspects of the shows that appeal to them nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
You shut your whore mouth. Don't you ever compare Gochiusa to that thing.

Edit: In all seriousness, mlp was specifically intended to cater toward little girls. That's not the case for either Gochiusa or K-On. So, no. It's not like mlp, dipshit.

Although, it's kind of widely accepted that K-On is a little "female-friendly" than others. Which is why it doesn't really get compared much with shows like Gochiusa, YRYR, Kinmosa or NNB, which is safe to say more compatible with a male audience.

I don't think I'd have a problem if my daughter wanted to watch K-On, but there's no way in hell I'm letting her watch Gochiusa until she reaches a more mature age to watch it herself. Gochiusa isn't exactly kid-friendly to begin with.

Yeah, I'm a veteran when it comes to this shit.
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing something about gochiusa? I watched like the first couple of episodes but it just didn't cut the mustard compared to all the other slice of life that I've watched. (Kinmoza, k-on, yuru yuri, lucky star, etc...)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I thought it was great. Despite being the most recent, it was still capable of making a name for itself. Now, it's standing alongside the other popular moe slice of life shows in the genre.

Also to note, thanks to its high production value in the second season, it undoubtedly outperformed the first by a mile.

If you were watching S1, try watching a few more episodes or see S2 for a preview. If it still doesn't suit you, then maybe you're better off with something else.
>> ARTICLE
I might watch the first one for the second, in that case. I definitely noticed a lot more people getting into the second season as well.

Thanks for your input.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a good idea. I liked the first season, but didn't feel like it had as much charm as other moe shows (e.g. K-On, Kinmoza, Non Non Biyori) when I first watched it, and it didn't match up to the humor of some of the other shows you mentioned (YRYR, Lucky Star). 

Gochiusa S2, however, is my personal favorite season of moe. It fleshes out character dynamics and is vastly funnier than the first season. Of my three favorite moe shows in recent times (Gochiusa, Kinmoza, and NNB), I would my personal preference would be Gochiusa S2 > Kinmoza S2 > NNB S2 > NNB S1 > Kinmoza S1 > Gochiusa S1. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much for your opinion on things. Kinmoza s1 was a little better than s2 I thought, but they were both pretty fun. I also haven't gotten to non non biyori s2 yet. Why do you like it more than the first? 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched it, but I can say that it has been the most successful (in sales numbers) of those sorts of shows since K-On.
>> ARTICLE
> In all seriousness, mlp was specifically intended to cater toward little girls. 

Right, because the references to things like The Big Lebowski and Bob Ross are *totally* for the little girls watching.

Edit: to address that point specifically, the creator of the show has stated multiple times that it's intended to be an all-ages show. Just because it's meant to be accessible to children doesn't mean it's catered toward them exclusively.
>> ARTICLE
I want to say right off the bat that I have absolutely nothing against either MLP or its adult fans.  I actually watched the first season on the recommendation of a friend--thought it was okay, but it didn't hook me and I just dropped it afterwards.  Thought the community was very warm, though, which was nice, and there's tons of creative work done by the fans.


I want to *also* say that I'm a big fan of K-Pop (Korean pop music), and have been for a few years now.  Bought tons of albums, going to a concert in a few weeks, the whole nine yards.  While I genuinely love K-Pop--the music, the visual spectacle, the people themselves--I am also all-too-aware that most K-Pop is aimed at tweens and teens, just like the boy bands of yesteryear.  I know this, and I'm 100% okay with it.


There's a lot of reasons people react negatively to the MLP community.  One is that people focus on an unfortunate minority of extreme cases--the (**NSFW**) /r/cummingonfigurines (**NSFW**) of the MLP world.  That's unfair.  Another aspect of it is that it is perceived as "sissy" and so people poke fun at the men in particular.  I find that to be a pretty archaic viewpoint.  However, one unfortunate trend I see that I think deserves fair criticism is the insistence that MLP is actually *aimed* at adults.  


As others have said, the presence of things appealing to adults does not really mean anything.  Specific references for adults serve two functions: making watching shows with children more bearable for parents and guardians, and making working on these shows less painful for the adult creative staff.  In the end, however, MLP is a show created by a toy company to sell toys to little girls.  There's nothing wrong with that--many of the beloved cartoons of the 80s (e.g. He-Man, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) were also vehicles for selling toys to young boys.  That intent doesn't have to affect on one's enjoyment of the media.  That being said, accepting the crass commercial purpose of the show and clear demographic targets can only help the MLP community in being more accepted.  There will always be ridicule, but I think being able to accept that it really is a show made for girls and poke fun at yourself could go a long way in avoiding conflict, both internal and external.

You also mentioned the creator, Lauren Faust.  While I'm sure she set out to create the best show she could, she's also well aware of her employer's aims in creating this sort of commercial vehicle.  You have to realize that she is *never* going to say something to intentionally alienate adult fans.  While they're not the target audience, they're still a sizable minority with money to spend, so of *course* she will say it's aimed at all-ages.  But MLP is not an all-ages show that is "accessible to children."  It is a show *made* for children that adults may also find enjoyable.  *And that's okay*.
>> ARTICLE

Seriously, I love a ton of seinen stuff like K-ON and Haruhi, because there's enough cutesy for me to be happy with it, but it's also kind of targeted towards my boyfriend. it's a perfect genre if you're trying to find something to satisfy the both of you.

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
What do you think they have done? Just curious, can you without googling, explain to me what a Republican believes?
>> ARTICLE
What an Republican believes (according to someone who has read enough and watched enough to be worried): 

* Believes that all Americans have an equality of opportunity (as opposed to equality of outcomes) and that with enough hard work and dedication anyone can become rich, ignoring the issue of the different playing fields the rich and poor have...

*imagines the gulf of power between Naruto and Rock Lee*

* Need to cut spending in everything except Social Security and the military, 

* Need to promote social policies involving a female's womb that result in Republicans advocating effectively an overreach of government powers into the bedroom, 

*imagines the saying "Life begins at conception" Republicans like to use and contrasting it to the social spending cuts for* ***after*** *the babies are born*

* Need to advocate an aggressive foreign policy with military deployments (incidentally consisting of putting young people at the front lines), 

* Need to refuse to acknowledge that gays can now marry in the US and serve in the military,

* Need to oppose Obama, regardless of validity of concerns.

* Need to alienate other nationalities, cultures and religions that do not believe in the Christian God or Jewish Yahweh. 

So basically (except the Obama part), they are American Diet Tatsuya Shibas. 

Minus the incest, unless you are in Alabama. 
>> ARTICLE
wait what?

I think I am missing something, how is Shiba Tatsuya like that? From the light novels he came across as someone who is logical and thinks through the different possibilities of the outcomes. The complete opposite of the Republicans.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka's setting is highly conservative, the LN and anime have Miyuki go "Tatsuya Shiba worked hard for this" even though later events blows that notion out of the water.

Also, this quote:

> For people without talent, to escape the fact that they cannot compare to others, they loudly sing the praises of equality. For those without magic, to avoid the fact that magic is merely one type of talent, they coat that belief with jealousy.

> After understanding these basics, what is the purpose of the one inciting them to action behind the scenes? The equality that they are referring to is equal treatment regardless of the presence of magical ability. Abolishing the societal differences caused by magic, is the same as not assigning magic any value. The end result is that magic would lose any and all meaning in society.

> In a society where magic has no value, magic cannot advance or improve. Standing behind the Magicians and ordinary people who are calling for an end to the differences caused by magic, is a force that plans to abolish magic from this country.

Replace "magic" and "talent" with "money" and "economic ability" and you now get the Republican belief in the equality of opportunity over equality of outcomes and the extreme far-right's occasional accusations of "socialism/communism" against egalitarianism espoused by the left.

Also a reminder that [spoilers](/s "Tatsuya is literally a 0.1 Percenter, his blood flows from the political elites of the Ten Master Clans (albeit estranged), he holds majority stock in a magitech company, he is almost literally unkillable and an extremely valued military asset and also literally incapable of caring strongly about anything except his sister.") 

[Also,](/s "the environmental damage on China's coastline.")

He hardly resembles a Democrat.

Sometimes I look at LNs and see stuff the Republicans would love. Not all bad, but they do stick out like a sore thumb.

EDIT: Added some additional points.
>> ARTICLE
And from your response I can see you get your entire political opinion from reddit. 

Republicans are not perfect, but besides a few niche differences Democrats and Republicans are the same. Both want less spending on social programs, both want a bigger government (though Republicans will argue they don't). I have NEVER met a Republican in my state that has yelled "Bout dat der obama." Which you think seems to be so prevalent. 

Not to mention there isn't any true Republican that will tell you that any other Race, Religion, or Nationality is wrong/bad/evil. Extremists are evil, but Republicans believe in the Constitution whole heartedly, its the second bible, Freedom of Religion, its a core belief of any red blooded Republican. 

I haven't heard anyone deny that the gays can be married, I have had many people go to gay weddings, and I myself have officiated multiple gay weddings, just because a vocal minority gets the whole world in a tizzy doesn't mean the entire side is bad.

Being right wing means you take a more conservative view of government spending, which some people people believes =Conservative values, which they don't they are very different. Spending absurd amounts of money to the DEA or the TSA and other organizations that don't do anything? Thats on the Republican hitlist, things that don't do good and are worthless but we spend money for are at the core, beliefs for true Republicans.

I'm not even republican, but don't go misrepresenting an entire Ideology because you get all your opinions from the "COMPLETELY UNBIASED REDDIT".
>> ARTICLE
> there isn't any true Republican 

I dunno about the "true Republicans", since that is a nebulous concept (see: "no true Scotsman"), but Trump talking about immigration definitely fits into the alienation of minorities.

> Both want less spending on social programs, both want a bigger government (though Republicans will argue they don't).

It's the *allocation* of government spending, rather than the absolute amount, that is the issue. For Democrats, they want relatively more spending on education, healthcare and welfare, as opposed to military expenditure and national security being the priority for the Republicans.

> Republicans believe in the Constitution whole heartedly, its the second bible, Freedom of Religion, its a core belief of any red blooded Republican. 

You say that, but they are also the ones promoting the mingling of (a mostly Christian) church and state. And then when non-Christian churches slip through they U-turn so hard it makes people spin. Example: [Valarie Hodges' views on state funding for religious schools reversed when she "found out" it included Muslim schools.](http://www.livingstonparishnews.com/news/article_6c2da5fe-c1e5-11e1-ae3b-0019bb2963f4.html)

I don't mean to say the Republicans are all bad or that the Democrats are all good. Heck, I find issue with some of the Democrats' increasingly militant approach to shutting down public debates with so-called safe spaces and [I most certainly do not approve of them doxxing people who oppose their actions.](http://www.fox9.com/news/61996080-story "Like seriously, what the hell?")

It's just that the assholes (regardless of political affiliation) are easier to see, and the Republicans have been louder until recently.

If you don't think that "They are all bad" then don't post such a broad term like "American Republicans". There are of course Republicans that buy into the shit that they watch. But the majority don't thats the thing. There is an OVERWHELMING amount of noise from ISIS, so much so that an uneducated person might say that ISIS is muslim, and they haven't heard from any other muslims, so Muslims=ISIS, which don't get me wrong some Republicans do believe that, but also so do some Democrats. 

Not to mention that Trumps views on immigration, while skewed and many possibly rasict, are not bad. Immigration is a real issue, You should not be able to live in america, without paying taxes and get a free pass. Life doesn't work that way, it sucks, but we have immigration laws for a reason.

Sadly my wife's entire family is in the crazy hardcore catholic conservative boat so they do exist in the wild.  

My own brother is in the whole "all refugees are ISIS" and "Obama is a muslim" grouping, but at least he accepts our gay brother.

On the other hand though, my aunt is completely on the other side of the spectrum being a full blown "pinko commie".

Seriously though, Democrats and Republicans are too broad a term and people jump on the bandwagon because of 1 or 2 main party stances. Some people just call themselves a republican because they want gun rights or call themselves democrat because they support the environment.

Most Catholics are actually less conservative than other southern Christians, but there are definitely exceptions.

> It was a show I didn't even know existed,

Kantai Collection is *huge.* The popularity predates the anime - KanColle is a browser game that became very popular and started attracting a large fan community that further increases its popularity by putting out tons of fan works. It's not on the same level as Touhou, but [KanColle has really dominated Comiket as of late.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-06-13/kantai-collection-comiket-circles-edge-ahead-of-touhou-project-again/.89189)

However, most KanColle material is targeted towards more hardcore and probably older fans, so I guess it isn't something one would expect to see be so popular in a middle school.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't get why it is so popular, I didn't understand anything of the game and the anime was too plotless.
>> ARTICLE
The anime tried doing two different things (SoL and a dark, military theme) in the same capacity and therefore never had a real focus. That obviously hurt it quite a bit, especially among the newer viewers and a number of the game's faithful.

I personally can't say too much about the game (I'm a fan of the premise and the historical aspect, not really the game or anime themselves), but the gameplay looks a lot like a more complicated version of Pokemon to me. You just kinda do some black magic to set up the characters and then you go make them fight while you sit back and watch.

It might be popular for the historical aspect or just because you get to see animu girls getting their clothes ripped up in a...less judgmental way (they were *fighting* the boss, okay?), but for whatever reasons, it's pretty damn popular...

^(I guess I'm just saying I dunno why it's popular either. But there's history in it, so fuck it, I'll at least get my feet wet.)
>> ARTICLE
It's popular because it has a large amount of characters with a variety of character designs, easily memorable personalities that play off of one another (which makes it good basis for fan works), and good voice acting (a lot of similar games skimp on the voicing). The game also doesn't charge you too much, unlike a lot of similar Japanese games. It's really a case of popularity feeding popularity - people are drawn in by the large amount of fanart, doujinshi, and spin-offs (most of which aren't translated, so I can't comment on their quality), and that in turn creates greater demand for such things. It is kinda similar to [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) in that regard, though more commercial in nature (though it's not like KanColle doujin writers are getting rich off of doujinshi). Tons of KanColle and Touhou fans don't actually play the original games (especially in regards to Touhou, since those games can be quite difficult).

I think that KanColle and Touhou are popular because they provide a sort of "canon" for people to work with. If you want to create your own story, you have to create your own characters with distinct personalities, histories, relationships, et cetera. If you are creating a fan work based on KanColle or Touhou, that's basically already done for you. The games provide enough dialogue to give the characters personalities - calm, brash, tsundere, energetic, introverted, et cetera - and set up relationships, but the lack of any sort of really strong plot (especially in KanColle - the game has no plot and the spin-offs all differ) means that fans have the freedom to basically do whatever they want with those characters. In turn, the people reading fan works have a much easier time - I can get some Kaga x Akagi joke in a random KanColle doujinshi because I already know who Kaga and Akagi are from the game and other works.

The result is that the fandom is very community-like, rather than based on the game itself (as for the anime... the anime really wasn't that well received by a lot of fans). Think lots of in-jokes and whatnot. One has to remember that fan-made works are really important in the Japanese "otaku" community, and corporations Kadokawa and DMM (the ones behind KanColle) will turn a blind eye towards or even encourage what is essentially copyright violations due to the fact that those violations increase the popularity of franchises. Whilst "fanart" can seem like a negative term, there's often no gap in drawing quality between professional and fan-made doujinshi.
>> ARTICLE
Also, KanColle's character personalities are directly based off of the history and actions of the specific ship they represent. This adds an extra level of humor and depth if you are familiar with Japanese naval history. 
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the things that made Touhou as popular as it is now is also because of the extremly catchy soundtrack over the course of 10+ games and that it was all done by a single person. There are more arrangements of the songs out there than I'm willing to count, and that aspect is just adding to the cute girls doing cute things (read: slaughtering each other) aspect. The franchise covers a lot of different preferences for everyone which I think is great.



All of that even without an Anime adaption which is usually the threshold of gaining mainstream popularity. It's a fascinating phenomenon and I love it. Games are too hard to finish on anything except easy, although japanese seem to love "mastering" a game, completing it to 100% and getting to know every nook and cranny while I'm just casual scum.

And this is why Toei can get away with such shitty production quality. Ever since the Marineford arc, OP has become too big to fail; Toei dropped production cost significantly since then  (minus the TV specials and theatrical films) and gets away with it because people would watch it even if they hired ONE to do the entire animation. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the OP manga, but the anime is complete shit at times.

And it also depends on which geographical region, OP didn't state. Kanto? Kansai? Tohoku? Hokkaido? Okinawa? Kyushu?

Edit: Let's just go the whole hog.
>> ARTICLE
>  Hokkaido?

I see you're a brave man.
>> ARTICLE
Why? I don't understand the joke.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it either but my guess is either:

1. Because it's motherfucking cold there. So unless you really love snow and skiing, it's rough.
2. Teaching there as an ALT sorta sucks. From what I've heard, the Boards of Education don't give great support to the ALTs. Also, since Hokkaido generally ranks near the very bottom of the achievement test scores (by prefecture), teaching them is a much harder task. Especially as a foreigner with no real power over the students.
>> ARTICLE
ALT = Alien Languages Teacher? Aberrant Languages Teacher? Americans Looking to Travel? Help me out here...
>> ARTICLE
Assistant Language Teacher.
You essentially move to Japan for a year or more to teach mostly English to Japanese students. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Language_Teacher
>> ARTICLE
From what I gather, the Japanese don't exactly consider people in Hokkaido to be as Japanese as they are. It's kinda hard to explain, but for example my Japanese teacher showed us a movie about mochi and there were statistics about "different kinds of mochi you eat for New Year's celebration".

Hokkaido wasn't even taken into consideration. The map of Japan was shown with Hokkaido covered in yellow, to show that they weren't even polled and nobody went to ask them about the tradition.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's got something to do with racism between the people of Honshu, and the Ainu people who were native to that area.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have any sources but I'm pretty sure most of the settlement of Hokkaido was done by poor farmers. Hokkaido's population skyrocketted when the government sponsored people to move there to expand Japan's agricultural industry sometime around the Taisho and Meiji eras. Most people if asked what they think of when they hear of Hokkaido would probably say potatoes and butter. Being from Hokkaido is basically being from the sticks.  I've never heard of any kind of wide spread exclusionism against Hokkaido though.
>> ARTICLE
There is racism between Japanese and Ainu people but it has more to do with the fact that Hokkaido is so new to Japan. It was only made part of the country in 1869, whereas most of the other major islands have been part of 'Japan' for thousands of years. Obviously its importance is changing over time, Sapporo is now the 4th largest Japanese city and the island is quite important being on the  East Sea unlike Tokyo, Hiroshima, Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, etc.
>> ARTICLE
So they've been part of japan 2 years less than my country has existed.
>> ARTICLE
Germany?
>> ARTICLE
The vast majority of  people in Hokkaido are ethnic Japanese who moved there. The population of Ainu is actually quite small. Like, a couple percent at most.

....that boy is now a man.

Anyway, World Trigger? I guess we can never truly understand children.
>> ARTICLE
World trigger is pretty good.
it's easy to dismiss because of the slow pacing, but it'actually necessary to go slowly to allow children to follow all the characters and actions happening simultaneously and spanning multiple episodes.

My 5 years old got to understand the group strategy used to contain a large scale invasion, and that'a big deal I think.
I got used to the pace, and it's actually intersting, with decent plot and consistency and no miracle or deus ex machina.

I find it way more enjoyable than most gundams or macross for instance.
>> ARTICLE
I am watching world trigger at the moment it seems alright, I tend to watch anime in batches though so I understand how it would suck it you tried watching it week to week
>> ARTICLE
This. I'm currently on World trigger. I feel like the pacing is random. Sometimes it goes decent paced, then it'll stretch something land for 5 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger is actually a pretty good shounen, Toei happened however.
>> ARTICLE
The thing with World Trigger that a lot of people seem to miss out on is that it's unique.

And I don't mean that it's brilliantly standout, but rather it's not competing with very much. There's not a tonne of that sort of sci-fi in Shonen Jump, and sci-fi is pretty rare overall in the magazine. So even if it does averagely in the ratings, it's stable and people who like that sort of thing aren't jumping to the next cool thing.

For example: people that liked One Piece, Naruto and Bleach during their heydey at the top would often pick whatever was feeling better at the time as their favourite. People that are liking Hero Academia in SJ probably have it competing with One Piece in their favourites.

So World Trigger isn't amazing, but for people who are into that sort of thing they aren't as spoiled for choice as those into say sports, magic, boobies or adventure.
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for the anime but I actually think the World Trigger Manga is pretty good.  It definitely stands out in Jump because it turns a lot of the normal tropes on their head.  
>> ARTICLE
The current arc is shaping up to be the best one yet imo
>> ARTICLE
You would probably get more interesting results if you asked for a top 3 or so. It would reduce the "default vote" effect at least.

Haha you're probably right, but the speaking test had to cover a number of grammar points so I really only had time to ask for one response. Maybe next semester I'll sneak a top three into a writing assignment and collect those results.

oh... TIL, because I've only watched first 6 episodes of its anime.

at least it has more content than the loliland where the world doesn't believe in panties: Strike Witches.

edit: by means of more content, because it has its own game/s, LN, mangas and anime. SW doesn't have much except anime.

TIL I need to watch Strike Witches

To clarify, he meant that they don't believe in pants (at least for females), and only wear panties.  
Rest assured, though that any male characters (and they appear VERY rarely) are fully dresed with normal pants

But lolis...

Most of the cast that gets naked aren't lolis

Well the game is popular, so they probably like the game and watched the show

I thought it was only played by otakus, I was wrong I guess.

That's a bit like saying video games (and not just the mobile ones) are played by nerds.

I mean, it's mostly played by "otaku," but the characters are kinda everywhere at this point (everywhere within the sort of anime community) I guess. I have a friend who teaches English in Japan, and he's seen a surprising amount of students of both genders with KanColle straps and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking World Trigger the manga, but I heard the anime wasn't good or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Just don't expect good animation out of it, and you might like it.  They seem to cheap out on the art.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the first 5-8 episodes were kinda lackluster in pacing. A lot of dragged-out shots and such but I think it became better as the season progressed. Though now they have started with some anime-exclusive content/filler.
>> ARTICLE
That one girl always looks high as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
World trigger had a slow mid season but it's back on track good now, and the show is pretty good.  Never read the manga, but I like it.  Most shows over 12-15 ep. per season I won't even look at, but I always keep coming back to world trigger

The anime, while currently on some filler since it caught up to the manga, got leaps and bounds better after about episode 20ish or so.

Yokai Watch is still mad popular amongst elementary school kids. Once they get to around grade 6 and into junior high they transition from the 3DS to their newly acquired smartphones.

I'm glad The Boy and the Beast (Bakemono no Ko) is so popular! I hope this means more good things about it. Hosoda hasn't disappointed yet.

>> ARTICLE
I'd be interested in hearing your experience teaching in Japan - how you got into it, what the experience has been like, what the pay is like, good things, bad things, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing too fantastical, really. I got into it because a buddy was applying to JET so I figured I would too. I was graduating and figured I needed a year to let it all settle in. Why not in Japan? I got the job and he didn't. *shrug*

The experience has been pretty great. The first, and supposedly only, year went fantastic and I've been lingering around ever since. Lotsof friendly people, a few xenophobic people, a bunch of cute kids, some brats, etc. 

Pay is enough to get by, along with slooooooowly paying off my student debts. As things stand I'll be entirely debt free in a year. If your goal is to be balling, teaching in Japan (like teaching *anywhere*, really) is not the thing for you. I grew up poor most of my life, so having enough money to pay bills, buy new clothes, get a car and eat well is more than enough for me.

As for good and bad things there are so many from either side that it'd be hard to list. But if you've just lived a normal life you can pretty much imagine what they are, except imagine a lot of Japanese folk filling in many of the roles.
>> ARTICLE
Did you get hired by your BOE directly after JET, or have you moved around a bit?

I'm curious because I applied for JET this year, though I'm not sure if it's the correct path for me (I have prior teaching experience).


>> ARTICLE
I was hired on board after JET. I'm officially a city worker now. From what I understand it's very rare for this to happen and JET tenures depend entirely on the municipality that hires them. I've heard of certain cities only allowing a JET to stay two or three years maximum.

Other cities transfer teachers to different schools every year or two, which having been at my school for so many years now would be a nightmare (especially because I've taught some of these kids since they were in kindergarten).

But if you've already applied I say go for it! Those first couple of years here were probably the best of my life. Learned a ton of great things, experienced a lot, met a bunch of fantastic people. Even if you only decide to only stay a year, it'll be a great year.
>> ARTICLE
You were retained by the same BOE? Thats nuts. I've never heard of that happening. I've seen a couple go into other locations and BOE's as privates after JET but never the same place. Where abouts are you? 
>> ARTICLE
Lol, yeah I'm not too into giving out my location. I've already been giving up a bunch of tidbits about myself but actually telling you where I work feels a bit too much. Ask me anything else not related to tracking me down and I'd be glad to answer.
>> ARTICLE
I assume you need to know Japanese for these programs? 
>> ARTICLE
Not at all! I certainly didn't (outside of dumb anima Japanese). Hell, I'd say there's a particular fun to be had having your coworkers explain details of the language to you as you learn.

KanColle is a video game in Japan that got pretty popular which then became light novels and stuff.

Haikyuu and Kancolle weren't surprising, but didn't think they'd have the exact same number of votes
>> ARTICLE
I think the factors evening it out were lack of a boys volleyball team at school diminished Haikyuu, and black magic elevated Kantai Collection.
>> ARTICLE
Hey Kancolle is actually a huge phenomenon in Japan! The game (which was the original source) is heavily played by a large population. I'm not surprised it is popular.
>> ARTICLE
Kantai Collection is really big, with a [large amount of game players](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/02/20/digital/kantai-collection-social-game-of-warships-sets-course-for-big-money/#.VoDgtkub7wI), *tons* of [spin-off manga and LNs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Collection#Print_media) and even more fan-made material (KanColle isn't quite on Touhou's level in that regard, but it's still quite massive, and has dominated Comiket in recent years).

It's surprising to see it be popular amongst younger people, I suppose, but it's hardly obscure.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually not that surprised that it's popular among younger kids. Now this may not be all that indicative of popularity, but the amount of merch that it has going is fairly extensive. I've had friends who go through Japan on student-exchange trips or what have you and lots of stores have Kancolle merch (hell, there was one where figmas of Kongou and Yahagi were front and center on the window display). Just seeing that stuff, especially since the anime aired not all that long ago, probably made these kids curious to what the hell Kancolle is (solid crackpot theory, I know). 

Plus the premise of Kancolle by itself may draw in a fanbase (assuming they're either into the history part like I am, or they just wanna see attractive animu girls have their clothes ripped up by the ~~US Navy~~ Abyssals).

I dunno, I'm just thinking out loud here, but I'm really actually not that surprised.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, merchandise does probably play a big role. If you go into a store to buy a figure or cell phone strap or whatever, you are probably going to wind up seeing a fair amount of merchandise of Kongou, Akagi, Yamato, et cetera, and that naturally would lead to curiosity as to what thing those characters are from.

I don't know how big of a role an interest in history plays. On the one hand, I certainly got into it in decent part due to my interest in naval history, and I can say that I've seen doujinshi and whatnot from people who are also clearly well-versed in the actual history of those ship girls. On the other hand, I'm sure a lot of people are just into it for the ship waifus and don't know or care to know much about the historical details. KanColle manages to appeal to both crowds, I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
I teach in China and some of the answers I've been getting are similar. I found it really awkward that a few students really liked stuff like Hetalia, but fortunately One Piece and Gintama seem way more popular than the rest (I say fortunately because I can relate to them way better, which sometimes creates interesting topics to talk about).

Then, in here, you also have wildly popular stuff like Tokyo Ghoul, SnK and Haikyuu. Another curious fact is that for some reason most students who REALLY like basketball prefer Slam Dunk over KnB. Now THAT's sweet. Slam Dunk is probably my favorite sports anime ever, but many younger kids have no idea how good it is. 
>> ARTICLE
This! 
Slam Dunk needs a remaster asap to save the future basketmen. By today's standard, the anime is actually holding back the epicness of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Praise those Usagi Desu ka voters. You've made me so proud.

>> ARTICLE
So happy to see world trigger up there! But age wise they are actually closer to that of your students and the teamwork is actually relatable and realistic. It's a low key series that is actually smart and good at interesting characters
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger is pretty good. You just had to get past the first few "boring" episodes. I'm still enjoying it although episode 60 was a pretty boring filler, hope next arc starts next week and will be good!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of sad that less people notice World Trigger. I haven't watched the anime, because I don't want to watch Toei, but the manga is fantastic and I definitely recommend people it. It is much more different than traditional battle shounen, with great battles and realistic development of character.

I'm surprised how popular One Piece is. Like, here in the West out of the "big three" it's the one people know the least, yet in Japan it completely destroys the other two combined.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder why that is. Imo out of the big three One Piece is the better one. Don't get me wrong it has it's issues (Pacing + so many characters pls Oda D:) But i love it for what it is. Maybe it came out a lot earlier than the other two and was already pretty far into the story when people picked up on naruto/bleach?
>> ARTICLE
It didn't help that Bleach Manga dropped in popularity and Naruto anime is filled with shitty fillers.
>> ARTICLE
I love One Piece. I honestly have no idea why the west (and /r/anime) do not love it as much as the Japanese do. I would say it has pacing issues at the beginning but later in the story, I do believe it does not.

The show just has so much going for it. I've had a lot of good laughs watching One piece. I've cried a bunch as well. It handles its lightheartedness with its seriousness and some scenes are epic as fuck.

I think the exposure because of 4kids really fucked it over as well as the large amount of episodes that really turns people away. It took me a very very long time to convince my friend to watch One Piece and stick to it until he got to the Alabasta arc. He keeps telling me, "there are just so many episodes man."

I truly recommend One Piece to /r/anime. It's really about the journey and growing up with the crew. You see all the highs and lows and its truly a great experience.
>> ARTICLE
The majority of Western anime watchers most likely (like myself) started watching Naruto and Bleach dubbed on whatever cartoon/anime station that played them often back to back, and liked them for their gritty (for our age) content and serious tone. 

One Piece on the other hand was always on a different channel and had less fluid animation, much worse art, and had a more light-hearted aspect to it so none of us really got into it.

I'm generalizing, but that's the reason why me and my friends never got into One Piece. Nowadays I avoid it due to the length, don't got the time nor the interest to start it.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece aired as one of the first midday Anime in Europe I think it's more popular here than Naruto or Bleach but that might just be my generation. The ones in school right now could think otherwise.

Ehh Skypeia suffers from the same kinda problem as Dressrosa in that it's WAY too stretched out and the story suffers as a result. It's also IMO hard to skip because of all the references later in the series.

> It also helped that this was probably the default answer that most non-anime fans used.

This is **exactly** why One Piece always takes the top spot in these rankings in Japan. I've seen this phenomena in Japan all the time. They'll answer "One Piece" and most likely never even saw the show or manga. It's the "go-to" answer for non-anime fans. 

I was fooling around on youtube some months back, and was watching AKBingo or similar show. I watched them ask 100+ members of AKB48 what their favorite anime was and every member who said they didn't watch anime said one piece. I even said out loud "Uh, that's going to skew the results a bit..." Interestingly enough, I don't think anyone from the group who admitted to being an anime watcher answered One Piece. I think Mayuyu Watanabe (arguably the most popular member, though she may not be with the group anymore, I don't keep up with them) is a self-admitted otaku and mangaka. She said Hetalia was her fav anime.

So now, if I want to know what anime Japanese people are watching, I always just scratch off one piece off the list, then start from there.
>> ARTICLE
I think you've made some absurd insinuations. You think non-anime fans legitimately lie and say One Piece is their favorite, and if so, that it's because they haven't seen *anything else* like several members of AKB48? The confirmation bias is real!

I was only in Japan for a month, but the amount of One Piece I saw was mind-boggling. The historical museum I went to had a full blown One Piece exhibit for the weekend. I got my picture taken next to a life-size Whitebeard! I saw salarymen reading issues on the subway. So, why would you scratch off the most watched show if you want to know what Japan is watching? C'mon, fam. 
>> ARTICLE
There obviously is a reason why One Piece is the best selling manga for years and one of the most watched anime series in Japan...

Don't know it seems the west and /r/anime has a certian bias against One Piece. It isn't the greatest piece of anime out there but it's still alright and the manga is ofcourse the best.
>> ARTICLE
> I think you've made some absurd insinuations.

Far from absurd, it's what I've witnessed being immersed in Japan & Japanese culture this past decade. 

> You think non-anime fans legitimately lie and say One Piece is their favorite

When you're not a fan of anime, nor watch it, and you answer an anime you've never seen before, is it a lie? Because then you're also calling OP and his kids a liar. 

But that's not what I said at all; I'm saying they're going to say one piece because it's probably the only anime they know or have seen. Regardless of why they answer it, non-anime fans (people who don't watch anime) shouldn't be answering in the first place because it skews the results. 

If I'm not a fan of baseball and have never watched it, nor do I follow it, and someone asks me what my favorite team is, and I pick the first one that popped into my head, say the Yankees, is my answer really contributing to the study or survey? I don't think so. 

> I was only in Japan for a month, but the amount of One Piece I saw was mind-boggling.

I'm not claiming, nor did I claim it wasn't a popular show. It is. It's one of the most popular shows in Japan. But I do think the results would be different (or have more variation) among *actual anime watchers*. 
>> ARTICLE
> I think you've made some absurd insinuations.

I lived in Japan for quite some time (you can go through my 6 years of reddit history for proof). 

People will answer whatever the most popular or "acceptable" answer is, even if their own opinion differs. That's just the culture in Japan. People will say "One Piece" even though their favorite anime might be Naruto. It's about the culture of , "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Japan is a society where everyone tries to conform or fit in. They will go with whatever "the group" thinks. I think that's what QnA was trying to say. And I saw *massive* amounts of that in Japan. So much so that it's really understated. It really does explain why non-Anime watchers will pick one piece. 

To back up QnA, [here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHuWC6gqnBw) of non-Anime watchers (girls) picking One Piece as their favorite. And I can pretty much guarantee the half of those girls aren't watching that show. I doubt half of them have even seen a single episode. (ninja edit: that might be the wrong video but you get the idea)

I just can't help but stay away from the big four (One Piece, Dragonball, Naruto, Bleach) because none of the concepts really interest me enough for me to watch hundreds of episodes.



And that's another thing. There's a crazy amount of episodes to each of their names.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind lots of episodes myself, but I will say One piece's 700+ is just absurd. I do like other ones that go are pretty fast paces, like one punch man but at the same time - because I like longer animes it make me wish it wasn't going so fast so I could get more out of it. 

To air off the other person, Hunter x Hunter is a prime example. It's not too long (in comparison to the big 4) being at only 130? episodes, but it doesn't really linger anywhere and stall out for long at all. Plus.. well, that anime is quite dark, despite it's appearances. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it's all about the presentation. Most concepts in Anime aren't something to write home about but the way they're pulled off makes them great.


I mean take HxH for example. A license to do pretty much whatever the fuck you want but to gain it you will have to take several highly life threatening tests with borderline supernatural elements. On paper it sounds pretty dumb but that doesn't mean it can't develop into something interesting.

The ecchi category is popular enough, but remember this are a) middle school kids, and b) most Japanese are less likely to admit stuff like that.

It's a bit like American high school boys avoiding all appearances of being "gay" in their own false perception of it.  In high school though there'd be some boys who'd definitely choose to say whatever the craziest ecchi they could think of.

Just remember that there's a metric fuckton of ecchi and quite a lot of it gets sequals.

I don't know what's your opinion on other long-running series, such as bleach or naruto, but I think OP is the best of those.

If you enjoyed the first episode, the best suggestion I have for you is to continue, as long as you enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is better than Naruto and Bleach because it has less fillers. According to http://www.animefillerlist.com/, One Piece has 14% fillers, while Naruto Shippuden and Bleach has 41% and 45% respectively. For Naruto and Bleach mangas, those are masterpieces, but in the animes, they got destroyed by fillers, an example in Naruto after Sasuke went to Orochimaru, the fillers are so boring that I am thinking, will this ever ends. After a while, I found the website animefillerlist and I skipped all the fillers. In a year, I only watched around 30 episodes out of 52 episodes released a year. When I watched Bleach, my brother told me to skip all the filler arcs because they are boring. One piece is alright, great story and characters, dramatic, but the pacing is horrible (extremely slow).
>> ARTICLE
> One Piece is better than Naruto and Bleach because it has less fillers. According to http://www.animefillerlist.com/, One Piece has 14% fillers, while Naruto Shippuden and Bleach has 41% and 45% respectively. 

While you can skip the fillers in Naruo and Bleach, you can't dodge the endless padding of One Piece, which is frankly worse than filler arcs. Padding downplays a lot of moments. For example Luffy One-Hit KOing somebody within one page of the manga? Toei turns it into a 5minute scene where the opponent even looks like he has a chance to win.

He is better off watching the One Pace and "Episode of"-Specials of the arcs. If an arc has neither I would advice to read the manga rather than watch the anime.

>> ARTICLE
I watched all the way through Bleach, wish I knew about that site beforehand.  Especially the first slew of episodes.  It felt like a crawl in the storyline.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I do not hold a grudge against fillers -that is, if they are good.

There are about two reasons I usually dislike fillers, one being its lower quality, the other being its inconsistency with the rest of the show.

Other than that, I don't read manga, so sometimes I don't even notice... ;)
>> ARTICLE
The funny thing about Naruto is that the filler is famous for being movie quality animation. It's a pretty big complaint over at /r/Naruto because the filler will look so nice and the Canon will look like playdough in comparison.

Perhaps, but I dropped it anyway because of the frequent flashbacks.

I would, I am currently at about episode 320 and Ive been watching it off and on for the past 3 or so years. Whenever you get bored of it you can always stop watching it and come back to it and still have a pretty good idea of whats going on (I usually dont stop midway through an arc though). But yeah its a really fun adventure to watch.

Good to know,  yeah most likely I'll be watching other things on the side and taking breaks since it's just so long.

It gets extremely good after about 200 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
It's a fun, imaginative world with a variety of characters who are great for the most part.


The first couple arcs may seem underwhelming besides a key few, but the show eventually explodes in scale and everything gets even more awesome.


If you can handle the episode count, then it's well worth the watch. Only problem is the pacing I'd say, since it can seem a bit slow, but it's still pretty good
>> ARTICLE
allright, im on episode 684 atm. It took me around a year to get here but i have almost caught up. I would recommend you watch it. The beginning is good but it takes a dip between episode 100-300. After that it only gets better and better. I do suggest you make liberal use of the skip button as the pacing can be complety off sometimes due to them being close to the manga. I'm talking about flashbacks that you've already seen 3 times or flashbacks to previous episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Takes a dip between 100 and 300? Water 7/ Enies Lobby is 200-300ish and that's the best arc of the damn show.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. 

If you enjoyed the first ep. then you're good to go. 

I didn't like it at first. It was heavily recommended to me years ago. I started it and gave it up, same person kept pushing me to keep on with it. I can't remember, but it was something like 20-25 episodes before I started liking it and 30-40 episodes before I was finally hooked.

There is no way, it's not worth it.

>> ARTICLE
Arlong Park is where I got hooked too.
>> ARTICLE
It's one hell of a ride, and it isn't even close to being over yet. If you are into long running shounen anime, One Piece is certainly one that you should pick up. It is definitely a marathon though. It can be hard to get through all the episodes/chapters (if you want to go the manga route). I totally recommend it though, if only because it's gigantic world and plethora of unique characters really draws you in, even if it does take some time to do so. 

Edit: Also if filler really isn't your thing but you still want to get into it, I recommend reading the manga. I personally prefer it because it's what I started with, and it doesn't have any of the small amount of filler that the anime does have. But the anime still is pretty great. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you watch it until the arlong park ARC and still don't like it after that then it isn't for you, but if you end up enjoying it then you will never look back.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I say you go through at least the first saga. That around episodes 1-50. If you don't like it after that, then you can drop it or watch sparingly.

I suggest you read the first manga chapter as well, it's got a few interesting things left out, but it's not necessary.

I also suggest that if you really love the premise and characters, but can't stand the anime direction, then try the manga instead.
Some people can get over the pacing, others  can't get over it, but give the manga a try if you feel it goes slow before completely dropping.


>> ARTICLE
Alright,  thanks 
>> ARTICLE
For how much little filler there is, its quite good..... every once and awhile I pick a chapter from the manga and the anime follows that very well..... the only problem I have is I trip up on fillers and don't find myself watching it for a few days/weeks, but that's just me.

Skip the fillers, and then when you get far enough, you can start watching One Pace instead of actual one piece, to avoid parts where it takes them like 6 episodes to run from one end of a room to another.

Not really. It's formulaic and dull. It's full of filler episodes and the episodes themselves have a lot of filler content since they cover one chapter of the manga instead of the usual two. In the end is just a waste of time and if you want something similar you could just watch the old DBZ series and it'd be the same.

Ouch,  those down votes...  Thanks for your opinion though! 
>> ARTICLE
No problem. Downvoting is what people do when they can't form proper counter-arguments, since everything I said was also said by people who told you to watch the show. 

In the end there are shows that in their 25 episode runtime are better than One piece with it's several hundreds of episodes. An you could watch like 12 of those in the time it'd take you to watch One piece, each of them better than One Piece. I'd recomend you just watch FMA:B if you haven't seen it instead

>> ARTICLE
I have watched a fair amount of all of them but my opinion is just my own so don't take what I say as anything more than that. 

**Story**: Dear god yes. Unlike the other shows you have listed One Piece is one massive running story. At this point there are still many great mysteries that many fans have fun speculating on. Now is a fantastic time to get invested in this series because you'll be on the hype train with the rest of the fans when shit goes down, which is a very unique and fun experience. Although the story of One Piece takes a LONG time to develop into something deep, especially if you are watching it. I can only advise watching it if you want to enjoy the adventure rather than just catch up. If you would rather not invest that much time then reading the manga is the way to go. 

**Action** I really enjoy how all of the special moves/attacks usually have some real world physics involved that make them believable. It's janky anime physics, but at least it's not just a shouting match of who can make the biggest aura or believe in them self the most. I think that really makes the fights much more satisfying. The fights are solid and fun but they aren't as tactical as say Hunter x Hunter. 

**Characters**: Since OP is so long character development is also crazy slow, but it's certainly there. One Piece is legendary for bringing back characters from earlier in the series and that helps to make the world feel more alive and 3D rather than just a trudge from one arc to the next. 

I'm a massive One Piece fanboy so again, take my rambling with a grain of salt. If you have the time One piece is such a well written adventure with so many things done right that I can't imagine you wouldn't enjoy once you got into it. 
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is good if you binge watch it. That way you can skip a lot of pointless scenes. I loved it when I was catching up, but now that I watch is weekly it's really slow. But I'd say watch it just because Luffy (MC) is such a great and unique character that makes the show good enough not to skip.

>> ARTICLE
If you binge it like I did then you will find it gets alot better but you might not like having to wait each week for another episode when you reach the latest episode because you binged all of it...and its going to be at least 5 years until its completed I think. You should read the manga after episode 517~ if you don't like arcs being dragged out but I recommend that you watch the fights on youtube after because they are a great experience. I don't think that there is that much silliness in one piece to be honest, in fact it can get really serious and there are times where you might feel like crying.
>> ARTICLE
No, a lot of it is filler. I would read the manga over it.

I honestly think the first 530~ episodes are absolutely stellar and worth watching.

After that the quality dips and the arcs become too drawn out. Good time to swap over to the manga.

IMO the manga is better from the start. One Piece is pretty drawn out at the beginning too but later it's just unbearable. Reading the manga is faster :|
>> ARTICLE
> Reading the manga is faster :|

Perhaps, but the voice acting and soundtrack makes it worth it early on before everything becomes unbearably drawn out (like you said).

At least for me I find it much easier to get into something emotionally in anime versus manga.

There's also the more recent issue of the show... not... being... animated. 25 frames per episode isn't something I want to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong I love the pre-timeskip part of the anime and the soundtrack is great.

Maybe the manga is just better for me :|

I don't recall it. It's been 10+ years since I watched it, though.

It is not as "Silly" as this guy implies. One piece is silly in the same vein as early Dragonball. Some of the fights use unorthodox methods to win but, they also make sense within the context. One Piece also deals with some very serious issues such as slavery, racism, brotherhood, family, and blondes who go missing.

Nope, I think it has many great moments, but it's not worth going through 700 episodes, you could read the manga because it's faster or just watch better anime that doesn't have hundreds of episodes. And it stays silly.

Not a lot of studios can produce a long running series like One Piece so it doesnt matter who does it because eventually the quality would have to go down. Toei usually pulls through during the important parts which is what matters to me since i also read the manga
>> ARTICLE
Bones or Madhouse please.
>> ARTICLE
didnt BONES collab with some early Naruto episodes or was it when Naruto recycled some scenes from Cowboy Bebop?

idk i forgot, i need to look it up, will post when i find something
>> ARTICLE
God. Soul Eater quality One Piece would be a dream come true.

Someone needs to redo the anime once it's all over, for better pacing and more than 5 frames per episode.
>> ARTICLE
Does it seriously move that slow later on? How is that even possible?
>> ARTICLE
It's basically an animated manga last I saw it during the coliseum fights.

Most of the time there aren't really any animations and then once in awhile they throw in a low frame animated sequence and even rarer, they might animate a few actions fully.
>> ARTICLE
I'm exaggerating of course. 

^^^but ^^^only ^^^a ^^^little ^^^bit

It's actually ridiculous though, if I didn't want it animated I wouldn't be watching the anime (and now I'm not anymore; episode 691 was my breaking point).
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised you made it so far. I gave up at ep 686
>> ARTICLE
It's alright. I'll just loop Water-7/Enies Lobby.
>> ARTICLE
Damn your missing out on Law's backstory then. :/
>> ARTICLE
I'm up to date with the manga as well.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair they do have to have an episode every week, and they do have a budget. Also if you've watched Laws flashback episodes in the Dressrosa arc, you'll see the animation is really good. Save up the money for the best parts. The Franky vs Senior ending was animated well to.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I don't think studio matters, it's a matter of budget which if I would have to guess comes from Shueisha. You would think they could spare a little more cash for the best selling manga of all time.
>> ARTICLE
If a different animation studio like Shaft, Madhouse, or Ufotable went back and started animating One Piece from the beginning, it would probably be very widely regarded. 

Of course, /r/anime would still hate it because long running shounen get shit on in this sub. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you realize how much money that would be needed to produce that? You're basically asking Shaft/Madhouse/Whoever to reanimate 700+ episodes. If it was that simple, then Dragon Ball would have already been reanimated in high definition. The closest you could get, is to have animated specials that recap certain arcs within a feature film. Examples would be Episode of Nami, Merry, Movie 8. The movies would be better because they can actually produce a good amount of revenue, unlike the TV - 2 hour specials. 

Additionally, if a company like Shaft would animate One Piece, then it would become a seasonal anime - meaning only 20-26 episodes per season, but that will never happen because One Piece/Toei doesn't want to lose its time slot.
>> ARTICLE
It's similar to the family guy thing, after so many seasons they can skimp on animation even if the episodes cost more than at the start.

People got used to the shit animation even if it got worse over the years
>> ARTICLE
The power ups in one piece come from people creating new abilities. It's not so much a random power up as it is an "oh i have the ability to do this, can't believe I never thought of it." 

There is a single large power up though during the time skip but that was 2 years of training they skipped over. Aside from that the show fits in a small time frame so people don't just randomly get crazy strong.

That said if you're in for a marathon you should watch it. Give it a 10 episode try and if you are addicted go for it. If you make it to 25 or 50 and aren't wanting more then it just isn't for you.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it is.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the best show ever but for a long running shonen, it is very good. I would recommend reading it versus watching it. Take's less time and there's no filler
>> ARTICLE
This is way to go with any shounen really, unless you're really bored and have no other obligations in life. I quit the Bleach anime 5 years ago somewhere around ep 200, but didn't want to watch 150+ eps to catch up, so I just switched to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I have enjoyed One Piece immensely. Yes, it has a ton of episodes. But it is definitely worth the time invested I haven't been disappointed in it at all like I was with Bleach or Naruto when it came to their fillers, that can sometimes span over a year. Their is maybe a few really bad fillers in One Piece but their short, and hop right back into the main storyline pretty fast.

Some of the filler I've read in rumors is stuff that Oda wanted to implement in the manga but didn't have time to put into it then. 

I would not recommend watching this one at break neck speed thou, you'll get frustrated that way. Just enjoy the adventure of the show. It should take you at the very least 6 months if not more to catch up to the very current episode. An then your with everyone else waiting for the next episode to finally show up.

Now this is a pretty big investment to make but if you can make it too Arlong Park you will definitely see why many people enjoy the show as much as they do.
>> ARTICLE
Gonna start it soon. See you in 6 months.
>> ARTICLE
hah, enjoy! It really is a great anime. :)
>> ARTICLE
It is not worth watching at all. Why? Because it's another drawn out guy anime like Bleach and especially Naruto. If there are whole seasons of filler you know it's a shounen!  
>> ARTICLE
Although I do agree that the show in itself is brilliant for a longrunning shonen show. I stopped watching at around episode 320 since it kept padding its content very noticably. Perhaps it has been fixed these days, but I would recommend just reading the manga as the story is still very good even up to this point.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with most shonens is that they tend to have power-ups throughout the entire series. So while in the start that giant bug might have been scary for the MC, by the end (or n * 100 th) episode the MC can fight off a horde of those same bugs without breaking a sweat.

Now, I've not seen one piece, but i've been told that it doesn't really have such radical power-ups (or any power-ups, perhaps). You may need ~50 episodes for it to become really good (again, I was told that).

I personally would like to see one piece, but maybe in the summer, since now I don't have anough time even for the airing shows.
>> ARTICLE
There's really only 2 "power ups" that come in the series. The first is established some 250 episodes in, and the second is more like 400-500 in. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not so much that there aren't radical power ups, it's more that in the first 100 episodes you meet some abusrdly powerful people that clearly outclass the MC's crew, so the show is more about MC's crew powering up to already established levels. 

As opposed to say DBZ which randomly introduces continuously more powerful people.
>> ARTICLE
The power-ups in One Piece really do make a lot of sense. Luffy, for example, is a fighter who specializes with improvisation. So when it starts getting really tough, he finds a way to *barely* edge out an opponent. But the way he achieves this isn't random either. It's thought out, and the moves make sense.

Plus, on of the underlying themes of One Piece revolved around how creative users can utilize their devil fruits. Luffy, for example, has a devil fruit power that makes him rubber...rather lame, right? It's not like he can control fire or shoot lasers. But the way he uses it makes him so strong. And the way he finds new ways to use his power is what makes him stronger over the course of the series.
>> ARTICLE
> The power-ups in One Piece really do make a lot of sense.

Looks at a guy flying in the air, learns gear. Logic.
>> ARTICLE
What are you talking about? Flying through the air? What?
>> ARTICLE
What what? That is how he learned it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand what you're saying, how did he learn it? Are you talking about luffy learning second gear? 
>> ARTICLE
How he learned the first
>> ARTICLE
The first? Please explain what you're talking about your making no sense to me. It's never actually shown when Luffy figured out how to use second gear I really have no clue what you're talking about.
>> ARTICLE
He saw the CP9 use their martial arts. He instantly learned gear.
>> ARTICLE
Thats not true he learned gear second off screen, why would you think that? He copied one of their techniques for flying through the air but anyone can learn that iirc they need to kick their leg 7 times very quickly, he saw them doing constantly and imitated it.

Why would cp9's fighting help him develop a fighting style specific to his devil fruit?
>> ARTICLE
I personally love it but like any long-running show, I wouldn't marathon it or focus too deeply on every episode. I like to put it up on my second monitor while I'm doing other stuff. 

It starts off very slow and doesn't pick up until the Arlong Arc. You will laugh, you will cry, and you'll experience the highs and lows of the crew. Seriously though, this shit is emotional. Clannad didn't do shit for me but I was bawling at the midpoint of the story.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the "Big 3." YOu're gonna hear that. I say, give it a shot. I enjoy it, but I watch it VERY casually. As in, I watch the movies using only my basic knowledge of the show from the 20 episodes I watched back in 2006. THe movies are great and so the characters. Whether or not you like the show is your opinion. Give it a shot, test the waters.
>> ARTICLE
I had to drop it around 200 episodes because I no longer have the time, but it is a great anime. You just need the time to watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say if you have like a million hours of time then yes. I stopped about half way through the series so far and I don't want to take a year of my life to catch up, but thats just me.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it is a pretty good show to watch and although it has quite a bit of filler's, some of them are quite worth the watch I'd even go as far to say it's one of the best filler's an anime. So I would say why not give if a try if it's your cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has watched all episodes of the anime and read up until the most recent manga chapter I would say yes. That being said, the beginning of the series is kinda slow, picks up, kinda slow, then gets awesome. Meeting the first 6 -7 crew members is cool but kinda slow. The Alabasta arc is slow to start but gets good near the end. The Skypiea arc is kinda slow and boring IMO but THEN you get the Davy back arc (which i love), the water 7 arc (also love) and the Enies Lobby arc which, Im sure most OP fans would agree, is the starting point of the greatness that is OP. Its pretty great from then on. The manga is getting AWESOME but then again my favorite character is Law who is featured a lot so maybe Im biased.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched One Piece up to about 30 episodes and then stopped. It was a while ago so I forget why but it was during a time when I was declining from anime so it might be because of that. I found it interesting and worth a try. Watch about 20 episodes and if you're hooked then I strongly encourage it. I've watched ALL of Naruto since I was a kid so I often compare shonens and long shows to Naruto and I would have to say that One Piece is more fun and less serious but the way it flows from fun and happy to serious action is great and has a lot of merits. One Piece is a show that is hard not to get hooked on because it is a good show. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch to Arlong. If you like it, it gets even better. If you don't, the "better" is just better versions of the exact same stuff.
>> ARTICLE
No. But it's worth reading. Less filler
>> ARTICLE
The anime is considerably better than the manga. It's certainly more padded out than the manga, but when you can watch the show at your own pace it's not much of an issue. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime has some good parts, but saying its considerably better than the manga is a huge leap. 


For example the current Manga arc is the best manga arc i've ever read. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry and gives me chills but the anime for that same arc feels like garbage. The pacing is terrible, they animate like 8 pages an episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Not a leap in the slightest. And One Piece is not meant to be watched as it airs. One episode a week ruins the show, just as being stuck with one chapter a week ruins the manga. When you're able to marathon both though, the advantages of the anime outweigh the pacing issues (Which are negligible when you can watch the show at your own leisure.), not even taking into account the disadvantages of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
The pacing is slow even when you marathon it
>> ARTICLE
This is a very big reason why I have just taken a break for awhile from the show. I'd rather watch it in blocks an enjoy it that way then week by week. The anime is good but watching it weekly is hard to do. It was hard to watch the fishman arc for me when it was coming out, but watching it all together it was done pretty well I thought.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much what I've done. I stopped watching the anime after Punk Hazard finished and I'll be picking it up again once Dressarosa finishes. I've already been following along in the manga, but once Dressarosa finishes I'll stop reading it as well until the next arc finishes.

I might just stop reading the manga altogether after Dressarosa. I like the anime a lot more, and knowing what happens from reading the manga takes away some of the fun of watching the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I love it but it's going to take you a long time to catch up.

You would probably be better off reading the manga and then watching the anime as it airs (currently in the best arc, probably).

I like your idea about it being a government secret. Maybe some sort of Key Ponyglyph that has all of the knowledge of the void century? I also think that it very well could be the straw hat because [ ](/s "Gol D Roger was the original owner") those are about the only things I could think of.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. A Ponyglyph could be there. Maybe Robins ancestors weren't wiped out at all and Gol D Roger saved a bunch of them. :D
>> ARTICLE
knowing your average shounen, it is probably friendship or something.
>> ARTICLE
Eiichiro Oda specifically said it's nothing abstract and definitely something that's physical.
>> ARTICLE
friends are physical :P
>> ARTICLE
He implied it was something that could change the world. It's already been found by Gol D Roger and he was executed for it. Then the government went on a massive search to see if he had any offspring so that they could execute them too just for being the offspring of Gol D Roger. Its definitely not "friendship" or the like.
>> ARTICLE
oh man.. this reminded me of that horrible Soul Eater anime ending.. -_-
>> ARTICLE
That ending does not count. Manga didn't end there. Seriously, not sure what they were thinking.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i heard the manga went on a bit longer and ended much better.

the whole anime was awesome though. i loved the art, the music, the theme all in all.

but that ending, man. it's actually the first time that i went "WTF?!?!" at the ending of an anime.

sad.
>> ARTICLE
The manga hasn't ended yet, and yes it is far superior to its anime counter part. So far no deus ex machina punch of courage, but we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
The government isn't guarding the One Piece since the Yonkou pretty much own the last part of the New World anyway and Whitebeard was considered the "closest" to getting it and only didn't because he didn't want it. I assume the reason no one has found Raftel is because of the weather/strange magnetic currents in the new world that make traveling extremely difficult. Remember that the log posts don't work in the New World and so getting to Raftel should be impossible unless you know the trick (which I assume there is) to finding it. Obviously the polygraphs have something to do with the One Piece (since the piece telling about the Lost Century is implied to be at Raftel) but I don't think that's the One Piece itself since then Luffy's dream and Robin's dream would be the same thing though that's debatable as well.

I had opened a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ug9ho/one_piece_theory/) in /r/onepiece and the top comment is pretty interesting. Basically right now the two lead theories is either it's a super weapon (since the polygraphs keep mentioning weapons) or it's the Lost Century.

The super weapon theory gets even more credibility when you think about how the government is obsessed as fuck about not only weapons technology (Vega Punk's Lab, Pacifistas) but also getting it's hands on super weapons (Impel Down). Perhaps the lost civilization was losing the war against the current government and was developing a super weapon at Raftel but ended up losing before it was finished up. That would explain why Rayleigh tells the Straw-hats that perhaps they would come to a different conclusion about it than the Gol D Pirates did (to use it or to reveal it to the world instead of keeping it hidden at Raftel).

Either way Oda specifically said the last arc is going to make Marineford War look like nothing so I'm excited for it.

Also, ITT: People who have barely read One Piece and have no idea what they're talking about try to shit all over it. They fail to realize that One Piece is HUGE in Japan. Like part of the culture; Chopper is pretty much everywhere.
>> ARTICLE
hey. thanks for linking me to that thread. i had fun reading through those ideas.

the superweapon theory is a really good one! i like that idea of uniting all seas is an option. but it makes you wonder why Gol D Roger didnt want to use it.

i think i can defend my theory.

the world government might not have control over the new world but they do have a very good presence in the other seas.

if you think about it, they dont really need a good presence in grand line. its a very dangerous place and compared to the other seas, its not big or as inhabited by humans.

im not really sure about riches or other royalties one might find in grand line so they're presence might be strong because of that.

i guess a good reason for their strong presence is to improve travel and trading of the four seas to each other. but you dont really need to build 3 great government establishments to do that (impel down, marineford, cp9 ark(?)). heck, they even built their main HQ on top and in the middle of the Red Line.

the world government controls how much the public is allowed to know and they barely do tell it all. (alabasta - the war that never happened, luffy beating Moria, etc.) just imagine how much more dirt they are keeping from everyone. and once it goes out, calamity will happen. maybe one reason why Gol D Roger didnt want it to come out yet because the world was not ready. After the great pirate era began, people are more aware of pirates presence now and probably the world government is exposing itself little by little.

I think it's going to be something pertaining to the Ancient Weapons. Perhaps one of them? Or a tool to defeat them? Or anything, really.

Well i doubt it is a ponyglyph or something like knowledge of government secrets/lost century since Ohara already figured that out...and since Gol D Roger offered Newgate directions to Raftel so One Piece is physical, some kind of object or treasure. There are 3 great weapons in the world and we already know of Poseidon, the other 2 will probably be Hades and Zeus but again i doubt either of them are One Piece.

To be fair that is not really true. One piece has the quality of having a geographical progression that you can use to chart their journey. They started in the east blue which is for babies and made it to the Grand line, next is the new world and then finally the one piece itself. They are now finally closing in on the border to the new world so they are technically a lot closer to the one piece.
>> ARTICLE
The Arlong Park arc is probably my favorite in the series and one of the better arcs in the story. You get the first unambiguously evil villain of the series, as well as one of the more tragic character backstories for the main cast.

If you're really unsure about continuing the series and don't mind fairly **Massive Spoilers**, [watch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vslBlZFpyRA). If that doesn't seem interesting, just drop it.

This video is what made me marathon this show up to date in a month.  Watch it if you don't mind.  A few things won't make sense but you'll realize how good it gets.

That video gives me chills no matter how many times I watch it.

[This part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHXiUHiS0U) of the show is where I knew I couldn't ever stop watching. It's about 150 episodes in, and I had been casually watching it prior to this part, but as soon as I saw this part, I knew I was gone. 

It really shows the whole basis of why Luffy is a bad ass (and his entire crew). You really understand that Luffy will do anything to protect people's dreams and things they aspire to do, even if he just met that person. From where you're at in the anime and where this video takes place, a LOT of stuff happens, and in the next arc you also get a small glimpse of what Luffy really will do to protect the dreams of his crew.

>> ARTICLE
I suggest this just because 500-something episodes is a ridiculous investment of time. you can read through that in a fraction of the time. what I've seen of the anime though is they do a very good job of depicting what happens in the Manga and add almost nothing else. so unlike some anime/manga series where you will see some differences from fight to fight, event to event. one piece will be pretty much identical the entire way through (fillers and first 3-4 episodes excluded)
>> ARTICLE
^ this.and he should also watch the anime version of the best battles.

The next arc with Nami and Arlong is really good. Maybe watch the backstory of like three episodes of Nami and Bellemere and see if you like it.
>> ARTICLE
Parroting what everyone else has said here already, Arlong Park really caught me and hooked me into the show. Afterward they get to the grand line fairly quick and things just continue to ramp up a lot. (LOVE The Alabasta leadup/arc overall so much)
>> ARTICLE
Just keep watching it. Don't give in to the other shows. After Arlong Park they slowly start revealing things that make you go woah! But, it will really bring you in soon
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind the beginning is slow, at leas compared to the rest of the series. You will see a significant ascension in maturity and weight of the events. IMHO Arlong park so alright but has the worst fights in the entire series. Just know that the show will develop its feel more until around 230 where it holds onto the intensity and carries it into all of the events that follow. be sure to check up on which episodes are fillers [here](http://razielsdomain.forumotion.net/t10321-list-of-filler-episodes-for-one-piece). Many people including myself will tell you that it is one of the best animes they've seen so far.

the next arc is Arlong and its probably the best arc in the east blue. Every time i see "walk to Arlong Park" it gives me chills down my spine. just keep at it, you will not regret it later on.

Small spoiler? Hmmm honestly I hate spoiling things for anyone in regards to a great anime. I'll just say only two things that might get you more interested. 1) More people will join them and there's one member's arc that is really touching, made me cried manly tears. 2) Epic battle scenes that will get you so pumped up that you'll get nerd chills all over your body.

PS: I have every single episode, movies, OVAs, specials of one piece and re-watched them a few times, that's how awesome it is.
>> ARTICLE
Anime I consider to have epic battle scenes:  The end of Cowboy Bebop, Ichigo in the Seireitei and the battle with Aizen, Sasuke vs Deidara, Gohan vs Cell, and Fairy Tail fights from episode 98 on.  Anime that has given me manly tears:  Clannad.  That's it.  (although especially the kyou episode of AF cuz it relates)  
If it's as epic as these, I'll give it another chance.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen everything you mentioned except for Gohan vs Cell and all I can say that, in my opinion, OP is bound to give you more excitement(some of the fights you mentioned were one-sided) and manly tears(maybe not as much as Clannad). Thus I would definitely recommend you to try harder to continue as much as possible. You will not regret this, trust me. OP is one of the best selling manga(anime is better imo) for a long time(more than 10 years) for a good reason. 

PS: I started watching OP for fun on a website that was streaming it. I started from episode one, next thing I know is that I finished close to 490 episodes within a month. Stream was kinda too slow when I reached episode 200+ and started downloading the rest. I basically watched through 10 years+ of awesomeness in a month.
>> ARTICLE
it's really long and daunting to get started now, either read the manga or just plain skip episodes so you get to the end of the arc quicker,  your just missing minion fights, exposition on the villains being dicks and power of friendship but you have 500+ episodes to get through.  once they get to the grand line it keeps getting better and better.

Sometimes a particular series just won't strike a chord with you. I've heard a lot of people saying that 12 Kingdoms is really good. I watched it and kept waiting for it to get good. In the end, I just didn't care for the show.

Wow, you're still pretty early on.

My stance on One Piece is that it's one of the most creative worlds that you can ever find. The world itself is fun, and it's populated by colorful and unique characters. Just looking at that, you got a masterpiece.

However, it does tend to drag a bit, and even get repetative. They fight the guy, Luffy just barely wins after he almost dies, and then they throw the same party over and over again where it's revealed that everyone you thought was dead isn't actually dead. 

It's a little annoying in that regard, although I will say that a few of the fights have been entertaining (Luffy vs Enel comes to mind, which you'll get to in 2 arcs I believe), but the real gold of the series is just enjoying the ride and looking at the characters. Take that philosophy with you, and you'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
You're actually super close to when it starts to pick up. The next arc is one of my favorites. There is a filler arc after it that you may or may not want to skip. It's sort of mediocre. After that, though, everything's amazing.

You seem to like action. Watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNp7qNgJskM&list=FLER3w0B9k2UoH0xTpTvWBSw&index=41&feature=plpp_video). Warning: spoilers.


>> ARTICLE
That was increadible.
>> ARTICLE
I started to really enjoy one piece the second they hit the grant line which, if I recall, is the second they leave the floating restaurant (ironically).

My favorite arc is the floating island one, but I had friends who didn't think much of it. My least favorite besides the beginning of the show is the zombie island arc (if that describes it enough). It also has gotten really good once they get to that island with all the bubbles.

If you don't like one piece much, then you don't like it. It is fine. Personally I really enjoy ALL of the characters in one piece (especially tony tony chopper). It doesn't matter if it is a background character or a foreground character, all characters in the show are unique. Heck, even the islands in the show are their own characters. It really helps make the show imaginative, random, and fun. Also, Luffy's personality has really grown on me. The first 100 eps I didn't think much of him but now I really enjoy his whole hearted forward thrusts into insanity and his caring for others around him.

I also really like the back story of one piece. Without saying to much (hopefully not a spoiler) I enjoy how the 'bad guys' aka pirates are often the good guys and the good guys are often the bad guys. US shows even for adults are so straight forward and black and white, it drives me nuts. One piece really demonstrates how people are people, not just bad or good, just like a lot of different anime series do. I really wish that lesson would pop up in the US a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I don't completely agree with your last point.

Most of the pirates are bad guys, with the occasional good guys.

Most of the marines are good guys, with the occasional bad guys.

I think it's more to show that there is no absolute. Or, to take your analogy, there is no black and white. Each side is tainted with evil, to varying degrees.

Aside from that, though, I agree with your post. :)

I tell you what. Watch One Piece only in Japanese with subs. I live in Austria and saw the first Episodes on a crappy teen channel. And the german voice acting is awful, but after I heard the first english dubbed episode, I knew it couldve been worse. The amount of heart the japanese voice actors put into the characters is astounishing and is a big part of what makes One Piece so special to me.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIBCSb9YW8o this AMV gave me chills down my spine. I wanted to reach these Episodes, thats how I started with One piece seriously. It is spoiling a bit I guess, but not much of the Plot gets revealed so it should be fine.

And for the record: All Episodes Favorite: Jet Gatling against Lucci

Semi-Spoiler: [THIS EPIC SCENE](
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so3UD9U_6so&feature=youtube_gdata_player) is when I knew One Piece was something else.
>> ARTICLE
I can tell you, two of my friends and I agree that it is slow. We had troubles getting past episode 30. So I decided we should do a speed run experiment.

We watched One Piece episodes 1-17 at 4x speed. It made it a well-paced Shounen anime. It was funny as well and the plot turns came fast enough to avoid our experience from watching anime all these years.

I have to say that we then followed up 18-100 that Saturday and it turned out... about every 10 episodes  had a 2-3 episode sections that were good. The rest between those breakers were slow and unmoving in plot even at 4 minutes an episode. Some of the later episodes between 80-100 didn't lose much at 8x speed.

Those 80 episodes were a hard brunt force to get through but at that speed, doable. I look forward to the episodes that start to pick up after that.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched One Piece up until the end of Season 13. I also watched Naruto, Bleach, and Gintama just to see what all the fuss was about. (Reference: Myanimelist top anime) End result? I loathe all four. 

Maybe it's just not your thing? I gave up on it afterwards, I just couldn't stand it anymore. 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Read it. The anime ruins a lot of what is so great about the manga.
>> ARTICLE
What does it ruin? It is far and above my favorite [long-running] manga->anime adaption. The godlike soundtrack, top-notch seiyuus, colorful presentation, and [occasionally] mind-blowing animation. The only real struggle for me is the pacing, which is why I read the manga first.
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for op but for me I read the manga for so long that all the characters already have a voice. So listening to them talking with the wrong voice aggravates the shit out of me. 

Also it's at least a tripling of effort due to how much time it takes to watch anime compared to reading manga. 

Also I suspect op may be in the manga is superior to anime camp. (which it is but you should never say to loudly around these parts) 
>> ARTICLE
It definitely ties into our personalities/dispositions. I'm a much more audio/visual person, and love the sensations anime allows me to experience. I'm an avid manga reader, but that is generally due to impatience hahaha.

I don't think there's any convincing to be done from either side. At least we can both enjoy the core of the work!
>> ARTICLE
It is really just the pacing for me. Not only was that aspect not as good, but it kind of trickles down into the test. I'm sure people enjoy the anime but I feel like you really have to read the manga for the full One Piece experience.
>> ARTICLE
Since we all agree the pacing is shit, now I'm imagining how awesome a condensed version would be...
>> ARTICLE
3 of the movies (Strong World, Film Z, Baron) are pretty good, as are the specials (Merry, Luffy?, and Nami). The anime itself has great music.

The SFX though (robot steps, anyone?) can get pretty irritating, since they recycle the same set of sounds even when they don't fit, and while the animation has been pretty good (from Skypeia up to early Marineford it was pretty decent for a weekly forever-anime) for awhile, you can watch the quality post-TS with lazier animations as if Toei said "fuck it, we're already popular" (not because outdated or anything, it actually gets worse) except for a few scenes here and there. Now, that's still tolerable. However, the pacing is the final stake. The show recently (not necessarily recently, but around late Marineford IIRC) changed its adaptation ratio to 1:1, on two of the slowest arcs ever (Punk Hazard and Fishman Island). 

You can watch the anime. For the most part it has been good or tolerable. Recently, though, I really can't say the same. the manga, however, is pretty high quality and is definitely worth reading through if you need to save time or if you'd rather have the unadulterated product.
>> ARTICLE
I liked a lot of he movies. They were fun since they didn't have to worry about catching up to the manga. The anime is just so slow though...
>> ARTICLE
While I have a mixed perception of the previous movies, I loved the One Piece "Films" a lot, which were written by Oda. You can see his formulaic approach to things (2 losses/ties/etc and a final victory with a new move), which makes it feel more similar to the main series, and the characters involved are actually pretty important (Shiki the man who once was on terms with the Pirate Kind and Admiral Zed). 

The manga's been making itself perfect for adaptation. the current arc is much faster than Punk Hazard and Fishman Island, meaning even if the adaptation tries to butcher it, it'll still (hopefull) be somewhat fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem is that you can read the manga in 5 minutes, creating a fast-paced adventure with frantic action scenes. The anime is just slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. One Piece would lend itself well to a kind of hardcore FMA:B treatment 10-15 years from now where they animate chapters at the manga pace. In all fairness, pacing is a problem with most manga>anime adaptations..
>> ARTICLE
I think it'd be more like DBZ Kai. They'll redraw some scenes, but since the story hasn't really been modified there'll be little reason to change anything like the extent of Brotherhood, which followed the manga route, a road that splits cleanly from the 1st FMA anime, along wth different body structures, etc. All I think will really be completely redone will be the first few sets of episodes that look a bit awkward compared to the rest of the show. 

It's bad that One Piece has terrible (dare I say the worst due to not having huge canon arcs) pacing though, since unlike Naruto it's extremely fast paced, and unlike Bleach its battles are generally pretty simple and can't be drawn out (well). Bleach's battles are its main event rather than story so long battles actually work well, and Naruto's story has set a slow pace with its completely interconnected arcs vs One Piece's grand adventure loosely connected arcs. Both Bleach and Naruto also have non-canon arcs, so although it's pretty terrible having to wait a year randomly, you get slightly better canon quality (Which would actually work out better for One Piece if done well since it's a grand adventure). 
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't wait for it to end. You can wait until it's *close* though, like maybe 6 months away. Then you should start watching it. It'll be a huge event in the anime/manga world and you can bet your face you'll get spoiled.
>> ARTICLE
You're gonna be wasting many years waiting for it to end then.  The story looks like it'll go on for quite a bit more.

>> ARTICLE
IIRC Impel Down was supposed to be about the halfway point of the Grand Line. 
>> ARTICLE
Ya that's true unless Oda's got some new plans, also his health/schedule has been slower the past few years which will slow it down a little.
>> ARTICLE
i started a couple of months ago, i am on episode 560 now. It's a damn good show
>> ARTICLE
An easy cheat to do, is read up to Chapter 100 of the manga, which covers the same details, and then start on Episode 61. While I loved the East Blue, you can get most of the experience through the manga relatively quickly (faster than the 24 hours it would take you to watch the anime) and it gets really good after that. Also to Fabrikator
>> ARTICLE
Definitely use a filler guide and skip the filler. I powered through 500 episodes in about 1.5 months. Once it gets really going, its hard to stop.
>> ARTICLE
You know it's good pretty much the whole time, right? As long as you make it to the Arlong arc (~ep 30) you'll be hooked. It's all great. Having so many episodes just means you have plenty to enjoy. It's not a race to the finish.
>> ARTICLE
For me that's a good thing.

I only started watching it about 2 years ago and I take my time, I'm currently at around 470-ish and I'm happy that I know that no matter what I do I can always watch a new One Piece episode.
>> ARTICLE
too bad since Oda has mentioned that an end is in about 10 more years!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly you could just jump straight in to where it is now, and you'd probably be ok? I did that around episode 300 for a while but I stopped again so I dunno...

They do so many flashbacks though, it's made so you can start anytime. 
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing.  Like Naruto / Bleach there are some filler arcs you can skip.  One Piece starts to mitigate this however starting in the 200's by designing their episodes to just fit a chapter.  This really sucks when watching weekly, but upon marathon watching it is quite nice.  Once you hit this point you can skip straight into to ~7min mark - opener 2min, repeated clip 2min, recap 3min.

TL;DR: It goes fast after episode 200 when you start knocking out 4 episodes in 1 hour.
>> ARTICLE
Same here
>> ARTICLE
try the manga first, less time to blow throw and none of the pacing issues of the anime
>> ARTICLE
Honestly if you start watching it now you won't even catch up to till the middle of next year if you marathon regularly. It's loads of a fun and is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same for a while, do it trust me.
>> ARTICLE
The end will be in like 10 years you know...

I had issues like you at first, but after the 3rd time (and maybe being a bit older) I finally became a big fan.

I suggest the manga if the time is what stop you ; you can read the chapters at the speed you want, that change everything.
>> ARTICLE
Right on the nail
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, you're not the only one. I always see so much great stuff about One Piece so I'm tempted to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
watchop.com

>> ARTICLE
I always thought the same about One Piece. It just seemed so compelling and interesting and colorful and fun to watch, but dear God, 500 (at the time) episodes? 

But then I finally got my shit together and marathoned that bitch up until the ongoing during my summer holidays. So glad I did that.
>> ARTICLE
What about reading the manga? The art style is much better. The anime is terribly slow paced and the art feels washed out compared to the manga.

What I wonder is which are these "big 3" OP s talking about, seeing how Bleach is out of the picture for now. Hell I'd put Magi in the "big 3" rather than Naruto, Bleach or even One Piece. It's easily the best shounen manga I've read in ages, but unfortunately, the anime is also far worse than the manga.
>> ARTICLE
look at it this way.  You can watch one new episode a day and it will be a cool new episode for over two years!  That's kinda attractive sounding.
>> ARTICLE
Me and my wife have been going through it since February (now at episode 550).  This is my second time through and I always tell people to not get into it unless they really have an interest and the time.  It's one of my favorite series ever and is fantastic... but in the span of all those episodes you could watch 10 other fantastic series... so it's tough.
>> ARTICLE
I know the length of the show can be intimating but One Piece will be around for at least the next 10 years so now would be the time to watch it if you haven't already. 
>> ARTICLE
read the manga then... you can turn through that pretty fast since the pacing is correct not artificially slowed down and zero filler arches. 

>> ARTICLE
No filler?
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is broken up into distinct sagas, many of which have ended. So, there isn't one carrot, there's lots of them. It's a story of many smaller adventures rather than one great one. I've gotten about half-way, watching the show as it's done by Kaizoku fansubs, and it's easily my favorite anime even without a final 'ending'.

I suggest you watch it. The first few story arcs are pretty short and fun, and then you'll be hooked!
>> ARTICLE
I totally get that, but I feel like even if it ended today, I am still in awe of the awesome and fantastical adventures they've taken me on, and would still be worth watching.  (well, almost, I *really* want to see what happens)
>> ARTICLE
It's not bad.   I watched all of DBZ +GT as a rerun. 
>> ARTICLE
When I first got into it they were already in the high 400's, it took me a good two weeks on binge watching to catch up. 

I highly recommend watching it. All of it. In one sitting. 
>> ARTICLE
It took me a week to read the manga... starting from, I think, about book 10, all the way to chapter 410 or so which was current at the time.

Then I lost touch with it and am up to volume 62 only. :/
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen the anime at all? If so I'm guessing you enjoy the manga better?
>> ARTICLE
You could always read the manga. It's the superior version anyway (mostly because of pacing), even though I still really enjoy the show.

While I'm on the subject, I'd like to give a shout out to how wonderful the music in the animated version is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree about the music, I never really realized how important it was until I noticed the fighting scenes in One Piece were so good thanks largely to the music.

The humor can sometimes come across better in the anime as well.  Died during the Sogeking song.

thanks man! .. you're really helpful. i just downloaded it.. and it is AWESOME!!! 
>> ARTICLE
and was it worth it?
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely worth it. The story was pretty slow at first but I got pretty hooked up starting at episode 30 I think.
>> ARTICLE
Okay cool.  Maybe I'll give it more of a try than just one episode.  I thought the first episode was rather strange.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I would say watch to at least 10 if possible. If you like it by that point then awesome! You won't want to stop. If you didn't really like it by that point (found it boring ect.) you should probably stop since you will be bored during the slower / interesting parts later on. 

There are some really good arcs in One Piece where I just can't stop watching to do normal life things but there are also slow moments and if you don't generally love the characters and their humor (important part here) you will find yourself suffering through certain points that happen inbetween the arcs you are waiting on.
>> ARTICLE
I've been at the  Punk Hazzard arc for a while now. The fighting was disapointing. And every episode named: _____ vs _____ consisted of 7 sec of fighting 7 min of talking and the rest were flashbacks of other characters and intro.

One Piece is actually pissing me off with this stalling. It was an awesome show. But now i'll just wait untill the arc is done and skate through the 50 episodes leading up to it, I'm bound to get the story on the way with all the repeats
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the advice.  I will definitely watch til episode 10 to check it out.  Do you prefer the sub or dub?
>> ARTICLE
I watch subbed because I prefer the japanese voice actors and also because I like everyone else obsessed with anime would like to learn japanese. If you don't fancy the language then dubbed might be better for you. I don't default to "You must watch it subbed or you are crazy" I just say watch whichever you prefer. 

On a side note when I watched bleach I watched like 50 ep. dubbed and then switched to subbed and it was confusing as crap due to people being called by their last name instead of first... Just a heads up if you want to swap back and forth lol

Have fun! :)
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit at least watch the crocodile arc that is some of the best shit I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, okay I will give it a try!
>> ARTICLE
The crocodile arc was so beast! Plus after that arc, the arc's tend to get  better as the series go's on, plus watch enough of the series to watch the 6th one piece film, it is so amazing, or just watch the 6th to get a taste of the later episodes without reveling too much.
>> ARTICLE
I tried twice, I got to about ep 55 ... painfully. Then I gave up. I know people say it gets better, but I just couldn't get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Same with me. I just went to the comics instead as it skips all the filler.
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga. Much better pacing.
>> ARTICLE
at the beginning you seriously have to skip the filler.  The filler is absolutely horrible.. especially that amnesia ark.  I think the amnesia ark is around the 50s..   

Look up the filler and skip it.  You can skip a few hundred episodes and save yourself the horror.  You have to really like one piece to tolerate it.

The filler was tolerable later with the slow mo guy but ya.

But... Afro Luffy!!!

Foxy? He was in the manga.

Yeah, but not nearly as much of him. Plus, in the manga you can't hear that stupid fucking laugh of his.

That's because the G8 arc was originally written for the manga but got cut out for whatever reason.

There are also episodes that takes me a long to finish because I keep on pausing it because it was very boring. But, finally I passed through all those boring arcs and after that I can finish 15 episodes or more in one day.
>> ARTICLE
so at which episode does the interesting stuff start?
>> ARTICLE
I say once they get pass alabasta is when things get very fun, there are some interesting tid bits before the new world, meeting hawkeye and getting to fight arlong. To me, watching the first parts of the series, even though it was boring, became such a great feeling over time.
>> ARTICLE
for me things really picked up at like ep 280-290, its well worth watching all the ones before that though.
>> ARTICLE
At around 80, where the "Drum Island" arc starts. That one is the first really good one, if you ask me!
>> ARTICLE
I forgot the episode, but when they get to the Nico Robin arc, that's where it really kicks off.
>> ARTICLE
Early 200's.
>> ARTICLE
Well it really depends on your point of view of things. But in my case, I think the story got very interesting starting at episode 30.

the problem with shounen is that they keep repeating the same scenes over and over again

Wait till you get to Skypiea..

Holy fuck that girls voice.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even began to watch one piece, this is from my previous experience with every shounen I watched so far (shingeki, naruto, HxH)

>> ARTICLE
Aside from Naruto. The 2 others have great pacing and is a damn masterpiece. Shingeki does the exact opposite of One Piece, Bleach and Naruto, they stopped making episodes when the caught up to the manga, not extending it.

I cant find a flaw in HxH nowadays. They move at a briskly pace and there is minimum flashbacks to previous episodes and all the "extra" is interesting character development
>> ARTICLE
I know that feel.. The first 5-6 minutes of one piece these days are the opening song and some of the clips from the last episode.
>> ARTICLE
yeah but I overlook that because I'm watching as many episodes as I want for basically nothing. These reminders and "our story thus far's" clearly were meant for a show that some people would only see once a week, or sometimes less often, on TV. It is annoying, but it is skippable, and we are still watching these shows for almost nothing.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching Bleach because of this.
>> ARTICLE
They don't actually enter the Grand Line until episode 60 something iirc. Everything up until that is character backstory essentially.

I think this term usually refers to the Big Three of Manga, not anime.  I hear this term thrown around a lot because I'm primarily a manga reader.

No, it's typically used in reference to anime, as well.

Yep, I see it thrown around in this subreddit plenty of times. 

I'm not saying that if the manga was popular, the anime is going to get popular, but that was the case for the Big Three. Chances are that if you watch anime, you at least *know* of the existence of the Big Three and how popular they are.

Bleach is an iffy member of that trio. Its popularity state-side is immense, but in japan it is not nearly as loved.

I always thought The Big Three was a term for the three anime shows that hit it big as anime became popular in the west, and Bleach was very popular in the west so I think it fits neatly

Does everyone really hate the beginning of One Piece that much? Personally, the way they introduce each crewmate is my favorite part of the anime. Especially Nami's arc.
>> ARTICLE
I love it, the story, the characters. They really introduced them well so you don't lose interest later on.
>> ARTICLE
I liked One Piece from the very beginning, because I'm not picky about how things may look "too childish" or just "odd". After all, we're watching cartoons, I'm not gonna pretend I'm too mature to enjoy the childish and "girly" stuff too. However, I still have to say One Piece turned into a lot more than it's initial impression. In comparison, the beginning may pale a bit. At the same time, I also love the beginning even more after seeing all the great parts following it.
>> ARTICLE
What about watching the *great parts following it* made the beginning seem less pale?
>> ARTICLE
MORE pale, that is. And well, it's just that when the show gives me something of bigger proportions, the stuff that used to be the biggest naturally now looks smaller. I mean, I loved the Arlong arc, but I loved the CP9 arc even more, so now the Arlong arc seems a bit more tame in comparison. It's basically the same as how your first dollar isn't all that impressive anymore after you've got a job with a steady income.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the beginning of One Piece is fantastic. Sure it gets even better later, and I *guess* you could say it's slow at first, but I have no issue with it at all.

The initial 4Kids dub really soured a lot of perceptions of it.  Even watching the original subs after witnessing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Oh right, I had pushed that unfortunate dub out of my memory. Valid point, though.

I definitely appreciate the beginning more after watching the entire series because Luffy took down all the prominent Pirates in East Blue. Also it was fun seeing how Luffy picked his crewmates. If Oda didn't spend as much time as establishing the rest of the Strawhats I don't think I would be as attached to them as I am now.

This is awesome. I just started re-watching One Piece (I watched up to about the Winter Island Arc where Chopper was introduced as a kid) and I'm loving it. I sped through 130 episodes in a little over a week.

I just hope they will be showing the dub as well, obviously not a popular opinion or a liked opinion, but I have trouble concentrating on subtitles and find it easier to watch a show for long periods of time in dub, and I don't think I could ever switch on a show that I've been attached to now.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation owns the dub rights, so I don't think CR is getting it's hands on them anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll just have to enjoy the 300 or so episodes of dub I have. Anyone know how that works? I haven't watched in years.
>> ARTICLE
Insert DVD in player and press play?
>> ARTICLE
Should have phrased that better. I know the dub isn't up to date with the current episodes of the show, are they released weekly? That's what I'm unsure of.
>> ARTICLE
They are released about 10-12 episodes a quarter as FUNimation releases the DVDs. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone born in a non-English-speaking country, I've never been bothered by subtitles. I find it extremely easy to read the subtitles and look at the images at the same time, so I think it's a matter of practice. If I were you I'd try getting more used to subtitles, because since it's limited how much stuff will get dubbed, you're also putting a limit on what you can enjoy. I'm not saying you need to stop watching dubs or anything, but for your own sake you might like broadening your horizons by getting used to watching subtitles without effort. Also, haven't they stopped dubbing One Piece? Meaning that at some point you'll have to switch to subtitles anyway..

What is the Big 3 now that Bleach (well the anime) is done?
>> ARTICLE
Well who's been saving anime the hardest lately? Kill la Kill is "big three" in my head. 
>> ARTICLE
Just call it the Big 2 and let bleach fade away into obscurity where I belongs. The manga is ending 'soon' and it's sales continue to decline.
>> ARTICLE
The last arc will get animated eventually. It's pretty good, too. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't get your hopes up. If they felt the Bleach anime was still worth the money they wouldn't have cancelled it. They would probably rather spend the money on trying to popularise a new show. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they realized how much people hate fillers, so they made a good call. Fairy Tail is on hiatus too, I'm glad they're not doing fillers right now.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. It just means that they didn't feel the anime was doing enough for tankobon/merchandise/magazine sales. The anime is not the product, it is the advertisement. Those anime typically air during prime time timeslots typically aimed at younger viewers so the filler thing isn't a huge problem in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought they weren't making the anime anymore.  
>> ARTICLE
Technically it's "on hiatus", because they don't want to run any more filler arcs.
>> ARTICLE
which is good. Sometimes I wish one piece take hiatsu too.


>> ARTICLE
One Piece is setting itself up for a Kai type run in the future. We've got to finish the main run first though.
>> ARTICLE
i would kill for one piece kai
>> ARTICLE
A group called One Pace is doing a fan project along those lines. They're calling it "Whitebeard War" and "New World". Whitebeard War runs from the end of Water 7 and is nearing the end of Thriller Bark right now, and New World runs from the time skip to a couple of episodes behind the current arc.
>> ARTICLE
im still in the 360s according to my notes. (im in the middle of several series i just write down the name and ep i left off on)
>> ARTICLE
They caught up to the manga, that's not exactly the same thing as cancelling it. The chances of them not animating the rest given the popularity of both the manga and the anime are ridiculously low. 
>> ARTICLE
Attack on titan tbh
>> ARTICLE
Bleach is... over? That's so weird to me. I just assumed it would last forever. It's like waking up one day and all the cheese in the world is gone.

Manga is still going on.

Dude, I think it's been more than a year now...we really ran out of cheese. 
>> ARTICLE
fairy tail? (although its on a pretty long hiatus)
>> ARTICLE
I think the 'Big 3' is refering to the American side of these series. Bleach is still pretty popular and ongoing (on Toonami I think).. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes. There are a lot bigger series in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Toriko is the Shonen Jump series that kind of took Bleach's place in Japan

In Japan its pretty much just One Piece at number 1 by a huge margin, and everything else fights for 2nd place.

yeah..still streaming bleach though >.<

Fairy Tail

Monogatari 2, Samurai Flamenco ^I ^wish

wow someone who actually watches Samurai Flamenco other then me?  I love that show!

Fairy Tail?

Also done (for now).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, hadn't reached that yet. At least it's not filling in between. 
>> ARTICLE
They need to get back on that STAT
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm going through fan service withdrawal. :(
>> ARTICLE
I read that it's going to continue but its caught up with the manga so they paused it for awhile.
>> ARTICLE
Its also speculated that ft will be completely rebooted with a large time skip and new characters. The manga will continue natsus arc though.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure I like that idea all that much
>> ARTICLE
I thought Bleach was taking a break so the manga artist can finish up his final arc?
>> ARTICLE
They stopped making the Tv show and fans decided it was because of many filler not making money and when the show ends tv series will restart from where it left. I don't think there has been an official announcement. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think its confirmed it will come back, but I think it's likely.
>> ARTICLE
It would be odd for them not to finish it I suppose. But I have said that about anime before that deserve a second season and never got it.

You can't call 366 episodes a season

It'll always be these 3. They represent an era in the manga industry. 

Also, if I'm not mistaken, there was never a "Big 3" before this one either, and I doubt it'll happen again.

Yes this makes me so happy, can't wait to Re-watch the series on crunchyroll.

freaking happy to see this. I really had a bad taste in my mouth from the dub way back when, so steered clear, but between this and Hunter X Hunter, ill always have anime to watch.

GG, my favorite anime is finally on crunchyroll

One Piece is God Piece, to but it blankly, i look forward to One Piece every week a lot more than Naruto.

correct.

Just in time for that 50% off Crunchyroll membership Black friday deal.

Which is all access and gets you the manga part of crunchyroll which was released yesterday :D
>> ARTICLE
Now they need Fairy Tail.
>> ARTICLE
They had Fairy Tail during its initial run, so It seems very likely they'll try to pick up the new series when it airs.
>> ARTICLE
This is really cool, recently had been watching One Piece as it airs on Toonami and it made me really want to go watch the couple hundred of episodes they skipped over. 

Hopefully they get the older episodes out soon enough ^^
>> ARTICLE
Sweet!  Now I'll be able to watch it, now to dedicate lots of time towards it... I... is this show worth the amount of time it deserves?  I'm limited to how much I watch a day - like only 4 episodes or anime every 7 days.  I kind of want to watch all of these other series beforehand that like only last 1 or 2 cours...

Ehh, I'll figure when to watch it.  I just feel overwhelmed on the amount of episodes, but I hear that they're all good....
>> ARTICLE
Just watch an episode a day or something, and if you like it, then you can be happy that it's not going to end any time soon. I have to say, I've never understood why people think it's a bad thing when shows are long. To me it's almost the same as being in a really great relationship and then thinking "Wow, this relationship is so amazing! I hope it ends tomorrow!"
>> ARTICLE
TOOK THEM LONG ENOUGH!

About fucking time

Forgive me, as I am just recently getting into anime. What are the other two shows that comprise the big 3?

Naruto and Bleach. Fairy Tail is usually held as the 4th.

'Big' 3

This is awesome. Wonder how long it'll take for the rest of the episodes to be up.
>> ARTICLE
which are the other 2 then?
>> ARTICLE
naruto and bleach
>> ARTICLE
This is great, now I can finally keep track of what episode I'm on and watch it legally. Then I can also justify paying for Crunchyroll every month even though I never use it XD
>> ARTICLE
Finally I can watch it on crunchyroll, ive been windering why they didnt have it.
>> ARTICLE
That's awesome. I started subscribing back in May and it has been worth it. I also tried a Funimation sub with the 14 free trial and first two months after that for only $3.98. Between these two, Crunchyroll covers most of the simulcasts, and Funimation has a damn fine back catalog and a lot of dubs for when I'm really too lazy to read and plus they have pretty good dubs. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn now I don't have any more excuses. Never thought I'd see the day this happened because Funi already streams it.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece, Naruto... What's the third? 
>> ARTICLE
It's Bleach.
>> ARTICLE
With "the big three" what are the other two?
>> ARTICLE
Naruto and Bleach
>> ARTICLE
Incredible news! I wonder if this is worldwide? I'm a UK viewer and I'm unsure if the selection differs depending on what country you're in. 
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll should really expand availability of more series more globally. Just checked CR as a legit streaming option here, there's literally nothing to watch in any language even on paid tiers. Ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
What are the big three? 
Sorry for being a noob :(
>> ARTICLE
One Piece, Naruto and Bleach


>> ARTICLE
I may have to subscribe if they get all the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
There's no such thing as the 'Big Three'. There's One Piece, then everything else. The concept is exclusive to the west.
>> ARTICLE
Damn you 4kids
>> ARTICLE
If the "concept is exclusive to the west", that obviously means the concept exists. So there IS such a thing as the "Big Three". Or are you saying only the Japanese have the right to rank animes?
>> ARTICLE
Was hoping it would be another current season show, but oh well
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain what crunchyroll is
>> ARTICLE
As the others stated, simulcast (same day as japan) streaming with some anime backlog.  If you do not have an account access to the simulcast is a week later and the video will have adds.

Same day and no adds with a $6/mo account. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime streaming service.

**For Free:** watch any of their anime (with ads), any time after its first week airing.

**Or Subscribe:** to watch any of their anime (even this week's episode) in HD with no ads.

Since it's officially licenced, some of the money goes to the anime studios, so you're supporting further anime development. 
>> ARTICLE
Think of hulu or netflix but  for anime. Including same day the ahow airs in Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
I know its rough, but to explain how one piece works its like this.  boring.. boring .. AMAZING .... boring .. boring ... HOLY GOD AMAZING SHED TEARS ...boring ... boring...   

The biggest reason for this, is filler, since well, the manga doesn't have that. But everytime the Anime catches up to the manga they introduce filler and recaps.  Find a guide online that skips the filler arcs and you will One Piece a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece actually isn't so heavy on fillers, though. At least not so much that they're "the biggest reason" for why you find a lot of it boring. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't quite mean it like that. And actually there is a lot more filler then you are admitting too.

List of filler:

"Summary: 50,51, 54-60, 93,98,99,101,102, 131-143, 196-206, 213-216, 220-226, 279-283, 291-292, 303, 317-319, 326-336, 382-384, 406-7, 426-429, 453-458, 492, 497-499, 506, 542, 575-578, 590

426-429 are specials relating to movie 10 which will be written by oda they are apparently linked to movie 10 but these episodes are awful

453-456 show whereabouts of the strawhats, these were shorts in the manga so they do contain new info for non manga readers."

>> ARTICLE
No, there's not a lot more filler than I am admitting to, because I didn't "admit to" anything. I just said it isn't so heavy on fillers, and I meant so in comparison with other similar shows. I did the math once, you see. I think I ended up at One Piece consisting of 28% filler, Naruto 46% and Bleach 64%. 28% is still a lot of filler, but it's not so heavy compared to other major shounens.
>> ARTICLE
You just did confirm though, that no matter how you look at "28%" is still A LOT of filler.  Its the same problem with Naruto, Bleach, and every other show of its type.  Just because one piece has less doesn't make it any less major.  Filler is always a major downside to any show.
>> ARTICLE
No, I didn't. You gave the impression that you find most of One Piece boring, with a some awesome episodes/moments here and there. Most of One Piece is NOT filler. Let's say you find 3/4 of One Piece boring. Only 1/4 of One Piece is filler, meaning there's still 2/4 of unexplained boring not accountable to filler. In other words, given your statement about how much of One Piece you find boring, filler can only account for 33% of it. Meaning the rest of what makes it boring makes up the remaining 66% of what you find boring. In other words, filler cannot be the "biggest reason" for why you find so much of One Piece boring, because it doesn't make up a large enough portion of it. You could say filler is a LARGE reason for it, which it truly is, but not the biggest. There's not enough filler in One Piece to justify blaming filler for most of One Piece being boring for you.

This explanation depends on me not having misinterpreted your first comment, though. I got the impression you found One Piece boring for the most part, which is how I can know filler can't be the biggest reason for why you find it boring, since most of One Piece is NOT filler. However, if you tried to say you only find One Piece boring some times, or maybe only half of the time, then filler can indeed be the biggest reason for why it's boring. If so, I apologize for the misunderstanding.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't find most of one piece boring.  I enjoy it.  Many others do though. And again.  Just because something has less then others doesn't mean its still not its biggest issue.  

But since you insist that I am wrong.  What is one pieces biggest issue then?

Honestly you sound like a one piece fan.  You should be taking what I say as a good thing based on how you see it.  Since filler is so little in the show (according to you) and I think its the biggest issue, that must mean all the non filler is pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I think you need to re-read my comment. It operates on the assumption that you find most of One Piece boring. The second you said you don't find most of One Piece boring, my statement turns false. In other words, you could in that case entirely justify saying fillers are One Piece biggest issue. Heck, I'd even agree with you at that point.

It's simply that of the 8 statements you made about One Piece in your original "explanation of how it works", 6 of them were negative. So I just naturally assumed that meant you found most of One Piece boring. Since that isn't the case, though, everything I said earlier does no longer apply.
>> ARTICLE
I understand the confusion.  With the way the original statement was worded.  I dont think there is more boring then non-boring, it just happened the way I typed it seemed to reinforce that I thought most of it was boring which is untrue.  I apologize for any confusion that brought with it.
>> ARTICLE
No worries. In this case, I do agree that fillers are the largest problem of One Piece. Haven't been much of it lately though, and I usually skip most of it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Aww man. Just after my subscription burned out on me.

Hold on a sec. I'll go renew it.
>> ARTICLE
So why would anyone bother paying a Crunchyroll sub when Funimation streams this for free in HD?
>> ARTICLE
Because some folks would rather watch without ads, and dislike Hulu (Funimation hosts episodes more than a week old over on Hulu).
>> ARTICLE
Just get ad-blocker. I don't see video ads on Funimation or Crunchyroll at all on their free old videos. Hulu is the only site that ad blocker doesn't work on that I've seen so far but I don't go there anymore anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Also not everyone lives in the US, so Hulu/Funi doesn't work for me if I don't use a proxy. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but just saying it says this on the crunchyroll thing for OP 

>One Piece will be available to Crunchyrolls audience in the following territories: USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.

So it isn't everywhere
>> ARTICLE
naruto one piece and whats the last big 1 ? hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Bleach is considered the last one.
>> ARTICLE
Why does people try to make others watch OP? I mean if they can't stand the length of the show let them pass it. Not everyone has to enjoy what you enjoy. I was scared of the 500+ episodes at start than a time came that I had so much free time I watched it. I did skip a few episodes but that's it. If someone really wants to watch something they will watch, don't try your hardest for someone else to like what you like.

Well there is Daisuki and a few other smaller sites competing with Crunchyroll still (and you can probably count Netflix and Hulu in there for completed series).  

Thankfully many of these series aren't exclusive, so competition can still thrive by multiple sites picking up the same titles.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Even if it were, why would you be angry about Crunchyroll being endorsed here? It's a great legal way to stream anime, so why is it a big deal if people who watch anime enjoy the site? This is almost like complaining about how people keep buying the DVD's/Blu-Ray's of Game of Thrones over at /r/gameofthrones..

on one hand, I wonder if its good for one company to have such a large share of desirable IPs without any real competition

on the other hand, I don't want to see this like hulu and netflix and whatever the 3 other sites are all trying to pry money out of us
>> ARTICLE
Ahh One Piece, or as I like to call it 'one filler episode after another'.
>> ARTICLE
Still significantly better than Bleach or Naruto filler
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that instead of devoting entire episodes of filler (which people can then skip), they integrate the filler into the canon episodes, stretching out the content so that each episode has the content of a single manga chapter. 

Without all the filler to stretch for time, they could consolidate down to a tight, entertaining 7-8 minutes per chapter, which might be more pleasant to watch, but doesn't agree with the television industry's mandate for 30-minute programming blocks. 
>> ARTICLE
You have just crushed my dreams.  I was just about to look for a list of filler episodes to skip and give the show a shot.  
>> ARTICLE
It's better at the beginning.  It's only when they catch up to the manga in later arcs that they start doing the stretching.
>> ARTICLE
To me that's even worse, because then I have to sit through 15 minutes of filler every episode. I'd rather just skip the filler episodes entirely.
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the manga but I saw that they changed the Grizzly Magnum in the anime and that seemed so dumb to me.
>> ARTICLE
I heard some reports that they fixed the Grizzly Magnum scene in the recap of the following episode (removing Ceasar's moment of resistance).

Yay, finally!

Yeah, but no BeBop...

So does this mean it won't be on Hulu anymore?

What if you don't watch the so called big 3? What if you want a streaming service for watching older titles like Netflix does for movies?

HULU has a very strong back catalog of Funimation titles. Many with dubs if you like that sort of thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I prefer subs. Thanks for the heads up. I might cancel my crunchyroll for a bit and try out hulu plus. 

Edit: nvm, remembered why I cancelled hulu plus. Awful video quality and ads at a higher monthly price. 
>> ARTICLE
Plus is a waste of $ unless you really want same day streaming of broadcast shows. You can get the whole back catalog without paying for plus. 

Fwiw - if you use XBMC there's a way to turn off commercials in the Hulu plugin. That's what I do ;)

Installed xbmc, but couldn't get any addons to work. Will poke around more with it later. Thanks for the info.

Really? People really call this and two other piece of shit anime "The Big 3"?

Really annoying that the most watched anime are the 3 most annoying I can think of. Doesn't help that they're shonen.

>  Also, Enel wasnt even completely defeated. He escaped with the weapon to continue his plan later on

He's on the Moon btw, and he's completely bonkers now.
>> ARTICLE
>Water 7 is also the arc when most of the heroes got a power up out of seemingly nowhere. There was no training involved, no epiphany to something they hadnt realized up until that point. 

Except where Luffy learns Gear Second and Third because of the epiphany he had after getting wrecked by Admiral Aokiji that he needed to get a lot stronger if he wanted to protect his friends, cause even if they aren't as strong as him, he has to get stronger so they can still travel together.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm unlike you I liked the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arc, it had an unique flair and some of the best fights of the series. True it suffers from writing weaknesses, but the presentation made it neglectable for me. 

One of my current issues with One Piece is that the story makes Luffy always run around chasing something for an endless amount of time since the Impel down arc.

This series needs to calm down and have the crew explore the world together like in the old times. Instead we always get this hectic chasing and running with literally no pause and time for anything else.

The fights aren't as exciting and luck-luster too. The characters got indeed stronger, but as a result we rarely see good choreographed fights anymore. It's just more about everyone using their flashy abilities than exciting martial arts. That is why I like the water 7 arc as it had fantastic fights.

The Marineford arc could also be handled much better.
It was the arc on a huge scale with great hype, but the fights here were consisting of just short cut-scenes where nobody did anything. In the end the fights in the arc wasn't as nearly as great as I expected them to be.

Whitebeard's pirate crew literately did zero damage to the Marines and the Shichibukais. They felt completely overpowered. The whole arc structure was a mess, where Luffy fought random enemies one after another without really defeating them. Sometimes it felt that they just disappeared for some unknown reason.

The arc was really subpar until Luffy reached Ace, where the fantastic conclusion began.

Just my 2 cents about my own frustration with One Piece. Overall I am still hoping for the series to pick up again after the end of the current arc.

>> ARTICLE
>This series needs to calm down and have the crew explore the world together like in the old times. Instead we always get this hectic chasing and running with literally no pause and time for anything else.

This I could agree  Op is taking itself way to seriously again what happen to the adventures and stop overs ? I could read other shounen if all I want is fight and fight. OP was famous for its adventure that even the fillers in the anime was enjoyable and part of the pirate experience 
>> ARTICLE
>Of course the show cant openly admit that, so it uses the cheap excuse of Nakama power! Its all ok if you do it to help your friends. Because thats what friends do, they help each other out no matter what happens. Just dont think too much how Luffy is accidentally befriending only good people, otherwise he would be aiding the bad guys just because they gave him food or something. He sure doesnt think if what is going on is right or wrong. He just punches the solution out of someones bruised body, and doesnt want to be a hero, because heroes share their meat.

Yeah youre trying to tell me that luffy would have helped crocodile, or Wapol, or Hody Jones if he hadnt have become friends with Vivi, Chopper, or Shiraishi? Out of all the things you said, this was by far the stupidest. Luffy becomes friends with people *because* they're good people.

Also, Luffy's not as stupid as you paint him. Do you remember when luffy puched vivi when she was being naive about trying to make sure no one gets hurt? Isn't that the opposite of what your everyday idealistic shounen MC is supposed to do? I think luffy is one of the best shonen MCs simply because while he gives of an air of being a complete idiot, when it comes to it, he actually knows what the fuck hes talking about. He also doesnt say stupid bullshit like "i do it because im a hero" or "ive come to make you pay for your crimes". He beats the shit out of people because
A: theyre assholes or B: because they fucked with his friends. If those arent good reasons to take actions, then what the fuck are?
>> ARTICLE
> He beats the shit out of people because A: theyre assholes or B: because they fucked with his friends. If those arent good reasons to take actions, then what the fuck are?

He beats the crap out of assholes, where assholes are those who mess with his friends, where friends is anyone who is going after his dreams. All major villains have their dreams too.
>> ARTICLE
If you keep calling people OPtards (or any other name) and whatnot for disagreeing with your opinion rather than calling people OPtards (or whatnot) for being immature and annoying human beings, then you're gonna sound more and more like an asshole.... which might be your goal, idk.
>> ARTICLE
It's so great to see One Piece get this kind of recognition here! 
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't really belong here tho, it's so huge it has it's [own sub] (/r/onepiece) (Yes it's an anime, but you wouldn't discuss league of legends on /r/gaming) 
>> ARTICLE
Why wouldn't someone discuss lol on gaming? A lot of anime have their own subs, this isn't r/oneseasonanime or r/underratedanime, I think it's good that the biggest current one isn't just getting slammed because it's so popular. 
>> ARTICLE
The question isn't why wouldn't you, the question is why would you. The lol sub is one of the biggest on reddit, Post game threads of regular lcs games make Front Page numerous times, content, pbe Patches, fanart (even that has it's own sub)  or the new dunkey montage. The /gaming sub would be spilled with lol things which many ppl there wouldn't care about, and they would complain that they don't see the binding of Isaac, the new might and magic etc on the frontpage but a Post Match discussion from lol. 

An anime discussion over one piece fits just better in /r/onepiece because the people who actively watch it are their. This only suits for rather big animes ofc
>> ARTICLE
You may have a point, but this isn't just any One Piece post. This isn't a Luffy fan art, or a discussion about a specific character, or a video of a scene from one of the episodes. This is a retrospective post about the entire show, analyzing One Piece's place in anime culture and why it isn't what non-fans might think it is, which is more relevant to the non-One Piece community than it is to the people who already know everything about One Piece.

All Logic aside Water 7/Enies Lobby  is by far the best OP arc for me its one of the most enjoyable and one of the best arc for me in any shounen since everything I was looking for a shounen is that arc .

I get new crew member,Death of a ally (even if its a thing) , Usopp vs Luffy , Robin deciding if she really wants to be part of the crew for good , power ups , new bounty that introduce the crew to the whole world famously , Strong Main villain .

Really this is still the best arc for me all the arc after time skip  has been very average the ongoing major arc has been dragging forever although the best of the time skip arcs.

no

that sucks, i usally don't like training arcs but at least they make later episodes make sense 
>> ARTICLE
Good read. I agree with most of what you said, except the last two paragraphs. But ultimately, I can't say I care too much. While what you said wasn't wrong and certainly an interesting opinion and analysis, I wasn't too bothered with it. I still think One Piece is going strong despite the rampant fanservice and incredibly slow pacing.  
>> ARTICLE
The Climax of the show was the Arlong arc. Afterwards i never cried to any other part of one piece.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I really liked your review. It's true that a lot of it is recaping of the series, but there is no real way to review the entirety of OP without speaking about each major saga.

I agree with you in almost everything, especially the complete lack of character development, even though I've grown to love this characters, it's really frustrating to think on how many shit they have lived through, and yet they are exactly the same as when they joined the crew.

To be honest, I haven't watched a single anime episode since the start of the dresrossa arc, and now I prefer reading the manga as it covers the same, or even more than an anime episode and it takes 5 times less time.

I also agree that the series hasn't get better and better like everyone loves to say, but I don't think it felt really hard until the timeskip, I personally enjoyed Water 7 and Thriller Bark, and found the latter to be pretty funny and entertaining, and, as you said, Marineford completely broke how the series had been working until that point, which was pretty awesome. Since the timeskip I would agree that the series has been a complete mess.

That being said, and considering what you said about the series getting worse and worse, I want to ask you if you would you say it was "worth it".
>> ARTICLE
It was worth it for making this analysis
>> ARTICLE
(continued)

It sticks out even further, when you have such an imaginative setting, where every island is its own little world, and has different challenges. You would expect the crew to be adjusting to every situation, doing things differently every time. But they dont, with a few exceptions the only thing they are using is brute force. Which is a major contrast to what the bad guys are doing. Every big boss has this master plan that he is carefully preparing for years. And yet we get stuff like the characters arrive, they brainlessly separate, and with no real plan they just storm in at the end, and stop the villain simply because they are stronger. It gives you the impression brains are evil because only the villains are planning ahead, and that might is right because that is all it takes to solve any problem. They are even going as far as showing Luffy falling asleep or not paying attention, or having a headache when someone tries to sound serious and talk in a rational way. Yeah, its played for laughs but it sure doesnt take away the fact that good guys hate smart things.  

Of course the show cant openly admit that, so it uses the cheap excuse of Nakama power! Its all ok if you do it to help your friends. Because thats what friends do, they help each other out no matter what happens. Just dont think too much how Luffy is accidentally befriending only good people, otherwise he would be aiding the bad guys just because they gave him food or something. He sure doesnt think if what is going on is right or wrong. He just punches the solution out of someones bruised body, and doesnt want to be a hero, because heroes share their meat.

And this is why the fifth part felt like such a big subversion for everything that was making One Piece formulaic so far. The Marineford battle is a time of major loss for Luffy. Not only he gets separated from the rest of his crew, not only he is much weaker than the navy admirals and the pirate leaders, but he also fails to save his own brother. Also, for the first time after 500 episodes, we have deaths of major characters. So far, it was only happening with minor characters in flashbacks, or it was just redshirts nobody cares about. The main characters all have uncanny durability that makes them survive even nuclear explosions, and all it takes to heal fatal injuries, is to eat a lot of food for a couple of days. We were so accustomed to seeing nobody important dying, that when it actually happened, we couldnt believe it. This is what made it a major highlight, of the likes we hadnt seen since Arabasta. 

With that said, this arc wasnt exactly superb either. Pacing and budget went to shit, fan service was increased ten times, and they introduced a hundred characters that seem to be important but we never got much screen time on any of them. It felt like a poor excuse to create a huge roster for future fighting games. 

Unfortunately, what followed Marineford was the exact opposite of what made it so interesting. The sixth part, commonly known as Dressrosa, still ongoing at the time I am making this topic, is everything that was going wrong with the show, times ten. Starting with a time skip, which is the worst thing you can do to any story if you want to destroy its continuity, the crew gets together once again, now more powerful than ever. Which means nothing since there is still zero character development, and turns out they were separated so the navy wont capture them. Meaning, what was a tragic event, is now presented as a great thing because they escaped and returned stronger. And it was all bullshut. Despite all the drama and suffering they went through, Usopp is still the same coward, Luffy is still the same retarded comedian, and everybody else still repeats the same crap from a decade ago. Oh yea, the skeleton now sings, the swordsman lost an eye, and the thief girl now wears even less clothes than before. Such great character development. 

The plot also took a nosedive into mediocrity, rehashing stuff we already saw before, with far less appeal and thought put into them. I mean, how many princesses that need help has Luffy encountered so far? Vivi was decent back in Arabasta. The rest of them are half naked bimbos. And they keep introducing characters by the hundreds, without ever spending more than ten minutes on any of them. And why is getting Aces devil fruit so damn important? Its not his soul; its a damn superpower. He didnt invent it; he was simply the last guy who possessed it. Someone else had it before him, someone else will have it after him. Stop making it seem like its the most important thing in the world. 

Not even the huge revelation was handled well. A childhood friend of Luffy returns alive and well, but the reunion didnt last more than a few seconds. This was supposed to be a super emotional moment and they breezed over it. Oda is otherwise wasting dozens of episodes in fights amongst people we dont give a crap about.   

So to sum it up, One Piece is a shonen, so of course its going to be immature and unrealistic. But its also 700 episodes long, and is nowhere near completion. It has become far worse since it began, and yet its still by far the best long running shonen of all times. Yes, the rest are even worse. I am very pleased with how good it was for hundreds of episodes and sad to see how low it has fallen, because at this point it just exists to make money. Oda doesnt need to try anymore; he is going to make lots of money no matter what bullshit he makes. All he needs to do is keep introducing characters, have all the girls being half naked with huge bouncing boobs, and keep the story as slow as possible so he can milk the OPtards (who still think it only gets better and better) until the end of time. 

I personally got sick and tired of it. I am still occasionally marathoning everything that comes out and all I feel is like I wasted 10 hours for a mediocre plot that could fit in 3 episodes. Most others still follow it because it is too late to drop it now, plus it gives them lots of effortless views when they make episodic reviews of it. So have fun while it lasts you tasteless casuals, because its not ending any time soon. Also, no matter what the hell is One Piece, nobody is going to like it. It has been hyped for far too long to properly satisfy anyone once it is revealed. Deal with it.

Just a quick question, do you only consider the Bleach and Naruto series when you say "long running shounen", or is DBZ, HxH etc. all included as well? Not of any importance, just for clarification.
>> ARTICLE
He includes DBZ I'm sure but he likes HxH
>> ARTICLE
I was just wondering, since there are quite a few shounen, but I'm not sure where we draw the line for "long running"
>> ARTICLE
Those were long running, but he only mentions Bleach and Naruto because Bleach, Naruto and One Piece were/are the most popular of the 21st century for long running shounen and 2 of them are still going and Naruto only recently ended. While Dragonball has been done since the mid 90s and even though HxH has been going on since '98, it's had long hiatuses multiple times since 2005, so it kind of forces itself out of consideration because it stops and starts at random times.
>> ARTICLE
There are long shonen and there are loooong shonen. The Big Three belong in the latter category. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks for clearing that up! I liked the write-up.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't really consider HxH (2011) to be a long shounen series since it's only 148 episodes and already completed. That's just me though.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough 
>> ARTICLE
>Crocodile, Enel and Magellan were superb, both in imposing presence and in cool powers.  
  
FTFY
>> ARTICLE
yeah Magellan, in my eyes, was more of a threat than anyyyyyone in the Marineford arc until ~~Aokiji~~Akianu destroyed Ace. We actually get to witness his strength as he single handedly stops a prison break full of level three prisoners. He was a final boss worthy character that was relegated to mini-boss status
>> ARTICLE
> Although One Piece is considered to be one of the big three, in reality there is no big three. In Japan, it wipes the floor with Naruto and Bleach in terms of popularity and sales.

This is really a stupid point. It doesn't matter if one monster is bigger than the other, the point of the name they had was they were massive and made money. They were the three big fish in the shounen game. 

So One Piece is larger than the two others, that doesn't take away from the size of the other two
>> ARTICLE
I think you have to say in terms of long running animation, One piece has done an exceptional job. The worst arc in one piece can still measure up to the best of other series, I understand the frustration with long running anime.
When I started the show from ep1 I could not believe this show was not recommended more often.It was so good and felt every emotion a human could feel and I wanted more ,God knows what I would have given for a non-stop supply of one piece.
 But in reality this kind of show is only enjoyable with a 20 episode gap, read the manga for your fix.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Aren't you the guy who labels people as pretentious overthinkers and you write this? Double standards much? 
>> ARTICLE
I think we should make it an offence in /r/anime to criticize One Piece!
>> ARTICLE
I respect you for taking the time to write this out but if you don't like it, just don't watch it. Expressing your opinions are fine too but there's also no point in shitting on other people's tastes. It just makes you sound like a condescending douche and an elitist.  
>> ARTICLE
> condescending douche and an elitist.

That's kinda what he is :p He doesn't exactly try very hard to hide it but his opinions are accurate
>> ARTICLE
wouldn't call it that accurate tbh, he leaves out an awful lot of stuff just to confirm his own opinion.

Skypia for example WAS about the dream of a man, [the will of a pirate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXUFfoI9Rhc) . Chopper considered himself finally as a pirate etc. Skypia is a myth for ppl on earth, a lie from the north blue, a children story. The straw hats shouldn't get recognised for it after, gold roger wasn't either.

Calling the powerup for the cp9 random is just wrong as hell. They met Aokiji before they were on water 7, and got their ass beaten from the admiral. After that you see them train (especially zorro).

All of them worked on their powers, and had a good reason to.

ace devil fruit is pretty fklin important for ruffy, it's the last thing that's left from him, the paper(forgot the real name) is burned, pretty obvious that for a rather simple man like luffy the fruit is huge...

Luffy actually goes through quite a bit off charakter development (punching the tenriyubuto on sabaody for example) and seeing how weak he is vs Bartholomus Br.

I didn't like the shadow isles arc, but leaving out Zorro and Br and Sanji from the end of it is kinda weird.

OP just got older and the anime doesn't fit his style anymore, easy as that. There were always weak arcs (davy back fight, east blue apart from the arlong arc) but there are great arcs aswell (dressrosa would be the best arc in the series if the pacing was a little better, fishman island was terrible aswell, punk hazard was quite good actually). 
One piece doesn't run because it wants to be finished, it takes to a journey, some may grow out of it (for good reasons), some don't (for good reasons)
>> ARTICLE
But... opinions can't be accurate? More like, opinions formed from accurate information, which he does inconsistently.
>> ARTICLE
I hate his elitist style and the way he calls people "plebs" and so on, but I think this review was pretty spot on, and I don't really think he really disrespected anybody. I've been a huge OP fan for years, and I think that, today, I like the series far more than he does, but I didn't find any of his arguments or sentences in **this** review to be offensive.
>> ARTICLE
What are you talking about, this post looks reasonable to me especially compared to his older posts and btw I hate the "if you don't like it, don't watch it" sentiment, which contributes nothing to the argument and discussion, but a passive aggressive way to avoid the criticism.
>> ARTICLE
There is no argument here. I'm simply saying that if he dislikes it this much then what's the purpose of continuing the series, especially if its about 700 episodes long. There's no reason someone has to subject themselves to that, it's literally a waste of one's life. 
>> ARTICLE
When you're a fan of a series, you're going to follow it no matter how low it can get.
>> ARTICLE
Just like being a CLG fan amirite 


...no thread is safe
>> ARTICLE
Hey it could be worse; I could be a Maple leafs fan.
>> ARTICLE
Who cares if he watches it or not, it's his own decision, let him do what he wants, but the criticism still stands. I hate when people try to argue with this every time someone voices criticism towards a show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched 70 episodes, got bored, and never picked it up again.

I have very low tolerance for those types of shows though so take my opinion with a grain of salt
>> ARTICLE
I think I went to the same theme park two years ago when I visited Japan. I'm not a OP fan, but seeing the ship was pretty cool. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/1y2n3) an album of some of the pictures I took while there. They had a huge giftshop full of OP items inside one of the buildings, including fuzzy Chopper Mickey-Mouse-like hats.

The pictures are really high quality, so they may take a while to load.

EDIT: The boat/ship itself had some life-sized or pretty close to life-sized recreations of the characters you could take your picture with. Of course, getting on the ship itself required a fee.
>> ARTICLE
Sanji really looks like Spike Spiegel.
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember what the fee was? Like was it cheap like 500 yen or most costful like 1500-2000 yen?
>> ARTICLE
iirc, the One Piece boat ride is part of the Huis Ten Bosch area/theme park?.  I think you need to purchase a pass into the place and then a pass for the ride, which is 1000 yen. 600 yen for children.  Some info here: http://english.huistenbosch.co.jp/enter_muse/entertainment.html
>> ARTICLE
I think it was at least 1000 yen? But definitely no more than 2000. It'd be a cool once in a life-time experience for any OP fan, I'm sure.

@ Huis Ten Bosch theme park.
>> ARTICLE
I've never watched one piece, but judging from the picture of all the characters, it looks crazy.
>> ARTICLE
Crazy doesn't even cut it. 
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend it.  I've never seen a show that's such an emotional roller coaster.  In the span of a few episodes, it can go from gleefully adventurous to ominous and foreboding, then from there to victoriously uplifting, immediately follow that up with mournful and depressing, then work its way back to off-the-wall silly and back to adventurous.  It's happened more than a few times.  The best part of all that?  None of it feels even remotely out of place.

On top of what I described above, the show is meticulously well-planned, with events and characters referred to or hinted at over *500* chapters ago coming up and being relevant in a big way--so much so that the 4Kids English dub (good riddance) got itself into trouble when it skipped over chunks of the story.  If you're going to watch it, I'd recommend either fansubs or the Funimation dub...the 4Kids one will only sour you on the experience.

EDIT: Also, skip the filler if you end up watching the series.  It's not hard to google which episodes to skip, and it'll drastically reduce the time it takes to catch up on the series.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, isn't 4kids the one that did all those weird censors? Like bullets to poison suction-cup darts and I think they changed all the rice balls in Pokemon to donuts.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it's *much* worse than that.  They decided that, despite the increasingly darker (yet true to form, still whimsical) vibe of the show as the series went on, they needed to market the entire show around Chopper.  Obviously, Chopper is cute, so they decided that the show needed to be marketed to elementary school children or something.  And since he wasn't in the show for the first 80 episodes, they decided that they needed to do what they could to get there quickly.  You can see where this went horribly, horribly wrong.

First, they decided to edit out any and all blood and firearms.  This made the fight scenes decidedly less impactful, not to mention make a crapton less sense (at one point they edited a pistol to look like some kind of Looney Tunes-esque hammer-on-a-spring contraption...I can't make this stuff up).  Next, they decided that Sanji was too young to smoke.  Granted, that's more of a TV regulation issue, but they really didn't need to make it a lollipop...that was just ridiculous.  After that, they thought it would be a good idea to remove just about all of the text from the show, since apparently reading is evil.  Everything that once had words on it (even English words) was now blank.  Except the Marines logo, for some reason, which was changed to say Navy unnecessarily.

When they decided that it was taking too long to get to the oh-so-marketable Chopper, they decided it would be a great idea to skip episodes.  But do they skip the ripe-for-the picking filler arcs? No, they figure it's best to remove a canon plot-relevant arc and completely screw themselves over for when it's referenced down the line (especially since it wasn't even that much later).

I could go on, but you get the idea.  As you can see, the 4Kids dub is something One Piece fans generally tend to have a strong dislike for.  I haven't even gotten into how they picked horrible stereotypical voices or really clumsily edited out deaths.  The whole thing was just a cash grab by 4Kids that they didn't even properly look into to see if it fit their audience in the first place.  Thank God Toei revoked their rights to it and gave them to Funimation.  It's just a shame the series got such a negative reception in the West compared to what it should have gotten all due to a poor localization.

Anyways, I digress.  I guess all I'm trying to say is that you should watch One Piece, or at least read the manga.  It's really good.
>> ARTICLE
Okay. I definitely got the "4kids is bad" vibe so I'll avoid it should I watch the show. I'll probably check out the manga though, since I usually read through it first, then watch it (did it with bleach and fma). 

Thanks for the heads up though.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I went a little overboard.  I just can't stand how much they butchered it.  Enjoy the series!  :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha, no I understand completely. It sucks seeing something that was cool, done in a bad way.

Anyways, I'll definitely check it out soon. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
You have no idea; the main characters are among the **least** crazy of the cast.
>> ARTICLE
Except Sanji. Sanji is one crazy motherfucker. Naaaaaami-swaaaaaan!!!
>> ARTICLE
Franky is pretty off-the-wall as well.  I really like that the main cast is so whimsical, though.  It really gives the series a bit of a Disney-esque feel, in that even when the subject matter is heavy (like slavery or racism) or the circumstances are dire (the Marineford Arc), it's still accessible to pretty much all audiences and can be simultaneously enjoyed by children and their parents, and everyone in between.  Kind of like how to this day I can still enjoy Aladdin, regardless of whether or not I had watched it as a child.  It's just really well put-together.

It's definitely worth it. But bear in mind it's nearing 540 episodes now, so space it out appropriately. And the quality of the drawing itself improves quite a bit as it goes on (though I don't have a nice comparison image available right now).

Best One Piece Filler arc - holy freakin' Marineford. ammmIright?
>> ARTICLE
Worst thing I ever considered to be filler in One Piece was the arc where he battled the fat guy that stole pirate flags and turned into lava. Luffy was so fucking weak at the beginning of that arc, and the art style was different during it....much more outrageous.

Rewatching it compared to newer arcs or more serious arcs and you'll see it was absolutely terrible.

Davy Back Fight was canon and only half filler.

Not one was during the Arlong arc.
>> ARTICLE
Hm. Saishuu Heiki no Kanojo was a tearfest for me and I don't even really know why. I was bawling at even minor character deaths.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until [Luffy fights Crocodile](/spoiler). Your jaw. On the ground. Shall.
>> ARTICLE
Yes when that happened I began considering it one of the greatest series of all time. Should've seen it coming after Zoro vs Mihawk though.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of envy you watching them for the first time. I remember finally being like, "Aw, wtf. I'll give this one a try." And then it was like episode 5 or something and I was entirely smitten even then. I felt betrayed. Like: "HOW COME NO ONE TOLD ME THIS IS AMAZING?!"
>> ARTICLE
You have some more great times ahead of you in this anime :P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I almost cried when i watched that. Just so you know, there are sadder scenes ahead.
>> ARTICLE
One of which involves an inanimate object, but reduced me to manly tears.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Yeah, I thought I was more than prepared for whatever One Piece could throw at me after watching things like After Story, but man, I am thoroughly impressed... I haven't quite matched that level of tears yet from One Piece (Nothing makes me cry more than Lion King or After Story, and they're tied), but at this point I won't be surprised if I end up beating my old record.
>> ARTICLE
How far are you in One Piece?
>> ARTICLE
Well I ended up staying up an extra 3 hours or so last night just to finish the fight with Arlong.
>> ARTICLE
Oh you have so many good times ahead.
>> ARTICLE
Alas, today I have reading I have to do for school. Stalinist Russia is not anywhere near as entertaining as more One Piece :(
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until Stalin gets the communist fruit...
>> ARTICLE
You mean the Commie Commie Fruit
>> ARTICLE
It has the power to kill millions of your own nation and not give a damn about it.
>> ARTICLE
Judging from the other posts by OP, it seems he/she's still at Arlong Park.

OP's going to have a blast from now onward, right guys?!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda jealous. I'd love to go through the experience again without knowing what is coming up. 
>> ARTICLE
When are they going to release some kind of brain eraser so that we can watch our favorite anime several time and enjoy them like the first time !?
>> ARTICLE
I'm suddenly reminded of a joke from Red Dwarf where Holly has all Agatha Christie wiped from his memory.
>> ARTICLE
[It's funny how one of the saddest scene in One Piece is when an inanimate object "dies," I'm talking about Merry Go of course.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
It made me lose it too. Nobody else mentioned it so far, but I cried the most on that scene.
>> ARTICLE
["I was so happy!"  I couldn't stop crying.  T.T](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Same here.  I usually read the manga, but I had to watch the anime of this.  Was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah shit man, the whole thing leading up to that was so sad :(
>> ARTICLE
During Sanji's Backstory;

[It was disturbing watching him slowly starve to death on that small island.] (/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
That did mess with me more than I thought it would. 
>> ARTICLE
Sanji's the cook right? His backstory is so fucked up.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he is.
>> ARTICLE
the whole way his relationship with owner Zeff is depicted is pure genius.
>> ARTICLE
Especially since in the manga, [Zeff had to eat his leg to stay alive, instead of just losing it while the ship sank.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
holy shit, Is that true? thats pretty bad ass. What other parts of the anime have been softened? 
>> ARTICLE
Edit: [Instead of losing half his mustache while fighting Akainu, Whitebeard loses half of his head.](/spoiler) Marineford arc spoiler.

>> ARTICLE
I will never let leftovers spoil again.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is quite a ride. So much imagination and, well, heart. 
>> ARTICLE
I cried horribly when [they lost their ship.](/spoiler) Anyone that remembers that knows what I'm talking about and I know that it was slightly silly but I thought it was so sad. [That ship fought until the bitter end for them T_T](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
The ending theme around that time frequently got to me, but I watched it every time.
>> ARTICLE
Just when [Merry apologised for not being able to carry them any longer D': so many tears](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
All I could think was [rest sweet ship, you deserve it.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still cry when i watch that episode even though I've seen it at least 10 times.
>> ARTICLE
Wait until you get to Robin's story....
>> ARTICLE
"I WANT TO LIVE!" 

Damn, goosebumps.
>> ARTICLE
My body was not ready
>> ARTICLE
Dara-shee-shee-shee.
>> ARTICLE
*Oka-saan...*

*I just wanted to hold your hand like the other kids...*
>> ARTICLE
Or Chopper's, for that matter. Truly heart-breaking.
>> ARTICLE
dude how could you not have known One Piece has some of the saddest moments in shounen? i feel like every arc there is at least one thing that happens that makes it's readers cry the manliest of tears.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I love this arc, along with a bunch of the others posted here. However, one moment hasn't been posted is [Hiruluk's Cherry Blossoms.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
I think 4KIDS influence on One Piece has a bigger impact than people think. I thought it was just some show for little kids until I read some reviews and saw people on the internet's opinions. Started watching it and couldn't stop. 470 episodes without watching anything else. Easily one of my favorite series. 
>> ARTICLE
When I first saw the 4Kids version, I thought it looked pretty cool. 7 years later and One Piece is still my favorite manga!
>> ARTICLE
Weren't 4KIDS the ones who replaced Sanji's cigarettes with lollipops?
>> ARTICLE
get used to it, i'ma  full grown man that looked like a 5 year old girl watching some one piece stuff..... too stronk! :P
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to say that One Piece is amazing. It is probably the only anime that can make me laugh and cry in 20 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
Many manly tears will be shed.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much every flashback in OP will reduce you to a blubbering mess.
>> ARTICLE
"Luffy....*sob*.... HELP ME!!!!!!"

>> ARTICLE
It was so much more graphic in the manga...I was 12,I was not ready for it ._.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the backstories made me, a tough lumberjack of a man, tear up. Just wait till you get to Water 7 (*'-')~
>> ARTICLE
[Luffy versus Usopp](/spoiler) was one of the best fights in the show.  And even better, it gave us Sogeking!
>> ARTICLE
[So relevant!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=VNyP3uzgRhA#t=14s)
>> ARTICLE
that is the brilliance of One Piece. It looks childish as all get out - but it's more than that. It's inventive and the characters are so genuinely fond of one another that it's infectious. I pity the fool who dismisses OnePiece as stupid. It's silly, but it's the awesome kind of silly.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this arch.  Here's my [favorite](http://youtu.be/RcGEqbmCU28) scene of this arch, and possibly one of my top 5 favorite scenes in One Piece so far.
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite scenes in ANIME so far.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is awesome, only draw back to it is that it's a slow moving (story wise) anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I prefer reading the manga. The anime sometimes has these unnecessary moments where nothing really happens.
>> ARTICLE
Like when they spend eight episodes recapping everything because they had caught up with the manga?
>> ARTICLE
I hate those! Not to mention how every episodes needs an intro on what's going on, which takes up to 3 miutes of the episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but One Piece doesn't have ending songs anymore, does it?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, just preview of the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not as bad as it used to be

LAST TIME, ON DRAGON BALL Z!
>> ARTICLE
LOL yep, and it's the same studio too.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece can be pretty campy at times, but there's plenty of times when shit get's real. Love it.
>> ARTICLE
I like to look at one piece as a comedy that is punctuated by some of the most poignant drama I've seen in an anime. A lot of the characters are down right wacky, but they all have interesting and almost always heart-breaking back-stories.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't planning on crying today.
>> ARTICLE
I actually reread those chapters today. Manly tears were shed.
>> ARTICLE
OH GOD WHY DID I CLICK THE PICTURE 
>> ARTICLE
As you advance in episodes, you will begin to call Oda GOD
>> ARTICLE
Damn you people! I had decided not to follow another looong anime since I already follow Naruto (fillers and all) and I dropped Case Closed after ~160 episodes, but noooo, you had to come here and tell me how bad ass and awesome One Piece is... DAMN YOU ALL!!!!

[starts watching]
>> ARTICLE
I advice you drop Naruto. I watched the entire series and a good chunk of shippuuden before I realised it wasn't really worth it. It pales in comparison to One Piece. 
>> ARTICLE
You will thank us one day.
>> ARTICLE
I just started rereading the series, realised just how incredible the first bunch of chapters was. Everything up to Skypeia is just pure gold. And after that there's alot of incredible arcs as well. 

The consistency of how good this manga is, after more than 650 chapters just goes to show what a genius Oda is for writing this.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, that moment got me completely hooked. That arc..

"Luffy, Tasukete." "Atari mai da!"
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you don't go to the one piece subreddit untill youre caught up. But by god there are much more moments like those coming up. Happy and Sad
>> ARTICLE
Oh, you will, cry, just wait until the ~450 episodes more or less.
>> ARTICLE
i can't wait to see how 4Kids works around this one
>> ARTICLE
No movie writer, director or company on this planet would have the balls to put these scenes together. 

Today, you are a man. A Blubbering, snotty-nosed man.
>> ARTICLE
Should I do a marathon of watching one piece  anime episodes ? I nvr really felt intrigued to one piece. I have powered thru fairy tail to the current episode but that was just 100 episodes and I am currently on a Hitman Reborn Marathon nearly approaching the half point mark in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Do it. Now. I've watched both FT and One Piece, and FT isn't even on the same level.
>> ARTICLE
The Arlong arc was a good one. Just a heads up, One Piece gives you incredibly evil villains that you want to see die or beaten to a pulp, but takes a long time to do so. It is totally worth it though.
>> ARTICLE
Lol that's nothing. Just wait until the Tony Tony chopper arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention Franky's arc.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait till Luffy gets his super saiyan! Badass fights ahead!
>> ARTICLE
if you think this is bad, roll on cp9!
>> ARTICLE
Oh balls, you had to go and post this. And create this thread. Arg, now I've gotta watch the whole thing. Again.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, i cried alot when, **MAJOR SPOILER** [Ace dies in that epic battle between White Beard and the navy](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is serious business. Luffy taught me everything I needed to know about nutrition.
>> ARTICLE
episode 37 by far my  favorite 

>> ARTICLE
Episode 405 is my favorite. It's the crew's last day on Saboady pre time-skip. I was not prepared. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on that. I read the manga and knew what was coming up, but that was executed so incredibly. I always hated flashbacks in One Piece, and while half of the episode was a flash-back, it worked so brilliantly. Especially at the end, [when only Robin was left and reached out for Luffy. And then when he broke down realising he couldn't save a single nakama.](/spoiler) 
>> ARTICLE
The reaction was so powerful. The despair was palpable and it was really sort of painful to watch :( then there's a filler for the next 2 episodes. I'm so glad I wasn't caught up at the time or I would have been devestated for a good 3 weeks. 
>> ARTICLE
I know... It was really quite terrible how they did those silly new year specials right after THAT imo. 
>> ARTICLE
No no, she was put in the dungeon
>> ARTICLE
You cry at least once an arc in One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
Sanji's backstory moved me more than this particular story.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to skip filler episodes (or at least know when you are watching them) the Wiki has a great color coded episode guide. 

http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_Guide
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I need to start reading this...
>> ARTICLE
Far be it from me to discourage reading, but.... WATCH. WATCH IT! Read the manga if you absolutely must inhale the entire storyline, but I cant imagine some of the most thrilling scenes without sound and motion- or better yet, the silence and stillness.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Nice timing. I'm actually watching it as we speak. It's heartbreaking to see Luffy [Covered in poison](/spoiler), Can't wait to see how things turn out after the Timeskip!
>> ARTICLE
a lot of tears were spent on this show, along with laughs and cheers
>> ARTICLE
One piece (the Japanese version) is my favorite anime! I absolutely love how much it makes you care about all of the characters. It has plenty of funny times but then times like these where I cry like a baby!!!! (Girl by the way)
>> ARTICLE
One piece gets so much more emotional than this scene.  I don't want to spoil it for you but stick with the anime, it's awesomeness level multiplies by 10^99999
>> ARTICLE
The first 80 or so episodes are pretty awesome and not your typical shounen poop
>> ARTICLE
you mean the first 130 episodes. The whole thing up to Skypeia is pure gold. I mean just after 80 episodes we get chopper's past, something that can make me cry anytime.
>> ARTICLE
One piece is an amazing anime that has a bit of everything. The only thing it's a little bit short of are cliffhangers. Which is a refreshing change because watching Bleach changes that big time for me. You won't be disappointed in One Piece. I never even noticed any fillers, if it had any.
>> ARTICLE
I pretty much cried at all the characters backstories..

Also..

THIS FUCKING THING
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyzyIapOrEk
>> ARTICLE
so badass it hurts.
>> ARTICLE
I also cried during this same episode, my dad walked into the room, and saw me crying over a 'cartoon'.
>> ARTICLE
Hngh. Enies Lobby. Cried buckets. Possibly my most favorite arc/saga in the series next to Marineford. 
>> ARTICLE
Many a random tears were shed later on in the series I love it so much.  The story just keeps getting better and it's a shame that people think it's too kiddy.  The anime matures with the people in it.
>> ARTICLE
Fansubs? These episodes are on DVD ya cheapskate, you wouldn't download a car, would you?!
>> ARTICLE
but on a DVD you don't get the fantastic decision to leave "nakama" untranslated!

(also the DVDs aren't in 720p)
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I recognise the font choice from Kaizoku-Fansubs' releases, and these are pretty early episodes, which means they were from before Kaizoku switched over to HD rips (and Arlong Park is late enough that I don't think Kaizoku has caught up to there with their blu-ray rip releases).

My first point was somewhat sarcastic, though I can understand there are people who'd prefer to keep "nakama" in as the word in Japanese has a much more intimate connotation than the usual English translation "comrade".
>> ARTICLE
I've heard that reason so many times, but if something is easily translated there's no reason to leave it untranslated. Surely they could have used "mate" or something close to that.

People go on about it having a deeper meaning so it can't be translated, that's ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
"Mate" has sexual connotations, thought its appropriateness in a naval context can't be denied, I suppose.

Well, this is why I buy my manga in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
Buying Japanese manga is probably the better route, more money going straight to the creators and Viz are inconsistent bastards who censor everything to please Wal-Mart anyway.

I'm English so I see Mate as more of a "'OW YA DOIN' MATE?" kinda way...

*Where do you get manga from? I'm stuck with either YesAsia or Amazon.co.jp and I wanna get the Fist of the North Star Kanzenban.
>> ARTICLE
I'm from Singapore (though currently in London) so I usually just go to my local Kinokuniya and buy them there for about 5 per volume.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, I live just above London, I've been meaning to go to that shop next time I go to London.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, wait, is there a Kinokuniya in London!?

*Edit*: [No, no there isn't](http://www.kinokuniya.co.jp/en/ostores.html) :(
>> ARTICLE
I think the worst is definitely [when Ace dies protecting Luffy after everything Luffy goes through to try and save him] (/spoiler). 
>> ARTICLE
this part is the best imo,  i strugled so hard to contain the rain pouring!
>> ARTICLE
Upvoted for referencing another great series.
>> ARTICLE
Major spoiler, especially for OP who is just at the late 30's/early 40's...  But, yeah...
>> ARTICLE
If this makes you cry, don't watch fairy tail.
>> ARTICLE
I think Fairy Tail EP.48 sums it all up
>> ARTICLE
Really? Why? I started watching Fairy Tail a while back but couldn't get into it for a number of reasons. I only watched up til episode 58
>> ARTICLE
I honestly think if you look at the big 4 (Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail and One Piece) Fairy tail and One piece are the ones with the most mature characterisation. To be fair I'm not sure why you didn't like it having got that far in, maybe it just isn't for you.

I must admit I don't know how to use spoiler tags in reddit because I lurk far more than I post, so for that reason I won't say any specific plot details about fairy tail. Although it's not sad in the same way one piece can be, there are a lot of bitter-sweet moments (people leaving the guild and being given the three rules e.t.c).

I suppose the point I'm trying to get at is that I feel greater attachment to the characters of fairy tail more than any of the other three, and therefore I feel a lot more empathy. This simply means that when they are so happy that they are brought to tears, I can understand it, and often feel the same way.
>> ARTICLE
One of the reasons I didn't like it was because of the underlying plot, it was pretty much non-existent (I know Natsu was looking for Salamander) but they were making little to no progress; they were just fighting among themselves (and other guilds); bringing in other random events like the clone/brother thing, whatever his name was.

I was comparing Fairy Tail to One Piece at times thinking, OP has a point to it (a goal) even if it takes them some time to get to it you know they're making progress.

I liked the music and fighting scenes in Fairy Tail though, they were thought out and played out well, unlike OP where sometimes you wonder how many laws of physics they've broken.
>> ARTICLE
Mhm, Fairy Tail isn't meant to be the classical type of shonen. It's more like the cartoons you would watch on Cartoon Network. -> No real goal or very slow pace towards goal.

I think it's doing a good job at that.
>> ARTICLE
The beginning of the series was ok, because it could make me laugh, and the Jellal character intrigued me. But after the Tower of Paradise Arc, it pretty much went downhill.
>> ARTICLE
fyi: instructions for spoiler tags are in the info bar on the right.
>> ARTICLE
I like Fairy Tail, but I think that it often tries too hard to be epic.
>> ARTICLE
It gets better but the manga is really sucky now in my opinion.

>> ARTICLE
Well we're still coming off a major arc which had a hell of a lot of pay off, so there has to be some more build up.
>> ARTICLE
There are two dubs: one by 4Kids that is heavily censored and another by Funimation that is not. 

I recommend the Funimation dub. It's very, very good. The highlight of the series is Krillin as Usopp. Yusuke Urameshi also shows up a couple hundred episodes in, an that was fun. I also think Fuhrer Bradley shows up. You might even recognize some people that I didn't. 

Funimation spared no expense on One Piece. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I didn't put Usopp and Krillin as the same voice actor. Thank you for making me feel stupid for 312 episodes lol.
>> ARTICLE
I <3 Funimation. 
>> ARTICLE
They really do a great job, don't they?
>> ARTICLE
Too good a job, in my opinion. Now I can't bear to watch the subs because I'm too used to the English voice actors, so I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs until the next batch of dubbed episodes is released.
>> ARTICLE
Every time I find a series that Funimation has touched I devourer it, once I discovered something that I had not seen I think it was 3x 24/6 ep series needless to say I did not sleep for a day or 2 ... 

Hope that one day my silly brain will start to understand anime fully so I would not need the subs tho eh. 
>> ARTICLE
Zoro is voiced by Vegeta/Piccolo. 
>> ARTICLE
He does sound like Piccolo!
>> ARTICLE
Funimation has a dub of it that's not censored and is really good in my opinion. But when you get to the higher episodes you have to switch from dub to sub because it's not dubbed in sync with the sub.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not quite sure how far the dub goes, but once you get addicted to One Piece and want to keep on watching, suddenly switching from dub to sub can be horrible, so for the sole sake of that I'd say watch the sub.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the Funimation dub till about ep 299 when that was all they had at the time, before switching to the sub. Funimation's dub was great, and i plan on re watching the new dubbed episodes once I'm fully caught up. You will have to switch to the sub at some point though if you plan on catching up, but both are great
>> ARTICLE
you realize you're 300 episodes behind then? you're going to rewatch them all when they get dubbed?
>> ARTICLE
I *was* 300 behind, at the time. That was also quite a while ago, I have like, 20 eps to go till I'm caught up
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Ok so I just reached episode 402 so how far do I have to go so I can join /r/OnePiece? I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks and yeah I'll wait a hundred more episodes. It's really picking up right now and is really sad. 
>> ARTICLE
I am subbed to r/Onepiece but is there a fairly strict no spoiler from manga policy there? If i am up to date on the Anime, is it safe?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Meh I'm up to [Episode 627](/s "The peto peto with Luffy, Chopper and Law")

Might be time to check it more consistently. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks so much I'm only on episode 57 at the moment, I hope I will be able to become one of your nakamas soon!
>> ARTICLE
Switching from dub to sub at the cut off was kind of harsh, but watch whatever as long as it's not the 4kids version. Subbed is all there is of the newer stuff. [r/OnePiece](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/) Join the nakama at our sub!
>> ARTICLE
Ok I will have too. Thanks for the help, this show is so amazing and can't wait to watch it all. Until now I haven't really taken on any animes this big before as the longest I've seen is code geass or gurren lagann ( both dubbed). So the funimation one is good but stay away from the 4kids one?
>> ARTICLE
I honestly really enjoy both subbed and dubbed, the only down side to dubbed  is that it's only up to Water 7 currently where subbed is wayyyyy farther in. If i was you just watch dubbed up until you catch up to the current episodes that are dubbed then switch over so you can get full enjoyment out of both casts.
>> ARTICLE
is there not a good fansub that goes from episode 1 - current?
>> ARTICLE
hope it's okay to name fansub groups but Horrible subs is who i use. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really sure I don't usually watch fansubs but I'm sure with how long OP has been out that there are some pretty good fansubs out there, however I don't know how up to date they are.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the Funimation dub up until the most recent episode they had done at the time (299) and I really enjoyed it. By the end there, it had gone through some serious work and I really liked hearing all the characters- especially Christopher Sabat as Zoro and Stephanie Young as Robin. However, since switching to the sub purely because it's the only thing available. I grew to love the sub voices so much more. I would say watch dub as long as you can and switch, because now you'd be at the end of one of the best arcs/
>> ARTICLE
One Piece has great voice JVA. People do seem to prefer Funimation if you are going dubbed. My brother isn't a big fan of reading, but we've been through over 800 episodes from all kinds of anime that's been subbed. It gives you more of that Japanese experience. It's all preference though, so do what you are most comfortable with. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel the VA for Luffy in Japanese is superb so I prefer it. having said that I am rewatching the FUNimation dub and buying them as the collections are released. 

Given the story and the timeskip which are not dubbed yet, you will eventually switch to subs so the earlier you start, the more you'll associate the characters with the Japanese VA
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I definitely recommend watching it subbed all the way. The dubbed not only censors blood, it changes so many things in the anime, including language.

I mean, can you imagine Sanji with a lollipop over a cigarette? Just... don't watch One Piece dubbed... 

Btw, this is all about 4Kid's dubbed version, I'm not aware of any other dubbed versions that might not be censored.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation has it all uncut and it's a fuck ton better than 4kids.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks for informing me! :3
>> ARTICLE
I completely recommend the manga, and here's why.

1. No filler or padding. Although you could skip over the pure filler episodes if you wanted to, some of the arcs (especially the later ones) only cover the events of 1 chapter per episode. Thus, they stretch out sequences and add more scenes, and it can sometimes make characters look like idiots (compared to what happened in the manga at least, many of the characters are idiots. It just very jarring for those who should know better).

2. Some stuff has never been animated or have been changed from the manga. Generally, the manga is more brutal, so some stuff has been made less brutal in the anime. This brutality can make the one inflicting it a bigger bastard, and it can make the receiver more badass if they go through it. Also, there are some side stories that were never animated which can explain a lot. Kinda related to this is that some fights later on have been stretched out, which really decreased the quality of them.

3. It moves faster. I see that you said you can't blow through the manga fast, but you can certainly get through it faster than the anime, especially now that the episodes are 1:1 with the chapters. 

4. More consistent art. Personally, I love Oda's style, and while it has changed over the years, it is always quality art. The art in the manga can range from being pretty good to pretty bad.

Still, I do agree the anime is more emotional and sometimes easier to follow, so here's what I recommend: go through the manga and watch the action/dramatic parts in the anime afterwards. I know that some of the reasons I listed sound weird, but I'm avoiding spoilers here.
>> ARTICLE
That 1:1 manga/anime ratio is a funny thing *looks at OPs 5 minute intro and 2 minute ending, for a total of 7 out of 22 minutes wasted*
>> ARTICLE
I just checked again, and it seems the intro stuff took about 4:30 out of a 23:30 program. So, the episode is 19 minutes, not 15. Yes, it's not much better but it's still slower.
>> ARTICLE
Does that include the recap which is just recycled animation and plot-lines (normally, they do add some nice maps)?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I saw the end of the last episode and the title card for this episode at 4:30ish. Also, there wasn't any ending sequence or anything.

And for context, I used the new episode [here.](http://onepieceofficial.com/videos.aspx)
>> ARTICLE
I would personally recommend the anime. The One Piece anime has amazing voice acting that you will endear over the series and an ost that is just amazing. The OST do a very good job of building up epic moments as well as the more sweet and touching moments.
>> ARTICLE
I will just say, there are moments in the anime that are so powerful, just with the music, the acting, the animation, that a colorless picture cannot express.
>> ARTICLE
I actually just watched all of One Piece for the first time, so I think I can bring a good insight into this. 

I'm currently working on reading the manga so I can compare, but the One Piece anime was just fantastic. It was on a totally different level from other shonen animes, like Bleach and Naruto that have hundreds of episodes of fillers, thousands of flashbacks and slow, drawn out fightscenes. 

One Piece has maybe, 50 fillers, tops, and the only time I felt like it dragged on was during Enies Lobby, and some of Thriller Bark. The end of Alabasta also felt like it dragged on a little. But for the most part, the anime was just fantastic. Skypiea, Marineford, Water 7, the Arlong arc, Impel Down, etc, they were all amazingly well-done, and the animation really held up throughout the entire series, unlike the other two big shonen animes. 

A lot of the negativity about the anime stems from the fact that the recaps/opening can drag on for a really long time, taking up almost 5-8 minutes of the episode. But that's not really an issue, considering you can just skip all of that. 

Really, the most impressive thing about the anime is the voice acting though. It's rare that I really enjoy voice acting in Japanese, and, indeed, I barely ever notice any difference, but with One Piece the voice acting is just so great that you have to take note of how marvelous it is. It makes every character feel unique and have a lot more life to it. 

So, I would recommend watching the anime. I was so impressed with it that I am only going to read the manga up to the point the anime currently is, and then I'll keep up with the show instead of the manga. I wouldn't do that with any other shonen.


edit- Oh, and, you may feel like the show is a bit boring with the first 30-40 episodesish. I generally wasn't enjoying myself until the Arlong arc. Just know that it gets *a lot* better and more interesting.

Here's a good source for you-
http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_Guide

It lists all of the fillers/special episodes that you should skip.
>> ARTICLE
From a personal view point I would say the manga would be a better choice but due to number of chapters combined with the fact that you don't read through chapters that fast I would say watch the anime but skip over any filler

Edit: not knowing the manga will make it to where you do not know what is filler or not. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally recommend the Manga because while the anime is good it Really slows down in pacing later on and has a lot of filler arcs. (not anywhere near as bad as naruto)

Honestly though I'd say do what I did which was watch the first portion of the series where they're introducing new characters and once they get out to the new ocean read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
"A lot of filler arcs" = roughly 7 arcs. That's out of over 500 episodes, and most of the arcs are only a handful of episodes in length. I think we have completely different definitions of what "a lot" means.
>> ARTICLE
One piece is really good as for anime, even though its ridiculously long you will enjoy every bit of it.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched a good chunk of the anime and I would whole-heartedly recommend it. I read only about a volume of the manga, not because I didn't like it, but the anime really captivated me more. Someone else said something about skipping the fillers, but I'll be straight up, they are some of the most wonderful fillers I've seen in any anime. That's a pretty good feat if you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
I jumped from anime from jusr before the skypia arc to the manga, both ways imo are fine.
>> ARTICLE
depends how much time you want to spend, are you going to watch 550~ episodes?  i reccomend watching until they get to the grand line and then read through sky island, and start watching again once crocodile gets in there.

then what's the one right after they go over the waterfall and meet vivi, is it chopper right away?  it's been years since i watched it.
>> ARTICLE
Chopper right away. Crocodile arc -> short part with bellamy -> Sky Island -> G8
>> ARTICLE
Early scans are pretty low quality so go with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I would say manga. I feel like a lot of the jokes are more effectively shown in it. Something about the timing of the frames in the anime feel off to me.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly,  this anime is the closest Manga adaptation I think I've seen. Either way is good.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from fillers?

Also, I'd say Hellsing Ultimate is the closest manga adaptation I've seen. :)
>> ARTICLE
Both.
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and watched the anime, still continuing both weekly and I totally prefer the anime (even though it fell off a little bit the last 100 episodes). The voiceacting is really good, so is the atmosphere of the whole series. Also the manga contains a lot of text (compared to other big series) and will probably take pretty long to read, especially for a slow reader. Go with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Both, every week I read the new One Piece and watch the new episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to have to go with "both" myself. Start watching the anime, and occasionally browse the manga. First few chapters play in a different order. Both are excellent.
>> ARTICLE
Why not both ? 

But seriously, I'd give anything to watch those 400-ish episodes of One Piece for the first time again without having to wait another week, so I say go for the anime ! You're going to remember those few awesome months for a long time. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga and then the anime for fights if you're interested. The manga is just fantastic, and while I enjoyed the anime, there are some really terrible fillers (though some good ones too) and it is a LOT more time to invest than just reading it. If it takes you 22 minutes to read a chapter of manga, then I guess either-or is fine.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Eh, nope. I take anywhere between 15 - 30 minutes to read a single chapter, I'm incredibly slow.
>> ARTICLE
I watched most of the anime, and manga. But one thing you might consider is switching back and fourth. At the moment I am just reading the manga but I like to watch the fight scenes animated just because voice acting, music and the animation add a lot to a manga. So sometimes I will skip around or do both. If you start watching the anime and you feel like the pace is slow, switch to the manga. And if see something really awesome in the manga, watch it animated as well. But, all in all I have watched at least the first 300 episodes of one piece, and aside from some filler its pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga, no contest. Even for a slow reader, the manga has much better pacing, and you're missing out on the magic of Oda's full-page spreads and ridiculous background details.
>> ARTICLE
I have only read the manga and watched maybe 5-10 episodes on tv (sadly German dubbed, I still shudder). 

Some of the most epic and dramatic moments [Pell in Alabasta, I wanna live/burning of the flag etc.](/spoiler) should be incredible in the animation. If had to start at zero I'd probably go for the anime now since it is easier to get into and follow and move on to the manga when ou caught up a bit or feel like rereading things. 
>> ARTICLE
Both are excellent but I find the anime to be more emotional. I would go with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
One piece is better as anime.

Neither

Hunter x Hunter 2011 best shounen.
>> ARTICLE
Hands down, although in ways that typically subvert traditional shounen.  So it kinda depends what you are looking for.  HxH stacks up reasonably well as a battle adventure shounen, but if all you tend to care about is action, you could easily find yourself disappointed.

HxH presents itself very differently from what it is.  The other series do not.
>> ARTICLE
I like shonen that aren't overly dramatic or too cliche like hunter x hunter or magi. Sure they're nothing like death note or steins gate but I think they have something about them that is both adrenaline charged like naruto and decently written/styled. So to answer your question some are overhyped (not necessarily a bad thing, if you like it then you like it), but I think others are truly well done and deserve the hype.
>> ARTICLE
Funny you should say that as I consider Magi to be a prime example of overly dramatic. My problem lies primarily with Alibaba; he doubts himself way too damn much over similar reasons... which made his character development pretty stale IMO. Also, the author seems to like making her characters cry (from what I remember anyway, haven't watched the show or read the manga in a while so I may be exaggerating). I still consider it a pretty good shonen though.
>> ARTICLE
Well of course it's still dramatic, it is shonen, but I consider it a lot less dramatic then Naruto ranting about about friendship for the 1000th time.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're a bit to quick to write off Alibaba's character. Sure in the beginning he definitely doubts himself especially when comparing himself to Sinbad. However despite his own doubts he still takes up arms himself and tries to do the things he considers to be right. Throughout the series you eventually see him becoming more confident in himself and acting on his own accord. He's a great example of character growth within any series let alone shonen. From humble beginnings he learns as he travels and matures a lot. Even he admits that had he never met Aladdin he would probably still be working small jobs at Quichan the town that the whole story started at and would have never worked up the courage to challenge things that were unjust. Sure he cries here and there, but it's just to show how compassionate he is and solidify the ideal that even as a king he would stay humble and understanding. Not to mention throughout the anime and the manga you can see how his past experiences influence the decisions he makes years after they happen. It's incredibly interesting to seem him face the many choices he faces throughout his journey and how he acts towards each one.
>> ARTICLE
I object to the idea that death note is in any way superior.  Togashi is an incredibly adept psychologist, but he doesn't feel the need to bash you over the head with it.

Togashi obtains moral ambiguity in much more subversive ways.

Light and L are both two sides of the same coin and act as roughly the same anti-hero with the same motivations throughout.  You get the sense that had the roles been reversed, L found the notebook and Light was the semi principled brilliant detective, the story would pay out exactly the same.

It is WAY too easy to explore 'psychology' when you play with the ideas of good and evil in such a simplistic manner, light is evil/good in the same way seen in Dexter, but at least Dexter tells you how his emotionless impacts others in subtle ways.  To make the series a large scale impossibly well thought out (see: cheats) strategy is to take away the interesting human exploration aspect and replace it with silly plot points.

Togashi will NOT give the audience such easy answers.  The King is evil, no amount if care for Komugi changes the fact he still plans to murder five million people.  At the same time, said action is brought about by instinct, the evilness is something you can directly relate to how humans treat the world and other species.

But even that isn't ambiguous enough for Togashi, who then give us not the internal conflict between 'good' and 'evil' as you would have Light provide, no, you have something far more human.  Far more identifiable.  You have the king annoyed at not understanding himself.  This doesn't excuse his actions.  This doesn't make the king 'good' but it makes it very hard to consider someone who lacks understanding of themselves or why they do what they do categorically evil, and much harder to categorically hate.

These are hard issues, but are primarily human issues.  HxH doesn't bill itself as an exploration of human psychology, but that is what the show is.  Death note pretends to do the same but often finds itself in way more shallow shounen-like waters.

>> ARTICLE
That's an interesting analysis. I suppose I didn't really care as much about Light or L's psychology while watching, it was really more just their intricate schemes and plans to thwart each other that I found very entertaining, but I can definitely agree with what you said about their motivations, morals, etc. When I was watching HxH I found the King to be one of my favorite characters because of him being innately gifted at everything and all powerful yet still puzzled with himself and his relationship to Komugi. I think it shows far more depth than most of the characters that are on the show. If you think about it, Gon is just genuinely curious about anything and everything (especially his father obvi) and although watching him transform and thrive on his quest for knowledge/strength/daddy issues is great, the King's struggles seem more profound IMO.
>> ARTICLE
One thing about these shows the others don't really have is the consistency in the world. The fights make sense, the power makes sense, even the world makes sense. The main characters seem real, they aren't undefeatable gods and know this. 
>> ARTICLE
Even though I haven't seen those shows, that brings up another point about major shonen that I have a problem with- super saiyan syndrome (badly written deus ex machina). They use these super powered states as writing tools to get themselves out of corners when they create an enemy that is too powerful for the character to defeat normally, only to write themselves into another corner when they create an enemy that is powerful enough to beat the unbeatable form, which they write themselves out of by using yet *another* super-powered state. This happens in Naruto with the nine tails' cloak tail levels, nine-tails' mode and nine tails' hokage mode, Bleach with Bankai and the hollow mask, One piece with second-third gear and haki, and of course in Dragonball Z, where they started the whole trend with the different levels of super saiyan. 
>> ARTICLE
Outside of the filler arcs (which sometime are pretty good,) most shounen like shows are actually pretty good. For one, the most recent episode of Naruto Shippuden was downright intense. The big shounen shows aren't te best ever, but they're still pretty good. Just Some filler gets annoying, which can be easily avoided. People don't see to see a 25 episode show runs for a few weeks then take a break before season 2.  The shounen shows usually have that much material from the main story and it's actually good, just instead of having a break in between, they just show unrelated episodes. 

Many elitist anime fans tend to trash on anime that they deem to be "intro anime, and these are usually the big shounen. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a strange thing that I actually thought last weeks episode of Naruto was better/on-par with all the other airing shows i'm watching right now.

I usually approach the long shounens with a completely different mindset than I do for other anime, which makes it more tolerable to deal with fillers and unbearably slow pacing. I'm more in it for the long haul. Especially in a show like Naruto, its really interesting seeing the various 100+ episode long plans/schemes/plot threads slowly reveal themselves. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole plot of Obito is him living in his own hell which gets good later on. 
>> ARTICLE
Does it?  I watched the last episode and all I got was the typical 'hero' turning semi-nihilistic villain after an act of betrayal.  What's worse, if Kakashi had a bad reason, then Kakashi legitimately betrayed the audience's trust, and deserves scorn.  Otherwise, Obito is being even more idiotic.  Why didn't he just kill Kakashi?  "You have to live with the pain of killing Rin" or some BS like that?  (Which would really be awful because it'd imply he'd still understand the importance Rin was to Kakashi.  Such an implicit bit of empathy makes it very difficult to justify such nihilism.  ESPECIALLY the complete lack of any real self-reflection on such empathy.... despite years of time.)  Obito neither seems to understand his own mind, nor care that he doesn't.

"Good" if you mean by an action stance, which I'd argue is all Naruto is good for anyway... perhaps, but dear god Obito's back story pissed me off.  His reaction to loss is a device for a plot point.

Edit: AND TO MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR!  Kishi does not write Naruto to act as a psycological exploration as to how characters act in certain situations.  Kishi writes Naruto for the things people find awesome about it, and the rest like the filler and the dialogue and the like can be skipped.  Michael Bay doesn't create movies to make you think, he creates movies to entertain... and Kishi doesn't mind doing anything else.  It's why for all the "Naruto characters are boring" arguments I can put forth, I don't think that ruins the series.  I will FOREVER complain about Death Note, however, because that the whole premise really is on the face a psychological exploration of the characters but it feels so... flat.  Constantly. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you have found cliche where there really isn't.


>> ARTICLE
I can enjoy the big three (big two now, fairy tail or toriko might take the place) Simply because so much time has been spent on it.

I still think that One Piece is a fairly good show. Having some amazing moments through out the anime.

But OFC, there are better ones like Death Note, FMA:B, Hunter x Hunter.

but out of all the long running ones, One piece probably has to be my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece: Get to episode 20ish, at the end of the Nami arc. By then you'll have an idea of the show. I think it has better writing, pacing, and much less filler than Naruto. Also the show has side characters you give a damn about which is nice.

Hunter x Hunter: Get to episode 10ish, starting into the Hunter exam. This show has the best combat system (powers/strength level/etc) of any shounen. In the last 3 episodes, 12 seconds of real world time has gone by and I have never been more engaged.

Fairy Tail: Imagine your writing a shounen in the last 10 years and you want to be big. What do you do? You recreate Luffy from One Piece, and jam cheesy humor and cheap fan service into it. Welcome to Fairy Tail.

Notable but shorter fighting/shounen anime's:
* * * * 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood: The best of the best

Gintama: The funniest

Hajime no Ippo: Not my cup of tea but loved by it's fans enough for a remake and many itterations

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: The most epic of Bro-mance and fantastical fighting.

Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy: Cowboy Bebop is in the number 1 spot of all anime for a lot of people, experience why! Champloo and Dandy, made by the same guy as Bebop, take you to Edo era Japan and 20,000 years into the future, respectively. Dandy is currently airing.
>> ARTICLE
I gave a shit about the side characters in naruto. There were moments regarding shikamaru and rock lee that still hold steady in my mind as the reason I started liking anime.
>> ARTICLE
Those 2 for sure had moments in Naruto. But they were short and they are at best guest stars. There is 9 crew in One Piece and each one is the best ever and they are always on screen. 

It's just not a fair comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never been tempted. There's just better things to do with my time. 
500 episodes? You could've literally watched 20-40 normal length shows in that time.

And tension isn't really sustainable when you realize that the MC has the thickest plot armor ever. Also, characters usually have their arc... and then are the same person for the next 100 episodes. Writing decent material for 500 episodes is nearly impossible.

Also, I prefer "thinking" series, ones that explore complex issues and such, but I'm not really gonna hold anybody accountable to that. 

>> ARTICLE
Animes like these were pretty good, and they still are. However, there are plenty of anime out there (imo) that are better. I too, completely immersed myself, but with Naruto specificially, it really did fall into pure filler. It's what really prompted me to read the manga in fact.
But yeah, personally, i think these main ones are quite overhyped.
>> ARTICLE
i love the crap out of fairytail i love Erza! Naruto is great the art and animation are realy fluid and natural. DBZ is just a classic like led zeplin and the Beatles it just doesnt get old sure sometimes it gets a little too much and the pacing is slow at times but i like that the show gets better with the pace with time. bottom line yeah i like the broseph animes but thats just because sometimes i dont feel like getting my feels jerked around like full metal alchemist did so sometimes its nice to see likable characters do some cool stuff without fear of my favorite characters getting screwed up or killed
>> ARTICLE
gotta disagree with you on the animation front. Naruto's animation, especially in the 4th great ninja war arc, gets really sketchy when they start using digital animation and get lazy. Certain points that come to mind are Naruto's face during the biju fights and after Gaara's speech where there are about 3 cheering animations between the entire Allied army. 
>> ARTICLE
i havent gotten that far i wouldnt know
>> ARTICLE
I watched bleach through to the end of Aizen. It was amazing prior to Aizen becoming the villan and then pretty terrible after but I still watched it hoping for greatness that never came. The characters went stale the plot got ridiculous and ichigo always just got strong for dumb reasons.

 I never watched naruto but have watched nearly all of Shippuden. It is much better than bleach and every episode leading up to the war, minus small fillers, was awesome. Ever since the war started ive barely even wanted to watch it. The quality of everything just plummeted so much. I barely even watch anymore. I think I'm like 5 episodes behind and ive actually skipped several because they were so boring. 

One Piece is my favorite anime even though it isn't the best anime. In my opinion it's the only one out of the big three that has consistency. The characters are all unique and have very different goals and personalities but all love Luffy and follow him. There are very serious moments and very funny moments all of which feel appropriate. They even lose fights. Like serious big fights where there life is put in harms way because they lose. No other anime could make me cry over an inanimate object. There is something magical about it. 


TLDR: Hunter x Hunter is probably the best "shounen" anime ever made and is much superior to the big three. One Piece will always have my heart. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh for me this has more to do with I've been reading and watching them for so long(Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, and Fairy Tail) that I think it would just be stupid to not see them through to the end. I started reading and watching most of these when I was actually the target demographic and even though my tastes have changed I really can't hate on them. 

Though I do agree with the underwhelming fights the only exception for me being Bleach, I love the shit out of most of those fights even the filler fights.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, the whole commitment thing is the only reason I'm finishing Naruto too.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Naruto, Bleach & Fairy Tail and I have started One Piec (45 episodes in at the moment).

Honestly, they're average shows. They lack in coherent storytelling and character development. The last one they make up for with character design most of the time, but only the MC will rarely ever go through noticable changes and even then it's not to grow the character but to grow the show.

With all that said, I love these long running shounens. One Piece spoiler: [The scenes where they're at Arlong Park and Nami starts to cry and ask Luffy for help with Luffy responding by giving her his hat. Followed up by a scene where Luffy, Zoro, Sanji & Usopp walk towards Arlong's Park.] (/spoiler) I thoroughly enjoy those moments. They get me excited in a way that Shingeki no Kyojin or FMA: Brotherhood can't seem to do.  
And this counts for the others as well. They thrive on battle scenes, but if they're well executed these shows can be so much better than your average 12/25 episode shounen shows because of the investment that comes with the massive amounts of episodes they have.

I use One Piece as a filler show inbetween more serious shows that require me to concentrate to enjoy them to the fullest. Inbetween Serial Experiments Lain & Steins;Gate I'm not always interested in another heavy show. I'm not a fan of moe, ecchi or harem shows so braindead shounens fill that void perfectly.

They're definitely not for everyone, and aren't even close to being the best anime as a medium has to offer. Don't watch them if you want smart or intellectual shows. But if you, like me, sometimes want to reach out to the little boy in you with "cool and kick-ass" fighting shows, then fuck yeah: these shows rock.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece has lots of great moments in store for you if you like the Arlong Park saga
>> ARTICLE
Used to watch alot of Naruto and Fairy Tail, but got bored after a while, so I stopped watching anime for a few years. Recently, though, I started watching anime again but could never get into more mainstream animes. 
>> ARTICLE
They are actually pretty good - there are a fucking lot of shitty anime out there, and all of the big three actually have some damn good episodes. They are consistently entertaining and fun, so I still watch them.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a fan of shonen for the same reason you are, they were my introduction to anime. However, I started out with Yu Yu Hakusho and that set the bar at a height which not many other shonen-based shows could reach. I was fortunate that I picked such a great show to start with, but it made it difficult for me to watch a show without comparing. 

In terms of Naruto, I like it. I hate the **flashback filler** with a passion but I try not to let that tarnish my view of the show (even though it does). I haven't seen One Piece so I can't comment on that, however, I completely agree with you on Fairy Tail. It's a filler anime to watch when nothing else is on. It's just plain okay. Nothing else. 
>> ARTICLE
I only put One Piece/Fairy Tail on as background sound when I'm doing something else. I've actually watched enough to get the gist of what's going on, but there's no way I'm going to seriously follow a 500+ episode anime.
>> ARTICLE
Not as hyped in the anime community anymore. There are a lot of bigger fish out there. 
>> ARTICLE
As of now, Naruto consists in 1 epic episode every 30 (or 40) bad episodes. Sadly T_T
>> ARTICLE
I haven't started One Piece yet and I don't care much for DBZ (please, be gentle). I watched a lot of Naruto and Bleach a *long* time ago but I've given on the anime for both. I read their mangas occasionally and I enjoy Bleach a lot more than Naruto.

For the longest time I gave up on shounen entirely but then I discovered Hunter X Hunter. It has quickly become my favorite series of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I believe the long shounens have probably the most epic moments in anime(Naruto vs Pain, Gaara vs Rock Lee, Marineford Arc in One Piece) but in general shorter anime are more satisfying. The long animes are good when you don't want to have to think because nothing ever really changes, they just fight the next strongest guy, almost die then move on  to the next.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree that you need 100 episodes of build up to a moment. Film pretty much shows otherwise; they only need 2 hours or so to build up to that final moment of catharsis.

"are good when you don't want to have to think"
I know you have the best intentions, but these words scare the living daylights out of me.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that long-running Shonen do have incredible potential for great moments, as the sheer amount of time you spend in their worlds causes you to become immersed. Although my most recent anime prior to my Naruto catch up being fate/zero, an anime with near perfect visuals, fight scenes, dialogue and plot, everything just seemed stilted and dumbed down. Although maybe once my standards have been sufficiently lowered I'll be able to get back into it. But yeah, I do agree with you on the account of moments. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it is pretty clear they aren't over hyped. Just a look through the comments and you'll see the ones that are currently contender's for most over-hyped Anime. 

Steins;Gate
Fate/Zero
Hunter X Hunter
Deathnote
Fullmetal Alchemist

These are the ones that are over hyped. 

I personally follow HxH and OP after finishing Bleach and dropping Naruto.

One Piece stands apart as one of the most vivid and imaginative worlds in fiction. It has a wide range of characters (Even down to important extended cast like Smoker, Akinu, Trafalgar Law, Shanks, Coby and literally dozens of others)

The very First episode of One Piece shares significant character links hundreds of episodes in. Every person in the cast has a deep personal motivation with the most developed in the Strawhats and even the extended cast having vivid personalities and traits. 

The Characters have all experienced tragedy and have also suffered meaningful defeats such as Zoro's early loss to Hawk-eyes Mihawk. 

We spent a recent Arc learning more about the first major obstacle, Arlong who was in an early season years ago. 

I really don't think One Piece gets enough recognition. particularly when compared unfavourably to HxH which currently has some of the least compelling villains in a recent show. The chimera ants just aren't compelling and the royal guard are compromised of clichs. 

not that i don;t enjoy the show

Hunter x Hunter 2011 begs to differ.

Hunter X hunter is arguably a great Shonen but the amount of quality One Piece Arcs is pretty staggering.

Arlong Park

Drum island

Water 7/Enis Lobby

Seabody Archipelago

Whitebeard War

Obviously it's down to preference though :p but objectively the world building in one Piece is pretty staggering compared to HxH but thats just since OP has been going steady in Manga format for so much longer.

Fighting shonen are to the most part entry level shows or filler shows between better anime. They are meant to be easy on the mind and as long as possible to eat up years of your life. And yes, 90% of the community watches and talks almost entirely about them, when there are far better series out there. Of course and they are overhyped/overrated.

Awesome. But how I started really getting into anime is sorta melancholy. After watching all of the Miyazaki movies, I tried to find something that captured that unique feel. Maybe it was the animation style or the stories or something else but I wanted to find more of that same feeling. It's been several years and it seems to me that Studio Ghibli is the only one that can. I've gotten close but not exactly. Until then my quest to find the other "Miyazaki" continues (and I don't mean Goro).

>> ARTICLE
I finished Angel Beats! less than 30 minutes ago. I'm in shambles.
>> ARTICLE
It's okay, have an internet hug.
>> ARTICLE
How long before the ending were you in shambles? The last time I rewatched the series, I was a crying MAN from episode six to the end and the Another Epilogue! Real men cry! T_T
>> ARTICLE
I had my spurts of shambleness. Episode 2 and 3 hit me pretty hard. Finding out how [Yurippes little siblings were killed made me step back for a couple minutes and think about my younger siblings.](/spoiler)

Evangelion, I'll teach them to be the opposite of Shinji, Rei, and Asuka.

I still haven't seen more than 4 episodes, do they all really turn into that big of assholes?
>> ARTICLE
More like a mixture of immaturity and psychological problems than them just being assholes, although on the surface that's how they appear. 
>> ARTICLE
It'd be a tie between Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and One Piece for me.  Both are great, but for a kid (assuming a very young kid) TTGL would grab their attention faster than One Piece.  One Piece is great for the long run.
>> ARTICLE
If it was a girl, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Seeing her face after Episode 3 would be priceless.

This is why I will not, and should not, have children.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka doesn't have nearly as much impact if you didn't grow up watching stuff like Sailor Moon, Card Captors, or Pretty Cure. It'd be like watching Eva without ever seeing any Gundam, you miss a lot of the trope breaking.
>> ARTICLE
This mitght explain why i dislike eva.
>> ARTICLE
That's not necessarily true.  I think that Madoka and Eva still have a lot of power because of how dark they are, and anyone watching it would be taken aback at stuff like Episode 3 or Unit 01 berserk.

Of course, it's all that much cooler if you know where it stems from.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, then I'd make her watch regular Magical Girl shows first.

Are there any similar soulcrushing ideas for boys, by the way? Because I kind of want to do this to my nephew now.
>> ARTICLE
read now as meow I think my brain is breaking.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, just the thought of me ending a sentence with "meow" made me laugh uncontrollably.

Sorry for laughing indirectly at you, but it was just too funny.
>> ARTICLE
Eva?
>> ARTICLE
Gundam to Evangelion. Or TTGL to Evangelion. Or just magic girl stuff to Madoka. Guys can like them too. At least during my childhood I watched Sailor Moon and Card Captor, but would never admit it to anyone at school. There's a new Sailor Moon anime coming out this summer, so that could be your chance!

You can also check out [this TVTropes link](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreDeconstruction) for more examples of genre deconstructions.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, TTGL is much more enjoyable after Evangelion, since you can consider TTGL as a reconstruction of the Mecha genre after Evangelion's deconstruction. You won't get all the (not so) subtle references to NGE in TTGL.

Gundam >> Random Mecha Anime (Vandread, Escaflowne, etc) >> NGE >> TTGL would be my advised order.
>> ARTICLE
Make them watch Aquarion for the weird fusion scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Good point. I think your order is probably the best for mecha. It's strange since I would recommend Nanoha before Madoka, but I think TTGL would go better after Eva.
>> ARTICLE
You could have him watch school days... I think by the end he'd know not to stick his dong where it don't belong.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, that sounds like an idea.
>> ARTICLE
I have actually thought this out before.

Very Young : 

* Dragonball
* Totoro
* Heroman
* Metabots
* Patlabor (TV)

Elementary school: "Big kid animus!"

* Dragonball Z
* GaoGaiGar
* Hajime No Ippo
* Giant Robo
* Shin Getter Robo

Middle school: "Here's some more serious stuff..."

* Neon Genesis Evangelion
* UC Gundam
* Ghost In A Shell
* Cowboy Bebop
* Big-O

High school: "You moar adult stuff son?"

* Space Runaway Ideon
* Kaiji
* Armor Trooper VOTOMS
* Legend Of The Galactic Heroes
* Cromartie High School (I know, but I had to stick this somewhere!)

College: "Son....it's time you get a waifu."

* K-On
* Spice And Wolf
* Azumanga Daioh
* [Eventual adaption of It's Not My Fault I'm Not Popular]
* [Eventual adaption of Daily Life With Monster Girls]

Then I should be able to watch animes and discuss waifus when he visits. 
>> ARTICLE
>"Son....it's time you get a waifu."

I like this :)
>> ARTICLE
My wife and I are trying to have a baby right now and the question of what anime to show my children has been on my mind frequently. Thank you for this list!
>> ARTICLE
Just about sums up my college list. For some reason, you just want to forget all your midterms and watch cute girls doing cute things.
>> ARTICLE
hmm im suprised by a lack of hunter x hunter in this thread
>> ARTICLE
HxH would be good for a young age because it eases into the really graphic serious themes subtly. 
>> ARTICLE
forgot to mention Prince of tennis too!
>> ARTICLE
Good luck getting a highschooler to watch LoGH.

Also, why is the college category all romcom and cutesy stuff?
>> ARTICLE
I'm a highschooler planning to watch LoGH soon - should I not?
>> ARTICLE
Of course you should watch it. It's fucking fantastic. It's just that it's long, old, has bad animation, and isn't as bombastic as stuff like Code Geass or Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
Plus, add a little Mirai Nikki to the HS part. Just so you can show how much one crazy girl can either do to mess you up or help you.
>> ARTICLE
^ Yeah...

College Category should be **Kaiji**, **Hajime no Ippo**, **Akagi**, **Berserk**...
>> ARTICLE
Because manime.
>> ARTICLE
cute girls doing cute things helps you escape dat college stress.
>> ARTICLE
This is true and effective. 
>> ARTICLE
I would show Eveangelion in highschool. Feel like they would understand/enjoy it more then.

Would show to a collage student. Maybe then they can explain the ending to me and I can die happy.

Aria the Originiation because it's perfect.
One Piece because fanboy.

This post originally was going to have a long list of anime included, but as I was typing it I realized something. That I have watched some really effed up anime. Needless to say the list got cut down to a couple of must haves. Definitely Haibane Renmei and pretty much any of Hayao Miyazaki's awesome films. After that just let them explore. That should give a good foundation.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree. Especially as Haibane Renmei is one of my favourite anime of all time. I think it would be a great place to start.

I'd also have to add Kino's Journey, similar to Haibane Renmei in many ways, and different in others, great series.

Phantom Requiem for The Phantom.

That show will have its spot in my own heart for quite awhile.

No you're on to something. Show him school days his freshman year of highschool, or when he takes interest in females. Then he can learn a very valuable lesson. 
>> ARTICLE
WHY HAS NOBODY MENTIONED HELLSING ULTIMATE???????
>> ARTICLE
Trigun. Vash shows the tremendous spirit in overcoming not just the obstacles of prosecution (and being shot every five minutes) but comes to terms with his brother, who has killed the one person who meant the most to him. I know my children won't understand why this anime touches home in a very personal way, because they won't have had to live through a family situation similar to that. But just for the optimism that Vash shows as he goes through life, and his ability to overcome everything... I definitely want to share this with any kids I might have.

Since i'm not a native English speaker, my kid would probably be a teen by the time he/she learns the language sufficiently to read the subs.

I would hope to give my children the thing that gave me my first experience into anime- My Neighbor Totoro. I remember renting my first VHS copy at the local library they had along with Kiki's Delivery Service and I had always been intrigued. It ended up being one of the most important and influential decisions in my life.

I would also love to give them Detective Conan, and when they get a bit older some Cowboy Bebop and Trigun. I feel like those two hold important messages while being crazy awesome.

I can't even pick just one.

I felt like out of all the anime I've watched, the ones that have pulled on the most heartstrings were Angel Beats, Clannad, and Gurren Lagann. I guess the last might seem like a wrench thrown in the mix compared to the first two, but.. I just felt like as someone who's too afraid to do anything, it gave me the confidence boost to just keep moving forward in life.

I think I'd like to keep to keep 5cm per Second shelved somewhere, too. Just a little something for them to admire when I'm gone and nearly forgotten, haha.

**Kokoro Connect** by far. 

watching that series was the first time I ever thought about this topic. show highlights perfectly the way people relate to one another and brings empathy to a whole new level by virtue of its plot device.

as for entertainment's sake alone: Nichijou!
>> ARTICLE
If I had to choose just one it would be Samurai Champloo, but I'd also show Dragon Ball Z as those two shows really got me into anime and Champloo is still my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki. Stalkers are dangerous.
>> ARTICLE
Stalker? I didn't notice anything strange about any of the characters in Mirai Nikki.
>> ARTICLE
My children absolutely must watch Princess Mononoke because it's most certainly "epic" when not many things described as such actually are and teaches much about humanity and reverence.  Madoka and Evangelion will be in there because they teach so much about depression and mindsets.  Finally, something patently uplifting like FMA:B or TTGL, because you need some emotional chocolate after all that.  

The whole Ghibli/Miyazaki gambit will also be in there for sheer artistic value/life lessons.

I binge-read the manga. I was usually a pretty fast reader and couldn't wait to get to the next volume but when this happened, I stared at it for minutes.

Then I took a photo of it so I could look at it again whenever I wanted to.
>> ARTICLE
Haha that's just great man! Hopefully it's the coloured one :) 
>> ARTICLE
wait there's a coloured manga? Is that for all the currently out? Where do i find?
>> ARTICLE
Yes there's a coloured manga and it's absolutely fantastic! 721 is the latest coloured one and can't recommend it enough! :) 
>> ARTICLE
Nope sadly not. But tbh you could give me that panel as a pencil sketch and it would still be the most satisfying thing ever.
>> ARTICLE
Dude coloured manga is the way to go when you reread ;) 
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't rereading, I was reading the entire thing for the first time. I got into anime pretty late, and into One Piece even later, so I kind of had 17-18 years to catch up with. Had some friends who could borrow me the manga, I just took what I could get.

Uhhh I hope you didn't just get spoiled :( 
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched like 20 episodes of one piece and all i can remember is luffy fighting a sharkman, what exactly is the relevance of this???
>> ARTICLE
celestial dragons are very very big big shots that you don't touch and just obey their orders... too bad Luffy dgaf about that
>> ARTICLE
Well it's a pretty big moment in terms of story. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is he called celestial dragon, He looks like an astronaut to me. I'm planning on watching the series again, would you recomend to start from episode 1 or if there a better place to start?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I wouldn't recommend watching the anime from start to end. It gets really drawn out (at least after the first couple of arcs).

Instead, I'd recommend the "Digital Colored Comics" version. I wont link it, but it should be trivial to find.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is tough to get into because it's so damn long, but if you were to watch it, definitely start from episode 1. The Celestial Dragons are practically the highest nobility in One Piece. They think of themselves as Gods, and normal people are completely below them. If someone so much as looks at them wrong, they can shoot and kill that person, and no one would think much of it. They're scum that were born into their positions basically. Speaking out against them or god forbid hitting one of them is unheard of. Of course Luffy isn't the type of person to look away when someone hurts his nakama. In this scene Luffy punching the celestial dragon is a HUGE deal, that's why they make it so dramatic. 
>> ARTICLE
Celestial dragons in that show are really really high nobility that live in a sacred land and consider themselves to be above the other humans, and not even by typical "I'm better than them" views. They straight up just don't think about other humans, there's no point when they are so far beneath them. 
>> ARTICLE
But why do they look like strange spacemen? Sorry, thanks for the explanation;
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of theories about that. But telling them would spoiled quite a bit of stuff, so it's better if you experience for yourself.
>> ARTICLE
So they don't breath the same air as lowly commoners.
>> ARTICLE
The helmet is just so they don't have to breathe the same air as normal people. They wear it when they're not in their holy land. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely from episode 1! You'll learn more about them, I don't want to spoil anything :) 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, also how much filler is there? Is it worth it to watch filler, or should i skip it?
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend the manga instead. The pacing is pretty slow for the anime (as are all super popular and long-running shows like Naruto, Bleach, DBZ). The manga however is nothing short of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
the pace is god awful, I haven't read the manga but I would still recommend going with the manga instead of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
only filler i recommend watching is G8 filler arc which is from episode 196-206 just for the comedy. One of the funniest moments one piece has is in this arc
>> ARTICLE
It's not that much, around 10-15%. It's actually pretty good and I'd say worth watching, but not necessary so it's your choice :) 
>> ARTICLE
You can simply skip fillers. Also if you want to you can watch one pace. It's basically a naruto Kai /dragonball Kai Version of one piece that follows only the Manga. It's shorter but still as informative but not all arcs are up there only those that have serious pacing problems right now. 
>> ARTICLE
With some exceptions (the dragon arc after Arlong Park comes to mind), most of One Piece's filler has been pretty good, G6 especially. Up to you really whether you want to watch them or not.

Pain Arc ended like it could have been the ending to the Naruto story as well.

Absolutely, they could've wrapped it up nice, maybe have an extra small arc or a couple of episodes to tie all the loose ends and end it with him being nominated Hokage (in the future, having a little "end of series" time skip). Although the asspull would still have tainted it a bit, and the series still had a LOT of stuff to do that couldn't reaaally be wrapped up quickly.

This might be weird, but watching the End of Evangelion for the second time.

The scene when [Komm, susser Tod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KYYVrBX4v0) kicks in. There are few music pieces that are perfectly fitting and horribly jarring at the same time. It fits so well, and yet it doesn't.

It's insane how Haikyuu has such a large cast and yet all those characters have such a distinctive personality.  
  
One of my favorite things to do while watching Haikyuu was pause during those group "yay!" shots and see what everyone was doing.   
  
I mean, let's [check this one out.](https://unotaku.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wpid-screenshot_2015-10-24-12-26-45.png) Pretty standard, Hinata and Nishinoya are jumping like crazy because they *are* crazy. Tsukki's got that one hand in his pocket "I'm too cool to celebrate" kinda deal going. Kageyama is double pumping his fists because he's so psyched. And some random upperclassman who isn't drawn well enough to be detailed is concerned for Nishinoya's safety.  
  
[Then you have this.](http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1748a82480dc5a0cbf2be72ff6688b5/tumblr_inline_nchgftn1RP1r687mn.png) Hinata is still jumping about because that's what he does. Tsukki still shows no reaction. Kageyama is overjoyed and throwing his arms up, while Asahi is pumped. Tanaka *throws Nishinoya into the air*, and Nishinoya just embraces it. Meanwhile, Yamaguchi is relieved and falls over.

>> ARTICLE
Do you like Rebellion? It seems that people who really like the series tend to hate the third movie.
>> ARTICLE
Rebellion is to Madoka as The Empire Strikes Back is to A New Hope.

A New Hope can stand on its own. It's a complete story. Empire is a very good movie, but it's not complete. If Star Wars had simply ended after Empire, it would have been unfinished. It needs Return of the Jedi to finish the story.

Similarly, the Madoka series stands alone. Rebellion is very good, but it is the second act in a trilogy. Madoka is thesis, Rebellion is antithesis. We are missing the final piece, the work of synthesis, to finish the story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a huge PMMM fan.

And Rebellion shot PMMM up to my #1 anime of all time. Best movie.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I gave both 10s.
>> ARTICLE
Not OP but I'm in the minority that liked the movie *way* more than the series (original series was still fantastic, gave it a 10). People only seem to criticise the third movie's ending if [Madoka series](/s "they didn't understand Homura's goal from the very beginning of the series").
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. In order to appreciate Rebellion, you have to accept that [Madoka](/s "the ending of the series wasn't perfect.")
>> ARTICLE
I actually disagree partially on this. [Madoka](/s "The series could have ended after the original run and I'd have been pretty satisfied; Homura takes the role of a Wraith Killer, who eventually dies sometime in the future and joins Madoka in the Law of Cycles. Story over. ")

[](/s "But while Rebellion felt unnecessary, I still loved where it went with continuing the story, and how the plot doesn't conflict with the original series, but instead expands on it, highlighting Homura's failed efforts and what she would do to complete her goal, to the point where she will go *against* what Madoka wants in order to save her (in her eyes)")
>> ARTICLE
Haha. This gets interesting. I think I phrased my statement incorrectly. [Madoka](/s "The ending of Madoka was perfect as in 'You can't make a better ending than that one'. But it was imperfect in the sense that Madoka's wish doesn't really solves anything (magical girls still fighting wraiths). And that Homura was left depressed, alone.")
>> ARTICLE
for anyone that liked madoka magica, I'd recommen d the manga [qualia the purple](http://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia)

it is basically madoka magica except instead of magic it is all explained with lots of pseudo science and technical jargon similar to the movie primer. It is also a pretty short manga can finish it in like 2 hours probably.

I can't imagine watching Monogatari without Commie's subs. They're hilarious, and they make that scene so great.

>> ARTICLE
Only Commie's I've ever seen are those beautiful typesettings they do like rotating subs., or precisely spaced so important parts aren't missed... never actually seen something like that... 

They've stopped though right ? (site's down)
>> ARTICLE
Unless something happened within the last couple days, they haven't stopped. That said, they are doing much less this season than usual.
>> ARTICLE
A great way to ruin good shows imo, but glad that the alternative exists I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I would never want to watch a series with joke subs.
>> ARTICLE
I can see that argument for some scenes in some shows, but not for that one. Even if [Monogatari SS](/s "she wasn't literally using those words in Japanese (I'm not even sure how profanity works in Japanese), based on her tone I think that's what that scene may have sounded like if it was written in English. They didn't make her say anything ridiculous, she just sounded angry.")
>> ARTICLE
It most definitely would apply to that scene and most shows for that matter ([there are exceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHDO2jRGtwI)). Swearing in japanese culture is very reserved, I mean just talking on the phone while on a train is looked down upon to give you some idea. It's not like people don't do it or that people never swear but it is regarded as very rude and not at all as relaxed as perhaps in the US.

The reason I personally don't like these kind of subs is that it immediately breaks the illusion for me because I know noone would say that. In such a polite, or perhaps reserved, culture where using a persons first name instead of their last name can be a huge event, having people saying things like: "Holy shit", "fuck you" or "retard" becomes silly. Even children know better than to do that. It is only done to appeal to a western teenage demographic that enjoy that, and that is fine of course, but often it also breaks character portrayals. 

It is not at all that I'm against swearing, I do that way too much myself to be in a position to judge. What I don't like is that it actually compromises story for a cheap laugh. Crunchyroll had a thing where they translated Durarara so that when people called each other by the last name, as is normal in Japan, they translated the name into the persons first name, so the western audience would not be confused I guess. So the person in the show said a name and another name appeared in the sub. And when suddenly character switched to be on a first name basis nothing changed in the sub. Very confusing. This is another example of how westernizing subtitles can bring a lot of issues, all because they do not trust the audience to understand.

A lot of plot points revolve heavily around the japanese culture. An example would be when Araragis sister has the whole toothbrush scene. [Nisemonogatari](/s "She does all that so that Araragi will *introduce* her to Kanbaru, because it would be unseemly and a big break of etiquette for her to just approach Kanbaru on her own.") To then all of a sudden blow that out the window for edgier swear or whatnot is just, again just my opinion, bad translation. Because you did not translate the meaning, you translated an interpretation and then knowingly adapted that into something that clashes with several other aspects of the show, for fun. And you can say "well they're just adapting it to a western audience so that we can understand better", but the problem there is that you are removing an opportunity for the audience to perhaps learn something about another culture and also confusing the audience that *does* know something about the culture (and watching anime and reading manga one does pick up on these cultural things pretty fast).

I know I am ranting at this point but this is something that gets to me. I am so very happy that people do take the time to translate and sub these shows and I don't want to come across as ungrateful. As I said I am glad that the alternative exists, I would just hope that it stays as an alternative and does not become the norm.

*Edit: spoiler tag just for safety
>> ARTICLE
I can see where you're coming from and it definitely comes down to preference. There's certainly no perfect answer.

I would say though that, for my preference, the subtitles need word choice that fits the sentence even if it isn't a literal translation. If the literal translation of a typical angry outburst ends up as something like "I don't really like what you did", it loses meaning. The subtitles need to reword the sentence to add the anger back in, because what sounds angry in Japanese may not sound angry in English. It certainly isn't the only way, but profanity is pretty good way to add anger to text in English.

I absolutely agree that localisation can go too far, but for me anyway what was definitely a case of localisation done right, at least within my very small knowledge of Japanese language and culture.
>> ARTICLE
> If the literal translation of a typical angry outburst ends up as something like "I don't really like what you did", it loses meaning

It wouldn't though, it would actually add meaning. It would convey what was said but also the person saying it. Vocabulary is part of the character. If someone stands up and screams: "I don't really like what you did" you can tell that *that* person does not do this alot. This person is not used to screaming at people and perhaps has lived a sheltered life away from conflict until this point. It actually gives us lots of information and creates depth for the character, you get an insight into how this person acts when they lose their cool.

It would be strange for an Ojou-sama person to use words like "fuck" or "shit". If the person however was some street thug that would be nothing out of the ordinary. If a street thug *did* use polite swears that would tell the viewer something about him. 

The important thing in the scene with Nadeko is that she is screaming at all. The cute reserved kid that everyone adores and gets away with everything because she is so sweet, soft and proper, is *screaming* at people. She is supposed to be the ideal kawaii young girl that behaves according to that frame and the frame shatters in this almost taboo breaking of courtesy and politeness. It demonstrates the immense pressure she is cracking under as she throws away her whole built up personality. It is a strong scene as is, to then add in random swears like that just makes it seem as though the translator didn't think the audience would get that this is a big deal already. And to throw in language that only thugs and delinquents would use just clashes with the girl we have gotten to know and for no good reason (again imo of course).

Choice of words tells a lot about who a person is just like in real life and as I said these more fun translations might end up robbing nuance from the story and character. But as you said it is down to preference.

Deserves to be rated way higher if only for having relatable adult characters dealing with real adult problems, a fucking rarity among anime that seems to somehow mostly exist only within PA Works.  They are doing it again pretty well with Kuromukuro!
>> ARTICLE
> Adult characters with adult problems mostly exist only within PA works

I love shirobako as much as the next guy, but angel beats, another, Charlotte and nagi no asukara, their 4 most popular works, are gonna have to disagree with you. 
>> ARTICLE
No one said they can't fuck up, but they are one of few studios I've seen occasionally get relatable adults very right.  None of the shows you listed even have relevant adults in them for it to matter to my point though, they are all high-schoolers.

Nagi no Asukara I've only heard good things about though, gotta get to that one.

Edit: I'm an idiot, I thought you mean those were shows with poorly done teenagers, my bad.
>> ARTICLE
He isn't saying they fucked up, but that their best works feature teenagers.

To give actual examples of fucking up: Glasslip and HaruChika suck.

Heh, yeah, I realized that a couple comments later, whoops!

That's my point though. Nagi is kids ~14 acting, well, their age. 
>> ARTICLE
So... they are good at teenagers too?  Are you saying that is a bad or good thing?  I don't understand.  I just think PA Works is good at making very relatable characters.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I actually think they are. Obviously it's more difficult if you're not a teen to relate to them. I'm not saying it's good nor bad, I was making a point pa works rarely make anime with adult characters (that are decently popular) 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh okay, fair enough.  It's nice when they do though.  As an adult, I appreciate having characters I can relate to, heh.

Yeah it's really important to relate to the characters in nagi, if you can it's a great show! I could see it being one of my favourites if I was a teen :) 
>> ARTICLE
> They are doing it again pretty well with Kuromukuro!

Are they now? I sorta avoided it because PA works shows aren't really known for their action. I may just check it out.
>> ARTICLE
*So far* Kuromukuro has pretty much been a 10/10 for me, or nearly so.  It's a very grounded show.  Like I said, a lot of the adults deal with real adult issues, even in an insane world involving big ol' alien robots.  That is one thing I specifically love when an anime does right, because, as an adult myself, it's nice to see outside of the bog standard highschool shenanigans.  It's nice seeing a guy go through a mid-life crisis because he's lost his way, because *I get that*.  Granted MC's situation in Kuromukuro is worlds apart from mine, but I still understand his feelings.  The same with the female MC's mom as well, even though her presence has been brief.

Then you have all of the other elements which have been fantastic so far.  The comedy has been *on-point*, with the first episode even having probably one of the greatest nudity censorship scenes *of all time*.  I was dying of laughter.  This last episode just had some fantastic jokes and quibbles between the two MCs that had me rolling too.  The characters are great and their interactions are fantastic, you really get a sense of them rather quickly.  The SoL moments are nice in between all the frantic comedy/action for a break, and the action itself has been oh, *oh* so sweet.  The samurai mecha fights have been so beautiful to watch.  The mechs have a real sense of weight to them, and they even make sure to include small details like them slipping on cars and such.  The animation has been consistently good, the music has been fun.  I honestly can't think of a single complaint for the show so far.  It's fantastic.

If you liked Shirobako and PA's style, and if you are cool with mecha and some fun action/comedy with potential for a much darker side to the story, then you will probably like this show.  I'm super happy GG subs decided to pick up Kuromukuro, I don't know how patient I could have been waiting 6 months to get it from Netflix.  I really think this show is *the* underwatched show of the season.

While Araragi is a true hyperbole, every other character is extremely realistic when you really consider their circumstances and the traumas that they've underwent. I always draw the comparison between Shinobu, CC and Holo as "semi-immortals who don't give a shit anymore" done right. The entire show is actually super realistic and deals with very real social issues when you deconstruct all the metaphors. It's good art.

Yes, definitely. Because of that I sometimes get irrationally angry when people say that Bakemonogatari is just a fun ride without any real depth. Although I can see that as years pass it becomes more and more acclaimed, which is nice.

Hunter x Hunter somewhere around episode 109-112 (I think) [HxH 2011 Spoilers](/s "Netereo and Zeno's entrance with the dragon dive. Up to that point I felt the whole operation was hopeless, the whole situation felt like it was one step away from dispair. Then these old geezers entered in a fucking badass way and I was genuinely filled with joy")

I just finished watching Hunter x Hunter for the first time this week, it  actually turned out to be my 100th anime. It was an amazing experience and I kind of feel like there isn't much else to watch now that it's over

The entire last episode of The Tatami Galaxy was a constant stream of catharsis.

Such a brilliant finale.")

in [Hunter x Hunter when Gon](/s "punched the living lights out of Pitou I was so freaking satisfied, as well as when leorio punched Ging i felt so good").
>> ARTICLE
I was going to say when Gon [HxH](/s "Punched Hisoka during their fight in the arena.")
>> ARTICLE
That was good but i didn't dislike Hisoka enough to find it satisfying. Hisoka is a loveable creepy crazy pedo but he is not hateful enough. Like i get that some liked Pitou but what he did to Kite's body pissed me off to much, disgracing the dead in my book is unforgivable. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hate Hisoka either, but just watching Gon get his ass kicked and then coming up with the perfect strategy against an opponent far beyond his level was just so damn satisfying to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I was more concerned than satisfied (though it was still damn satisfying). [](/s "when gon bashed her head in, he sacrificed his humanity in a fit of rage. I knew at that moment that our playful lovable protagonist was gone.")

>> ARTICLE
The most satisfying thing is, whem a series ties all steps of the story together. The kind of moments when everyone who the protagonists helped appears to pay back and support them, the moments realizations flash before their eyes, words spoken, sacrifies made. 

Bonuspoints if it's a long running franchise and the latest installment calls back on moments from previous seasons that lead to the situation. When a fan can feel true bliss because the past isn't just informed, but was experienced.

For me this was the emotional climax of the series and represents a lot of what I love about NGE.  The scene is both hauntingly beautiful and miserably tragic.  Imo it's the ultimate distillation of Shinji's suffering and humanity, framed against the greater context of mankind: NERV, EVAs, Angels and SEELE (and this in turn invokes the rest of the cast of NGE, contrasting Shinji's struggle with that of Misato, Rei and Asuka among others).

 * Planetes - Nono-chan's little soliloquy at the end really put things into perspective. Doubly so when you consider who was with her at the time.  
 * Rumbling Hearts - I either hated or wanted real bad to hate everyone by the end of the series. But then you get to read the story book at the very end. The simple way it draws everything together makes you see how wrong it was to hate anyone. They were just common flawed people trying the best they could in a bad situation. It's that moment when that light goes on that you get the moment of satisfaction *even if* you don't like much of what actually happened.

I'm late to the party, but whatever.

I'm going back a bit to an older show, [Gunbuster.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/Top_wo_Nerae_Gunbuster)

The very last scene in the show, in episode 6.

Episode 6 was entirely in Black and White, which was odd. It was the last major climax of the series. Why would they do Black and White? 

To set up the last scene.

Holy shit. 

[Gunbuster Spoilers](/s "The duo successfully set off the bombs which comprise Buster Machine #3. However, it creates a black hole, and with them so close to the black hole, time slows down super dramatically for them. They expect to drift back to Earth within a few decades, maybe a Century. 12,000 years later, they make it. They think Earth is dead because it's completely dark. But then lights appear, and spell out "Welcome Home." They eject from Gunbuster. Suddenly there's color.")

It was the color that did it for me. Chills. I highly recommend this series. It's odd, but not bad. But I recommend it entirely for the payoff of that very last scene.

Long arm tribe says sup

Isn't his thumb on the wrong side of his hand in the first frame?

>> ARTICLE
First pic shows a left fist, second shows a right fist.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed.. I actually did not notice that, I was so caught up with the double-elbow action.
>> ARTICLE
No I think the thumb is in the right place. It's just that he turns his head to look back at his arm.
>> ARTICLE
It's the wrong side. The first picture shows his presumably left hand. The second shows him holding up his right hand.
>> ARTICLE
In the first picture that's his right hand I think.
>> ARTICLE
Make a fist with both hands. Now look at them and compare to the first frame 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but if you put your arm out to the right of you and twist your fist slightly, then turn your head. The perspective can be recreated perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, they just broke the [180' rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule) by flipping the camera to the other side. The thumb is correct.
>> ARTICLE
I think this is exactly it. After watching this clip I think it can be argued that their animation is plausible, they just made it look confusing.
>> ARTICLE
The thumb is not correct. First shot, left hand, second shot, right hand. 
>> ARTICLE
The art on this show gives me a migraine
>> ARTICLE
So close, op.
>> ARTICLE
No, the mistake is still there.
The top frame is his left hand, but the bottom frame depicts it's supposed to be his right.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this is a mistake. He's probably part of the long-arm tribe, which has extra segments in the arms.
>> ARTICLE
That is the joke. I just didn't really know about the long arm tribe until now. Or maybe I forgot, I'm not sure. I just got back into One Piece, I haven't read it for 3 or 4 years (when I stopped the manga had just got to Fish-Man Island).
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Fish-Man Island was 3 or 4 years ago? Can't believe it's been that long.
>> ARTICLE
It's crazy. I still can't believe it started when I was in elementary. Here's to hoping Oda and GRRM can finish their series.
>> ARTICLE
Oda's 39, so I'm not too worried about him dying of old age before One Piece is finished.
>> ARTICLE
First appearance of the longarm tribe was the weird instrument guy of the supernovas on Sabaody, iirc. But he didn't really reference anyone else with 4 elbows. The next ones were the ones who captured/managed Brooke.
>> ARTICLE
I love One Piece. But I still find the art style extremely untidy. Which is why I can't get people to watch it for their first time. But it doesn't stop me watching the anime and it adds to the entire charm of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love the art in the manga, but the anime is definitely on and off.
>> ARTICLE
The funniest part about it is that because the art is so horrific in One Piece, anatomy mistakes are everywhere.  Not even pointing out the mistake of it being a left fist / right fist, just look at Zoro.  His head is the size of a grape! Exaggeration aside, his head is a lot smaller than the rest of his body proportionally.

One Piece is my favorite anime, but their art can hardly be called sub-par...Does't change the fact I'll watch the fuck out of it.
>> ARTICLE
god the art is so bad in this show

well, once a series goes beyond 500 episodes, you can't really expect the quality to be on par with madhouse or ufotable shows

It's much better than naruto and bleach. Even though they all seem to follow the same pattern. Meet enemies, power up, defeat enemies. However one piece has more comedy in it.

The 4kids version was an offense to humanity. I'm just getting into it, and the Funi dub is awesome. I'm watching them as Funi adds them weekly to Hulu. Just got to the Wopple arc.


Also, I totally want to get into Detective Conan/Case Closed, but I want to watch it dubbed. Did they continue to dub them? Is there anywhere I can watch them streaming, like on Hulu? I love the autoplay feature Hulu has, where you can just queue different shows up, or play all of one show.

We interrupt this Reddit service announcement to bring you the following news bulletin...

Please watch Gurren Lagaan.

I've watched all of Gurren Lagaan recently and by the end, it truly changed my life. It throws you the most amazing thing you'd never think would happen, then comes back and does it again times 10. It is always consistent on this every time.

Everyone I've managed to talk into watching Gurren Lagaan will bow down to its awesomeness. It has created the greatest and most manly figures anime has ever know and I don't consider most people *human* until they've seen the entire series at least once. Look at this subreddit alien, if you don't believe me. The tale woven is the most gripping, heartfelt, intense...I couldn't make up an adjective to describe it perfectly.

Disclaimer: GL is NOT a mech anime. Sure, it has mechs in it, but it also has shoes. You would just as soon call it a shoe anime. Do not be put off by the fact that there are battles in mechs, because GL extends so much farther beyond that.

The dub is acceptable, in my personal opinion, but you'll always be safe watching subbed and experiencing it as it truly should be.

TLDR- Gurren Lagaan is good, you should watch it.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled service announcement.

Breathtaking.

I watched the first few episodes but something didn't click with me. Maybe the personality of the main character or the animation. I been thiking on giving it a chance but haven't yet.
>> ARTICLE
The only reason I started One Piece was because some friends insisted I watch it. 

For some reason the show didn't 'click' with me until i got to the 20th or so episode, but now I'm up to episode 436.
>> ARTICLE
At first it's hard to know what to think of Luffy, he's obviously an idiot, and that never changes.  But there is depth to his character that is hard to imagine in the first few episodes of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I will try reading the manga later. I thinkt he art style doesn't help me liking Luffy, with that stupid smile in his face.
>> ARTICLE
I realise this is 5 months late but I too have a really hard time convincing people just how good One Piece is.

It does take a while to click for some reason though. Ussop and Luffy 'disagreement' at Water 7 was the one of the major penny dropping moments for how deep this Anime really is.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say One Piece is one of the only solid "long running" series I'v yet to see, but part of that is why I lack interest. I tend to like series that have more resolution to them. 


Regardless of my taste, I see the appeal of One Piece.

What are you talking about, you can watch it in 720P, that's a pretty high resolution.

Well played.

Gants and Berserk, are personally my favorites, when it comes to this topic. Though I do watch and read One Piece, and it's getting quite interesting now. Give Gantz or Berserk a try xD

I'm gonna go check out Gants. I loved Beserk, too bad the last episodes never got made :(

EDIT: There is no anime called gants....
>> ARTICLE
It's called Gantz...with a Z....here is a link to a dubbed site. - http://anime-media.com/category/gantz/
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, watching it now!
>> ARTICLE
I watched ~100 episodes or so, waiting for it to click or something. It never did.

So I disagree.
>> ARTICLE
How much of One Piece is filler?  I really loved Bleach until they started doing filler episodes and filler arcs, and really long drawn-out scenes where several episodes are needed to just portray 5 minutes of actual action.  That shit kills a series DEAD, IMO.  Why do anime makers even do that?  Either tell a story in a timely fashion or don't bother, please.  Long-running series are good when there's actually, you know, IMPORTANT STUFF HAPPENING.  I know about anime series being made before the manga is finished and that's supposedly why such tactics are used, but really, would it be THAT hard just to actually wait until the manga IS done?  And THEN make the anime?  with perfect scene-for-scene accuracy?  That would be good.
>> ARTICLE
There is a bit of filler scattered around, no long running anime is immune to it.  But it is NEVER brought back into the main anime, it's never more than a few episodes long, and (I had the same problem with naruto and bleach, stopped watching them altogether because of it), it's somewhat bearable.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I may have to check it out then.  The english dub I saw on Cartoon Network gave me a bad impression, but then, so did InuYasha, and when I finally got around to reading the actual manga for that, I discovered, to my surprise, that I liked it.

On an unrelated note, OneManga.com and MangaFox.com are great places to read entire manga series online, for FREE.

It took me a month to watch 250ish episodes when I was a child and had a lot more free time.

Up to around 610-620 something like that.

Can I request the story?

Of One Piece or why I watched it so quickly?

For the prior just read the manga, the manga is legitimately great.

For the latter I had just gotten into anime and finished binging all the harems I could find, remembered watching One Piece as a kid, began binge watching.
>> ARTICLE
What was your routine for that one month you were binge watching?

Ehm I watched it in 2 and a half weeks although i skipped the occasional fillers like that davy back shit.
>> ARTICLE
It took my a little less than 2 weeks for the ~500 episodes it had at the time.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it in a little over a week, but then again when i watched it it had around 400 episodes

that wasn't filler...

but it was non-essential and, let's face it, boring.

There there, its all ogre now.

I should have realized you can't watch 600+ episodes in 6 days

2x or 4x speed in MPC. Or 4 windows at once. Yeahhhh!

Read the manga. That's the fastest way.


And if you really just wanna watch the anime, leave out the [filler eps](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece).
>> ARTICLE
I think that will take even longer than the anime...and as I said in the post, I would like to listen to the dub so I can do other things while I listen. You can't really do anything else while reading a manga.
>> ARTICLE
Just read the manga by volumes.  Just read a couple volumes a week.  Depending on your reading speed, a volume should take you 30 minutes to an hour. Also the manga is the best way to experience the series as the anime can extend, and change things in the adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
It depends on your reading speed, but more or less at this point, they're stretching out manga chapters over mutliple episodes.  So if it say takes 5 minutes to read one One Piece chapter, compare that to the 20+ minutes it will take to adapt that material.  
>> ARTICLE
I am a speed reader, but I don't think you should speed-read manga. Kind of defeats the purpose. Also we run into the issue before that I'd like to listen to it. Do they make manga on audiobook? That'd be weird...
>> ARTICLE
It will take you a long time no matter which way you choose. It started 18 years ago.

That is true. I'm not in a "rush" per se, but it does seem like a long, long time to devote to one thing. I'm just asking people that may know more than I do if there's a good way to catch up by cutting out huge chunks - like a catch-up movie. I know some shows do this.
>> ARTICLE
I still think the manga is a better, and faster way of enjoying One Piece. The anime suffers from horrendous pacing problems by extending scenes from the manga for too long (i.e., 3 panels in the manga translated into 6 friggin episodes in the anime because of fillers and flashbacks).

Not only that but the manga has a lot of trivia, ask-the-author sections that are really enjoyable to read that you won't get from the anime.

Edit: corrected stuff
>> ARTICLE
Woah, really? 3 panels to 6 episodes? Are you kidding?
>> ARTICLE
totally serious. Water Seven arc, during the time the protagonists bust through the gate via the rocket train and were falling. Just that part was extended to 6 episodes, 1 for each character in the current lineup (sans Robin) because each of them had a flashback episode about how they got from where they were to where they are now as they were falling.
>> ARTICLE
> horrendous pacing problems

[One Pace](http://onepace.net/)
>> ARTICLE
There is a faster way to watch the anime than what is suggested in the comments. Basically you download the One Pace episodes 

>One Pace is the paced version of the One Piece anime, packed together to match the manga more accurately. It involves cutting and merging the episodes together to create a more manga-like experience for the viewers who are tired of the One Piece animes slow pace.

The only thing though is that it doesn't do that for all the episodes so you'll have to mix up the normal episodes with the edited episodes
>> ARTICLE
Is there a specific place you'd get it or shall I try my Google-fu?
>> ARTICLE
You can find the necessary information by searching on /r/OnePiece 
>> ARTICLE
You can cut about 1/5 an episode by skipping the OP and ED. Other than that, you could skip some filler.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a quick way to do this? I have a Crunchyroll sub. Netflix does this to some shows, but I know Crunchyroll doesn't do it. I also noticed that there's some "intro" to a few episodes before the intro runs that I might miss if I just skip the first 2 minutes or so.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch on crunchyroll people usually tell you when the ops and summaries are over in the comments 
>> ARTICLE
Most intros are about 90 seconds to 2 minutes, and you just move on once the ED starts playing, thats how I do it OP
>> ARTICLE
Not a very eloquent solution. I was looking for something more hands-free, but nothing is perfect. Do you know anywhere that has the entire dub run?

[deleted]

read the manga by volume.
>> ARTICLE
There isn't really a way to do that unless you want to skip some good parts. You CAN skip skypeia arc, you CAN skip thriller bark (but u will miss out on the coming of a character). 

In my opinion you should just marathon watch it during holidays/breaks aka no life that shit. If you don't have time for that just stick with only watching that every night for some months.

EDIT: BTW just DONT watch the dub in water 7 and enis lobby arc.. Just don't.
>> ARTICLE
Two and a half months is a long time to devote to one anime...I'm afraid I'll get burnt out on it, is my main issue there.

EDIT to your EDIT: Why? Any particular reason?
>> ARTICLE
Nah you won't :). If you liked it up to 100 episodes you will absolutely LOVE what's to come in about 100 and you will keep wanting more and more so I don't think that will be a problem.

EDIT to your EDIT: Emotions are way better portrayed in the sub IMO which will make the series a better experience in those arcs.
>> ARTICLE
As long as you watch more than 1 episode per week, you'll catch up EVENTUALLY at least. Binge watching 600+ episodes is really bad, just watch when you feel like it
>> ARTICLE
Just take your time and enjoy all the episodes, there is no need to hurry. After you catch up you'll have to wait every week for another episode. 
>> ARTICLE
You'll catch up eventually, just watch when you feel like it and skip the fillers. No rush.
>> ARTICLE
Just watch an episode when you get a chance. Don't worry about "catching up." The nice thing about One Piece being so long is that for the forseeable future, you will always have something to watch if you just wanna watch something.

What I'm doing with Fairy Tail right now is I'm watching 1 arc, then I go and watch some other stuff for a while, and then I come back and watch another arc. I know that FT isn't nearly as long as OP, but you could always try something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, abandon all ship. *Do not watch the anime if you value your life/time*. There's simply too much for it to be reasonably possible.

If you really want to catch up on One Piece, I heavily recommend reading the manga instead. You can read it at your own pace, which will almost always be faster than it would be to watch an episode. Once you've mostly caught up to that ,you can switch over to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Grit your teeth. Clench your fist. Unzip your pants. Read the manga. 

Seriously, if you *really* want to catch up, the fastest way is probably to just read the manga. Other than that, it's just watch as much as you can as often as you can. My friend is now 300ish episodes into Naruto and it only took him 3 or 4 months I think, so it's not *impossible*.

I prefer the HxH anime over One Piece anyday, but I'm a bigger fan of One Piece's manga and universe.  
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is better at world building and telling a great story as well as focusing on lots of characters. HxH is good at telling a good story but has way better fighting sequences. They also do a good job focusing on a smaller group of characters be it antagonists or protagonists. One Piece kills HxH in the manga but the anime is complete opposite. They both are great and deserve to be where they are at but at this current rate One Piece will just continue to pull ahead even more since no new content for HxH is being released 
>> ARTICLE
What does him liking One Piece have to do with this argument lol
>> ARTICLE
He loves one piece but if a majority of ppl believe Hunter is better he may feel more inclined to stick with it
>> ARTICLE
That's certainly some odd logic. I think it's better just to say "hey you like _____, this has _____ so like check it out" than having people say it's better than something he likes strongly.
>> ARTICLE
I like One Piece for the Plot and HxH has better character development, what I dint like for hxh though is that the narrator *especially* on the chimera ant arc spoiling crucial information when I am still in the middle of figuring what happens next on my own is all
>> ARTICLE
Why won't he watch it? If he's just a One Piece fanboy and therefore all other shows are shit then don't bother. Just tell him to watch it and form his own opinion. Arguing will get you nowhere since it'll just boil down to "my favorite anime is better than this one I haven't seen".
>> ARTICLE
> "my favorite anime is better than this one I haven't seen".

I mean, he watched *10* episodes of Hunter x Hunter. His opinion isn't going to magically change considering he's a long ways away from Yorknew City. The golden rule of 3 episodes is perfect for me, if someone doesn't like an episode 3 episodes in it should be perfectly fine for them to drop it and voice their opinions on it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see how this is relevant to what I said. What I was talking about was him disliking things he hasn't seen, you even quoted me saying "better than this one *I haven't seen*".

And seeing 3 episodes of a 1-cour show is different than watching 10 of a 148 episode one.

Also OP didn't have how many episodes he watched when I replied.
>> ARTICLE
So you have to watch the *entirety* of a show to get your opinion on it? I don't need to eat an entire cake to know I don't like it, likewise I don't need to watch all 148 episodes of a show to know I don't like it. That would just be a waste of my time for a show I know i'm going to hate anyways, forcing people to sit through a show they dislike is only going to make them more vocal about their dislike towards that show.

>And seeing 3 episodes of a 1-cour show is different than watching 10 of a 148 episode one.

That golden rule goes for all shows, not just 1 cour or 2 cour. Besides, if someone isn't hooked after *five* hours of a show, I don't see why the hell they should have to continue it. It doesn't matter if it's only 5 hours out of 74, that's still a fuckton of time. Not to mention Hunter x Hunter doesn't start to get interesting for most people until Yorknew, and then Greed Island happens and its just 3 steps back at that point. As I said watching more won't magically change his opinion of Hunter x Hunter.

Doesn't really matter since you're standing by your statement, aren't you?
>> ARTICLE
> So you have to watch the entirety of a show to get your opinion on it?

What the fuck are you talking about? You said it yourself, "His opinion isn't going to magically change considering he's a long ways away from Yorknew City." Implying Yorknew city arc is a change in tone for HxH, meaning he has to at least watch until that to get what HxH really is all about.

>I don't need to eat an entire cake to know I don't like it

Terrible example? Cakes don't change in flavor, shows change in tone, drastically so at times, you said it yourself.

>That golden rule goes for all shows, not just 1 cour or 2 cour.

AGAIN, you said it yourself, HxH changes in tone with Yorknew, which starts in like, episode 40 or something. don't do 3-episode rule for a 148 episode show, give it way more than that, and since you like misinterpreting things, NOT the entire thing.

>if someone isn't hooked after five hours of a show, I don't see why the hell they should have to continue it.

Five hours is a whole one cour, not even the first arc of HxH. It's painfully obvious the 3 episode rule doesn't work for all shows.

>Doesn't really matter since you're standing by your statement, aren't you?

Way to sound like an asshole? You're the one misunderstanding my comment so much and putting words in my mouth?

And I really, really don't even understand what your point is, not in this comment or the first one. Maybe I'm just dumb or you should structure your thoughts better.
>> ARTICLE
>meaning he has to at least watch until that to get what HxH really is all about.

Is still too much and you can not just take those two arcs and forget that the rest existed
>> ARTICLE
> What the fuck are you talking about? You said it yourself, "His opinion isn't going to magically change considering he's a long ways away from Yorknew City." Implying Yorknew city arc is a change in tone for HxH, meaning he has to at least watch until that to get what HxH really is all about.

Did you even read all of what I wrote? Notice how I said *in that very same sentence* "and then Greed Island happens and its just 3 steps back at that point". Hunter x Hunter's tone isn't decided by Yorknew City and I never implied that it was, in fact I implied that its the opposite and that it is the exception.

>Terrible example? Cakes don't change in flavor, shows change in tone, drastically so at times, you said it yourself.

Cakes can also change drastically in flavor depending on what you buy, but normally shows and cakes are expected to maintain the same tone/flavor throughout the entire thing. Not to mention like I said, HxH doesn't change in tone, Yorknew is the exception to the rule.

>Five hours is a whole one cour, not even the first arc of HxH. It's painfully obvious the 3 episode rule doesn't work for all shows.

Of course the 3 episode rule doesn't work for all shows, there are even 1 cour shows like Classroom Crisis where they change halfway through. I still wont fault someone if they watched the first 3 episodes and dropped it, because its the studio and writer's responsibility to create hook for their story and establish what it's about. Madoka does this perfectly since the writers knew about the Golden Rule and saved the big plot twist for the last second and as a result got the viewers hooked.

>Way to sound like an asshole? You're the one misunderstanding my comment so much and putting words in my mouth?

How does that make me sound like an asshole? It wasn't intended to come by that way, i'm just saying that your last sentence doesn't matter if you stand by what you're saying. That's not even putting words into your mouth.

>And I really, really don't even understand what your point is, not in this comment or the first one. Maybe I'm just dumb or you should structure your thoughts better.

My point is, is that someone doesn't need to watch an entire show to say it's shit. I don't see how my point could have been missed and i'm not calling you dumb so don't try to put that on me.
>> ARTICLE

Hunter x Hunter's tone isn't decided by Yorknew City and I never implied that it was, in fact I implied that its the opposite and that it is the exception.

Sure, HxH's whole tone isn't decided by Yorknew, Yorknew just shows you how dark it *can* get, evidenced by the arc following the greed island arc, chimera ant, which goes much more darker than Yorknew.

>Of course the 3 episode rule doesn't work for all shows, there are even 1 cour shows like Classroom Crisis where they change halfway through.

Madoka does this perfectly since the writers knew about the Golden Rule and saved the big plot twist for the last second and as a result got the viewers hooked.

Again, I don't see your point, that's exactly what I'm saying. You were saying the 3 episode rule also worked for HxH, which isn't true, but you apparently don't think it's true too, so why did you say that it is? You're contradicting yourself and confusing me at the same time.

In your second comment you said:

>That golden rule goes for all shows

and in the third one you said:

>Of course the 3 episode rule doesn't work for all shows

What?

>My point is, is that someone doesn't need to watch an entire show to say it's shit. I don't see how my point could have been missed and i'm not calling you dumb so don't try to put that on me.

You're just reiterating points I already said. I know someone doesn't need to watch a whole show to say it's shit, I never said that, or meant to say that in any way at all.

At this point you're contradicting with yourself so much in consecutive comments that I don't know if you're trolling or not, so I'm just going to stop this pointless argument and go do something more useful than argue with you about things we have the same opinion on. 
>> ARTICLE
> Sure, HxH's whole tone isn't decided by Yorknew, Yorknew just shows you how dark it can get, evidenced by the arc following the greed island arc, chimera ant, which goes much more darker than Yorknew.

It doesn't matter at all how dark the show gets if it doesn't maintain that tone. Just because a comedian does one good joke in an entire act, does not make the entire act worth sitting through because he didn't maintain the consistency of his comedy.

>Again, I don't see your point, that's exactly what I'm saying. You were saying the 3 episode rule also worked for HxH, which isn't true, but you apparently don't think it's true too, so why did you say that it is? You're contradicting yourself and confusing me at the same time.

I said the rule stands for all shows, i'm not saying it doesn't work as in you can't apply it to all shows, i'm saying that it could be applied to all shows but it doesn't guarantee that you'll only drop the shows you wont end up liking. But again, that's the fault of the writers if they can't convey what their show is going to be like within the first hour and a half.

>You're just reiterating points I already said. I know someone doesn't need to watch a whole show to say it's shit, I never said that, or meant to say that in any way at all.

Then why are you having a problem with OP's friend dropping HxH 10 episodes in?
>> ARTICLE
Is there a specific reason he isn't wanting to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
He thought the first 10 eps were to slow and kiddish and quit. I watched 90 eps of One Piece and never got hooked. I guess it's just not dark and gritty enough for me.
>> ARTICLE
but... arlong arc... :'(

>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen, the biggest differences between HxH and One Piece is the length of the fights and the focus on side characters. In one piece, the fights start short and sweet, but later build into massive 10+ ep fights, while in HxH, each fight is compacted into a single episode. And there is no denial that HxH has pretty much everyone beat in how they develop side characters WAYYYY more than other shows do.

Another way to look at it is this: In One Piece, the Luffy is the hinging point of each arc. He is the main player in every story. (bar marineford) In HxH, Gon is almost NEVER the main player, instead acting in the shadows of monsters around him.

Personally, I think HxH is better written than One Piece, but I love both of them equally. If only HxH would ever update... :(

(Ps, while yes, there are better stories in HxH down the road, if the first few episodes don't hook him, than he probably won't care much for the rest of it. Tell him thanks for trying it out!)
>> ARTICLE
As a fan of both, if we're strictly talking about anime, then HxH is much better than OP. Manga wise, One Piece is better. Honestly, I loved Hunter x Hunter more as it's darker and more surprising than One Piece, but OP is a really close second.

The greatest edge of One Piece over HxH is the fact that it's still ongoing (and exciting!), and it will have a legitimate ending someday. If Hunter x Hunter will continue, I think it has the potential to be better.
>> ARTICLE
Watching just a part of One Piece is like only looking at one inch of a really big and awesome painting. For me, there wasn't a specific moment where I decided that I was past the point of just enjoying it. I just kind of realized after awhile that I really loved everything about it. Someone on another sub said it in a better way, that "One Piece isn't about specific arcs or moments, it's about the trip." The difference between them for me is that everything in OP seems more natural. HxH had a good plot, but that's all it had- a good plot. The actions, reactions, and emotional moments experienced by characters in OP feel real, and I think that's why people can get really connected to the world and characters.
HxH was really well written, and I enjoyed the story a lot, but I guess that was it. I can say "that moment in HxH was sad/cool/funny", but I can't bring myself to feel too emotional about it.
In all honesty, I can't say I've ever met someone who's watched either and not enjoyed them, but it's One Piece for me.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that kind of unfair because of HxH having 110 episodes and OP having >700?

Ive seen all of hxh 2011 and about 320 episodes of one piece so far and as much as i love one pieces world and the fact that oda is way more consistent than togashi.

Yeah. Ninjas. I dropped the show after a while I loved bleach the urban fantasy show but then there where like 700 episodes where the take a road trip to the afterlife and the show became inyuasha. It was after he found out that his sword was actually the bad guy from the cowboy bebop movie. I stopped watch shortly after because half the characters I liked stopped showing up and the lady main character became, like, catatonic and the whole show changed tone completely but there where ninjas. Ghost ninjas. They wore black jumped around with swords and shit. Ostensibly their job was to kill ghosts so they would be double dead and go to the afterlife but we never really saw them do that. They where all just kind of guards for this city in the afterlife that was for some reason pre-industrial but they sucked at being guards because like 5 guys break in and just kinda wander around for like 3 years or however long that arc was. I may be remembering things wrong but a ghost guy in black with a sword is at least as much of a ninja as a 12 year old in an orange track suit who does nothing but yell.

Bleach is like Fairy Tail, you like the first 30-50 episodes, but then... the author(s) seem to run out of ideas and cram some entirely different anime down your throat and abandon core character flaws/interactions/plot-hooks.

Bleach has a lot more to it then fairy tail and from my view doesn't seem to change into a different anime but it does have some flaws. But i agree 100% on Fairy Tail, it like a shitty fan fiction of One Piece.

Fairy Tail has more substance than Bleach. Kubo Tite's entire idea of a plot consists of a damsel imprisoned somewhere where the protagonist has to go through a new area with progressively stronger enemies to reach her. Oh and leveling up behind the scenes. There, I just described the last 450 chapters of Bleach.

If you mention Naruto or Bleach in an anime forum expect downvotes from people.  It would be like claiming to like a really popular band on an indie music forum.

When it follows Ichigo the plot is fairly boring and shallow. Right now in the manga we haven't seen anything from Ichigo from weeks and the story has focuses around the soul society characters (back story, people actually dieing) and it's so much better. Bleach would have done so much better without a main protagonist in my opinion.

That's why I said the last 450 chapters instead of the last 500. The most recent arc is much better but again, Ichigo is going to level up behind the scenes and show up to beat the most dangerous of villians.

Nope. Not one bit. I watched the entire series skipping filler last year and it didn't effect my viewing experience. Was it slow at parts? Yeah. However without so many people talking about it on /r/OnePiece I would have never noticed. 

What it fails on with pacing is made up for IMO by the great voice acting, well done important scenes, and awesome music. 

EDIT: I should say that yes I do read the manga and yes I can tell when certain things are drawn out. However it's good enough for me personally.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you still enjoy it, seriously! I agree, the voice acting and the music are both very good. The anime isn't horrible in its current state, and it is definitely very watchable. Have you seen Hunter x Hunter (2011) though? That's the kind of treatment I think One Piece deserves. I guess my problem revolves more around my perception of Toei's work ethic/practices (which I might be wrong about).  
>> ARTICLE
HxH has a tonne of material to work with. One Piece needs to avoid catching up with its manga. That's all there is to it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man no I definitely agree with you. I WISH that it had a better adaptation, like Hunter X Hunter (ESPECIALLY SO HXH FANS COULD SEE HOW GREAT IT IS), but honestly I'm just happy there IS a One Piece anime.

I'm not a fan of Toei either, but they do the important stuff right and that's a lot of what I care about. This all being said the anime hasn't been nearly as bad as it was during Fishman Island or Punk Hazard, and I think things are looking up for it as far as pacing goes because Dressrosa is just so incredibly action packed (hasn't hit that breakneck pace yet, but it will in the next month or two.) and lends itself to being animated.
>> ARTICLE
Yup trying to watch the anime after reading the manga was definitely very hard. The pacing of the anime is just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow and I've given up watching it entirely.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care much about the animation quality. Its not amazing but its passable. What I can't get behind is the bullshit pacing. They fucking destroyed the punk hazard arc. I watched the One Pace version of the arc and its glorious. 

Speaking of, One Pace is a project by some fans who edit the episodes by removing filler scenes. They compress like 2-3 episodes to like 30 minutes. I really recommend watching these if you feel like marathoning any arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice, I'll definitely check it out!
>> ARTICLE
I just started One Piece(the anime). I don't really care for manga in general, so I highly doubt I'll be getting into that. 

That said, I was always against the shounen extended episode series. I hated the fact that they all had fillers and no end game in mind. Then I started HxH, and with much reluctance, I started OP this summer because I found some excess free time.

I'm actually pleasantly surprised with what I've seen so far. Yes, the battles take like 6 episodes when they should only take 2 max, but I've come to terms with the fact that that is just how it is.  

I haven't gotten to the time skip obviously, but I think as a casual viewer as opposed to a OP fanatic, I'll be more inclined to just take the changes in stride. Is that accurate?

Well it's not like they just animate them standing there. It is intense.

>Or why I should be so invested to care that much.

If you're watching One Piece you're probably going to be invested in it. If you don't find yourself invested in it, you're not going to enjoy it one bit. I don't see how that's so hard to imagine.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, as a casual viewer I doubt you'll have any problems with the anime. I'm more of an OP fanatic (I like to think of myself as somewhat reasonable though), so I can't help but compare the source material with the adaptation. I also tend to take art very seriously, which puts me at odds with many business practices (such as Toei's).

This is not Toei's fault. Well at least not entirely. The issue is that there are several things you can do when you are catching up to your source material. You can add filler. You can go on a break. You can try and stretch things out. For One Piece they have done the first and last option. This is the most common choice for long running anime, and the reason why is because it's the choice that makes the most money. Going on a break means that the show is not going to be making money during that time. One Piece is Toei's cash cow, it just doesn't make sense for them to chose that option. Also it might not be entirely in their hands to chose. We don't know the contract details they have with Shounen Jump so we don't know if it's up to them whether they stop and wait for more material to be made.

In the case of HunterxHunter the series was made, caught up to it's source, and then stopped. After a few years an OVA came out, then another, then another. And then they gave it a reboot. It had a huge amount of material it could cover at it's own pace in the reboot. However thanks to a hiatus for the manga it is now fast catching up. Soon we will find out what their decision will be. Will they add filler? Will the show go on break? Will they stretch things out? Well the last choice is obvious because they already did so, but they did it in the most flawlessly executed manner I have seen. They avoided using reaction shots, long scenes of people running, pointless dialogue, and all the other tactics we see in One Piece, Naruto, and other long running shows. Instead they made use of the narration and visuals to delve deeper into the psychological issues going on. This is a tactic that would not work for other shows because they don't have that level of depth to delve into. The show began deeply exploring the minds of it's characters, how they reacted to situations, and how they changed from the events that were occurring. It was a wonderful feat that Dean pulled off, but Toei could not have chosen to do the same because One Piece simply does not have that element to it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not bothered by Toei simply because they slowed down the pace. At the end of the day, it is as you said; they don't have much of a choice (I would have preferred a lot of filler though). Even without the slow pacing, (IMO) One Piece lacks the overall quality (animation-wise) that other shows such as HxH have. Even when they bring in their top animators for the important scenes, the results aren't always impressive (again, compared to HxH which is pretty consistent). 

The anime itself is far from horrible, but the manga is definitely a superior work of art. This shouldn't be the case (again, IMO). Anyway, as you said, it might not be entirely in Toei's hands.  **Edit: Check out eighthgear's comment down below.**

Last note, I'm not sure Madhouse actually stretched out HxH as you said. I think the "stretching out" is a result of the massive amount of narration present in the manga. One block of narration from the manga takes 5-10 seconds to read, whilst that same block of narration is 30 seconds long in the anime (essentially because it needs to be separated into individual sentences). I like the fact we weren't given still shots during the vast amount of narration though. Madhouse really did a good job.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah even if the manga slowed down as well, the way they kept it interesting with that slow pace was phenomenal. Also yeah I see where you are coming from with One Piece's animation being not as good, but to me that doesn't "ruin" the show. The pacing does however.
>> ARTICLE
>an arguably slow-paced story even slower (one episode = one chapter ever since Thriller Bark IIRC)

I prefer this to filler episodes al la Naruto and Bleach. Especially Bleach which would interrupt mid fight for filler. 

>It should be one of the better produced animes out there, but it isn't

If the production was sped up, the total cost for the project overall might lead to a premature end. HxH is in danger of running out of consent so the cost won;t balloon easily out of control, One Piece is a massive story that would be all too easily become unapproachable since the story has been consistently moving forward since 1999

I also believe Ods'a distinct and really fantastic style doesn;t really translate easily to an Anime Adaptation. HxH is drawn like every other show out there (In terms of style not character originality) whereas One Piece is as close to a new style as Anime gets while still being Anime. 

So, it's slow pace because the alternative is filler which no one likes or hiatuses that might become indefinite if another show populates the timeslot. Fair trade in my mind

Production costs are kept down because unlike almost any other series, One Piece has a longevity that could quickly make it look like a bad investment if the per episode cost was multiplied by hundreds of times. (Remember the money could be used on short high production shows as an alternative with a large sum so that might make more money quickly is OP episodes were comparable). 


>> ARTICLE
HXH is ending because it caught up to the manga, not because it has a high production value. Also One Piece is one of the big three so it rakes in a ton of cash I doubt they would find financial issues by raising the quality.
>> ARTICLE
>HXH is ending because it caught up to the manga, not because it has a high production value.

yeah, my point though was *because* the material is currently finite it's easer to budget 5,000,000 yen per episode because the number is currently capped by the manga. 

With One Piece being a perennial investment a smaller investment would make more sense since it's a perpetual cost to ensure the budget for it doesn't get blown out.

As big as One Piece is, the Anime itself likely has trouble proving as a good an investment as a new IP. It might be consistent, but a smash hit 13-26 episode series with more spent per episode could easily make more money then One Piece. It it less risk for less return and so a lower investment

When you consider merch sales and licensing for the various One Piece attractions around the place, the Manga would be the biggest source of drive anyway considering it is truly a massive selling series and often outsells the second and third best selling places combined. 

So because they already have merch sales totting up, the anime wouldn;t have as big a Return on Investment as a new show, so the value on each episode is lowered along with the budget.

*Hypothesis only :p*
>> ARTICLE
Around Merman island I stopped watching and switched to manga only, before I was reading the manga and watching the anime weekly, the pacing has just become so bad.

I'll wait until Toei finally does filler for OP again before I watch again.
>> ARTICLE
> The anime started off fine, but Toei slowly butchered it. First, they changed the format, making an arguably slow-paced story even slower

I'm going to stop you there, because Toei doesn't have 100% control over the pacing of One Piece. Anime is produced by production committees, and whilst Toei is on the One Piece production committee (majority of the time studios are not even members of these committees, they are just basically contract workers), so is the publisher Shueisha, which publishes the manga. Pacing is determined by people called "series composers" who are hired directly by the production committee, and the production committee retains creative control over an anime. In particular, the publisher of the original source material, so Shueisha, in this case, actually has final say over creative decisions. If One Piece is horribly paced (and I don't know if it is, I've never watched the show), that is the fault of multiple entities, not just Toei.

> Out of respect for the author's work, Toei should take its adaptation more seriously

As I mentioned, the publisher of the work, Shueisha, sits on the production committee and is intimately involved in the anime. Technically speaking with adaptations the original creator ("gensakusha" in Japanese) - so the author - is recognized as having overall creative control, but generally speaking they are represented by their publishers. You know, because most manga authors are too busy making manga and don't have experience making anime. So for basic purposes it is the role of Shueisha to represent the author of One Piece.

> They should stop treating it as a cash cow, and start treating it as art.

Shueisha and Toei treat One Piece as a cash cow because One Piece is a cash cow.

There is this common notion here that studios somehow just buy the rights to a manga or LN series and then just do whatever the hell they want with it. That's simply not how it works. Manga and LN publishing firms like Shueisha, Kadokawa, Kodansha, etc are big players in the anime industry not only because they provide a lot of the source material for anime, but because they are intimately involved in the process that sees their intellectual property turned into anime.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! This is the kind of reply I was hoping for. Very insightful. Unfortunately, it doesn't really change my position. Replacing every "Toei" from my original post with "production committee" doesn't change much.

I am not completely ignorant. I've seen Bakuman you know!!! Seriously though, I am somewhat aware of these publishers' role in the anime industry (from the source material, to green lighting an anime). Admittedly, I wasn't aware these publishers had seats in production committees. I thought Toei Animation *was* the production committee (and was bound by a contract with Shuiesha, essentially telling them what they can and can't do with the series/license). 

> Shueisha and Toei treat One Piece as a cash cow because One Piece is a cash cow.

Yes, but my point is One Piece is first and foremost art, and should be treated as such. Obviously, this isn't how the world works, so my whining about won't change anything. I know having a business perspective is incredibly important (sometimes more so than an artistic perspective). Nonetheless, some studios are amazing when it comes to letting their artistic side shine through their work. Toei Animation, not so much.

Again, thanks for the insightful comment!

Yeah, production committees are weird things. They are basically ad-hoc organizations formed by multiple companies. Publishers, media distributors, et cetera. Sometimes even record labels or merchandise manufacturers will get involved. Every production committee is different. A lot of times studios don't even sit on production committees - they are just paid to animate a series, and that is what they do. This is one of the exceptions, because Toei is on the committee.

> Yes, but my point is One Piece is first and foremost art, and should be treated as such. Obviously, this isn't how the world works, so my whining about won't change anything.

Fair enough. Hunter x Hunter would be a good example of a series that is being far better treated by the people turning it into anime, I suppose. Like I said, I haven't seen One Piece so I can't really comment that much on the show itself.

I find that really interesting, because after Thriller Bark was when Precure started going through changes in animation and general quality. To compare two of the points you mentioned, Thriller Bark coincided with Yes Precure 5 Gogo, which had the animation quality of something several years older than 2008. The same year Punk Hazard started in the anime, they were just wrapping up Smile Precure, which featured fights [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VMXN4XuiI). 

I forgot when I started writing this, but Oda considers Precure his nemesis because his daughters like it more than One Piece. This coincidence is actually hilarious.

EDIT: It's also important to note that Precure is actually one of Toei's original series and not an adaptation like Toriko or One Piece, and once they realized they were on to something popular with not just kids, but also adults, they needed to devote more resources to it.
>> ARTICLE
It makes sense too because recently as Toei ended Toriko, One Piece animation has been improving. Just in the past few months even.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why, but the animation quality got a relatively visible downgrade during/after the timeskip.
Can't really complain about the pacing, but I hope the animators start putting more effort into what they're doing.
But yea. When One Piece ends, I'll wait for a remake done by Madhouse (never gonna happen)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same happened to me. Grew up both watching and reading One Piece since first grade elementary, continued even through middle school. But when the scenes started dragging and they incorporated a shitload of still images, I dropped the show and just continued reading the manga.  
Also, just how much did they buff CC in the anime?  
^(wow i can finish an entire chapter and they'll still be holding hands)
>> ARTICLE
Toei, like many japanese companies, is run by senile fucking old men that refuse to change antiquated business practices. 
Toei = the cheapest animation humanly possible, so we can keep that 9 am saturday time slot. NOTHING else matters to them. What they're not taking into account:

a. One Piece is MEGA popular now, and doesn't need the saturday morning slot every week to hammer itself into kid's brains. Now there's video games and movies and shit.

b. Are japanese tv viewership numbers THAT fucking important in the grand scheme of things? I don't think so, and I believe they would be making a LOT more money by creating a quality anime that people worldwide would want to own on disc.

Personaly if I was Oda (and it was legally possible) I'd just take away the animation rights from Toei and give it to someone less one-track minded that respects the author's work.

Voices own though.

And no I don't think Toei ruined One Piece for me.
What they did ruin, though, is any chance Toriko had of becoming the huge shonen hit it deserved to be, by making the anime fucking embarassingly bad.
>> ARTICLE
How can an anime ruin something for you? How does a manga's anime affect the source material? If it's bad, I just don't watch it and stick to the original.

One Piece is pretty good, and the filler arcs only last like 10 episodes at a time. The first like 60 episodes are all cannon and then there's a 6 ep. filler arc. You can skip 54-60, 98-102, 131-143, 196- 206 (its filler but **highly recommend that you watch it**), 220-226 (also found this arc really entertaining), 317-319, 326-336, 382-384, 575-578, 626-628. Most the filler isn't bad and you will not really notice the slow pace too much if you are binge watching but once you get to the current arc, switch to the manga. In my opinion the Anime starts out stronger but as time passes the manga becomes the better of the two.

One Piece doesn't have as much (or as cool) fights as bleach but its story is brilliant. The world building is excellent as are almost all of the characters back-stories. I suggest you keep watching if you don't mind the art and slightly care for the characters. I recommend that you watch until ep.37 before you choose to keep up with it or not

edit: Also, a good place to start is ... the beginning. So many things comeback at random times and so many things inter-connect with each other that you kinda have to watch all the cannon stuff otherwise it could get confusing
>> ARTICLE
This is pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I didn't realize it had that little filler! That's great news. I've gotten up to episode 20 thus far, and I'll continue to at least 37, but I'm sure I'll keep going. 
>> ARTICLE
ooh, you're in a really good arc this is where things start getting good
>> ARTICLE
How long are the episodes? 600 episodes of 45 minute or so episodes seems crazy
>> ARTICLE
only like 15-20 minutes of actual content, this is excluding the opening ending and recap of course
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh, Fullmetal Alchemist was the same way. I prefer it to be this length. Maybe I shall watch One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
There is very little filler in One Piece. The episodes have been stretched quite a lot though. The manga is better if you're looking for a well paced story.

Having said that, One Piece is still my favorite anime of all time, and I would reccomend it every time!

Also, I'd say you watch a series or you don't. Everything in One Piece (save for one or two fillers) is part of the story. I wouldn't skip any part of it.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest if you don't mind reading manga then go for that instead and only watch the anime for the important arcs/scenes. You could also just skip the anime filler episodes.
>> ARTICLE
But you do gotta watch the G8 arc. Filler arc that's honestly at least as good as a number of the actual arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend this as well if you don't dislike manga.
>> ARTICLE
I did some math on this and to watch all of one piece it would take you a little over 6 weeks of Full Time (40 hours/week) devotion. 

And all that time just for ONE SHOW.

If that's your thing, go for it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched it all in 6 weeks in late 2013. Was pretty fucking crazy. 
>> ARTICLE
I have in a few weeks over the summer before. I bet some people have beaten that too
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember what made me want to start One Piece but I know I wouldn't do it if it was today. During this latest arc I was curious so I read a bit of the manga and then I couldn't return to the anime. (Though I am not keeping up with the manga also)

If you're reeally curious I'd suggest the manga. The mangaka is planning to continue it for another 10 years or so, so you wouldn't get conclusion for a long time with both the anime and the manga. 

Also I wouldn't suggest starting from the middle or watching a part of it because the event kinda lead up to eachother so it's all one really long story. (Unlike HxH which changes it's setting from arc to arc)
>> ARTICLE
Dive HA... Get it because devil fruit users can't swim... Nice. 
>> ARTICLE
Read it. It's faster and the pacing is better. If you must watch it I'm pretty sure there are abridged versions out there.
>> ARTICLE
You could see ~25 anime with 2 cours or ~50 anime with 1 cour during that time.

I gave up on it, but maybe try some episodes and see if you get hooked by it.
>> ARTICLE
i always say to people to look up what people say are the best arcs, pick the top 'how much you can be bothered to watch' and read the rest
>> ARTICLE
I watch all of it back when it was at the thunder god was not bad but the show is so worth it
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga, go on youtube to see the important scenes/fight scenes you want to
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are saying read the manga. And that sounds like a great option, but I really connect better with characters through anime. I don't get as excited about a fight or as sad about a death through manga. 
>> ARTICLE
The manga generally has better pacing than the anime. There's a project online called One Pace that edits and cuts the anime to match the mangas pacing and I usually watch that instead of the anime itself. It's only for the second half of the anime though. 
>> ARTICLE
Hello! You can skip all fillers if you want to but make sure you never skip any canon episodes. This is important because something that happens in an early episode could become relevant again 300 episodes later. 
>> ARTICLE
If you want to catch up to One Piece really fast, then I recommend reading the manga. But if you wanna thoroughly enjoy One Piece and you are willing to spend 100+ hours on it, then keep watching. Either way, it's still worth the time spent c: Enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
I have seen all the episodes released of One Piece thus far and the small amounts of filler didn't really feel like filler to me. It's all a part of the grand adventure of the story.


>> ARTICLE
One piece doesn't have much filler actually, and have you seen Hunter x Hunter (2011)? If you are looking for a long running battle shounen this one is by far the best!  Don't get me wrong I love one piece so if you have the time it's definitely worth a try
>> ARTICLE
I have not tried this one. Heard a little about it though, and I'll put it in my list! 
>> ARTICLE
It starts really slow, I read the manga until the art got bad but that's what I heard, it's really good though
>> ARTICLE
I started watching OP in 2013 (binge watched and reached ennies lobby in a month, I'm a NEET, sorry.) because my brother bought me a t-shirt for my birthday (the one with Luffy's wanted poster (B 300,000,000) ), and I'm glad he did.

So to answer your question, why are you even asking? Dive into an epic journey full of laughter and tears (no show made cry as bad as this one).

No.

One Piece has less filler I heard. I heard the series gets a bit weak around half way though.

Less filler but things are streched out like DBZ.

>it could be dangerous for my grades

Real talk, grades come first man. If you don't think you have the self-control to keep yourself from watching when you can't afford to, DON'T. However if you can stick to a strict schedule of like two episodes a day then I don't really see a problem.
>> ARTICLE
The sad truth is that there will always be anime to watch. There will always be a series out there that you really don't want to put down. You are just avoiding a bigger problem if you chose not to watch one piece because it's too long. It's a game of self control, you have to limit yourself and to train yourself to not break those limits. 

It's not an easy task to balance anime with life but if you can get it down, the reward is plentiful.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say I'm not too bad, I alway get my work done, I just gotta control myself when it comes to staying up too late after all my work has been done. That's sometimes not until 1130 so I should probably just make it a rule not to watch after 11 or something. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece does drag out its arc endings a bit, so you gotta be super careful to avoid the final boss or the hype moment.

Usopp is the best character get used to it.

Good luck.
>> ARTICLE
I love how much the Ussop support has grown over the years. I've loved him since back on Loguetown and have gotten weird looks every time I would say he's my favorite. It's good to know his fanbase has grown.
>> ARTICLE
It's worth it.

*^^Unlike ^^Naruto*
>> ARTICLE
Naruto and One Piece should only be read. They are both too long and drawn out. 
>> ARTICLE
While it's great that you actually do acknowledge the problem, you should probably work on your self control if you're that worried about it. Why not just wait until an extended break to start? Or just give yourself an actual limit, like 2 or 3 episodes per day.
>> ARTICLE
Worth it.
>> ARTICLE
You could try what I did with Fairy Tail. You could watch an arc, and then stop and watch something else, and then come back for an arc every now and then.

You don't have to think of it as a show that has to be watched all at once. You can just use it as that show that you watch when you have nothing else to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually gonna try this, after watching Naruto for so long I got bored of waiting for the next anime release so I jumped to the manga and finished it off in like a week, now i'm not so bothered about watching the anime, it's sorta put me off big anime, but I think i'll start doing this. Also, I hear a lot of mixed reviews on Fairy Tail, worth it or no?
>> ARTICLE
Personally, it's one of my favorites. A lot of the criticism is valid, but I still smile and have a great time whenever I watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
That is actually a nice strategy! Will probably use it as soon as I start to get interested in another long anime, so take my upvote kind stranger!
>> ARTICLE
I'd read the manga since it doesn't have the filler.
>> ARTICLE
Try watching only one episode each day. If you like it, keep up the pace or increase it; eventually you'll catch up in no time. Starting the series is always the hardest part.
>> ARTICLE
It's really worth it. I assume you have some sort of balance between anime and school, if you convert all your anime time into one piece time you'll be able to pull it off without affecting your grades.
>> ARTICLE
Not to make it worse, but we've officially broken the 700 episode mark already. Episode 707 came out this weekend.

No matter how you look at it, the series is something that is going to take a lot of time for anyone to watch. Hell, just running it in the background would take literally days to go from start to finish without stopping. 707*20=14140 minutes, or 235 2/3^rds hours, or 9.819 days.

A long, long time.

Is it worth it though? I think it is. I've already, for better or worse, rewatched the majority of the series at least once, and some entire arcs more than once. Is it worth putting before your everyday life? Your grades? Your family? Of course not.^(This isn't Nisioisin's work ;))

Is it worth investing the time? That answer is different for everyone. If you are going to watch it, don't put aside extra time for it. Whatever time you normally put towards watching anime, or whatever you typically do in your free time, put some of it into watching One Piece instead. I don't know a lot of people that can handle marathons, and even fewer who can do it hundreds of episodes at a time. Take it in pieces - if you do it at all.

That's my two cents. Take it for what it's worth.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, OP is incredibly long. I would recommend not watching during the week and do a small binge on Sat/Sun. I only say this because the quality of animation is pretty bad and the story is awfully slow the first 10 ish episodes. Binging is the best solution until after you get past the fishman arc. After that, you can slow it down to an episode a day but i promise you, the feels will keep you watching. Arcs are long but the build ups are worth it. And Ussop, no matter how much you hate him at first,  enough to even make you stop watching,  is THE best character so let that be enough curiosity to keep you going. 


Tl;Dr binge on the weekends u til hour hooked. One a day with binging on the weekend for progress. 
>> ARTICLE
From experimentation over the span of 2 years of my university life, I can state that "Anime does not affect grades". But that goes only for me, I guess.

If you want to watch any of the Big 3, I would recommend OP but try to watch at the most an hour a day if you think your grades will drop.
>> ARTICLE
I started to watch One Piece a few years ago, from episode 1, and watched up to somewhere around 350-400. I had enough of it for a while, but a few years later I continued and binged all the way to the latest episodes. In my opinion the pace of OP can be a bit slow sometimes, so maybe binge-watching when you are able to spare time might be a good choice? (That's what I did. It was in the school holidays)
 
(Also, while watching all of Naruto, one thing that helped me a lot was to skip (fillers of course as well as) several episodes after I became bored and just looked up a summary of what happened in the episodes, and once I thought it was gonna get exciting again I started from that episode. (Ultimately you know for yourself what's best for you, just thought I'd share my experiences with you if you decide to start watching sometime.))

Edit: Just wanted to state both were absolutely worth it for me.
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to watch all of them.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say go for it for sure. It's definitely worth it IMO. If you want just skip the filler arcs and some other things and just make kind of a schedule for it 
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is by far a considerably better show.

- The world is incredibly expansive and immersive. Few, if any any anime approach the level of world building that takes place in One Piece. 

- Previous plot lines maintain relevance and having lasting impact on future events.

- A clear and defined goal that the show is actively working towards. Each arc is a clear progression towards that goal and the show never feels like it's just floundering around.

- A vast and diverse cast of interesting and unique characters. They might not be the most well developed, but Oda is a master at creating likable characters that work well in the world he's made. 

- While this wasn't a huge problem for me with Fairy Tail, One Piece doesn't have the whole "prevail through friendship power" nonsense going on. When someone wins a fight it typically feels like that win was earned. Whether it be through ingenuity or a greater understanding of the enemy. In Fairy Tail it's more of a, get beat up several times and then finally win because  "I really want it."

- A clear character progression and discernible growth in power. It's very obvious in One Piece that a character is growing and gradually progressing as the series goes on.

One Piece blows Fairy Tail out of the water... Fairy Tail follows an annoying rinse and repeat formula

See, I said that at first but I honestly found myself having a lot of fun watching it, maybe more fun than with OP, while I still think OP is the better show I have a hard time saying it's THAT much better. Like what points do you think that OP hits that FT misses? 
>> ARTICLE
The world building, the characterization, the storytelling, the foreshadowing ... its hard to think of things that One Piece *doesn't* do better in.

One piece does almost everything better. However, you have to be a masochist to sit through the pace they chose for the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty! I felt weird that I dedicated that much time to Fairy Tail so I hunkered down and chose to finish or at least catch up to One Piece. It was insane, I'd watch during my commute to and from work, during every lunch break, weekends and week nights, during cardio at the gym, I felt insane half the time. The only other thing I allowed myself to watch was The Flash! 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail is just a worse One Piece with more fanservice and asspulls like friendship power and "It's Erza, she can beat anyone".
>> ARTICLE
Haha not going to lie, I love Erza for that reason. She reminds of Goku but not an idiot. Ha.  I feel like OP does the "friendship power" thing too...Ha I dunno if you're a DBZ fan but the spirit bomb is just one giant friendship power up! Ha. 
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't do the friendship power thing every fight though. It happens once for Luffy during the Lucci fight.
>> ARTICLE
>  I feel like OP does the "friendship power" thing too

It does but compared to Fairy Tail it does it extremely well and does use it against every single battle. Fairy Tail's arcs are pretty much just [this](http://i.imgur.com/SGlPvNM.gif).

Bold move trying to downplay One Piece and also upplay Fairy Tail. Be ready to get downvoted for stating an opinion not many share even so way less people actually watched both to get a good opinion on them.

I have to say i watched the first 40-50 episodes of One Piece and am still watching Fairy Tail and i like Fairy Tail more than One Piece but i wouldnt really try and compare those two because (as you can see) the fanbase is pretty fanboyisch and wouldnt let any other anime reign supreme.

I'll just say like whatever you like and be done with it. Both anime have their respected rights to exist and therefore have their right to be liked but noone has the right to say one is definitely better than the other because thats subjective.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I'd add from Fairy Tail to One Piece is Happy. Happy is the shit. Everything else is way better in OP.

Edit: I also like Lucy better than Nami as a character. Namis power is way cooler though. but that's debatable. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with Lucy but not Happy, he doesn't really do anything. #TEAMcHOPPER
>> ARTICLE
What!? Happy is the only decent character in that anime, you sir don't know what your on about.
>> ARTICLE
Only decent character? What about Natsu?
>> ARTICLE
As the top comment said,

> In Fairy Tail it's more of a, get beat up several times and then finally win because "I really want it."

Natsu is kinda the source of all of it, and it bugs me when I see this in anime, only reason why I can't like him. Although, thinking about it a bit harder I really like Gray, his shirt coming off all the time somehow just doesn't get old.
>> ARTICLE
Well, besides the fact that Natsu is a cheap ass in every fight, I do like his character a lot. Probably one of my favorites in the show, but I can totally understand the whole "always getting up" deal.

What do you like about Happy? AYE SIR!

Happy just makes me happy, nuf said.

I'm surprised how many people prefer one piece over fairy tail O_O.


>> ARTICLE
im surprised by the oposite actually, one piece is probably my favorite manga and to be honest very little shows come close to it.

Fairy tail is a generic shounen pretty much if i where to describe it i would say its the nisekoi of battle shounens. It is filled with every single trope in existance but its still enjoyable
>> ARTICLE
Hunter X Hunter > both.
>> ARTICLE
While I wholeheartedly agree, that's not what he was asking.
>> ARTICLE
Who asked about HxH here?
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to ask for it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but OP is asking /r/anime for our aid in comparing his conflict of FT vs One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
It is a very bold move to compare OP and FT in /r/anime where people dick ride OP and anal the shit out of FT. One Piece for me has a way better story and characters. Fairy Tail has pretty well written characters but the overall story is decent at best due to asspulls 24/7 and nobody dying but is extremely fun to watch, imo. I love them both for completely different reasons. Think of FT as the Fast and the Furious anime of the shounen group of anime. It's ridiculous but it is incredibly fun! 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail is by far the better show. 

One piece was funny for a little while, then it started repeating the same jokes

One piece is impossible to follow, it jumps around, has to coherency, randomly changes the power lvl of characters and seems to be so focused on making a huge interconnected plot that it forgot to make an understandable plot

I stopped watching/reading one piece a while back, I still eagerly look forward to fairly tail
>> ARTICLE
You're in the wrong here. 

One Piece outclasses Fairy Tail in numerous ways such as: 

Fun and interesting characters such as Law , Doflamingo etc
 
Excellent world-building and a really well laid out plot

Interesting powers in the Devil Fruits







>> ARTICLE
"Fun an interesting characters" who aren't actually that interesting, or fun

"Really well laid out plot" lol (Such a well laid out plot that i stopped watching/reading because the plot had degenerated into seemingly random bullshit)

"Excellent world-building" Well yes, the world might actually be better than fairy tail

And while the devil fruit powers are interesting, thy are no more interesting than the magic in Fairy Tail. 

Its fine if you like One Piece, but your arguments literally are "I think one piece is better therefore anybody who disagrees with me is wrong"

FMA has a decent history and mentions countries (some more than others) that the story doesn't take place in like Drachma, Xing, and Creta.

* Nasuverse(aka: Type-MOON universe): Fate series(Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night), Tsukihime, and Kara no Kyoukai movies
* Break Blade Movies --- a large world with an interesting past, though the movies don't expand on it as much as the manga does
* Darker than Black series --- many of the events in the series occur because of large events that happened before the series
* Tenchi Muyou series(plus spin-offs: Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, and Tenchi GXP) --- Though it does tend to focus on the MC of each show, the world built around it is pretty large and connected, though sometimes not that obvious
* Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita(Humanity has Declined) --- series is a bit disorienting at first because the episodes are in reverse chronological order, but shows an interesting perspective of what the world might be like when humanity is slowly removed from the picture
* Last Exile series --- lots of information regarding various factions and countries, as well as some lore surrounding several mysteries about the world itself
* Maoyuu Maou Yuusha --- large emphasis on how the world works and how small actions here and there can lead to large changes, wish it had a sequel
* Spice and Wolf --- A large look at economics while using the characters as an anchor
* Read or Die series --- a mix of spy/action with a focus on mystery and supernatural

also

* Naritaverse: Durarara, Baccano, Yozakura Quartet ---
Not as obvious because a lot of the material and a couple series haven't been adapted into Anime yet, but these three shows are all technically in the same universe, with Durarara specifically having several Baccano references

"Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible!"

Watched that part and said "That's the worst fucking advice in the world. That's a great way to get yourself killed"
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah, If you interpret the show in such a simplistic manner. I mean obviously kicking logic to the curb isn't a great idea. Though that's not what I think you're supposed to take away from that show.

 The *logic* is other peoples rules and their power. The entire show is about moving forward regardless of what those in power say to keep you down and demoralize you.

The first season humanity is under the thumb of the beast men and Lord genome. 
Once they over come that obstacle it's the anti spirals. Who want to keep humanity from exploring space and expanding, they are living stagnation.  Once they're free of those obstacles they go out to settle the universe and so on.

The attitude is "fuck your rules! row, row fight the power".

have you actually played past the Fate route? Because he's not nearly as bad in UBW and is actually normal on HF. 
>> ARTICLE
Of course im doing my 2nd play through atm and he is pathetic in both ubw and hf the quote I used is from hf. In hf he is constantly worrying and getting embarrassed over sakura and in ubw tohsaka is constantly pushing his buttons if anything he acts the most normal in the fate route except for his constant "I must do it because I am a man and she is a woman" attitude XD
>> ARTICLE
I mean he's not the suavest thing every, but he's not THAT bad. He's just a little shy really. And look at the girls he deals with. Rin is the hottest girl in his grade, Sakura is the hottest girl in her grade and his friend's little sister, and Saber is a hot blonde. He's just a teen guy. I mean the girls he's dealing with don't act much better really with romantic stuff. For the most part though, he's fine. 

Rin teases him a lot, and Sakura is his childhood friend, and his friend's little sister. He's kind of in a position there he really likes her, but doesn't know if he should go for her because him and her are such good friend's and Sakura is Shinji's sister.

Oh and don't take it wrong I love the characters its just it makes me laugh which was the intention of those scenes

Pokemon, kids going around the world without going to school for years (like Ash did, he must be something around +25years now, but is still as smart as a 10 year kid)

nah, Ash's main idea:

Considering how some pokemon are born or how they live (especially ghost types), I wouldn't call them all innocent.

For example: 

> Duskull is a nocturnal Pokemon, mostly inhabiting dense forests, but isn't interested in woodland creatures, only children. This floating Pokemon is rumored to pursue kids who don't follow the rules. Why? Because it enjoys the sound of them crying. But hey, it's not all creepy; once Duskull evolves into Dusclops, it is capable of swallowing anything into its body cavity, never to be seen again. We'll let you use your imagination.

Fate Zero - Fighting for your ideal will most likely end in tragedy because they are too hard to achieve, evil douchebag is the way to go. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol The actual message is that people who believe in nothing will be the least effected and "happy" in the end of this strife. The anime is a commentary on nihilism and the meaning of having a belief or ideal to follow in a world that perhaps is inherently meaningless.
>> ARTICLE
I know thats what most people think the message is but I don't see how it must be the "actual message", since that would imply other messages people take away from the story would not be "actual messages" and therefore false, but that is not how literary works work.

besides I don't think that message even fit the story, no one actually belive in nothing. It's a difference bettween people believing in rigid grand idealistic goals that they will not give up on, and people who have more selfish goals that are flexiable because they work with what they can achieve and build upon it once they achieved it. 
>> ARTICLE
>no one actually belive in nothing

Contrary to popular opinion, this is not what Nietchze's form of nihilism is truly about.

A more apt way to put it is more like "Go with the flow, expect the worse, and have fun."
>> ARTICLE
no, first of all that is not nihilism is lol, what you describe would be pessimism. 

nihilism is simply the position where one believe any form of purose, meaning, knowledge, doesn't intrinsitcly exist, they are just constructs of our own perception of the world. In fact you can still be a optimistic nihilist. 

what is relatvent to the story should be moral nihilism and Existential nihilism, which are the positions where morality doesn't intrinsically exist, and life has no instrinsic meaning. 

but suppose we go with your definition of nihilism, i don't think anyone in fate zero hold that belief either lol
>> ARTICLE
Actually, that is what nihilism is. Read up on Nietzsche or read Ubermensch. He's the main guy that popularized nihilism in the west, and is the one where we get our nihilist ideals from. Even though we broke down his beliefs way too far.

And Kotomine and Gilgamesh both held the nihilistic ideal perfectly in Fate/Zero. Kotomine is a man who couldn't find meaning in life (as is described by Nietzsche), while Gilgamesh affirms Kotomine's beliefs and simultaneously teaching him to enjoy life for what it is.
>> ARTICLE
No it is not lol, and  there's no other way for me to explain it to you other than simply telling you your factually wrong. It is simply not how nihilism is defined. 


First of all its not what Nietzsche believe, but even if that is what he believe it is not what nihilism is lol. It would be like saying because decarte started skepticism all skepticism is is Cartesian skeptism.  That is just ridiculous and not how philosophy work and not how the word is defined.


Not finding the meaning of life is not the same as believing there is no meaning of life. In fact kotomine was clearly not an Nihilist because he wanted to complete the grail to find out the meaning of his existence. To have that goal he must assume there is a meaning to find out. Therefore he is not a nihilist.
>> ARTICLE
>decarte started skepticism all skepticism is is Cartesian skeptism. That is just ridiculous and not how philosophy work 

Even if that's not how philosophy works, it's how language works. So in fact, if the primary form of skepticism is predominantly Cartesian skepticism, that will be in fact how skepticism will be defined.

As it is right now, Neitzsche nihilism is in fact nihilism. Because this is the most common form that the masses are attuned to. It doesn't matter what a word's true definition is, as after enough common incorrect usage, definitions change. For example, ironic situations now also refer to mildly surprising situations. Even if that's not what irony truly is.

Kotomine is unable to find meaning in life and his existence -> Gilgamesh affirms Kotomine's beliefs in that there is no meaning -> At the end Kotomine finds no meaning after the grail war, he decides to enjoy what himself instead -> Gilgamesh and Kotomine have merry times while doing whatever they want and making their own meaning.

Kotomine's journey and end result is him becoming an Ubermensch. While this is necessary not truly a part of nihilism, it is in fact so entertwined with nihilism that it may as well be nihilism according to the common masses.

Talking about technicalities and "true definitions" will get you absolutely no where.
>> ARTICLE
no, that is not how language works. Language works on definition of words, and that is not how nihilism is defined at all; but here's more, there is a counter example that proves your logically wrong. Namely, epistimilogical nihilism, which is in fact Cartesian Skeptism, which  existed before Neitzsche.

Kotomine wanted to complete the grail to find the meaning of his existence in the 5th holy grail war for every single moment up until the end. Therefore it follows he in fact believed there are some intrinstic meaning of his existence that he can find out from the grail, and at no point he gave up this belief. Therefore he is not a nihilist, therefore making the events you thought happened in fact false. 
>> ARTICLE
>no, that is not how language works. Language works on definition of words, and that is not how nihilism is defined at all

What you said literally made no sense.

Language is created by people. Therefore, words are created by people. Inherently, said words have no meaning until it's been generally agreed by common people to mean something.

That is what we call a "definition." But a word's definition can change. It changes in the same way that a word gains one in the first place: when it's been generally agreed to now mean something else.

For example, the famous (also fake) story of the word quiz showcases on how a word's definition is obtained. The word quiz also showcases how a word's definition changes (from "odd person" to test).

I guess you can technically argue that quiz still means "odd person", but no real user of the English language will ever use that word that way.

>Namely, epistimilogical nihilism, which is in fact Cartesian Skeptism, which existed before Neitzsche.

Logically, you're correct. But the human language is in fact, not logical, and neither are the people who create the human language. 

Coming back to nihilism, it can technically mean to a belief in a completely meaningless existence/world/whathaveyou, but that is no longer the *common usage by the common masses*. Now, the word predominately refers to Neitzsche's beliefs and ideals due to constantly being (incorrectly) peppered into works worldwide. Not only that, but Urobuchi (writer of /Zero) particularly enjoys this *common form of nihilism* and most likely intentionally wrote Kotomine's journey that way.

>Therefore it follows he in fact believed there are some intrinstic meaning of his existence that he can find out from the grail, and at no point he gave up this belief.

You're technically correct in that he never gave up his belief during searching for the grail. However, at the end of the 4th Holy Grail War, he discovers there is in fact, no meaning to the Grail, no meaning to his life, and no meaning to the world. So instead, he subscribes to Gilgamesh's Ubermensch-y life style/beliefs/whatever.

Which, as I have said before, is now basically part of nihilism, even if it was never intended to be that way.

I My Me! Strawberry Eggs

What an incredibly terrible show. I have no idea why I watched it or how I managed to finish it.

It's about a guy who crossdresses so that he can get hired by a school who only hires females. The reason is because the headmistress is afraid that men are filthy and will prey on the innocent school girls (keep in mind, this is a middle school he gets hired at), so she keeps the staff all female.

And so what happens? Exactly what the headmistress wanted to prevent. The guy who just graduated from university develops a romantic relationship with one of the small, young middle school girls, gets found out, and gets tossed out of the school, just like he should.

But in the end, he is forgiven, even though the entire plot was that he would show that men are capable of being reliable teachers and morally stable around the girls.

Fucking incredible.

Not too surprising! Slayers was originally written as a parody of dungeons and dragons tropes. You can even break up the various characters into different archetypes of tabletop roleplayers.

Yes.

You don't remember Mankind in his first tenure, do you? because that's exactly what he was until he brought out the faces of Foley.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think there's another character in any other arc in One Piece that was meant to be hated as much as Spandam was. He is just dislikeable in every possible way, and never once redeems himself.

Spandam: More of a piece of shit than even most heels in wrestling.
I think even some heels have had "good" moments even if they backslide, I'm pretty certain Spandam has never intentionally done anything productive.

On the contrary, Mankind, one of Foley's alter egos, was actually really popular during WWE's prime years

Few of his memorable moments include [getting thrown off the top of a cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hMp65SzyTU), [winning the WWF title on a RAW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KybuIy0wKXk) and [his music after he wins his matches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PylQLXWAUCw)

Enel?

Na man, enel was a douche but he had style.
>> ARTICLE
What about Wapol?
>> ARTICLE
Wapol was strong though. He knew how to fight and even if he was a douschebag King he wasn't a coward. 

Spandam has a double play going with his father who got Tom unfairly sent to impel down by using franky's ships. Then Spandam spends all of the cp9 arc as a coward. He hides behind cp9 and thinks he's invincible because o it. The only time he does anything is when he mercilessly beats a powerless handcuffed woman. Then once he finds out how they couldn't win he declares them traitors to the government. 
>> ARTICLE
Wapol redeemed himself with all the toy factories he made and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
He then married Miss Universe and together they now rule over Black Drum Kingdom. (I'm not kidding)
>> ARTICLE
Not quite... I don't think anything trumps him abusing Robin, at least for me personally. 
>> ARTICLE
What about Foxy? I nearly have to skip over the Davy Back Fight arc of the anime as his character just infuriates me way too much. The only redeeming part of that arc is Afro Luffy. 
>> ARTICLE
Foxy was more of a comedic character to be honest. None of his actions had a direct negative impact on any of the characters. Spandam was the type of character you wanted to see suffer for what he did. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong the whole thing with Robin broke my heart.

But I mean with Wapol don't forget he didn't care for his country, and don't forget the doctors he took from his people.

I consider them on par
>> ARTICLE
Wapol is a giant douchewad but he at least has a couple things going for him, like being a devil fruit user and discovering wapometal, that could make him marginally more likable than Spandam.

Also he became a successful businessman after getting his ass whooped by Luffy.

That's kind of the cool thing about him in my opinion. Sometimes there should be some villains who are just too far gone to salvage.
>> ARTICLE
Mick Foley seems cool with this tribute, but could someone actually legitimately sue Oda over this? I hope no one would be that shitty, but I've heard about it happening in other mediums such as video games.

Unlikely. He'd have to prove that this goes beyond inspiration and that Oda is *literally saying* these are things Foley did, *or* he'd need to be able to demonstrate provable damages beyond some vague assertion of, "muh feelin's."

>> ARTICLE
Could he sue? Potentially you can sue for anything. Could he win? Really, really doubtful you'd get past the first hurdle. 

If he created a character called Mick Foley that looked exactly like him, he could sue, but over indirect references or characters that bare some resemblance or were inspired by him? No, you wouldn't win. If the court case was in the US, parody (which this would likely fall under) is protected under fair use.
>> ARTICLE
Also if mick Foley was characterized as a parody of Mick Foley there would be a strong chance of Oda winning the suit as well.

Beyond everything else it would be a giant pain in everyone's dick for him to sue a japanese guy that lives and operates business in japan.

Watch a few episodes... If you're intrested keep watching. 
IMO it's totally worth it.

truth be told, it starts to get really good after about 30 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first many episodes can be really boring, but it get's better and better each arc.
>> ARTICLE
It's worth it but I have my doubts that you'd make it through all 700 episodes in just one summer.
>> ARTICLE
if you're also into manga, i'd recommed to read it 
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely yes. Especially if you don't get anything spoiled for you. Just stick with it until they beat uo some guy called Arlong and you'll be hooked.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the episodes that progress the plot are certainly above average .. well, better than most shounen at least but those damn fillers are really off-putting. Most of them are really boring - I would consider them the good ones, because some just plain suck.

 [Here's a list of the fillers](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece) If you skip them, you are good to go I'd say. Some arcs are really neat, so you should give it a try. Not everyone's cup of tea, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more worth reading than watching, if you like reading manga as well. The anime's pacing is apparently pretty abysmal and there's a good bit of filler.
>> ARTICLE
>apparently      

Only in the very late arcs. And still that comes back to manga readers already knowing what's gonna happen. OP still has around 500 something episode before the anime starts catching up with the manga. 


>> ARTICLE
that's good to know, I might consider watching the show knowing that. I put the manga on-hold a couple years ago when I got up to date and was considering the anime but heard about its pacing issues and such, so I didn't bother.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with the one piece anime is the problem with all anime adaptations of manga, catching up. One piece chose to attempt to alliviate this by slowing down the show to one episode per chapter instead of 3-4 and introducing filler arcs...it isn't working
>> ARTICLE
I think it's definitely worth it. For me it really keeps things fresh as opposed to alot of other long-running shounens. The characters are great and goofy. There are many moments that will make you laugh your ass off, and also ones that will bring you to tears. 

On a side note, there are tons of filler arcs (some non-canon ones too) that you could probably skip. When my roommate ventured to watch it, he skipped them and it didn't really detract from the quality of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

But it's too damn long. It took me more than a year to get to episode 655. Some arcs get boring but some are insanely awesome.

It has amazing comedy, nice characters, awesome powers and a diverse universe. It's definitely an anime to pick up for the long run.
>> ARTICLE
Eh you're better off watching HxH 2011 instead. But if you have seen that then yeah one piece is pretty good. Have been watching and I'm on episode 100. Really interesting characters.
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell if these comments are sarcastic.

Whatever you say. You can return to your Naruto already
>> ARTICLE
In short, no.

Long answer: It depends. If you do actually enjoy generic shonens (and I don't mean the typical i watched when i was younger, i'm gonna finish it), don't mind the horrible drawing style of the characters and don't care about watching 400+ episodes of a mediocre anime when you could be watching 12-24 episodes anime and have way more variety, then go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely watch it! It's a great show but you'll end up getting bored and after some time it's all more of the same.

But until then you'll have a great time with it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it untill timeskip, it's worth watching when you know what episodes are fillers and with you hand on shift + -> . I didn't skip much(i think) but there is certanly moments where they just jerking off to reach 20 minutes.

So, if you really want to watch One-piece and wath to watch some action\comedy then go ahead. If you 'thinking about watching it' then i'd recommend finishing other..."regular" shows\movies.
>> ARTICLE
If you do watch it, watch it up to the timeskip. I have only read the manga but many anime reviewers out there complain how the anime starts following a "1 chapter per episode" sequence which could lead to horrendous pacing issue. I find reading it much more enjoyable but thats because I've been up to date on the source material for years. If you choose not to read it i suggest watching other animes.
>> ARTICLE
You could watch 10 other great series instead of watching 700 episodes of one piece.It is a great anime but 700 episodes is just a bit too much IMO.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece isn't that great in all honesty compared to many other anime's out there. Don't be fooled by the blind amount of followers who give it the popularity it has. 

It's fun for a few episodes then you begin to realize that you'll get like 10% plot and 90% filler in the non filler episodes + the novelty wears off very soon. People literally never die even though they show them dying for effect. 

Here's a list of anime for your summer check them out on MAL for descriptions don't waste your time watching 700 episodes of that rubbish. 

Aldnoah Zero (Season 1 is great, 2 is okay), Berserk (Old series but good, could watch the 3 Berserk movies instead), Clannad/Clannad After Story, Code Geass R1 + R2, Death Note, Death Parade, Guilty Crown(Guilty pleasure shonen), Fate Stay, Fate Stay Night UBW, Parasyte, Shinsekai Yori, Gurren Lagan, Kill La Kill, Steins;Gate, Rainbow, Attack on Titan, Mirai Nikki, No Game No Life, Psycho Pass.

I feel conflicted for saying this, but I think Nami's chest might be a bit small.

Maybe a bit. It's honestly a hard thing to quantify since at the beginning of a story arc her chest will be a decent size, then seems to get bigger over the course of the arc, and then resets at the beginning of the next arc.

Man I miss Nami's old short hairstyle

...aren't they just called "statues?"

Yeah I couldn't help thinking the same. At a certain point they aren't small enough to be considered figures anymore. Add that to the fact that they are not articulated in any way, and you've got yourself some statues.

At this point, I'll be thankful if Berserk "ends" at all. There's a real concern that some of these hiatus-inclined manga-writers may kick the bucket before they resolve their series' core plot points.

> Gilgamesh from F/Z

He's also very consistent with his character and they don't try to make us empathize with him by making some sort of backstory or reasons as to why he's such a pompous asshole. It's simply who he is based on the story he's from (more so type-moon lore rather than actual lore). You know what to expect from him and he delivers on all fronts, that's what makes him great. Plus it also helps that his VA [Tomokazu Seki](http://myanimelist.net/people/1/Tomokazu_Seki) voices him really well based on the character Gilgamesh is supposed to be.
>> ARTICLE
I must say that, having read Fate and watched F/Z and now watching UBW without having read the UBW VN route... he seems REALLY different from how he usually is for no apparent reason.
>> ARTICLE
    >Watching the UBW adaption before reading the route

WHY
>> ARTICLE
...Why not?
>> ARTICLE
Because it skips like all of the explanation of things and just animates? I adore them animating the fights the way they do, but you miss so, so, soooo much of everything else.
>> ARTICLE
His characterization is inconsistent between F/Z and FSN.
>> ARTICLE
But in Fate route he's pretty much exactly the same as he is in F/Z, whereas in UBW he's different. 

If he was inconsistent between series, fine, but he's inconsistent between different routes in the same series. That's just weird.
>> ARTICLE
 that's because ufotable did change him a bit 
try reading the UBW route and you will find him the same as fate route
>> ARTICLE
Alright, cool, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
What? He is by no means the same in the Fate route as he is in Fate/Zero. In the Fate route hewas evil for the sake of it and was completely different from his self in Fate/Zero. UBW, not so much.
>> ARTICLE
Greedy king, wants everything including Saber, sticks with Kotomine for the lulz, hates the modern world, dislikes Shiro because faker.

I don't see how he's any different than in F/Z. 
>> ARTICLE
He wasnt evil for the sake of it in Fate/Zero, he also didnt hate the modern world yet in Fate/Zero. He was interested in it.

Besides, what makes UBW gil so much different?
>> ARTICLE
He's composed, he's very down to earth. Hell, I'm pretty sure he hasn't even called anyone a mongrel yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Thats because everyone is either too below him to even bother dealing with, or they're so strong that its a joy to fight them.
>> ARTICLE
[F/Z](/s "It's because he gets driven partly insane by the grail at the end of Fate/Zero")
>> ARTICLE
And ya know that whole still around thing. 10 years bruh
>> ARTICLE
That's also because [FSN](/s "Kirei fed him with dead kids.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, people kind of miss the whole [F/Z](/s "has been tainted by all the world's evils thing.")
>> ARTICLE
And yet his character sheet lists him as Chaotic Good.
>> ARTICLE
Well he states in FZ that he cared about his kingdom and his people, it's just people of this era he hates because they're boring to him. Or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Back then, there were fewer people and they were more treasured because they couldn't be replaced. 

Now, there are so many people that one person alone has little worth. 

That's Goldie's logic anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
And we're all useless mongrels
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he's probably a good and honest king... He just wants *everything*, and other people would often rather not be his subjects/property.
>> ARTICLE
This is somewhat what his chaotic good status means. If you're his subject he was good to you (If a bit weird, he slept with all wives the night they were married so he'd have to love the kid as it might be his own) though he also says that if needed he would be the north wind for his people. Ie; he would make the hard decisions to help them move forward.  

Then take into account what humanity is like when he gets incarnated into the world for the Grail War and he sees an entire world of people who are less "pure" and more stagnant than they used to be and he starts acting more frivolously about human lives. He even mentions this within the anime never mind the VN or derivative works of FSN, the story he told Shinji about how none of the servants put in front of him could be killed since they were all useful and needed whereas near everyone in the modern day was uneeded and useless is very telling about his overall character.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're kinda glossing over the bit about him abusing prima nocta. I mean, even in the myth which was written when the law was common, he *still* gets ripped on for being one of the greatest rapists there ever was.
 
I mean, you could argue its just Nasu pulling another Medea where he erases the more evil aspects of a Servants myth to make them more sympathetic, but he also kind of makes it clear on no uncertain terms he wants to rape Saber in basically every route AND zero so its still sort of possible that its canon for the show.

Nasu just has some exceptionally weird thoughts on the old D&D alignment charts, and how good doesn't equate to nice/just/fair.
>> ARTICLE
You've got to also think about how Gilgamesh thinks of Saber and the time period he's from. It's not as though he respects her, he's not even trying to make her his wife or anything of the sort, she is an object to be added to the vault in a sense for him. He describes her often as a beautiful flower or something, and that's exactly how she is to him.  

Look at Lancer for god's sake, the guy is the nicest guy in FSN more or less, and as he says in Hollow, he sees nothing wrong with breaking into houses to steal away women to have some fun with. It's simply how it was at the time, to expect Gilgamesh to be more upstanding than him even if he's also good is laughable. 

He still protects his people and loves seeing the way they "reach for the stars". He defied the gods and fought the heavenly bull to protect them, it's not like it was a threat to him, just them. This is even mostly pre-Enikidu of course, who was sent to make Gilgamesh stop doing the few questionable things like raping every woman in town and make him go even more towards the good part of chaotic good.  

Gilgamesh's status of being Chaotic Good is entirely in a "overall good" fashion, much like any dnd character who plays a chaotic good character would be. They're going to occasionally kill someone for a petty reason, loot or whatever, because they're human, but that doesn't automatically make the GM go "Right, so now you're chaotic neutral" unless it's a habit. Amusingly this is exactly what Enikidu does in a sense, he's the GM warning that Gil's being a dick and he more or less cleans up his act after that.  


Type Moon goes much more in depth into his chaotic good side in Extra/CCC, since that time he was summoned into a world that wasn't stagnating and people were still being ambitious and he didn't decide he needed to unleash the grail on them to be their north wind.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised no one has talked about him yet, but Shou Tucker deserves to be burned in a bonfire while being stabbed by spears.

Meh, he tortures two people.  In a world where people have actively perpetrated genocide, I have a bit of trouble caring very much. 

>> ARTICLE
This. A thousand times this. In all the anime I have seen, Shou Tucker is unquestionably the one single character that I hate far and above all others. Being burned in a bonfire while being stabbed by spears is far to kind a punishment for someone like him.
>> ARTICLE
Yess!! I'd like to add Kimblee and envy too
>> ARTICLE
I would disagree on both counts. FMA Kimblee was totally Insane, but Brotherhood Kimblee had his ideas he adhered by, and was a Darwinist just like Olivier, only an antagonist unlike her. And also cunning. And it doesn't matter what side you're on, he won't hesitate to call you out for abandoning your ideals just because things aren't going your way.

And Envy's just a brain-dead moron.
>> ARTICLE
First season Kimblee? Maybe. Manga/Brotherhood? I thought he was one of the better written villians.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest he's my third least favorite villain, my least favorites being Sloth and Gluttony. But I'm not saying he's a bad villain, everyone else are just better villains for me.

>> ARTICLE
Sad thing is he could be a decent guy.  I mean he was friends for a long time with Shirou.  Sure Shirou can be a bit dumb at times but I think even he would have not have given Shinji the time of day if he was always an evil bastard.

But his family situation, his inferiority complex,  and especially his grandfather pushed him over the edge.  He could have just been a jerkass friend.  But he became so much worse.

Really if there is one villain in the series that should be despised, its Matou Zouken.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Shirou would just put up and be used by Shinji.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, in Hollow Ataraxia you learn that Shinji used to beat up bullies/thugs together with Shirou in middle school, as well as socially assassinating anyone who took advantage of Shirou's kindness.  He was a dick, but he was a good friend.  He only went full crazy later.

Can we think of **Nina Einstein** (Code Geass) as a character who became a villain?

If so, she's my pick.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of debate as to who is the best girl. But Nina stands above all when the topic of worst girl comes up.
>> ARTICLE
She's still the only fictional character that I have just completely hated.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Fuck her and her stupid royalty fetish. 
>> ARTICLE
Nina is one of the characters I pity the most on Code Geass. Pure-blood Britannian, and absolutely fears Elevens because all she's ever heard about them was how they're savages and less than human. So, then she gets kidnapped by a bunch of Japanese, and they're about to beat/kill/eat her alive or whatever those monsters do when PRINCESS EUPHEMIA STANDS UP. This would be the equivalent of having Obama show up in a batman suit to beat up the robbers that were trying to take your wallet in an ally. I don't think Nina is a lesbian. Obviously she loves Euphemia but I don't think she would sleep with her, given the opportunity. No one has really ever stood up for Nina, and she's always felt helpless and insignificant, but a PRINCESS just risked her life to save her. Then Euphie goes and announces to the world that Japanese (not Elevens this time) are people like us, and deserve rights. Well, this doesn't sit well with Nina. The woman who saved her life from an Eleven just restored their rights as Japanese? But it's OK, because then that thing happens and now Euphie is dead because of the Japanese. Clearly these people are nothing but brutes and thugs! Fast forward to R2 and...

Nina has dedicated herself to ending the war. How do you end wars? You drop nukes on Japan! So she builds a nuke, and it gets deployed and an absurd amount of people end up dying. Britannians and Elevens alike. Woah. Little fragile Nina, all she wanted to do was help her home country that has protected her and that she loves, now realizes that a bomb doesn't end a war. It just kills people. And a bomb doesn't care if those people are Japanese, Elevens, Brittanians, or ANYTHING. It just destroys. Maybe Nina new this would happen from the get-go, but even if she did I don't think she truly understood what it was she was doing. Lloyd did, as we saw in R1 when he talked Nina out of detonating the bomb at Ashford Academy, and Schneizel new EXACTLY what she was creating, but neglected to tell her the true purpose of a bomb of such magnitude (the Damocles). So now she has a choice: continue on this path and hope that all the lives that her creation has taken won't be in vain and this war will end, or help the one person she hates/fears the most but knows is the only one that can make sure the FLEIJA never gets used again, and hopefully can forgive herself of creating it in the first place.

Sure, Nina is whiny and racist and kind of stupid, but she's just a product of her environment, and when you stop paying attention to all her flaws, she really is quite a nice person.

Maybe i'm missing part of my soul but I really don't think the villain is that bad at all. They don't do it out of spite or anything like that, they just have a different set of morals and different priorities.

His action are justified, but this doesn't change the fact the he is a douche.
>> ARTICLE
A douche? Wouldn't that imply malicious intent? Can he even be considered a *villain*?
>> ARTICLE
It depends from whose point of view. His objectives certainly don't benefit humanity. So from humanities point of view, he is a villain. However, in the long term, if you look at the universe at a whole, his actions are benefiting it. 
>> ARTICLE
> His objectives certainly don't benefit humanity.

They do in the long term. [PMMM](/s "Humans benefit from the universe continuing to exist just as much as other entities.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "In the long term you are talking about, humanity wouldn't exist anymore. So how would they benefit from that?")
>> ARTICLE
First of all, spoiler tag your comments. Secondly [PMMM](/s "His objective isn't to destroy humanity, it's to reverse entropy. Sure Kyubey's original *method* may have led to the destruction of humanity, but it wasn't his end goal.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "Therefore, once again as I said earlier. While his methods and goals benefit the universe, they don't benefit humanity in any way. If you can't live to gain profit from it, theres no benefit in it")

I don't think you understand what I'm saying [PMMM](/s "Methods and objectives aren't the same thing. Kyubey's *objective* is to save the universe. I was simply saying that this *objective* in the long term is positive for humanity, just that the *method* for doing so is not.")
>> ARTICLE
Well, according to him, were it not for his species wish granting powers, humans would still be bashing rocks together. Of course, you don't have to believe him.
>> ARTICLE
There's an important difference between *villain* and *antagonist*. I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure "villain" implies either "evil" or malicious intent, neither of which [](/s "Kyubey") has
>> ARTICLE
According to a dictionary, a villain is someone who actions are evil. And intending to wipe out humanity certainly isn't nice.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I'm still of the opinion that intent is an important part of it. I'd consider him/them as closer to a natural catastrophe(which can be antagonistic) than an actual *villain*, as the destruction of the world isn't their goal, but a side-effect of saving the universe. 

But whatever, no point in arguing over it
>> ARTICLE
A douche doesn't have to have malicious intent. They just have to not care. the guy who cuts you off in traffic doesn't hate you personally. The guys that did the paper work sending people to concentration camps most likely gave it no thought. You don't have to be evil to be a villain. Hell, its the villains that don't care that their hurting people that usually make the best ones.

I'm sure a punch won't cut it. Several thousand deaths might not either.

>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why Kirito acted so indifferently towards him at the end of season one. I thought he would be raging and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Because he knew it'd be useless.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, while I agree that Kayaba was very evil, the anime didn't really do anything to make me hate him.
>> ARTICLE
Kayabe was probably the best of the SAO antagonist just become he was not rappey and instead was killing people for shits and giggles (which I find better than the rape approach)
>> ARTICLE
Kayaba even forgot why he did it. What a retarded dick.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he is the main villain but I fucking hate Shinji From F/SN. Other villains I can understand but he is not redeemable in any way.

Also OP why do you hate Griffith? He wasn't wrong as much as Guts was.
>> ARTICLE
Who wouldn't hate Griffith after what he did in the Eclipse Arc?


>> ARTICLE
What he did was payback for what Guts did in the end of the Golden Age arc. And Guts did more wrong than Griffith anyways.
>> ARTICLE
What did Guts do that's nearly as bad as Griffith? Yeah, he kills a lot of people, but he's a soldier. That's literally his job. He never kills any innocents, just opposing troops. And aside from that, he's a pretty good guy from what I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I was talking about his actions towards his comrades not the enemies. He betrayed his comrades and left them multiple times. He also abandoned them when they needed him the most.
>> ARTICLE
Did you actually watch/read it? That's not what happened at all.

Guts left just as things were going well because he wanted to leave and he thought it was a good time. There was no way for him to know just how deep Griffith's selfishness went, nor could he have predicted that he would risk kissing off the entire kingdom to comfort himself. He was under the impression that Griffith viewed him as lower, not as a true friend. So he thought that if he went and got stronger, Griffith would accept him as his equal. But instead, Griffith was really just childish and selfish, which no one could see behind his massive facade of regal innocence.

Guts did what he thought was right over and over again, and got bit for it every time. That's the theme of the story. I don't think him leaving was nearly as bad as Griffith having everyone devoured in some devilish nightmare.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, even if what Guts did was wrong, it's not like there was ill intent in the action. And honestly, you'd be hard pressed to say that even his actions without knowing his intent were wrong. He left the Band of the Hawk to find his own path in life. That's it. Without any more information, calling that a betrayal or treason or whatever is pretty fucking silly. When including Gut's intent and meaning behind the actions, you'd have to literally be retarded and not understand Gut's character at all to call it anything like that.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't betray them, he leaves when everything is going great because he wanted to leave. He appreciated what Griffith did for him but wanted to find his own way in the world. Calling that betrayal is such a misrepresentation of why and how Guts left that I don't even want to warrant that with a proper response. And the second time, he tries to leave but ends up staying anyways, so really he only leaves once.
>> ARTICLE
He saw how much Griffith was destroyed when he announced his departure and still left his whole crew because of his selfish dream. I don't think that everyone's life would've turned to shit if Guts didn't abandon everyone because he was a selfish warrior.
>> ARTICLE
So? Would stay at home with your mother if you turned 18 and she started to bawl? People have to live their own lives and move on to find their own way, even if it means hurting the people they love. It's intrinsically selfish because it's *them trying to find meaning in their own lives*. But I don't think it makes Guts evil or a bad person by any stretch of the imagination. It's a completely understandable action that I wouldn't fault anyone for making.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that there is anyone not evil in Berserk. Yes Griffith was wrong in what he did but Guts was even more. And their relationship was more than that of a mother and son. They needed each other and they self destructed when they were tore apart by Guts' dream.
>> ARTICLE
No, they really didn't. Griffith survived just fine without Guts for years before they met, and obviously Guts didn't need Griffith since he decided to leave in the first place. Griffith made the mistake of putting all his emotional baggage into one person and putting an unnecessarily large burden on Guts in the process. He made Guts pretty much the sole proprietor of his emotional health, something he never asked for or wanted. 

And considering that Griffith's dream [](/s "literally fucking killed everyone"), Gut's kind of pales in comparison.
>> ARTICLE
He actually did kill innocent people.
>> ARTICLE
It's war and it's in middle ages. Of course everyone is going to kill innocent people who are too weak to defend themselves.
>> ARTICLE
That still does kind of make Guts a shitty person. Since Griffith is the one who asked him to do it though, they're on roughly the same level of 'asshole' for what happened.
>> ARTICLE
What I meant is everyone of the characters in Berserk was a huge asshole.
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember Casca doing anything too assholish.
>> ARTICLE
She did have feelings for 2 guys at the same time IIRC. 
>> ARTICLE
[Well,](/s "He killed an innocent child" )
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Yep, I remember that part now. Under Griffith's order of course.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't really hate him, because in a way the Griffith as we knew him [](/s "died after he got imprisoned. Afterwards he got brainwashed by demons and the Godhand") I am not saying Griffith is an angel or anything but compared to the world of Berserk it would not accurately describe the whole situation if you just say you hate Griffith.
>> ARTICLE
Shinji is a little shit, but literally everything Griffith does a thousand times worse than Shinji's actions, I'm surprised you can sympathize with Griffith, but detest Shinji. 
>> ARTICLE
While chasing your dreams in Griffiths case is admirable. But if achieving a lofty goal such as Griffiths means not just abandoning the people that love and care for you deeply but having them being eaten alive by a rampaging pack of demons for a sacrifice to facilitate your apotheosis. Then you've earned a couple of douche bag points. Not to mention what he did to Caska just to rub it in its Guts' face, because Griffith was too fucking childish to accept the fact that Guts had outgrown him and wanted to pursue a dream that was all his own instead of someone else's.

So yeah those reasons are why i don't care for Griffith. Course you might've been being facetious, but I've met some dirty Griffith supporters before.

There's Embryo from *Cross Ange*, who not only [](/s "can't die when he is killed"), but is also one of the skeeviest villian I've had the misfortune to watch.

I mean, people complain that SAO had rapey villians, but Embryo actually tries to seduce Ange. And that doesn't work, [](/s "He goes and tries to mind rape her into submission.") It doesn't take, but still.

He doesn't help his case by initially being presented as a well-intentioned extremist - he claims to try and make the world better [](/s "after *seven World Wars* and the destruction of old Earth"), but you pay attention to the flashbacks throughout the series and then you realise - [](/s "HE'S THE ONE WHO BLEW OLD EARTH UP"). 

Not to mention that Embryo is not the most reliable person - he claims to want "strong, intelligent women" in his new world...and while he's expositing his new world, the scene depicts him gazing at a woman wearing nothing but an apron.

And then Episode 21 rolled about - and he killed off [](/s "best meido Momoka and resident perv Tusk.") Granted, [](/s "they got better by Episode 22"), but I cried for his blood.

All of this meant that /u/Daishomaru's talk of him being a Rau clone just disintegrated - instead of a villain I could emphasise with, **I WANTED EMBRYO TO DIE HORRIBLY.**

---

As for the second villain...well, I'll let this speak for itself.

Reccoa from Zeta Gundam. She technically isn't a villain, I guess until the end, but SHEESH she grated the crap out of my nerves. I couldn't have been happier to see her die before the show concluded.

I'm not gonna try and argue that her characterization is all that well fleshed out, because it isn't.  At the end of the day, she's an ancillary character that doesn't get focused on enough to make what happens with her feel all that natural.

But I think you're severely misreading the situation with her.  Her defections and motivations aren't exactly 'for no good reason'.  She's an emotionally damaged character, who was taken advantage of by Scirocco and basically brainwashed by his powerful Newtype abilities and charismatic aura.  When she's finally free of his grasp, we see her ghost fly to Kamille's side because she's not inherently a bad person who doesn't know right from wrong.  Just one who was damaged and placed in impossible situations (having to be a spy for the AEUG).  It's frustrating to see her get manipulated and that she doesn't have a strong will/ego to combat Scirocco, but she's a tragic character and that's how she was written.

What makes these three special is that they have 0 redeeming qualities to them. This is also slightly problematic since villains that are 'pure evil' are kinda boring. You KNOW they will die horribly at one point and you won't feel bad about them.

Special mention - Chimera Ant King from Hunter X Hunter, for the following reasons:
* Story-breaking strength
* Author attempts to humanize him slightly but fails miserably
* No redeeming qualities even after he 'befriends' a human.

The only villains I can really hate are the generic villains.

Rapey, totally vile assholes who do what they do just for the sake of being assholes, with no meaning behind it whatsoever. Not only do I hate them because they're assholes, but also just because they really have no driving reason for what they're doing other than being an asshole. This is not how the vast majority of "bad" people work. You don't just wake up one morning and go, "Boy, I feel like being a douche. Let's kill this entire kid's family and rape his mother and then try and start the apocalypse."

A villain needs MOTIVATION. They need a REASON other than just saying "Oh, he's insane." No, fuck you, stop taking the easy way out. Other than being a massive douchebag this character is certainly not insane. Either come up with a reason for him being such an asshole, or just admit that you don't know how to make a compelling villain.

I'd have to say that, without a single doubt in my mind, Shou Tucker from FMA: Brotherhood was my single most hated villain, not just in anime, but in anything. I recently rewatched SAO, and Sugou was pretty high up on my list, but the way he was presented, as a rapist who didn't even try to hide that fact, imo just couldn't put him near as high as Tucker. The reason I hated Tucker with such seething rage was because of his motives and how he tried to justify what he did, [FMA: B](/s "turning his wife into a science experiment, essentially murdering her, in order to become a state alchemist, and then doing the same thing to his daughter, just to keep his job.") It put him so high on my list, that I highly doubt anyone else will ever even come close to him.

ITT: People hate villains that you're supposed to hate.

I'm going to go in a slightly different direction and cite:

*Knives* from **Trigun** - I just don't think he was given sufficient screen time to build the character sufficiently, nor do I think his character motivations really made a lot of sense either for the things he ultimately ends up doing.

*Makishima Shougo* from **Psycho-Pass** - similarly to Knives, we're never really given enough character establishment to understand him as a villain or see how his life experiences justify him becoming one.  He's ultimately a pretty shallow villain who is mostly about style over substance.  I'd have liked an episode dedicated to exploring his past or something, or deconstructing his character motivations.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Makishima Shougo was a really good villain, he had no social identity and as a result, no future; because of this, his psychopathic behavior took over and he started attacking the Sibyl system, the reason he had no place. By the end, Makishima's goal was destroy Sibyl system by opening up a future isolationist Japan to the world.
>> ARTICLE
> he had no social identity and as a result, no future

Literally not the case.  Because Sibyl couldn't judge him, he could have become anyone he wanted and done anything, unlike most mooks who had their whole lives pre-determined.  We have Akane here as the counterpoint to this.  But the show never really sees fit to draw up this contrast more directly for the viewer.

And really, the only way we know this is the case is because the guy said it once to somebody.  We don't really know if that's actually the case or not, because unlike every other character in the show, we never get a look into their past to see what actually makes them tick.  For all we know, he was lying through his teeth.  The guy is a boogieman and a placeholder for conflict, rather than being a fully fleshed out individual.
>> ARTICLE
No, the series stated specifically that everything in that Japan was based off of a persons Psycho-Pass. He states in a monologue that no one would acknowledge his existence.

I understand what your saying, Psycho-Pass/Gen Urobuchi not very subtle so I took what they said at face value. I can see if you don't, his character does fall apart if you don't believe this.

I just really like him like I like Griffith, they are evil in some form, but I want to see and understand why they think they are doing whats right form themselves or society.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hating a villain you're supposed to hate mean that the villain is well written?
>> ARTICLE
Depends on why you hate the villain.
>> ARTICLE
Makishima Shougo is an example of a well written character in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
So your going a more "hate cause of bad writing than good writing"? I didn't actually specify in the post but if I were to say a villain that I hated simply because they were boring and not very good at their job. Vicious from Cowboy Bebop, this fucker does nothing but have a deep voice, a sword, and an ugly bird.

Fat because of a hormone deficiency that went undiagnosed through my teens. Now that I'm on proper medication, the weight is falling off, so I don't need the advice, thanks. (And I honestly wouldn't care if it didn't, I'm happy where I am in life.)

She's flabby and will lose that body by the time she's 25. Silhouette is nice though, but I'd rather put a little thought into why I'm attracted to someone. A nice body is great, but it's only a partial indicator of how healthy they will be.

>> ARTICLE
you say that now. Watch 3 episodes and I promise you you will be hooked
>> ARTICLE
You should watch it. The weekly gintama rewatch threads helped me watch this masterpiece after having it on my planning list since when the episode where the neo armstrong cyclone jet armstrong cannon first made its appearance.

I think this was in 2007-8. I really was missing out for these 6-7 years...
>> ARTICLE
Said it somewhere else but if you have this feeling about a long show then I would suggest reading the manga instead. Easier to get into it and will probably take you a lot less time to get through it. 
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is the kind of anime you can watch whenever and have no real need to marathon or watch all episodes. For many years I just watched random arcs that sounded nice(later rewatched whole series).

The anime is composed of many short arcs and even some standalone episodes. There is some continuity but very little. 
>> ARTICLE
I watch one or two ep every night before bed.. Its really a show you can take your time with. Like "oh I don't really have anything to watch" put on some gintama. Some people marathon it.

Im on episode 43 and its been a couple of months but I still enjoy it.

Just watch it whenever. It's not some epic, life-changing experience, but it's a really good show.
>> ARTICLE
what i recommend is to stop hyping it as much as people are because its a very good anime with an amazing story deep characters and go through amazing progression but it wont change your life like everyone says it will.

that said it is still something everyone who's even remotely interested in anime should watch at some point in their lifetime 
>> ARTICLE
Gosick.

It's been on my list for a year now but i'm just never in the mood.
>> ARTICLE
I can vouch for this show. I've been putting it off for months and finally gotten around to watching it. I'm about 16 eps and it's a good show. Although the show has a mystery theme, that is just the back drop and doesn't focus on that. It's more of a romance IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Sherlock as a Tsundere. It's alright. Has an ending. 
>> ARTICLE
That's been my problem with countless of anime in the recent time. Ending is a rarity and I'm getting kinda sick of it (Especially adaptation of LNs or ongoing manga). It was really refreshing to watch Gosick.
>> ARTICLE
HAS AN ENDING? Hooray! I've had my eye on that for a while, and the confirmation of an ending has sealed the deal. Far too few anime shows that actually have one. The very reason I don't want to watch Deadman Wonderland. Or Deadwood, even though I hear it's amazing. It's HBO, so that's to be expected.

A *really friggin cute* tsundere.

Spice and wolf, steins gate and blacklagoon have been looking at me from the shelf for months now
>> ARTICLE
Hah. Spice and Wolf, Steins;Gate, and Psycho-pass have been in my queue for months as well. 

I finally finished watching No Game No Life, and decided to watch Golden Time on a whim. Those three are still sitting there waiting...
>> ARTICLE
Christ, watch Steins;Gate. All of you.
>> ARTICLE
I really recommend black lagoon if you want something easy to watch... Not to much of a deep story that you really need to pay attention to. but fun to watch with all the action.
>> ARTICLE
Give Spice and Wolf a try. It's really easy to get into, very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really agree with  it being easy to get into. You can't just put it on hold and watch a week later. The plot can get confusing if not followed closely(or at least how the economics work). I put it off for a while just because of that. Finished it recently and really enjoyed it though. 

Out of those I'd say black lagoon is the one you can easily get into and just watch a few episodes at a time. It has small arcs that consist of a few episodes usually that are action packed and always entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd argue that Spice And Wolf is just as episodic, if not more episodic, than Black Lagoon. Concerning things like Roberta's Blood Trail, what Spice And Wolf arc is as big as that? I know that's a separate OVA, but the point is the same. Black Lagoon certainly isn't episodic to the same extent that something like Cowboy Bebop or Mushishi is.

I don't really see anything particularly complex about Spice And Wolf, either. It's fairly simple stuff. They want to go to a place, and money is involved. You don't even really need to understand the system to enjoy it, except perhaps for the Fool's Gold arc, which was actually the one that it's fair to say I both hated the most AND enjoyed the most.

holo u traitor ;_;

But not really.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf has got small arcs like that too. I just think it's easy to get into / get a general idea of the show compared to Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
I started it and got two episodes in... I honestly couldn't get into it. But that was several months ago. Should I try again? All I got out of it was economics.
>> ARTICLE
Try the dub. It not only makes the economics easier to follow, it's actually very well done. I prefer Holo's English VA.
>> ARTICLE
If that doesn't interest you, I don't think you should watch it. It also offers great characters with amazing chemistry, but if you don't enjoy the economics it's not for you I think.
>> ARTICLE
You got it all wrong. The show is entirely about economics, and just includes some lame characters to help economics get a backstory.

Edit: Economics is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
That's true for all of those anime, and that is why they are on his list.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't Steins;Gate have a relatively slow start to it though?
>> ARTICLE
It does have an incredibly slow start, but it wouldn't be on here if it wasn't worth the time. The heart string tugs are incomparable. 
>> ARTICLE
You can just sit down and watch them, any time. So why *right now*?
>> ARTICLE
I just started Spice and Wolf and I'm three episodes in. I am enjoying Holo and Lawrence's conversations and the economics part is interesting. It blows my mind that the voice actor for Holo is the same for Ryuuko in Kill La Kill and Kallen in Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Been wanting to watch TTGL and Chihayafuru. The former because of how popular it is in this sub, the latter because I rarely see it here but when it gets mentioned, it's all positive reception. Can't find myself having time to watch either of the two though. I always end up watching something else.
>> ARTICLE
Recently watched chihayafuru its good if you kinda want a chill sports anime.. But most of the episodes feel very repetitive. And yeah you should watch gurren lagann unlike most hyped shows on this subreddit that one that deserves all the credit it gets.
>> ARTICLE
I have a soft spot of TTGL because it legitimately helped turn my life around. If you're stuck or in a bad place in life thst show is better than any motivational speech.

Baccano for me. Been sitting there for ages but just can't seem to get the motivation for it. 
>> ARTICLE
Was Baccano for me too. For years I wanted to watch it and only recently I did. The amount of entertainment I got from this show is just ridiculous. Start watching it right now.

just start watching a few episodes, you'll end up marathoning.
>> ARTICLE
I second this opinion. I sat down a couple weeks ago wanting to rewatch the first couple episodes, and ended up watching the whole thing.

To counter this, I dropped it in the middle of episode 3 because of how disinterested I was in any of it.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad and  Clannad afterstory. People constantly talk about it but to me it doesn't have the appeal enough for me to put it higher on my to watch list.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. I started watching it about a year and a half ago and stopped around episode 14. It was just so boring! All the characters seemed completely 2D and none of them had any really interesting motivations. The way they all interact with each other makes it seem like they totally hate each other even though they're friends. I decided my time would be much better spent watching a show that actually interests me rather than pushing through through that just to get to After Story
>> ARTICLE
I had Clannad/Clannad Afterstory on my list for such a long time and was always hesitant on watching it. I eventually forced myself to try it and didn't like it so I wouldn't recommend forcing yourself to ever watch it (one day I felt like giving it a try and liked it more and eventually finished it. I was glad I did finish it, but it took me several months to do so lol)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Clannad for me to. Although it does appeal to me, and i want to watch it, it's just that I am always hearing how great it is, how it will make you cry ect, ect. It feels like my expectations for the show are already to high and i don't want to watch it and feel disappointed. So i have just been avoiding it.

Something similar happened with Grave of the Firefly's. Kept reading that it was sad and would make you cry, and i eventually watched it and i was expecting it to be really sad and make me cry and by the time i had finished, i just felt disappointed because it didn't live up to the expectations i had built up for it from what other people said about it. That's why i now try to avoid reading about something that i haven't watched, as soon i someone mentions an anime i haven't watched i stop reading the comment, and i now also avoid recommendation threads and all that.
>> ARTICLE
I can see how you might be let down with all the hype people are giving Clannad but I'd say it's justified. I went into it think it would some kind of supernatural action show (Somehow I linked "Clan" from MMO's to Clannad) so it hit me like a tonne of bricks.

I really wanna watch this show because people keep praising it. But I just can't get over the art style.

Honestly if you can get over the character art (I know that's no small task) the rest of the art is actually pretty fantastic (backgrounds, etc.).

I've said it before, but it's the combination of the eyes, hair antennae, and tiny noses/mouths. They look like aliens or insects. And it's so disconcerting because they're supposed to be cute. Ping Pong isn't trying to be cute so it works.

Damn you should have tried watching Code Geass as your very first anime. The  impact it would have on you would be so much greater.

At least I was completely blown away by it back then. Even now after watched hundreds of great anime no other show could give me same feeling. It was like first love. Never forget and will always remain special.
>> ARTICLE
It had only just started airing when I started watching anime, so I was more focused on catching up with everything old that people liked.

I feel like so many shows have done the Code Geass scenario that it just won't have the same effect. The same thing has happened to me with other anime in the past.

The first show I watched is pretty special to me (even though I know deep down that it's not amazing) so it's all fine~ \^^

Steins;Gate. At this point I'm intentioally putting it off. I don't think I'll ever get around to watching it. I don't even think I want to watch it anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. All the hype gets annoying to hear after a while. Also all of the people saying that the first half is slow but the characters make up for it. And none of the characters look interesting at a glance to me. It's also one of the shows that you see recommended a lot on this sub but no gif's, images, and etc. are actually posted for it. I''ve never gotten a solid reason to watch it that seems appealing. 
>> ARTICLE
There is a reason people heavily recommend and hype it. 

Whether you watch or not is of course your choice. People just like sharing something they really enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
It's good. That should be reason enough. What other reason does one need to watch something?
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is one of those shows that people who haven't seen anime or haven't seen a lot of anime before will enjoy a lot, but once you've seen a lot of shows it sinks into the realm of above average. One character in particular just felt like a bland, unrealistic neckbeard bait type character (like Asuna from SAO)

Also, make sure you don't say anything bad about the show in this subreddit, because you'll get down voted for having a different opinion
>> ARTICLE
I'll vouch for Steins;Gate all day long. Yes, it is a long winded anime. Yes, it's overhyped to death. Yes, there's not a lot of .gif moments in there without ruining major plot lines. But I challenge you to find me a better series that deals with its themes better. 

Yes, i'm being extremely vague in its description. Because it's one of those shows that surprises you where it's going. Goes from Slice of Life then adds Sci-Fi elements that don't seem misplaced. 

I love Steins;Gate. very very much. Comparatively, I hate Mawaru Penguindrum, but i'm not sure how popular it got outside of my circle of friends.

I've been procrastinating Aria for over four or five years now. It's a very easy show to procrastinate because it's just so slow and relaxing and just knowing its always there to go back is arguably better than actually completing the series. I did manage finish the first season, but I think I left off somewhere in the middle of the second.

Accurate. Of the animes I've seen, they are the only two I've given 10. Hunter x Hunter mainly for the characters and final arc but with FMA:B it was entirely because I'd never seen a more complete and satisfying story across any medium ever.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. I keep wanting to watch it and everybody who talks about it describes it as something I'd love, but the eyes
>> ARTICLE
My god, the eyes. I can't.
>> ARTICLE
The art. The way the feet look when they are walking almost like little triangles. Its really bad.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure Clannad is great and lives up to what everyone says, but I physically cannot get through 10 minutes of it.
>> ARTICLE
lmao this exactly. Heard so many good things about Clannad then you see those eyes... but yeah I gave it another go and it does live up to its reputation.
>> ARTICLE
Hello, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I'm sure I'll watch it eventually, but damn that episode count is daunting. 
>> ARTICLE
Straight up, it really isn't. Logh is one of those anime that is really easy to watch, the story line is one large persistent thread you can pick up at any time, a year or a week you can get through it at your own pace and not feel lost.
>> ARTICLE
It's still a huge mental block for me. I'm having enough trouble trying to watch Nana and that's only forty something episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Golden Time, Durarara, and High School DxD. I don't know why but whenever I try I just shrug and think to myself "I'll watch it later." 
>> ARTICLE
I've been putting off a few classics like Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Akira and such for at least 3-4 years but I finally found a way to actually get to watching them.
>> ARTICLE
Akira is just a movie. Easy watch get to it!
>> ARTICLE
Easy to say but I'm like the laziest person on earth.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't we all?
>> ARTICLE
Akira story wise is a little boring in my opinion. But its really a beautiful looking anime and deserves the credit it gets. I've put off Eva too and personally waiting for the cowboy bepob blue ray release.
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to like NGE, but I believe NGE is a mandatory watch for anime fans. Get on that
>> ARTICLE
Oh I know that. I plan to watch it. Don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
Anything ongoing. I instead watch series that have finished so I can easily marathon them. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm the opposite. I love following a series that's active. It feels more lively and theres always tons of discussion in the anime community 
>> ARTICLE
Never thought about it that way, but I think the wait would be too much for me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh the anticipation is the best part! Feels like you're a kid again you just have to wait for next episode and then once it comes on you know you have to wait another week and just wondering and thinking in your head what could happen next. Getting online and theorizing with other fans about what do you think is going to happen next.  
  
 and then finally the day comes on which episode will air and you anxiously try to get out of work/school so you can run home and watch the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan 
>> ARTICLE
a lot of them.  



>> ARTICLE
My MAL has over 100 anime on the "Plan to Watch" list, and yet I never watch anything from it.
>> ARTICLE
THIS!!! 
I always end up watching something new thats not form my PTW list, I don't even know why I have a PTW list.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly! I have all these great shows on my list but then I hear about an awesome show that I've never heard about and it goes from not being on my list to being completed while the rest are still neglected. It's a problem.
>> ARTICLE
* *Ghost in the Shell* (Movie)   
* *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex*

I never feel like it's something I want to watch at that moment, even though I'm pretty sure (and many have suggested) that I'd enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari.

I picked up the blu-rays off RightStuf back in April before they went out of print for ~$50 each and they have sat on my shelf ever since they arrived. I really do think I will like it and I make an effort to avoid any posts about the series so I don't accidentally spoil anything but for some silly reason I just haven't sat down and watched it. 
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari was probably my easiest watch to date. Just get yourself around an hour of free time and watch it. The anime is very satisfying when not marathoning it and is just really fun to watch - conclusive enough to be fine with a single episode but interesting enough to continue it anytime.

The ending is exceptional aswell and along with Steins Gate one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Railgun the WHOLE SERIES. 

Don't know why.

P.S.
I'm sorry Kennen my promise of watching this will be honored one day. 
>> ARTICLE
I found Railgun very enjoyable, but be warned there is a lot of filler.

But it's good filler, not "pull your teeth out one by one filler".

^^^^^Unless ^^^^^Episode ^^^^^13 ^^^^^It's ^^^^^fine.
>> ARTICLE
Princess Mononoke. It's kinda ridiculous how long I've been putting it off seeing as it's just an average-length movie, but I just never seem to be in the mood to watch it. I even own it on DVD and still haven't seen it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica.lol
>> ARTICLE
Whatevers in my plan to watch list, animes go there to die.
>> ARTICLE
School days , steins gate , nichijou 
>> ARTICLE
you might want to put school days on hold, forever.
>> ARTICLE
More of an experience to say you can day it's shit then to really watch it imo.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Code Geass. They'd both probably make my top 5, but I just keep putting off watching them. 
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK. I got to episode 8 but then I just stopped because it was just so weird.
>> ARTICLE
For me its Cowboy Bebop
>> ARTICLE
Monster, I watched a few episodes, then I stopped watching anime for a while. I started watching anime again and put Monster on my PTW list and it's on my PTW list for at least a year now.

>> ARTICLE
Perhaps you should try the manga? They are selling them as the big compendium release volumes now. I picked up volumes 1&2 (first 30 chapters) and blew through them in 1.5 days. Much faster and same experience. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really enjoying monster at the moment just got to episode 13. Its really just a long running drama. It feel more real than any other anime I've ever watch. But the amount of episodes can be a turn off.
>> ARTICLE
Yozakura quartet . all mentions of it on this subreddit are positive ones but I watched one episode and found it OK but never continued. And yes, I did watch the supposedly better version.
>> ARTICLE
Tons. 

Sailor Moon is probably the most popular show that I've been putting off, with Inuyasha at second. 

Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion are another two glaring examples of popular shows I've had some hesitation starting
>> ARTICLE
Over at /r/trueanime  we're watching two episodes a week of Sailor Moon. We just finished the first series which absolutely knocked my socks off. If you don't mind coming in late, or just catching up slowly, there's some truly passionate writing about the show to enjoy every Friday.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece
>> ARTICLE
Anything that would make me cr...I mean...that would cause heavy rain in my room. This includes, but is not limited to: Clannad, Clannad AS, Angel Beats, and 5 cm/s. Surprisingly 5 cm/s is one I really want to watch but I haven't found a replacement umbrella. 
>> ARTICLE
Accel World has been on my to watch list for months now. 
>> ARTICLE
It's nothing special and has some of the most childish villians and character interactions. I'd second taking it off. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not worth trying. 
>> ARTICLE
It's only a small niche of us that actually enjoyed Accel World. I know for me, it's only because I want that kind of future to exist. It's like my fetish or something to be in video games. Even with that, and Kuroyukihime being mai waifu, the MC was still a fucking bitch and pain in the ass to watch. If you don't have anything special for the stuff I mentioned, don't watch it. Not worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Take it off.

You're welcome.
>> ARTICLE
My god .. I tried but the main character is a 1 foor 16 year old that looks like a basketball which is just making the show so damn bad already and I can't watch an anime with a main character that is so damn bad like that one.

Just pretend it's south park

South Park is fun.

ITT: People saying an anime, and then everyone else trying to convince them why they should watch it

I'm probably a sinner for saying this but Code Geass. I've been halfway through the first season about 3 times now and have never finished it.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop, Black Butler and Psycho Pass.
>> ARTICLE
trigun
>> ARTICLE
GunBuster, can't find a nice way to view.
>> ARTICLE
If you're a fan of TTGL or NGE, you owe it to yourself to watch Gunbuster.
>> ARTICLE
I've got a lot of them. I started Soul Eater then put it on hold after 5 episodes. I watched one of Kaichou wa Maid-sama then put it on hold, and I've been meaning to watch Black Lagoon for a while now.

Instead, I'm watching 20-something airing shows while also watching Spice and Wolf S2, Steins;Gate, and Tamako Market.
>> ARTICLE
While I'm currently watching Soul Eater and am enjoying it, you definitely made the right choice in prioritizing S&W and S;G over it.
>> ARTICLE
Bebop, Code Geass, Death Note are the big ones.

Although I'm holding them off for good reason.
>> ARTICLE
lol bro what actually did you watch?
>> ARTICLE
I've been planning to watch Genshiken for at least 8 years now.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely watch it. I found it to be very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I want to watch NaNa but I can't find a stream of it in more then 360/480p. Msg me if u can help 
>> ARTICLE
**Monster**. I know I *should* watch it but I don't have real urge to watch it so soon.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter

People seem to really enjoy it and  it has such a high rating on MAL but when ever I read that premise or look at that character design I just hold off and say I'll get on the series later.

*also a 100 or so episodes*, I ain't got time for that.
>> ARTICLE
Do not be fooled by it, it is excellent and one of the if not best shounen series ever, besides Jojo in my opinion. For example I thought originally years ago that HxH was going to be a kid shounen about friendship saving the day. Oh how wrong was I. HxH can be downright graphic and borderline disturbing at times. I implore you to reconsider.
>> ARTICLE
The only 10 on my list. Trust me the synopsis does not do this masterpiece any justice at all. Don't let the character design throw you off either or the age of the MC so many people are missing out on some of the best writing I've seen in an anime series. Its really great. I had the same exact thought as you when I started but i was wrong. Truly everyone should give this anime a try. Its will have you crying.. And on the edge of your seat but also make you smile and laugh.

Not just saying it cause it my favorite but this show deserves all the hype it gets. If you put it off cause of character design and age your really missing out. I mean how many anime's do people watch with 10 year old little girls and what not. Those are still good anime's. So I don't understand how someone sees a twelve year old boy and decides he's not badass enough or old enough.
>> ARTICLE
Legend of the Galactic Heroes 
>> ARTICLE
Imo this is very easy to start and go through, nothing to push through, just a general flow.  Very story heavy though.
>> ARTICLE
My friends have been bugging me about watching "AnoHana" for a year, but I want to watch certain anime for the first time chronologically, so it comes later than "Clannad", "Toradora!", and "Angel Beats!"
>> ARTICLE
Noir. I watched the first seven or so episodes a long time ago and dropped it because it was putting me to sleep. I want to watch it again to give it a better shake, but man, I've got all kinds of good stuff on my backlog without that sleepy stigma.
>> ARTICLE
True Tears. I heard it was good, but it's really hard to get into.
>> ARTICLE
Amagami SS.

I'm mostly through season one. That was two years ago. The episodes are just sitting there, waiting to be watched.
>> ARTICLE
The Evangelion series.

I'd like to watch it but I've heard it's depressing especially with the writer having issues toward the end or something.
>> ARTICLE
It's only depressing because the series deals with uncomfortable familiarity, it actually has an uplifting message under all that harshness.
>> ARTICLE
5cm per second. I just don't know why ;(
>> ARTICLE
Well both Death Note (saw 10 eps) and Code Geass (saw 5 eps) have been on the back burner for like 4 years... And I got half way through FMA:B and stopped.  Don't get me wrong, I think they all have amazing concepts (I saw the entire original FMA). I guess I just have a problem finishing top 10 anime when I know that you only get it once.

But I am really feeling like finishing at least one of them... Tomorrow?
>> ARTICLE
Bleach. It doesn't seem worth it. Is it? I am on episode 100 now but it's so fucking boring
>> ARTICLE
K-On!, Steins;Gate, and Madoka have all been shows I wanted to watch but can't find time.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of the ongoing shows from this season that i wanted to watch but have not even started, and will probably just sit in my to watch list. 
>> ARTICLE
Watched the first episode of each, but didn't continued to watch after and forgot.

* Kaiba
* Dennou Coil

Always planned to watch, but never felt like it.

*  JoJos Bizarre Adventure
* Wolf Children
* Redline
>> ARTICLE
>  JoJos Bizarre Adventure

hohohoho 

do iiiiiiiit

season 1's animation is a bit bad for the most part. the first nine episodes are pretty dated in terms of storytelling as well, but you get to witness one of the best anime protagonists ever after episode 10 drops. 
>> ARTICLE
Everything in Gintama beyond episode 20 or so, and everything in Natsume Yuujinchou after the first season. I really loved them, but for some reason I just can't pick them up again. At the moment I'm working my way through Rurouni Kenshin. I constantly feel like I'm procrastinating against watching those shows by...watching other shows.
>> ARTICLE
Ergo Proxy, Monster, Bakuman, Tiger and Bunny, Azumanga Daioh and Chobits.
>> ARTICLE
Serial Experiments Lain, I tried the first episode, was severely freaked out and never touched it again.

>> ARTICLE
Code Geass. I'm like 17 or so episodes in and I just can't be motivated to finish it for some reason. :/
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everything. I put stuff there and then end up watching something else on a whim. Decided my PtW list is for things I will never get round to or where I watched one episode and went to do something else - never to return.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. Please don't hate me
>> ARTICLE
OMG SUCH A FAGGOT GET OUT OF HERE NUB

In all seriousness though, not that big of a deal to not watch it yet. Theres only about 3 or 4 shows I would say are a must watch for all anime fans, and this is not one. Still really good though, so hopefully you're reminded of it one day when you have nothing to do.
>> ARTICLE
Cardcaptor Sakura. I know so little about the magical girl genre (I really liked Madoka Magica and am currently watching Sailor Moon Crystal, but that's it) but I doubt I'll ever actually commit to watching it
>> ARTICLE
Jigoku Shoujo.

I've wanted to watch this forever since forever ago, but I keep forgetting about it. I'm currently stuck in Mexico and usually without any sort of internet, and if I do have internet, it comes with a 1 GB a month download limit, so I'm in no position to watch anything on it.

However, I found out a few days ago that they air Gurren Lagann and Jigoku Shoujo on TV here, but Spanish sucks. Not knowing Spanish right now sucks. I miss you, secure internet and anime.
>> ARTICLE
Close, but it's actually Bleach. It's been on my list since I first started watching anime (yes, I've ignored it for that long). The only reasons I've been putting it off is because of the number of episodes and the many people who keep criticizing it for its generic shounen plot devices.
>> ARTICLE
Dragon Ball. Just never had the courage to start.
>> ARTICLE
Ergo Proxy, every couple of months or so I decide to pick it up again and after watching 1 episode my reaction is always "what the fuck?".  Needless to say I've only gotten halfway through in about a year.
>> ARTICLE
I've been putting off Working!! for so long now.
>> ARTICLE
Inuyasha
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter, I think its because its pretty long and it took me a long time to start watching Monster which is slightly shorter.
>> ARTICLE
Don't start by marathoning it. Just watch an episode or two a day and have binge days whenever you feel like it. It's definitely worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Steins; gate(on episode 8, can't make it to 12), Haruhi, FMA:B
>> ARTICLE
Kino no Tabi
>> ARTICLE
I loved Lucky Star, but I can honestly see why some people wouldn't watch it.  It is the essence of slice of life and there isn't a real story.  Some people may not even like the art style.  But it is mostly comedy gold and you can't not like Konata.

As for me, there's Steins;Gate, Fairy Tale, and Angel Beats.  I don't know why I keep avoiding Angel Beats.  It sounds like it's right up my alley.  But something keeps me from actually watching it.  I've even had the DVD for almost 2 years lol.
>> ARTICLE
Konata is probably the true Best Girl in anime, people just don't want to admit it.

Edit: also, give the first episode of AB! a try. It has a pretty good start given half of it is an exposition dump. All of the characters are quickly established and memorable. Few if any are mysterious right from the start except for maybe Angel.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka. I've never watched a magical girl series before and never plan too and Madoka is supposed to be a deconstruction of it and since I've never seen it, I don't have a frame of reference.

Clannad. The art hurts me in my soul.

Nisemonogatari. I didn't like Bakemonogatari but people are always saying it gets better. Thing is, I can't handle those flashing slides because I have photosensitive epilepsy. Also, there's all these supposedly good characters but never once did Bakemonogatari make me give a shit about them before going on a fucking 3 episode monologue.
>> ARTICLE
Your username concerns me

If you can't handle the flashing frames, don't continue. The Monogatari Series does have some of the best characters ever created, but it's not worth having a seizure over
>> ARTICLE
One Piece for me. I say every summer that I'm going to watch all of One Piece, but never do. It's just so many episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf. I watched three episodes of it and ended up dropping it, but later decided to give it a second chance and put it in my Plan to Watch list again. Now, it's just been sitting there for several months, and I pretty much have no motivation to continue watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Index and Railgun series. I watch a couple of episodes of Railgun every few months. Probably never gonna get to Index. Same with Fullmetal Alchemist. One day..
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much anything on my plan to watch list.

I pretty much choose to watch things on a whim, and very rarely do my plan to watch list and my random watches line up
>> ARTICLE
Still need to watch Baccano! and Fate/Zero but keep turning to other series.
>> ARTICLE
Probably D. Gray Man. It's one of the only "big" shounen ones I haven't watched yet. I feel at this point I'm just too burned out by the Naruto/One Piece/HunterxHunter/Reborn! type long series and can't do this again.
>> ARTICLE
The Monogatari series. Now at episode 7(or 8) of Nise as of last night after 3 months , the toothbrush scene was **hot damnnnnn** 

Idk, sure it's awesome, I could marathon it, but there's the ongoing anime right now and the dialogue doesn't do me good when I'm watching anime usually around 11pm-3AM.

Madoka Magica is one I still haven't finished I got like 2 or 3 episodes in and just stopped.

>> ARTICLE
It's clannad for me.... For some reason its just hard for me to finish the first episode
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that you can't find anywhere to squeeze episodes of Lucky Star in. It's literally a show about nothing. It's the Seinfeld of anime. It's so completely about nothing that you could watch it in a random order and still be fine.
>> ARTICLE
I'm embarrassed to say this but umm Spice and Wolf.
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi. I keep starting and watching the first episode and then end up watching something else.

20 days ago  I started. Am now on one piece episode 100

Psycho Pass and Spice and Wolf.

I'm pretty sure I'll love both, but they're not easily accessible in a good quality online and I have a smaller hard drive, so I don't like to download them.

I said I would watch HxH 2011 but I've never gotten the time to marathon it. I know it's good though.

I hate to admit it but Spirited Away. I have seen literally all of the Studio Ghibli films except for that one.  I'm basically just waiting for the Blu-Ray that may never come out. I might just bite the bullet and get the Japanese Blu-Ray.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama, Steins;Gate, Neon Genesis evagilion, cowboy beebop and Ghost in a shell are the ones from the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Fate/Zero. For FMA:B, people keep talking about how good it is and all, but there's always stuff that I want to watch more than I want to start FMA:B. Fate/Zero seems to have an interesting premise, but again, people go on about how I should play the visual novel before I go into Zero, that I continually put it off until I feel like starting the visual novel.
>> ARTICLE
Code geass and Zankyou No Terror, after episode 2 I just could not deal with that series anymore. Probably will watch Code Geass at some point but Zankyou can take a hike.

SAO I watched the first half and a few episodes after that. I literally just put it off from what I saw. The anime went from awesome to not my cup of tea anymore lol. There are times when I want to finish it because I already watched half of it and there's a 2nd season now, but there's so much better things on my list so yeh SAO takes the cake.
>> ARTICLE
Among the "classic" anime, Trigun and NGE. They were long over when I got into anime (around 2005? Sometime around then...), and there was just so much to catch on I've just never made the time to go back and watch these.

From anime that started after I got into anime, Gintama. I had actually started and had a bunch of episodes downloaded, but then my computer died and I didn't remember where I left off so I just never bothered to continue.

Steins: Gate. I don't even have a reason, i just haven't gotten around to it even though i really want to.

Mushishi. I know it's supposed to be really really good, and i usually have no problem with episodic shows, but the slow pacing alongside the episodic nature of the show makes it hard for me to get into. It's weird cause i'm watching aria atm with no problems at all and i finished kino's journey pretty easily.

I've been stuck at around episode 60 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes for months now. Every time I think "I really should get back to watching that" I end up watching something else instead.

5 Centimeters per second.  I got through 17 minutes and when I realized i

From what I've heard about Welcome to the NHK, I'm planning on putting it off until I have a midlife crisis and need to get my life back together 
>> ARTICLE
There's a ton of them, I get bored really fast.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter. Gon is so boring. He's so bland for a male shonen lead.
>> ARTICLE
but you like One Piece? Luffy and Gon are both heavily influenced by young Goku and feel very similar (especially in their upbringings). 


Gon is fantastic and music is so good, idk it just gives me that warm feeling. 
>> ARTICLE
I've heard so many good things about HxH and I really wanna get into it but Gon really just makes me bored especially in the beginning. Tried reading the manga and watching both anime adaptations but no dice, I just really find him a non-engaging character.
>> ARTICLE
Oh :(. Thats a shame. 



just curious, how far did you get? 
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island. I've forgotten so much of it though, since my friend just made me watch it with him. I wanna get into it properly this time though, so I wanna start at the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah thats the way to do it. Definitely just stick to the anime (2011) though. The manga is pretty bad at times (art wise). 



>> ARTICLE
Everyone puts off this amazing show because of Gon mainly because of his age. I really don't get it. You are truly missing out on something amazing. Gon is not a boring character you have to give it a better chance. Don't let his age or cute sweetness throw you off he is the definition of badass. And so is the show in general the only true ten on my list :)
>> ARTICLE
I don't really care about his age tho. Plenty of anime have young leads but that didnt put me off any. It's more on his reactions and general attitude I guess.
>> ARTICLE
> definition of badass

didn't realize we were talking Killua.
>> ARTICLE
More of a mereum. :)
>> ARTICLE
http://i.imgur.com/CEy8ZYV.png
>> ARTICLE
The fact that Gon is built up to be a happy go lucky bland typical 12 year old male lead is entirely intentional. It's done so that later events can have that much more of a shocking impact on the viewer/reader. 

A gif I would show anyone who was putting off or not watching HxH because of Gon would be [this](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2x854TBxeew/VE3SdF0I59I/AAAAAAAAF08/UxuQvPLQDN4/w426-h341/14%2B-%2B1). Warning though this is from a future event but completely out of context and should oly indicate how much the tone changes in this show. Also despite all of this, if you STILL find Gon boring that's okay as this show has a huge cast including [Killua Zoldyk](http://i.imgur.com/rvO78uC.jpg) who has arguably just as much screen time as Gon and is anything but boring with by far some of the best and gradual character development I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I am familiar with the main cast, and some of the side characters, because I've caught the series on TV before. I really wanna get into the series because I know how good Togashi's can be (big YYH fan here). The Hiatus x Hiatus reputation as well does not help motivate me any, though.

If you want more S&W just read the LNs. Honestly I don't want a 3rd season because I'm sure they'd have trouble getting the same team together for it and it would likely suck, but the LNs are great (I'm on vol 6) and focus even more on Lawrence and Holo's relationship and chemistry.

People always say "watch this", "watch this". I agree that so many of the shows are fantastic, but when I'm juggling 22 anime at once, with 25 "on hold", then I start to just enjoy my anime less and less. I don't want any more anime to watch. I just need to get down to at least less than 2 digits. Therefore, my 118 anime in my "plan to watch" list will likely not see the light of day for a while.

It isn't really, I wouldn't judge the entire show's art (especially since the animation is phenomenal) just because of the lame character designs.

Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
Better question is why not?
>> ARTICLE
I was in your position a year ago, and I always thought it was too goofy and didn't have a legit story/serious side and so I presumed I couldn't enjoy it.

I ended up giving it a try and watching some episodes and I really really liked it. The character development, world building and mystery sub plots making you want to keep watching, and the show itself keeps getting better and better after every arc.

I highly suggest watching it. The beginning episodes while awesome, can be a little slow as it has to build the characters and such but it really ramps up after that. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

Reason: Action, fantasy, comedy, a good choice as a big anime to keep on watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yes because reasons.

No, really. It's fantastically well put together. Oda makes one hell of an amazing job with One Piece. The story develops very nicelly, as well as the characters. Just try a few episodes. Feel the pace of the anime, you know?
>> ARTICLE
You should at least give it a try. I stopped on episode 250 because I got burnt out, but I'll definitely continue later. It's pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
well, it is faster to read the manga and rewatch the fight scenes.

or, if you really want to watch it, skip all the fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah. It starts off a little slow and a bit boring for me but Imo once you reach episode 31 you'll be hooked
>> ARTICLE
no, go read it.
>> ARTICLE
no, way too long
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's a really fantastic series and I don't think any other series does adventure as well as One Piece does.

You'll laugh, you'll cry because it's sad, you'll cry because it's so happy, and you'll yell when shit gets really serious.

It's the best show of all time, nothing comes close and never will.

So yeah, you should watch it.

thats..not true. like, even objectively its not true. It could be argued that its the best shonen at the moment, but hunter x hunter takes that throne pretty easily. Its definitely better than Naruto and bleach, but thats not saying much

It's just an anime not that his opinion matters nor will he ever accept to find faults in his favourite show, there is no point in having a comment war with a 'Ignorant fanboy' which will be end in pointless debate as there won't ever come a conclusive answer.
>> ARTICLE
Understood 
>> ARTICLE
Ive seen alot of anime, and when i first watched One Piece i really didnt like the animation style and i also found it very "goofy". After giving it another chance its now my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. It starts out very small-scale and personal, and gradually builds up until there's a huge variety of character connections and focuses on multiple characters and events all at once. There's not really any arcs or characters where you think "that could have been written better." Something that always makes an interesting story is having interesting villains, and Oda is great at giving character development or backstory even to side characters. A lot of people will say that for the sake of time, you should just read it, but to me the anime does an amazing job of bringing everything to life, and it's definitely worth the commitment.
>> ARTICLE
Currently on episode 168 and I'm digging it.

A question of my own: I've heard that the anime starts going downhill after episode 405 and that I should switch to the manga at that point. Is this a valid claim or have I been misinformed?
>> ARTICLE
The anime has pacing issues around then, but honestly it's not something that I really gave a shit about when I first caught up (to ep 630) a few years ago. The anime still does well with all the big moments and I think it's still very much worth watching.


>> ARTICLE
A lot of people like to complain about Toei, but they do a good job for a weekly anime. The first couple arcs after 405 actually have imo the best animation out of all. It does change a bit over time, but all you should notice is the increase in quality. There is a little drop in detail, but it's still good enough to me.
>> ARTICLE
IMO (yea down vote me I'm ready) if your intrested in One Piece then read it......your going to be watching it FOREVER the author said we are barely halfway........so your looking at maybe.......10 or 14 more years of this....   ? That's a serious time commitment I think it's pretty cool but I simply don't have the time to watch 6 or 700 + episodes of anything but yes it's I guess you can watch it but reading it would work better if slightly shorter on time like me.

Edit: actually after further research it's like 70% done I think sorry but still worth checking oUT 
>> ARTICLE
They said the manga is 70% finished tho So we are probably looking at 6-7 years.
>> ARTICLE
That's still a long time

It's 70% done. Not barely halfway.

Really? I heard that he was 75% done.

nope. the timeskip was the halfway point so this is wrong

I wish it was only halfway. I managed to watch around 600 episodes in a couple months, and juggle everything else at the same time. Probably because I got so into it, any work I did was for the sake of finding free time later to watch more.

I mean, jokes aside if you have a significant other who doesn't want you enjoying certain hobbies because they don't like them, they shouldn't be a significant other in the first place.

Had a boyfriend who would continually get upset if I just happened to be playing video games while IMing with him. He threatened to broke up with me like three times over it until I eventually just got fucking sick of it and did it myself. 

The hilarious part? He doesn't play video games that much, yet he's a game design major.

I love Shoujo. I seriously love it and this is coming from a guy who is straight. It just gives me a nice romance to watch without having to think about so many complicated things. Also, you can see things from a different perspective. It's almost like you can see romance in a new way and different way. I also like reverse harems sometimes. I find the characters more interesting than a regular harem.
>> ARTICLE
It's especially good if the girl MC doesn't struggle to spill spaghettis for 24 episodes and they get to the romance quick enough, that's my opinion tho.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you on that one, also Shoujo tend to include an early confession, so the shows often are about the relationship problems and not Nisekoi-level of nothing really happening. 
>> ARTICLE
I just hope when I make a girlfriend that she doesn't think of me as a freak when I tell I her like to watch anime. Especially when you tend to watch romance genre :/

*What she doesn't know can't ~~hurt her~~ weird her out*

I've already decided for the next girl I date I'm going to sneakily get her to watch a Ghibli film after a marathon of other cartoons (UP/WALL-E/Tangled/etc.), and then I'll slowly creep in an entry-level show like FMA:B, AoT, or Baccano! before I get her watching Usagi Drop and other Shoujo shows (or Kyoani stuff).

Within 3 years it'll either have worked or she'll have long since dumped me.

No it isn't. Don't mix 2D and 3D, bruh.
>> ARTICLE
If you're joking around because this is a silly thread, hehe.

If not, how does that work?  I enjoy fiction because it relates situations that may be fantastic, but which explore realistic emotions and human nature.  Oregairu rings so true because it follows a period our life many viewers can relate too.  5 Centimeters per Second touches on the longing and depression old relationships can have on us.  Log Horizon Season 2 was what actually prompted me to finally level my WoW character to 100 and find my way into the second best raiding guild on my server.

The "2D" can tell just as emotionally engaging stories as the 3D, sometimes even more so.  I *want* to be able to engage with characters, it's a positive thing to create believable characters whose feelings, emotions, and actions resonate with the viewers, and when a character who I've come to like and relate with *has romantic or sexual feelings for their younger sister...*

Ick.

I never said I didn't enjoy it, I think it's a pretty good show. 

I just don't understand how people can write entire essays on an episode.

you can write an essay on pretty much every anime episode of any series. You can find intricacies and depth (whether there purposefully put there is another debate) in even simple anime, hell I've seen 3-5k essays on Chunibyo and Non non biyori (not taking anything away from these series as they are both great).

I tend to agree with that. Hibike! Euphonium has pretty great characters and lots of fun interactions between them. Most of those yuri-baiting scenes however just feel off because, other than being romantically interested and being very forward, I can't really see why Reina would behave so incredibly intimate. I mean there's a difference between being somewhat awkward and not quite knowing boundaries and getting up close and touchy feely like it happened last episode.

Those scenes stand out even more because of how much animation effort is put into them.

Going through Monogatari right now. It's a wild ride. I can't say that there are any other animes like this one. Yeah, Shaft is big on fanservice, but the dialogue just blows me away.

I've been busy watching the other thousand anime that I "have" to watch. Just finished Madoka Magica today.

The Monogatari Series and Madoka both share a few voice actors and studio. Completely different stories but if you liked Madoka I'm sure you'd enjoy Monogatari
>> ARTICLE
Psch, FMA:B should have had more priority on your list than Madoka. I just finished that recently as well, actually. How'd you like it?

It only had more priority than FMA because, well, you can't exactly watch all of FMA in a single day. Madoka on the other hand...

I personally thought Madoka was very good. A few minor problems, but overall thought it was well above average and a very enjoyable experience. It was my first time watching something by Shaft so I finally understand the "head tilt" references :p. I'm most likely going to be watching the third movie tonight (which I have pretty much only heard negative things about, so we'll see how that goes).

If you don't reply to this I'll assume you watched the third movie and your head just straight exploded

In that case I guess I'd say save the best for last. It's also said one of the characters are done better in FMA so you care about them more. So watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood last. That way you end off on the best of the two.
>> ARTICLE
Ya I mean I've heard mixed things from people, some prefer the first series, but most prefer brotherhood. I was told to watch the older one first just because the newer one obviously looks way nicer, so watching that then trying to go back to the older one is harder to do.

I've only seen about 20 or so episodes of it but I like it. it's very entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
I've yet to see any of it. Fairy Tail is one of the few shows that I watch dubbed, and Funimation hasn't dubbed any of it yet.

Looks like the dub for the first 12 episodes are coming out on August 25th, though. That's exciting.
>> ARTICLE
It's not about the filler itself...The animation decayed, the soundtrack is totally inferior, I don't get why they removed the magic circles that looked cool, the fights were better in the older version, the color palette looks weird on the new version as well...Idk, they changed it too much, it doesn't feel the same at all, but maybe that's just me, I still love the manga though.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed they dulled the color palette for this arc, which fits it considering the tone of this arc.  The quality itself is back up to par, though.  The soundtrack is definitely inferior and it's a shame.
>> ARTICLE
Magic circles aren't in the manga, that's why they're gone. The new art studio is...not as good as the other in most departments. But with the new arc that just started recently, it's gonna be good.
>> ARTICLE
I know they aren't in the manga, still, they added a certain degree of awesomeness to the attacks imo, now they look so plain...
>> ARTICLE
That disappeared a while ago though. I did enjoy it, but only for powerful attacks and such. It doesn't bother me that it's gone. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail 2014 filler doesn't exist. That shit sucked balls. Everything else is pretty good. And the new arc(Tartarus) that just started up is considered by just about everyone who's read the manga's favorite arc. So it's getting better. ;)

I like SAO

I love SAO. *runs away and hides

No need to run and hide. This is /r/anime; we respect, value and agree with your opinion, and are rational, accepting human beings.

You forgot to add /s to your comment.
>> ARTICLE
That was serious. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^/s
>> ARTICLE
so brave
>> ARTICLE
I'm very passionate about disliking the parts of SAO that suck (story and characters mainly), but praising other aspects of it.

Calling SAO an absolute piece of shit isn't necessarily fair because it DOES have its strong points. 
>> ARTICLE
Along with the 29,645 MAL users who have it as a favorite, or the 265,234 users who have it as an 8 or above.
>> ARTICLE
I have never met an anime fan in real life that dislikes SAO. I honestly feel that I'm in a minority just for thinking it was fun but not special. I've only met one other person that's even willing to go that far.
>> ARTICLE
It's really fun to watch, no doubt. Cool/attractive character designs, interesting setting, kickass animation, and also weapons. People just get riled up about the bad writing and static personalities.
>> ARTICLE
I disliked full Metal alchemist since it aired. I'm not kidding  I just disliked the leads and couldn't enjoy its story, not saying it ain't good, just saying I disliked it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of with you. I like the plot to FMA, but the two leads are just so unfunny. The constant unfunny short jokes get to ya after a while.

I cannot **stand** Gurren Lagann, for some reason I find it mind numbingly boring, yet I had a riot watching Kill La Kill.

I'm in the same boat. Gurren Lagann has its moments,  but it just seems really boring and contrived. KLK on the other hand, KLK is too awesome for words.

Standard Shirou progression in F/SN:

Here goes nothing....

I enjoy fan service to the point where, when there is no fan service I'm actually disappointed. I love the pantie shots, ass shots, overly jiggling boobs that are way to big for her head, the sexual advances, the tongues and everything related. Now here me out, this only depends on the type of anime it is. If it's a serious show, like *Attack on titan* or *Tokyo ghoul* then I wouldn't be expecting any or next to none at all. If it's a light hearted with an interesting story then yes bring on the fan service, like *Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?* or *Rosario To Vampire*. Now you're probably thinking why not just watch porn or hentai? it's because I like to be teased without giving away too much, I could go watch porn any time, jerk myself off and be done with it but with anime I'm actually interested in the story and fanservice is like my little reward for sticking around. Your chances of fucking some made up character is higher than fucking that poster girl on your wall these days with VR and whatever the Asian love industry can come up with. 
>> ARTICLE
Am I looking at the mirror?
>> ARTICLE
I fucking HATE old art styles, literally anything animated before 2000 is a pain in the ass to watch. I quit NGE. Cowboy bebop, Logh, and all the other super famous shows that everybody on here raves about that came out before 2000. I know they are good, and I think I might like some of them... but god fuck the animation looks so retarded.
>> ARTICLE
...i'm not gonna downvote, but a good anime is more about the story than the animation, from what you said it would mean that Boku no Pico is more watchable than Cowboy Bebop, and just writing that makes my brain hurt.
>> ARTICLE
I don't deny that they have good stories, but I just hate the art style enough that watching it no matter how good the story is ends up being a chore because I hate how all the characters and everything looks. Maybe someday ill force myself through them, but until then I plan to avoid them as every time I try to watch them currently I get 5 episodes in and quit due to hating the animation.
>> ARTICLE
Sailor Moon is and always will be a key anime in my life and has helped me through countless hardships in my life... But I've never watched the final season. *I'm so ashamed...*
>> ARTICLE
You MUST watch Sailor Stars!! I have not read the manga so i don't know how much it diverges, but it was absolutely amazing! It really felt like a combinsation of everything I enjoyed from previous seasons - with less of the fillerish episodes.

When I feel lonely, I sometimes look up doujins of Tomoko from WataMote..

I prefer slice of life anime more than anything else. :|
>> ARTICLE
The reason I have friends is because of anime. Fairy Tail always centered (or at least tried to) on friendship and it made me realize that I cannot depend on myself all the time. Plus, it hits deep for me because I always have a good time with friends. Shows like that just me cognizant of what I have and should strive for in life.

anime men are often more attractive than real life men 
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen most anime women? If women like that existed on a normal basis, I'd have blisters. Personality wise.. people in general tend to not have as charming of, noticeable, personallity as any anime character. Most attractive males in anime are Alucard and professor Stein though. NO COMPETITION. 
>> ARTICLE
Lots of anime women I've seen have been really dull and bland (as far as personality goes). The tsundere character archetype is something that I see often, which I'm not fond of. Teresa from Claymore is my favorite female character of all time; I consider her my waifu. And she's also pretty hot, even though I don't care about women in general. 

Most attractive anime men imo personality and look-wise are Sinbad (Magi), Gaara (Naruto), and Willard (Umineko - he's not in the anime but I'll count him anyways)
>> ARTICLE
I like Fairy Tail :c It's my guilty pleasure.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like Inaba in Kokoro Connect.    
I found Psycho-Pass S2 much more enjoyable than S1.    
I don't like Izaya as a villain. 
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see enjoying s2 more than s1. S2 doesn't deal with the different philosophical principles that s1 was enamored with and just opted for action.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, I like philosophical anime, but S1 threw its morals and "questions" in the viewers' face and spelled them out. A lot of times, Tsunemori feels like an ambassador of the audience - "this is what you should feel, this is the reaction you're supposed to have, those are the questions you're supposed to ask yourself". One of the few truly interesting topics brought up by Psycho-Pass was butchered; they kept throwing more and more reasons why Sibyl is bad and added flaws to it (that are irrelevant to the core question - the existence and + vs - of such a system, freedom vs happiness) to further the "Sibyl is wrong" argument.       
The rivalry (for the lack of a better world) between Kougami and Makishima also suffered the same con (especially in the beginning), although to a lesser degree.   
I also had quite a few problems with the worldbuilding. [](/s "How the hell can Japan be this prosperous (or, to put it better and simpler, have all this stuff) while COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD? Where do they get all those natural resources, all that fuel, tobacco, all that everything? And don't even get me started on the motherfucking HYPEROATS.")
It did get better in the second part of S1, but the flaws haven't disappeared completely. And S2 threw philosophy out the window (not completely, but still), which took most of the most glaring flaws of S1 with it. 
>> ARTICLE
Same same, I like Iori as a character more!!
>> ARTICLE
>I didn't like Inaba in Kokoro Connect.

That's a pretty serious typo, my friend. I can't even figure out what you're trying to say. 
>> ARTICLE
WHAT.

THE. 

FUCK.
>> ARTICLE
And that's not all - I disliked her voice, too. I genuinely don't understand why everyone likes her so much (well, actually, I kinda do, since she's somewhat more original and less typical than the others, but I don't necessarily find that a plus). 
>> ARTICLE
I actually really dislike NGE and Clannad.

It's an /r/anime cardinal sin I know. 

NGE was just... a joke to me. It was a mecha anime trying way too hard to be deep and philosophical, it was a massive clusterfuck of a story with characters who for some reason are archetypal tropes now. Any time I watch it with friends I have a need to scream "SYMBOLISM" anytime NGE goes "edgy philosophy mode".

As for Clannad I literally don't like it. Admittedly I stopped after the Fuuko arc, but everyone had been telling me that it gets better after that arc. You mean to fucking tell me that it takes 8 whole episodes before an anime gets good? Nope. Done. I'm out. The art style is way too moe for my tastes as well. I don't even mind romance animes, either. I genuinely enjoy them sometimes but I don't understand the appeal to KyoAni shows.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, ^but ^I ^still ^love ^Clannad ^to ^death
>> ARTICLE
Seryuu Ubiquitous is one of my favorite villains in anime.

I also didn't watch Kyoukai no Kanata because I felt that the female lead wasn't moe enough.
>> ARTICLE
The base story for her was fine but it was taken too far, she stopped being Seryuu Ubiquitous with a backstory and motivations that made sense and became generic over the top villian, Justice Bitch! Good concept executed poorly.

Same deal with Esdeath, an awe inspiring powerful woman who slowly falls in love with a guy from the other side would have been good. Instead she immediately propositions him and he isn't really down for it.
>> ARTICLE
I love yaoi undertones(and just regular shounen ai and yaoi as well).

Also K-On is boring as fuck, and the way they try so hard to make the characters seem cute is obnoxious.
>> ARTICLE
it depends on how the undertones are played for me

>> ARTICLE
Subtle undertone anal and brojobs are the best I'd say.
>> ARTICLE
Monster bored me so much that after finishing it I lost interest in anime for about 3 years.

I never tell someone I like anime unless I know they also like anime.
>> ARTICLE
I actually like Absolute Duo. 

I dropped AoT after one episode because I can't take those titans serious.

I didn't ship Inaba in Kokoro Connect.

I still believe people dislike Accel World because it's bad not because the mc is a Cartman rip-off (to be fair Kuroyukihime is awesome. Saving grace of the show)

I wasn't mad about the OreImo ending because I saw that coming all along. I still ship Ayase tho. 

I still think Mahou Sensou wasn't as bad as people say it was. The ending was a train wreck but the rest was still enjoyable.

I didn't cry a single tear while watching AnoHana. It was way to predictable for me.
>> ARTICLE
You actually like Absolute Duo.

Ok.

I get it man. 

[Mentally screams]

[Dies internally](#blank-stare)

like this?

Yeah I watched Oreimo and by the end I was like, "Shit sucks for Kyousuke" but I didn't feel the need to drop the score to a 1 lol. 


>> ARTICLE
I can't watch shows like Baccano or Kekkai Sensen. Whenever I try to, I get so uninterested and fall asleep. I TRIED, OKAY.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode of Baccano, and didn't understand anything and it seemed a bit boring since it didn't seem to focus on the characters. I didn't watch the second episode.

I actually think 2D girls are better than 3D.

Anime thread discussion has so much shit (namely everyone's opinions) and very less actual material (namely actual interpretations of the material).

I have yet to finish TTGL, Cowboy Bebop, and Trigun.

I have all of them essentially on hold, but I just stopped them for one reason or another. They are all good, high quality shows but for one spoiler or another I just lost interest.

They are all marked completed on my mal cuz otherwise all I would get for recs would be to finish them or people telling me to finish them when they look at my list, and while I will, i would rather not have people up on my back to do it.
>> ARTICLE
> Trigun

I FINSHED SORA NO WOTO FOR YOU, NOW YOU GO FINISH TRIGUN RIGHT NOW!!!! ^/s But it's understandable, Trigun honestly isn't meant for everyone and it's your opinion to put it On Hold if you need some time before getting back into it. And I can't stay mad because Sora No Woto was fucking fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
the problem is, ive seen the first 6 eps twice now, and then like 12 15, 16, and 22-23 just from people by me watching it, soo... :/

ill watch it I promise!!
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen NGE, Trigun, and numerous other series that everyone has seen. Also, while I can agree that it was overhyped, I liked Shingeki no Kyojin, and I think Kill la Kill and Gurann Laggan were brilliant, and no one will ever convince me otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
>I liked Shingeki no Kyojin, and I think Kill la Kill and Gurann Laggan were brilliant, and no one will ever convince me otherwise.

~~I didn't like Inaba from Kokoro Connect (granted I didn't watch Michi Random yet)~~

I didn't like Gekkan Shojuo Nozaki-kun's OP and Death parade's OP.

I think Angel Beat's is bad and [Spoilers](/s "felt that the romance is pretty forced")

I enjoyed the second half of Durarara more.

I loved Zero no Tsukaima. 

edit: Okay I will get to Michi Random before jumping to a conclusion
>> ARTICLE
Watch Michi Random, because it gives more closure.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's important you watch Michi Random before jumping to a conclusion on Inaba.  You're not wrong about Angel Beats.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand the appeal of Puella Magi Madoka Magica but will happily watch Is it wrong to try pick up girls in a dungeon? as if it's the best anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop/TTGL.

Edit: Bonus! I watched Highschool of the Dead even though I thought it was average at best just because a girl I liked had seen it. I also watched Hellsing for the same reason but actually liked that.
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Madoka, though? I noticed it's not on your list, and not understanding the appeal of something is different than not enjoying it. 

Did you try it and dislike it? Or did you hear/see something about the show that turned you off of it before you watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it up until that magic girl you know what.

Just couldn't get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 Mirai Nikki made me drop the anime for a while before i finished it.

I really don't like Platinum Disco and Renai Circulation. They're both sort of cute, but nothing more than that. I don't understand the appeal one bit.

Also, I still don't know if AtLA and LoK are classified as animes, since they weren't made in Japan, so can someone please tell me?

One of which was only 6 episodes long.

It's a slow process getting into the form of media.

I go through phases like this.

Usually only lasts a maximum of a week until I find a series that I binge and complete in a day.

Not the case with me.

Of course, I'm not that good at finding stuff in the first place.

EDIT Also, for the record, I do intend to bring that up to 4 series eventually. (Gotta wait for UBW to actually FINISH first... unless it might have done so already? Not really sure)

I think Edward Elric is 10 times hotter with his automail arm than without it. In fact, in the epilogue he looks like a loser.

I dropped Hyouka half way through because I couldn't find anything I liked about it. I think Chitanda is really annoying,  and during every episode I was getting really bored and couldn't get through them in one sitting before I finally dropped the show. 
>> ARTICLE
I like a lot of ecchi shows, even if they don't have much plot, mostly because they usually end up being hilarious.

Edit: Also, I think Oreimo is shit because none of the characters a likable.
>> ARTICLE
I hate clannad, its my least favorite show, I feel princess mononoke is one of Studio ghibli's weaker films, I like howl's moving castle.. a lot.. I hated 5 centimeters per second, I disliked hyouka and Great teacher onizuka. I have a mild dislike for trigun, the only thing keeping that series afloat to me is vash. I hate chitoge, I feel tsugumi is a far better love interest for the MC. My favorite character in Death note was mello, followed closely by near. I disliked mirai nikki, a lot, I felt it was relying too much on the main girl character to carry the story and its plot and the other characters were weak in comparison. I liked lisa & five from zankyou no terror. I liked the first part of steins gate more than the second part. I don't like K-on, its seems to boring, the only character in there that I liked was mugi because she added [conflict](http://i.imgur.com/UzTpIFi.gif) and she had adorable eyebrows. I didn't ship the childhood friend in golden time.

I don't even like anime, as anime, I like it because I never see what's going to happen coming, even though I might know in a distant way. Anime just has a whole nother level of tropes I ain't exposed to anywhere else. 

Someday, someday maybe soon, I'll stop being horrifically shocked every time incest themes come up. Someday panty shots and creepy-ass main characters won't make me jump in my seat as if ants are crawling into my urthera. Someday I'll get over the fact that *people just don't have noses half the time.* 

Until then, I'll continue to enjoy noting down "no nose," "pinhole for nose," and "arch nose."
