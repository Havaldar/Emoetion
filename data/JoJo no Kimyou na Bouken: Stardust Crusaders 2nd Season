At long last, we finally made it! We've made it to the end of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and what an adventure it was. I hope you all had a great time watching and reacting. I certainly loved reading each and every comment.

I wanna get something out the way first, because I absolutely know that somebody is going to say it. **No, DIO's death was not an asspull. It was foreshadowed when he was talking to Hol Horse and mentioned that the left half of his body was significantly weaker than the right. Did you happen to notice which side Jotaro punched?**

Tomorrow I'll have all sorts of polls and links for you guys. I'd go through the trouble of hunting them all down for today's thread, but I really need to get to work on finishing the JoJo podcast coming out in a few hours, so they'll have to wait. Some of the videos will probably be posted here by other people anyway, but we'll see what happens.
>> ARTICLE
Thank god someone said it. I hate seeing people who say this fight ended with two asspulls. Both are properly foreshadowed.
>> ARTICLE
In retrospect, DIO's death can be considered an ass-pull, but while watching I was frankly too hyped to give a damn. And that's basically what Jojo is all about.
>> ARTICLE
An asspull is when something comes to save the heroes with absolutely no foreshadowing at all. This was definitely foreshadowed. Whether somebody finds it satisfying is a completely different discussion, but it is not an asspull by definition.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the thing is... I really don't think that's how people take it. More like they *don't expect* foreshadowing from a series like Jojo. So, when it comes, no one makes the connection.

After your explanation, I don't see a problem with it at all, but not many will.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice that at first. 
>> ARTICLE
> After your explanation, I don't see a problem with it at all, but not many will.

This is one of the biggest things I see from people, actually. There are a lot of people out there who think that DIO's death and Jotaro's time stop are both giant asspulls.
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro's time stop is absolutely foreshadowed multiple times, so that's bullshit. If anyone thinks it's _really_ a coincidence that Jotaro's stand just happened to be the only one without an established "stand power," then I can't do anything to help them.

No, punching is not a power.
>> ARTICLE
But once DIO drank Joseph's blood, the scar on his neck was gone and he had complete control over Jonathan's body. So presumably that weakness he had was gone. 
>> ARTICLE
I just took it as that he needed to drink Jotaros blood to be complete.
>> ARTICLE
Not Complete Cell yet
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't even his final form.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy was it not.
>> ARTICLE
> No, DIO's death was not an asspull. It was foreshadowed when he was talking to Hol Horse and mentioned that the left half of his body was significantly weaker than the right. Did you happen to notice which side Jotaro punched?

I never thought it was an asspull and honestly can't even think of why people might accuse it of being one, but wasn't drinking the blood of a Joestars supposed to reconcile DIO's head with Jonathan's body and end this weakness?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I guess so. I kinda forgot about that, and now I look like an idiot :/
>> ARTICLE
It's okay Smurf, we love you anyway!

[](#flattered)

Thanks, guys. It means a lot to me that everybody enjoyed the rewatch so much.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't a certain thing. DIO thought it'd work but he didn't have any proof, and during the Vanilla Ice arc he implied that he merely wanted to have the final drink come from a Joestar rather than it being a requirement.
>> ARTICLE
I actually thought his leg shattered because Jotaro broke it just mere seconds before that punch.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought The World shattered because it has a way lower durability than other Stands in order to compensate for its time-stopping power.
>> ARTICLE
I like that answer too.
>> ARTICLE
> Tomorrow I'll have all sorts of polls and links for you guys.

Hype! JoJo doesn't end! 
>> ARTICLE
Mostly because Part 4 anime comes out on April 1st...
>> ARTICLE
Similarly to last thread, but this time it's /u/NoPenNameGirl who couldn't make it, so she asked to me post her comment today:

One note about DIO sucking Joseph's blood: In the fighting games like All Star Battle, if Part 3 DIO suck the blood of any member of the Joestar family (AKA, anyone with the star birthmark), he repeat the same animation and speech. It's a really nice touch!

I REALLY like that scene with Joseph spirit. This show such character development from Jotaro's part in relation with his Grandfather. He started not caring about him, but ended creating a deep bond with Joseph to the point of really feeling his "death". I really love that.

Needeless to say, the Road Roller Da is DIO biggest Super Move in the Fighting games. [There is a legendary combo with that move, which can kill the opponent on the spot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CamPXxfl7Lw). It takes a lot of Super Bars, so while is awesome, isn't pratical in Tournaments. ALSO, Jotaro can cancel DIO time stop in the Capcom Game with his own, so he technically can escape the combo if he has at least two Super Bars. Same with All Star Battle, [he is able to escape the Road Roller special with two Super Bars as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XAt_a5H2CA), giving you a awesome cutscene.

People say DIO's death make no sense... they're wrong. Remember the talk DIO had with Hol Horse: He said the left side of his body is less "perfect" than the right side. DIO kicked Jotaro with his bad leg, which was the reason why he died. There is nothing senseless about that, DIO just got hasty.

"There is one reason you lost... DIO... one answer..."

"You pissed me off!"

One of my favorite lines in the series, along with Joseph saying was all his plan towards Kars. It's also what Jotaro generally says in the end when you use his biggest Super Move in fighting games.

Joseph trolling Jotaro is simple just GOLD! That's why I LOVE Joseph. Glad he is fine! Part 4 won't have been the same without him due to another favorite scene I have with him there.


Finally, Jonathan got avenged! Since I actually liked Jonathan, this is SO satisfying. After several episodes, he can finally rest in peace. Rest well, OG Jojo.

And so Part 3 comes to a end, with Jotaro feeling diferent than when he started, looking at the photo of his friends. All I can say is: Are you ready to DUWANG? Because I AM!

I guess with Dio's transformation, he got a cool new hairdo and some really green lipstick. Kinda worried for you Dio. What will people think when they see you with green lipstick?

Your getting a bit creepy there Dio. I liked you better before this transformation. 

NO!!! JOESPH'S GHOST! ;_;

Now you're just being a massive dick Dio. He's already dead, just let him be. 

SFX opening! Nice!

There's the WRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYY!!!!!!

Talking is a free action like always. Even while time is stopped, can monologue forever. 

Holy shit, Jotaro is getting rekt. 

Why is Dio gone? I have a bad feeling....

RODA ROLLAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That's actually really random, to go grab that construction vehicle and smash it on him. Then again, that's the best vehicle for flattening someone.

JOTARO NOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh shit, Jotaro has the time stop power now.

Jotaro stopped time inside a time stop. And yet, Dio is still able to talk. 

More random analogies. Araki y?

Wow Dio, you're getting pretty petty there. 

Holy shit. A single punch completely demolished Dio.

Kinda being a little full of yourself there Jotaro. Technically Dio could've won the fight at multiple moments. 

With stands, anything is possible for the JoJo family.

I can't believe it, they got Joseph back from the dead. This is great.

WAIT! NOOOOOOO!!!!!!! HOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!?!?!??!?!?!

It was just a prank bro, calm down. Joseph you prankster you.  

These are some really random questions. But hey, the answers rhymed which was pretty cool. 

And now Dio is dead for good I hope. 

What a touching scene ;_;

Looks like Polnareff is off to go on his own bizarre adventures. 

lel, Joseph still has his walkman. 

I miss the "To be continued" arrow at the end ;_;

And it's over. Thanks Smurf for hosting the rewatch. It was aight. Looking forward to part 4 tomorrow.

I always loved the road roller part. So many Oras and Mudas. A beautiful symphony.
>> ARTICLE
[DUWANG! DUWANG!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQigxCLz0S0/maxresdefault.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Road roller was such a ridiculous idea. Did like the Ora Ora vs. Muda Muda ontop of a steam roller. 

Jotaro with coolest line of "You pissed me off"

The true protagonist of JoJo lives and all is right.

Part of me is happy that Joseph lived, but at the same time not really. It kind of cheapens Joseph's "death" and the whole soul moving on moment earlier. Bringing back Joseph felt like a cheap cop out that doesn't really accomplish anything other than bringing a character back for the sake of it. Also, isn't Joseph's blood mixed in with Dio's blood such that if they used his blood wouldn't that make him a vampire?   

To be honest, I'd say I still prefer the Vanilla ice fight as my favourite Stardust Crusader fight. The DIO fight lacked a certain spark to it. Not saying that it was a *bad* fight. Just a fight that I wasn't as invested into in comparison to the Vanilla Ice vs. Polly and Iggy battle. 
>> ARTICLE
> Also, isn't Joseph's blood mixed in with Dio's blood such that if they used his blood wouldn't that make him a vampire?

I've seen this question a lot and the common answer is that Joseph's Hamon cancelled it out.
>> ARTICLE
I think Joseph can't use Hamon anymore because of DIO's blood in his body. You know how Hamon makes you live healthier and longer? Well, in Part 3, Joseph is about fifty but still looks ruggedly handsome and muscular. In Part 4, Joseph is about sixty and he really looks it.
>> ARTICLE
A theory I've seen is that Joseph stopped practicing Hamon so that he wouldn't outlive Suzi Q by a long, long time.
>> ARTICLE
That also be why [Jojo manga](/s "he's so old in part four. He couldn't use hamon without hurting himself.")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/s "I heard that he only did that so he can die old together with Suzie Q.")
>> ARTICLE
I've never heard that, though it is pretty cliche. [Jojo Manga](/s "Makes it a bit weird considering he survived until Made In Heaven.")
>> ARTICLE
> Part of me is happy that Joseph lived, but at the same time not really. 

But we got to see the best trolling in all of anime because of that scene!
>> ARTICLE
Was certainly a classic Joseph scene.

Best Guy is too good!

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
just a little nitpick. i don't honestly think the polnareff namechange is an eiffel 65 reference considering how part 3 and eiffel 65 are almost a decade apart (even if it is you said 95) :P other than that great job overall

edit: full force and hol horse seems most likely because lisa lisa and cult jam collaborated with them many times. 
>> ARTICLE
So will you continue in part 4?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
And here we are...The grand finale. I'm honestly wondering if it can manage to trump Part 2's ending.

* Fuck DIO... Seriously. 

* Joseph's soul.. ;-; ... I am not ready. 

* Fuck DIO!!!

* Sfx opening hype!! Oh hell yeah. This is twice as awesome

* WTF? He can do it for more than 5 seconds now!?

* Shit... He's down... And now DIO is gone!

* Road Roller... Ok that was hilarious

* The grand finale. Ora vs Muda

* Horry sheet... All that happened in 2 seconds.

* Eh... DIO can't move... But Jotaro can... WHAAAAAT!??

* Jotaro can stop time, too... Araki what the actual fuck!?!?

* Based Jotaro is so broken OP... 

* Yeah, can you kill DIO about now? I have a policy about villains being left alive. It basically says: "Don't"

* The ORA of truth!!!

* There's something delicious about that moment a villain goes BAKANA!! Doubly so if it's a douchebag like DIO

* And so... DIO is dead... FUCKING YOROKOBE!!!

* Kakyoin confirmed dead. PolPol confirmed alive. And Joseph can somehow pull out of...well...having his soul fly away??

* Oh yes. Let's add CPR to Star Platinum's list of BS abilities.

* He's DIO! Wut!?

* Oh goddamned Joseph and his sense of humor.

* PolPol is going back to France. Yeah, I never did grow to like the guy.

* Ah yes. The best form of male bonding: Exchanging insults

And so ends Part 3... Join me tomorrow as I write way too much in one comment explaining my thoughts about the series and possible predictions/expectations for Part 4 (First ep should've aired by then). I'll also put up the final versions of all the counters there. See ya all there. Now off to figure out how to host my own rewatch without having it crash and burn.

Hint: There's a reason this series fucking disabled my profanity filter for the last 2 months.

> Jotaro can stop time, too... Araki what the actual fuck!?!?

Stopping time is the same as moving in frozen time
>> ARTICLE
Actually no... Because stand powers aren't shown to be absolute. DIO doesn't stop time itself, he merely allows himself to freeze an area around him (5 metres?) for 5 seconds. Jotaro was shown to be able to resist that.

DIO was subjected to the exact same but couldn't resist it. Implying that Jotaro's ability is more potent. 

>> ARTICLE
DIO does stop time itself, he just can't reach anything too far away in that time hence the talk about short range.
>> ARTICLE
>he just can't reach anything too far away

Except when Araki demanded a road roller. :D
>> ARTICLE
Nope, DIOs timestop is universal.
>> ARTICLE
Imagine there being like ~1000 time stoppers in the entire universe and every one notices it when another one pulls off his powers.
>> ARTICLE
For real!?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I forgot where I read this from. /u/smurfrockrune can probably confirm
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, there are two time abilities I've seen discussed this way, and one of them is universal, but I can't remember which one.

One of them is DIO's Za Warudo, and the other is [Part 5](/s "Diavolo's King Crimson.")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 6 spoilers](/s "Made in Heaven is also universal")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 6 and Jorge Joestar](/s "Unless you're too busy drawing manga to realize it.")
>> ARTICLE
The part 5 one is distance related.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I wonder what that would look like if you used binoculars?
>> ARTICLE
Man, I hate trying to explain [Part 5](/s "King Crimson"). From what I understand and can remember [Part 5](/s "He skips time, removing any events in it while the positions remain, without the affected ones remembering. This is just a theory but, I feel that time flows normally but those events inside the range have their effects (like damage) negated and memories wiped. I'd like to think that looking at it with binoculars would look like someone shot a bullet and it just went through without hurting the target and they all got confused. I could be wrong about the distance thing though.")
>> ARTICLE
Probably the same as if you were inside it, like some fucking bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost absolutely not canon in any way, but it's worth noting as a curiosity that in Jorge Joestar [Jorge Joestar LN](/s "The World only stops time on Earth, and all the other Stand powers that seem to affect all of time and space actually just affect time and space on Earth.")
>> ARTICLE
No. All but [Jojo Manga](/s "two" ) (thanks Smurf) time stands are global. For all intents and purposes it stops time for the entire universe. Jotaro can resist that because he can also stop time so the length of time that Jotaro can stop time is the length that he can move in it. How would a "bubble" of time stop work? What happens if something is partly in the bubble? Does part of it stay and part of it go or is it completely stopped?

And for your second point, DIO stopped time for his eleven seconds. Jotaro also stopped time at nine seconds. Becasue DIO used nine of his eleven seconds he can move for two. Jotaro then has two seconds where he isn't stopped and DIO is.

Remember when he respected Jonathan once? RIP that character development.

Omg his soul is talking to him so he really did die ugh I can't.

BEST GUY DOESN'T DESERVE THIS! 

OMG JOTARO IS ACTUALLY ENRAGED! I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY!

AWWW YUS SFX OP! 

[Literally](#WRYYY)

Dio is such a shit. I hate Dio so much! 

My heart can not hang. 

Wow really? Dropping shit on him? Kind of a cop out Dio.

> This proves that no one can surpass Dio!

He can't move?? WHAT'S HAPPENING? 

OMG JOTARO CAN CONTROL TIME NOW?! AND DIO CAN'T MOVE!!

This is epic but STOP TALKING AND FINISH HIM!

Actually agreeing with Dio, really shouldn't wait for him to heal and should just finish him now. 

# NOW THAT'S ONE PUNCH MAN! 

> There's just one simple reason why you lost...you really pissed me off. 

> DIO...The World - Utterly Defeated... Dead

Would like on a t-shirt pls. 

Holy Shit, now what?! What do we even do now?

I guess we bring Best Guy back to life? That's a plan to me!

Jotaro too GAR. I can't hang with how boss he is. Joestar best family for sure. 

Oh no is he evil now?! MAYBE THIS WAS A BAD IDEA! YES IT WAS A BAD IDEA! 

> W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding! Kidding! I'm just kidding!

...oh my god are you serious? I'm laughing my ass off right now OMG HAHHAHAHAHA

[](#laughter)

And this is why he's Best Guy. 

Jesus Christ, pulling that shit is the epitome of JoJo's Bizarre Adventures for me. It's absolutely serious, ridiculous, intense and just so bizarre that's fantastic. Such a world treasure. 

> It's because of them that we still live.

I was laughing two seconds ago and now I'm almost crying. GODDAMMIT JOJO! 

Bye Pol! You were the real MC honestly and a great MC at that. 

[Sayonara](#poltears)

Awww I'm so glad Holly is safe

Wow what an epic ending....wait. Ending. That means its over. What do I even do now that there's no JoJo to watch? Oh wait...I'll see everyone tomorrow for PART 4: HYPE IS UNBREAKABLE! 

---
Overall thoughts: What can I even say after 72 days of watching JoJo every day? I started it out of curiosity for the praise, memes and manly poses but now I can honestly say that I finished a fantastic series with amazing characters and brilliant storytelling. It's truly an epic story passed down from generation to generation and each part has a unique tone that complements the time period and characters. So while I'm left with some big time post anime depression I'm here with another timeless anime completed another Best Guy to add to my favorite character list so really, I couldn't be happier! 

Thank you to everyone who participated in this rewatch and made it lively every day for the past 72 days! And of course, thank you /u/SmurfRockRune for doing a great job at hosting a fantastic rewatch! Your constant passion for JoJo is fantastic and it made the whole experience exciting. I hope to see everyone again tomorrow for Part 4!

Is eyes over heaven Canon? Where is it from?
>> ARTICLE
Did you respond to the wrong post? lol

I'm not sure if you're referring to Eyes of Heaven or Over Heaven, so I'll answer both.

Eyes of Heaven is a game that just came out in Japan and will be releasing in the West this summer. I don't believe the story is canon, because it's pretty ridiculous.

Over Heaven is a novel written by the author of the Monogatari series which follows DIO. I wanna say it's canon, but I'm 100% sure.

And I meant DIO heaven acension. Where is this from in the most non spoilerish way?

Today on [Pranking my Grandson in Egypt GONE WRONG! (STAND SUMMONED!!)](http://i.imgur.com/BT52wVV.png)  
Jotaro is being taunted by DIO who goes on to desecrate Joseph's lifeless body. As a result we have some quality time stop pummeling going on, including one of the most prevalent JoJo memes of all times. [ROAD ROLLER DA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtBb-OJF3Tk)!!!  
Okay, that one was a joke. But the road roller is getting referenced a lot and was the very first JoJo meme I've ever seen. Long before I knew JoJo was a thing. And before JoJo had the TV anime.  
For example: [The Wryy collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwAbN6D5-k) which is just a collection of much older memes.  
[The parody videos for this are endless, if you just know where to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNmCBEA3S04).  
Ahem. I don't know if you're noticing, but I'm a bit passionate about the Road Roller thing. It's what made me watch JoJo.  
Back to the rest of the episode. DIO explodes, we get a [literal Speed Wagon](http://i.imgur.com/MEVJHRb.jpg) and an unexpected revival. And speaking of the revival, Joseph's trolling aside, why the hell didn't he turn into a vampire like Vanilla Ice? Was his blood still so fresh in DIO that it had no vampire essence?  
We end this part with Polnareff and the Joestars going their separate ways. PolPol was only one episode focus off and he'd be tied with Jotaro, but no one can deny that he was the most important side character in Part 3.  
Holly recovered, lowering the RETIRED counter by one. During our 50 day trip, 31 Stand users have been sent to the hospital, forced into hiding or died.

I've started reading Part 4 last week, and I'm really, really excited to see it animated starting tomorrow. Especially [Part 4](/s "Bug Eater's sniper duel so far.")
>> ARTICLE
I should have read ahead. I watched the first video waiting for Dio to turn up, and it never happened. I'd never heard of Road Roller before today, but it's definitely going to be one of the things I remember about the show.

I think that the reason Joseph wasn't turned into a Vampire was that he had such sick jokes to be pulling on people. Beyond that I have no idea, Hamon maybe?
>> ARTICLE
Very sorry about that Road Roller video. I just stumbled on this while searching for 'ROAD ROLLER DA' myself and wondered wtf it's doing in my search results.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry Polnareff. You will always be the main character to us.
>> ARTICLE
>Joseph's trolling aside, why the hell didn't he turn into a vampire like Vanilla Ice?

Vanilla Ice didn't turn into a vampire when DIO gave him his blood and he came back to life the first time. He does the eye thing and grows fangs after Polnareff kills him by stabbing his brain stem. We'll have to see what happens if Joseph ever dies after this...
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that's what does it. Remember in Part 1 Dio didn't become a vampire until after the cops shot at him.
>> ARTICLE
What an amazing final episode. I think it's one of my favourite finales in anime. No trippy last episode, no shitty twists and I can't think of any glaring loose ends. It's a very old fashioned way to end it. Plus it works as an ending to part 3 and the 'DIO vs Joestar" arc. [Jojo's Bizarre Adventure manga spoilers](/s "That might be my biggest issue with part 6. It makes sense that DIO still had some followers, but this was such a great ending that it left a bad taste in my mouth.")

And before I get into my play-by-play reactions I want to show you guys something. On youtube there is this guy named [CoolTaff16](https://youtube.com/channel/UC1kZgMzWm4nLyPDJqZ8yRnQ) who makes a lot of Jojo fan videos. Real funny guy. He has made a few videos such as [Outside of Homura's World](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cFNfC26P0EY) and [Outside of DIO's World OVA](https://youtube.com/watch?v=g73ah54DpR0&itct=CBoQpDAYASITCKH5wKaB7MsCFdeMTgod468J6jIHcmVsYXRlZEjGoL_0tuHXqXA%3D) however the original was [Outside of DIO's WORLD](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tK77U7ACc8I&feature=iv&src_vid=cFNfC26P0EY&annotation_id=annotation_2991922133) which made the whole DIO fight like the first time DIO stopped time. I expect anyone who has watched Jojo to have seen this video and is *Cream*ing themselves trying to be the first to post it, so I hope I'm first (Smurf I swear to Christ if you post this video...)

On to the play-by-play. Great start, with DIO showing that he's not all there after 100 hundred years *down in the midnight sea* as well as being high of his tits on Joestar blood.

This has the side effect of killing Joseph. This is bad. I would like to say to everyone who said "there was no 'Joseph has died' message so he's still alive", you were right. Now Joseph is dead. Happy? For real though, dude lived a great life, had a loving wife, good relations with his daughter and grandson, killed a god and made a lot of great friends. And the last thing he does is give Jotaro advice to help him kill DIO.

Regardless of the tactical disadvantages of clawing your own brain out, it is very effective, extending his time stop to 11 seconds. At this point it is also blatently clear Jotaro is a machine, being Muda Muda-ed in the face before flying through a metal sign and then part of a building! After that display off super human durability, DIO starts the most memetic part of Jojo. DIO, who will live on in our very [souls](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/817/951/666.png). Forget "Kono Dio da!" forget "Your next line is" forget it all. With three simple words DIO made meme history!

ROAD ROLLER DA!!

It's really cool. I like it.

After that awesome moment, Jotaro sandbags the hell out of it by stopping time and breaking DIO's legs. Remember yesterday when I said

>even good stands can go turn to shit if the user is injured

That was a reference to this moment. DIO kicked with his bad leg and got blown the fuck up, while going out with a surprised"KONO DIO DA!"

After that we get a scene of Joseph and DIO's corpse. So Jotaro does the most logical thing, bring Joseph back to life with his blood that's in DIO. Why not, it's no weirder than baby Freddy Kruger or stealing souls. Joseph has a laugh and almost gets re-killed and then everyone is happy again (except for Kakyoin, Iggy and Avdol).

And we end on a touching scene of them in an airplane.... [wait a minute](http://i.imgur.com/x9ZLbkf.jpg)

Well here we are then, the last episode in Part 3, and the last episode of the rewatch. Its going to be a long comment.  
Unfortunately Im visiting my parents at the moment, so had to watch the last episode on a much smaller, older screen; and Im having to write this on an uncomfortable keyboard on a computer which sometimes lags behind my typing. Wonderful. What a great way to round it off.

Anyway, I really liked this episode. It was a really nice way to end the season. It wrapped up the story really well, and gave everyone a nice send off.  
The whole bit with JoJos soul giving a motivating lecture to JoJoJo was really nicely done. It managed to set the table for what was to come without feeling intrusive or out of place, and the message given was really fitting to Joseph. During Battle Tendency, JoJo had been incredibly hot headed, and it caused him a fair few issues. It makes sense that as an old man hed have learned his lesson and passed it on to his Grandson in his (not quite) last moments. I did however think it somewhat unfair that Fancy Guys soul didnt get to appear as smoke whilst going to the afterlife. Iggy and Dadvol got to do it when they died, and JoJo didnt even actually die and he still got to do it.

The fight of JoJoJo Brown vs. DiJos final form was satisfying. We got to see DiJo really beat the hell out of JoJoJo for a bit, and show *him* how it feels to get punch ghosted. Then he deployed Road Roller , which might well be one of the best finishers Ive seen. The only way I can think to improve it would be to replace the Road Roller with HoHos elephant; it would still be an effective finisher, but it would also wrap up the greatest mystery in the history of fictional media.  
Road Roller was a wonderful attack. I loved the way it was executed. JoJoJos there wondering where DiJo will come from and getting ready to unleash his counter attack, and then BAM! ROAD ROLLER! He got a Road Roller dropped on him (is that actually what theyre called? It seems wrong, but that might just be because Ive written it a bunch of times. I could check but I *really* dont want to). It was so unexpected, both by JoJoJo and the audience (well by me anyway, there was probably some guy out there who saw Road Roller coming a mile away), but was so fitting with the character of DiJo, and to top it off, was actually an effective strategy. 

Unfortunately for DiJo theres nothing that JoJoJo cant punch ghost his way out of, not even Road Roller. So he got away by the magic of Star Platinum, and then pulled off a really sound plan. The core of which being that he didnt take DiJo at his word.  
JoJoJo had no way of knowing what the new limit of DiJos time stop was. Sure DiJo had said that it was nine seconds, but hes *literally* Dio, so why would you trust him. He deployed his own time stop at nine seconds just in case DiJo was right, but then waited until DiJo stopped moving to reveal himself. It allowed him to exploit his own few seconds of time stop in a way which DiJo couldnt stop.  
On a side note, can you imagine those Time Stop bits if talking *wasnt* a free action in JBA? Imagine if they all actually lasted the amount of time they were supposed to. It would be madness. Im pretty certain the whole bit from DiJo freezing to time restarting was only supposed to take a second or two (JoJoJo can only stop time for about three seconds, he started at nine and DiJo stopped at eleven, so even if were generous and give him four that still only leaves two).  
So once again JoJoJo was able to overcome the ability of his foe, and turn it into a good old fashioned contest of Who has the best Stand?. A question which those silly Stand Charts answered in the first episode.

The resurrection of JoJo was simply wonderful. I genuinely thought for a moment that DiJo was returned, what with the purple blaze and all that. To go from dead to pulling a joke which might get you killed in so little time is something which few characters could reasonably pull off like that, but Josephs one of them. Think about what his thought process must have been: Oh hey, Im not dead any more. Oh look theres Dios body, I guess that Jotaro was actually able to beat him. Wait, why *am* I alive? Oh theyre pumping Dios blood into me. Hey, Ive got a great idea for a joke, Ill pretend that Im now possessed by Dio and use Hermit Purple to make it look like Im covered in Purple Flames. He managed to get through all of that in a matter of seconds, amazing. The whole scene was funny, a light hearted conclusion to the whole affair, and also addressed the really obvious problem with JoJoJos blood transfusion plan whilst also assuaging fears of it. 

Then we got all of our conclusions and happy endings:  

First off was Dio crumbling into dust in the suns light and blowing away to never return. Frankly I dont believe that for a second, he was brought back for this; and theres no way he wont be brought back again. Hell probably show up in JoJos Bizarre Advneutre Part 10: Overjoyed Swordsmanship, where JoJoJoJoJoJoJoJoJoJo and his friend Handsome-man-who-is-introduced-in-an-antagonistic-role-but-soon-becomes-a-fast-friend-of-the-main-character have to use the power of Happy Swords to stop Dio from stealing the internet. But first they have to overcome the challenge of HoHos Elephant.  

Then we got that nice little send off to all the dead protagonists. Im not going to lie, I got a bit emotional at that. It was a bit of a cliche to have them all pinned translucently to the sky, but cliches often become cliches because theyre effective.  

The Frenchman got to give his big farewell to the Jos. It was nice, and really rang of friendship. They had their friendly banter, but also a bit of a deep cut from Joseph when he mentioned how lonely hed be. It brings Kakyoins back story to mind, where he was the only one who could see Hierophant Green. Now that Dadvols dead JoJo wont have anyone else around who can see Stands with him, he wont have an adventuring buddy with him.  
It was a nice farewell scene, showing the guys to be happy now that Dios dead, happy to have had the journey, but sad for what they lost.  
What they lost did not include the bag which the Frenchmans been carrying with him the whole time. I liked that bag, it was a small consistent thing which added a nice bit of realness.  

Holly was cured of her Stand affliction (still not entirely sure how killing Dio actually saved her, but I assume theres something there) and the purpose of the journey was fulfilled. I thought it was an interesting choice to not show her reunion with the Jos, but I liked it. That scene worked just as well implied as it would have shown, probably better. Also by not showing it we didnt have to see the heartbreak in Hollys eyes when she realised that the Fancy Guy hadnt returned to her.  

Then there was that simple closing shot of the two Jos on the plane. It said all that it needed to and tied up the season really nicely.

I really liked Stardust Crusaders, it was a load of fun with some really great ideas, and was a really solid adventure to boot. We got to follow a cool group of Manly Superpowered Men on their globe trotting journey to save their mother/daughter/daughter of friend/love interest/person hed never met. We got to see them fight a great group of villains (and some not so great ones, but lets not look at them), and beat the big bad guy.  
As youve probably guessed theres a but on its way, and here it is. I really liked Stardust Crusaders, but its my least favourite part of JBA so far. I really liked it, but I really liked Phantom Blood a bit more, and I loved Battle Tendancy.  
There are a few reasons for this, one of which is the length of it. Stardust Crusaders is almost twice as long as the other two combined. It felt very slow at times, especially later on when there were a lot of two parters which I dont think warranted the second part.  
Perhaps as a result of that length it also lost a fair bit of focus. The bad guys were cool but they were monster of the week, and I missed really getting to know bad guys like we did with Battle Tendency. Also with five main characters it felt a lot more like they were taking turns.

These are issues I had with the show, but theyre not the main thing. My main problem with Stardust Crusaders was Star Platinum.  
In Phantom Blood, Jonathan was in way over his head. He was fighting a foe who was massively more powerful than him, and seemed to be able to counter him at every turn. Time and again he managed to overcome Dio due to his sheer tenacity and the fact that he never gave up. Ultimately sacrificing himself take Dio down with him. He had to fight his hardest for every victory, and really earned them.  
In Battle Tendency Joseph was more powerful than Jonathan, but the bad guys were a similar step up. The Pillar Men were an order of magnitude more powerful than him, but he used his ingenuity, his strategies, and his tricks, to turn things in his favour. He managed to overcome his disadvantage and really earned his victories over the bad guys (except when he won by luck as he did against Gary Numans Cars, but in that case he still used every trick in the book to help luck along).  
In the first episode of Stardust Crusaders Dadvol (the Stand expert) said Thats the most powerful Stand Ive ever seen, and the series listened. Jotaros best fight were the ones where he couldnt actually fight, but thats the only time Star Platinum wouldnt instant punch its way to a victory for him. He rarely had to earn anything, and instead coasted along on just having the best punch ghost. I know this isnt a problem for most people, but it made the show less interesting to me. 

That aside, I loved the series, and I loved the show as a whole. I had a lot of fun with this rewatch, and look forwards to Part 4.

I've always heard it called a steam roller because it puts down pavement using steam. Wikipedia says in can be both though.

A-Are politicians that are trying to make stupid rules for the internet actually Dio in disguise? /u/discdeath you may be on to something!

Her stand awoke because of Dio and began to overwhelm her. Perhaps when Dio died her stand began to calm down?

> He rarely had to earn anything, and instead coasted along on just having the best punch ghost. I know this isnt a problem for most people, but it made the show less interesting to me. 

Personally I love Star Platinum but I definitely understand getting a little fed up with such an op stand.

Rumour is that Part 4's adaptation will be 39 episodes. Since the manga is longer than Part 3, it'll be packing even more content into less time. And I'm really happy about that, because 48 episodes was far too much for Part 3. Imagine if the slowest 2-parters were one episode instead, or if things happened at roughly the same rate as Part 2. Even the slowest episodes would be much more gripping.

I'll be looking forward to your comments on Diamond Is Not Crash, they've been a wonderful reading experience.

I think it just comes down to what people want in a show. Jonathan was a character who I really liked (yes he was pretty bland, but blandness can be an interesting thing), whilst Jotaro didn't really interest me much.  
Also part one had [Robert E.O. Speedwagon](https://36.media.tumblr.com/210b4f50277637c156297a1a3e0c8faf/tumblr_n7i5atd9nI1qgrcpjo1_400.png) in it, and that counts for an awful lot.

Nope, DIO is completely dead.

I get your criticism of Star Platinum. I think you'll be relieved when you see Jotaro in Part 4, because he's older, and he's in a mentor role, which works really well for his character.

If you remember, I didn't link the music videos to Kakyoin's and Joseph's songs because they still contained spoilers. Well, we're done now, so here they are. ["OH MY GOD, JAHHH"](http://viewpure.com/yXz05mU9kmI?start=0&end=0) is still on youtube. Naked Silver and Goodbye Nostalgia aren't, unfortunately. So [here's that mega link again.](https://mega.nz/#F!uU9kyBAL!PTH0_JAw6l_VLrxrGWK7rQ!mU1FEbKC) Personally I found [Polnareff's](https://i.imgur.com/sT5a34u.png) and [Kakyoin's](https://i.imgur.com/osivhmY.png) videos to be the best ones so definitely check those two out.

THIS SHOW SUCKS!!I WASTED MY PRECIOUS TIME WATCHING THIS SHIT!

APRIL FOOLS!


First of all I want to thank Smurf for doing an amazing rewatch that was super long,74 episodes already holy crap!I hope we can continue with part 4 as well all together.I thank you from the bottom of my heart for introducing me to JoJo,my life is so much enriched with dank memes and funny lines.Now to talk about the episode and this season as well.I think part 3 overall was super fun,mostly because of Joseph and Polnareff who were comical relief,also badass and manly.I'd say it's almost as good as part 2 for me.The last fight was super great,Star platinum is a bit op,but nonetheless,i loved it.The only reason you lost was because you pissed me off,I'm gonna use that line whenever I can,it's super badass ! Is this the end of Dio forever? I dont know,he might be dead but not forgotten.As always ,see you on the next thread and may part 4 of JoJo be as good and even better than this one!

**YARE YARE DAZE...**
>> ARTICLE
> Is this the end of Dio forever?

It's the end of DIO, but we may see more of him in the future somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah JoJo is pretty much the best series ever.

So what now you may ask? Well obviously part 4 starts tommorow, so watch that obviously. Then seriously read the manga, it just gets crazier from here, and waiting for the anime to catchup will take forever.

Don't forget to check out the awesome JoJo AMV's/MAD's my personal favourites are the variations on the Voodoo kingdom AMV. 

Interesting fact about that song, as you may know there was a part 3 anime a long time ago, it's weird and not as close to the original as this is, but it's still at least a little good.  
They then decided to make one for phantom blood, and it was one of the worst things ever created. I mean they cut out Speedwagon for christs sake, it was so bad it's only been shown once, and all copies have been destroyed.

The one good thing to Cameron it was the song Voodoo Kingdom, by the band Soul'd out, who are huge JoJo fans, and one of their album covers was actually made by Araki. They are also referenced with a character name way off in the future.
>> ARTICLE
> They are also referenced with a character name way off in the future.

Two character names! [Part 7 Names](/s "Wekapipo and Magenta Magenta are both songs of theirs.")
>> ARTICLE
Last episode hype!!! And it was a good one.

DIO fucking creepy ass head scratching, this really disturbed me especially the fucking sound effects

DIO counting seconds to make Jotaro think he was using the time he could move within the time stop to block the rest of DIO's time was great.

DIO plz stop, DIO plz I can't stand this.

roado rolla da fucking brilliant, how is DIO so great

Jotaro stopping time hype. I guess the flying and super energy stuff went away for the first part of this episode so they could come back at this point

DIO's one singular thought: Memes

the music when The worlds leg starts to break is perfect.

Jotaro so cool

Killing DIO would be quicker if Joseph was still alive.

I'm tired of hearing Muda too Jotaro

Ok so Jotaro brings back Joseph and then they still wait for the sun rise instead of just using hamon? I guess everyone just forgot about it.

I was expecting an ending more like part 2 with everyone still alive meeting up, or at least Jotaro and Joseph seeing Holly again before it ended, but this ending was good too.

Hyped for part 4 tomorrow. It took a bit in this part for the battles to get really good and they just kept getting better, so hopefully the battles start better then the early part 3 ones and keep up the trend.
>> ARTICLE
Early Part 3 is basically set-up for every other Part as the Stands just get crazier and hyper from here.
>> ARTICLE
When I first watched this, I was in disbelief and had to Google whether Dio was actually dead. Save yourself the spoilers - he's dead. 
>> ARTICLE
[Part 7 Spoilers](/s "Though being actually dead and not coming back doesn't stop him from appearing to fight the Joestars once again...")
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't Dio, [Part 7 Spoilers](/s "that was an alternate universe version of Diego. I mean, you could say that means he's DIO but the Jojo wiki thinks he is a separate character")

DIO is definitely dead. I mean, he exploded and they put what remained in sunlight.

Yes, I'll leave it at that. Pretty massive plot twist.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I've looked at it like a week ago when I was checking out who's who and I'm pretty sure I know who you're talking about. I didn't think anything of it at the time but I can see how that would shake stuff up. 

Does it come up early in the part or is it some big crazy ass reveal towards the end that I'm now imagining?
>> ARTICLE
Do you wanna tell me exactly who you're talking about? I don't wanna say stuff about one character, and have you talking about someone entirely different lol.
>> ARTICLE
Who/What I think I'm talking about: [Part 5](/s "Giorno Giovanna is the son of DIO") 

>> ARTICLE
It's not a really big spoiler, you find out two chapters into Vento Aureo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what I thought you were talking about.

It's revealed really early on in 5. We'll probably see it in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for clarifying. That's how I assumed it was going to be like but this thread made me question if it actually was something super spoilery.
>> ARTICLE
I thought I had spoiled a huge twist for myself when I first read it. But then I read the actual manga and learned otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
Yep :/
>> ARTICLE
I got spoiled by YouTube comments and the wiki too lol. Oh well, just makes me more hype for that part.
>> ARTICLE
I have to work tomorrow night so I won't get to experience duwang until like 11:30!

[](#WRYYY)

I didn't take part in this rewatch but I did come in the threads to see everyone's reactions and they were all pretty great. I finished reading Part 4 about 2 weeks ago so I'm extremely hyped. 
>> ARTICLE
Star Platinum's stand ability is actually to drop really cool one-liners.

Damnit Joseph, you're too old to be doing this pranking shit.  

At last, Dio is dead. Not just DIO, the stand user, or Dio, the immortal vampire, but Dio Brando, the invader.

After (re)watching this, I finally understand why people said that Polnareff was the MC. I know most were kidding, but he genuinely felt like one. Thanks for doing this, Smurf.  Now onto my favourite part!
>> ARTICLE
> After (re)watching this, I finally understand why people said that Polnareff was the MC. I know most were kidding, but he genuinely felt like one.

He takes on so many stand users on his own! I don't recall if the guy doing the chart with what character was the episode focus has Polnareff having more episodes than Jotaro or not.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's a weird thing to note, but the sound effects for this episode--and really, the entire series--were just amazing. Like the scene where Jotaro crashes into the ground just sounds *lovely.* Based David has based audio.

So, there is one question I have concerning this ending, and it relates to something that happens later on.

[Part 5 Spoilers](/s "So... Joseph, when brought back to life, is fully 'alive.' However, when Bruno is brought back, he's basically 'undead,' despite having been dead for even less time than Joseph. I'm kind of struggling to think of a reason this might be. Is it that Dio's consumption of Joseph's blood meant that the big guy wasn't technically 'dead,' so much as contained within Dio's body--which already sounds like bullshit just typing it--or does it maybe have to do with the fact that Bruno was specifically fated to die, but Giorno kept him alive past that?")

[Part 5 Spoilers](/s "I mean, it's entirely likely it was just an oversight on Araki's part and we can just chalk this all up to Joestar's being Joestars, but I'd prefer to have a nice Watsonian explanation for it. I also imagine the particulars around why Bruno was 'undead' would be easier to grasp if the translations for that explanation weren't such crap.")

>> ARTICLE
[Part 5](/s "The canon reason why Bruno was undead is, as you said, because he was fated to die after he escaped from Rolling Stones. Giorno's power brought him back even though he was fated to have died there painfully, so his body started dying while his soul continued to inhabit it.")

I suppose it ties into Araki's greater ideas about fate. Joseph was physically dead in this episode, but nothing said that he was 100% dead when he got into the Speedwagon Speed Wagon, or that he was fated to die at DIO's hand there. So Jotaro's idea was able to work.
>> ARTICLE
[Part 5 Manga](/s "The second one is my bet. Joseph was brought back semi-realistically with a blood transfusion whereas Bruno was fated to die and was brought back from that.")
>> ARTICLE
The steamroller was beautiful.

Joseph lives?! [NIIIIICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffQmb-cNFuk)

Jotaro is on the plane with Joseph. RIP?

Gentlemen, it has been an honor to go on this Bizarre Adventure with you all. See you guys in Part 4!
>> ARTICLE
> Jotaro is on the plane with Joseph. RIP?

There's a funny comic that takes place here where Kars comes crashing back down and smashes into the plane that they're on.

[Found it.](http://i.imgur.com/x9ZLbkf.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
[SFX OP, with additional effects and more additions.
](https://my.mixtape.moe/safvyv.webm)

DIO's pretty nuts, but maybe imbibing Joseph's blood isn't a great thing for your sanity either.

Apart from DIO's weak side, it's notable that Jotaro's final blow killed DIO because he countered with The World. If he'd blocked with his own leg, Star Platinum would have smashed his leg off and he could have counterattacked Jotaro with The World. Since The World is hard and not squishy like flesh, its entire body cracked instead and the mirrored damage ran up into DIO's brain. DIO was going to lose anyways by the end, but the fact that a property of the Stand he relied so heavily on is what killed him in the end is just fantastic to me.

Kakyoin turned Hierophant invisible to get the secret of DIO's Stand. Joseph turned Hermit Purple invisible to fuck with his grandson and some paramedics. Bless his restarted old man heart. I'll always imagine that he was blasting classic Weird Al when he was the one driving. 

I'm glad we could do this rewatch with so many regular posters week after week. It really was fun. I believe that from the bottom of my heart! It's fitting that this journey of a rewatch ends with an episode about ending journeys.

[One last thing for you Holly/Kakyoin shippers.](http://i.imgur.com/UuRe5hI.png)

Holly thinks Iggy is a cute dog. Holly confirmed to actually be blind. Apparently in this comic though she was only unwell for 15 days instead of 50.

Here's a [count down](http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page
) for anyone wondering when part 4 airs. (give it a sec to load)

I was gonna wait till Jojolion was finished to binge part 8 all at once but with the rewatch I broke. Seems like they weren't really to sure if they were gonna animate part 4 because of the lack of a Josuke tease at the end, glad the series is doing well enough now to warrant more adaptations. How would you guys rank this part among the others for me personally its 7>8>6>4>2>3>5>1.

i'm saving part 6 for anime only and plan on binge part 8 so currently

4>7>2>5>1>3

(8) > 7 > 5 > 6 > 4 > 2 > 3 > 1

JoJolion is so good right now it might end up as my favorite part if it ends in a good note. But there is still enough time for everything to go downhill.

And the JoJos:

Gappy > Jolyne > Joseph > Johnny > Josuke > Giorno > Jotaro > Jonathan

I started watching jojo when you guys were just starting s2 of stardust crusaders, so i caught up and finished it last night. The final 6 or so episodes were so goddamn hype, easily the best in the series imo. 

Now, my question is, do future jojo parts have as much hype as those last 6 eps against vanilla ice and dio? Because it'll seriously be hard for another part to overtake it.

Imo part 3 > 2 > 1. Although part 3 and 2 are really close, the ending few eps of part 3 was just way too hype. Can't wait for part 4!

Seriously, ZA WARUDO and it's time-stopping sound effect is just the best thing i've ever heard.

I remember when I started to watch JoJo, I was on Mother's Basement channel, watching the [One Punch Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syXo_JeSzuE) video, when I saw  the [JoJo part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55MMEXVnPBo), and I thought "this series looks nice, I'll give it a try". Now I'm reading part 8 and already bought 3 JoJo action figures. So, thanks /u/G-0ff for that.

I'd like to recommend [MrDonutTheDonut's JoJo AMVs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI677iDDfXz-qZULbgqiEcJ7UzXwc0mAs), they are all amazing, specially my favorite, Joseph's [Oh My God, Jaaaah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXz05mU9kmI). Also, Joseph proved once again that he is the best JoJo, pulling an [Ethan Bradberry](http://i.imgur.com/cJyfbsd.png) on Jotaro.

And I'm really impressed on how well SC aged. We have to remember that this is an series made from 1989 to 1992, and even so a lot of stuff here is better than a lot of animes coming out today, so props to our [favorite immortal vampire mangaka](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--aYOXkagp--/17rrkmniqi4xgjpg.jpg). 

Overall, part 3 isn't my favorite (my ranking is 4-6-7-8-2-5-3-1) but I rated it 8/10 on MAL so if you are a anime-only you can expect even better things from JoJo from now on. So, all aboard our last train home to the town of ~~Morioh~~ Duwang
>> ARTICLE
8 is near surpassing 4 for me. it's just so goddamn good recently [Part 8](/s "damo is a beast")

> favorite immortal vampire mangaka.

He really isn't aging. It's crazy. For real though I wonder if Araki uses some kind of skin product? Probably does his best to eat healthy and get a lot of sleep as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say is the same thing that happens with Smash Brother's [Sakurai](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/806/790/7c1.jpg): asian, takes care of himself and old pictures are really bad.

Of course that is what they want us to believe, they are actually masters of hamon. But I'm ok with them being immortals, that means we get JoJo and SSB for the rest of our lives.

Fun fact: Sakurai is a big JoJo fan, and Wii Fit Trainer is basically a hamon fighter with his/her sun powers and breathing. My mind was blown when I found this out.
>> ARTICLE
... That makes so much sense now.
>> ARTICLE
Sure Sakurai looks older at 23 than he does at 29. Must've become a vampire somewhere in between those years!

Yeah Smash has a number of Jojo references. While trailers were coming out for Smash 4 [Zelda became Kars](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/922/134/943.png)

WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

welcome to the jojo's hype train new viewers!

i cant wait to see what part 4 has to offer
>> ARTICLE
Here we are. The grand finale! This episode is the pinnacle of hype and I still watch the roadroller scene at least once a week. As an aspiring voice actor, I can't get over how great the voice acting performance in that scene and the series overall. Takehito Koyasu just *kills it* as DIO, I can almost feel how much he enjoys doing it.

And as I promised, I'd like to summon u/discdeath and u/NoPenNameGirl to discuss the The World theory. So here it goes. I believe that The World's real power is to copy the stands of Joestars. Like, **all of them**. But at that point, obviously there's only 3 Joestars with stands. I think the time stop power actually belongs to Jotaro. Dio has it because of his Joestar-copying power. Since Dio was taught by Enya about the stands, he immediately began studying his own power and discovering what his Stand could do and he probably -in his arrogance- thought the time power belonged solely to himself. Meanwhile Jotaro initially thought himself to be possessed by an evil spirit. So it took an impending death and a fucking roadroller dropping on him to discover his own power.

I think the scene where we see Dio using Hermit Purple was (although retconned to be Jonathan's stand for some reason) quite obvious, but here's my real point. The flesh buds Dio used to convert people to his cause (as in Kakyoin and Bronareff), is actually Holly's stand power. It's the power of mind control through flesh buds.

I'm currently reading early Part 5, so these stuff might already been explained in the later parts. So there's that.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry I'm 11 hours late, but these threads go up at night in England, so I've been asleep.

Anyway, I'm with you 100% on the copy thing. It just explains everything so well, and Dio's arrogance is a perfect reason for why he wouldn't realise he was copying others. I also really like the idea that the Flesh Buds are Holly's Stands power, it fits in really well with the appearance of her Stand, and gives the Flesh Buds a bit more substance than: "He's a Vampire, he can do Vampire things."

I've said this before, but I think the similarities between Dio's Stand and other Stands are simply too great for him to not be copying them.
>> ARTICLE
>But at that point, obviously there's only 3 Joestars with stands

[Spoiler] (/s "Actually there is 5. Jotaro, Joseph, Holly, Josuke, who has 4 years only, and Giorno, still on his Mother's womb. There is several points in time that look like he has Josuke and Giorno Stand powers as well. So the theory is really nice to explain why DIO is able to do some stuff.")


>> ARTICLE
Don't forget that The World also has [Parts 4 and 5](/s "Crazy Diamond's appearance and Gold Experience's color scheme. Josuke and Giorno were both alive already when DIO got his stand.")
>> ARTICLE
It's crazy that i've seen this road roller part of this episode waaaaaaaay before i ever decided to watch jojo's. It was while looking up WRYYYY videos haha.

The watch was awesome, and im glad i didn't skip a single time. I even waited for yall to catch up to Stardust to watch it together! This was my longest watch thread on this subreddit so far and the most successful (if maybe the only one) that i've watched personally. There were a lot of great posters like the music reference person and the 'Ora'/'Stand' counter person. But most of all thanks to you /u/SmurfRockRune for hosting this and I can't wait to see you in the Hype is Unbreakable threads haha
>> ARTICLE
Gentlemen (and Ladies), it's been an honor.

Dio, if you have a headache, I can just get you an aspirin. Or do you have head lice? Zombie head lice? *Vampire* head lice?

You keep talking like the fight has already been won, and that is why you fail, Dio. In spite of everything you make the same mistakes as any Shonen regular goon.

OH SHIT IT'S THE SPIRIT SMOKE. OH DAMN IT ALL.

>Don't worry about me anymore.

;_;

Beat his ass, Jotaro!

There's the SFX I was looking for!

Hooray! A decent Wrryyy!

Bad to underestimate JoJo Dio, and that hit was supposed to be on your strong side as well.

Luckily for JoJo Dio can't help but brag and waste all of his time advantage. Really, Dio is going to lose because of his hubris, and if I remember Dante's inferno correctly the greatest punishments are reserved for those whose sin is Pride.

Dude, that rush from the World was brutal. And it bought Dio enough time to recharge! That's just busted. 

>One second has passed...Two seconds have passed...Three seconds have passed...
 
Wait... is this...

> Four seconds have passed...Five seconds have passed...

Oh my god, it *IS*!

>Six seconds have passed....

Here we go! I am so ready, I am so READY!!!

>Seven seconds have passed...

*ding*

[ROADA ROLLA DA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIaqZh_gGz4)

UUUUUUUWWWWWAAAAAAAGGGHHHH.

*Post-Orgasm inhale*

Unfortunately my favorite version of this scene has been removed from Youtube, but dear god, this has to be my favorite scene just for the sheer ridiculousness of what is happening. Really, if I were to describe anime, I would pull a [Wataru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVoz-uJsxTY), except sub out the word "drifting" for "anime" and Takumi's drifting for the Road Rolla Da.

OK, tangent over, back to JoJo.

Damn, the World looks so smug during this Dio rant.

This does not look good, it looks like the end.

Oh! Dio's frozen?! JOJO!!!

I believe Dio this is known as "the hunter becoming the hunted".

Jotaro, get on with it! Don't make the same mistakes Dio made!

Oooh, that sounded like it hurt. And now it looks like it hut.

Yes, go for overkill!!!

I think JoJo has gotten this far BECAUSE he's human. Unlike Dio, Jotaro has the ability to change.

>Be victorious and rule!

So, as usual, what happens when you have no one else left to rule and no one else to fight and be victorious over, Dio?

ORRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

...

^No...

...

**YES!!!** 

This part needs more So No Chi No Sadame.

>There is just one simple answer: You really pissed me off.

*Shivers...*

Dio... The World... Utterly Defeated.... Dead.... Yay!

Can't JoJo just use Star Platinum to circulate the blood by controlling Dio's heart? Like he did his own?

>We did a lot of impossible things on this journey

That's an understatement.

We mad science now!

Oh here we go again!!!

Not. Funny. Joseph.

So long Dio, you were a great villain, but good riddance.

Kakyoin...Iggy...Avdol.... goodbye...

Bye Pol Pol... we'll meet again soon I hope...

Holly's alright! It's been all worth it!

Man, what a trip. This show has had me root for Nazis (and I hate Nazis), awaken my masters, run like hell, pose, scream, and who knows what else. I really can't even begin to say how much I have enjoyed this with you guys. We'll see each other soon in Part 4, I'm sure. Kudos to everyone. This is /u/A_Hint_of_Lemon, signing off.

Last episode hype! Sfx op hype!

One of my favorite scenes is where Dio scratches his head apart to test the new speed at which he heals. He's so crazy.

Oh shit Joseph's ghost! Having his blood drained by Dio is what finally killed him. Rip Joseph.

"These fifty days really were fun."

My feels. You know for such a show titled "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" there's a lot of feels. Look how many people/dogs have died from Part 1 till now. Araki wants everyone to cry.

Sfx op time! You see The World's fists punch away some credits before Jotaro brings out Star Platinum.

Each time the op shows the foreshadowing for each Crusader's death The World's silhouette is there now as well for Kakyoin and Joseph.

"Wryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!"

"I feel so good, I could break out into song!"

I'd actually really love to hear some songs done by Dio's actor.

"Road roller da!"

What's this? Dio can't move! I wonder why?

"I stopped time at the nine second mark." That's fuckin why! Since Star Platinum and The World were revealed to be similar stands it makes sense that Star Platinum can stop time too!

Blood in the eyes! Cheaty Dio! But Jotaro punches The World in the leg and wrecks him which wrecks Dio as well. He's out of commission for now. I don't really get why Dio's body catches fire like that though.

"Dio...The World - Utterly defeated...dead."

Jotaro plans to get blood from Dio and put it in Joseph, giving back his Joestar blood. The doctors say it won't work since Joseph's heart has stopped but Jotaro's had enough of this shit.

They start on it with the help of Star Platinum and Joseph's body begins to look clearer.

He opens his eyes! Joseph is alive!

Wait something's wrong. Holy shiiiiit! With Dio's blood in Joseph's body, Dio lives again! Ah never mind Joseph's just trolling. Best Jojo and worst grandfather ever. Trolling his grandson who just only managed to kill a terrible evil.

"Aru Yankoviku!"

They place Dio's body in the sunlight and it disintegrates. Dio is truly dead.

Kakyoin, Iggy and Avdol. Three amazing bros. They will never be forgotten.

Polnareff lives though! The main character didn't die! He leaves to go back to france. It would've been cool if he had gone to New York with Joseph though.

"It'll be lonely without you."

I'm not crying you're crying! Waaaaaah! They hug because they're all massive bros. The part where they turn away from each other and begin to walk in different directions is really sad.

And without Dio's influence Holly begins to rapidly recover! Kakyoin the milf hunter would be so happy.

Jotaro is holing the photo they took in egypt, reminding us of the friendship the six crusaders have. 

And that's how it ends, with Jotaro and Joseph heading back to japan on a plane. But the Jojo action doesn't stop here guys! Part 4 starts tomorrow!

To all new Jojo fans:  
Welcome to our WARUDO!

Part 4 hype, it's happening tomorrow..

OH SHIT IT'S THE FUCKING ROAD ROLLER!

Such a hype fight. Jotaro is such a badass.

Now I am hyped for Duwang tomorrow.

You know, I didn't like this OP that much originally but now at the end with all of the SFX effects and knowing the story made it amazing. 

Part 4's has a lot to live up to and I can hardly wait.

Applause the new Jojo fans for completing fundamental of Jojo's bizarre adventure, You've now grasp how this series works.

Truth is, the bizarreness actually starts from here and intensifies, same goes with its goriness. HYPE for tomorrow, DUWANG is unbearable!

I'm so hype for Diamond is Unbreakable that I've somehow found myself here

It's kinda funny that by the end of the series, Vanilla Ice has technically done a better job than Dio has - a higher kill count (although this depends on how you count Joseph and Vanilla's suicide for Dio) and plus, he trashed Dio's mansion.

(I kinda wish there was more on Holly, though...I mean, she WAS the reason this all started. It doesn't seem like she'll be in Diamond is Unbreakable either...shame, I would have loved to know about what her stand is.)

And now, time to punch some spaghetti.
>> ARTICLE
> shame, I would have loved to know about what her stand is

It can't be revealed. It's too powerful. Even Dio would've been afraid.
>> ARTICLE
> It's kinda funny that by the end of the series, Vanilla Ice has technically done a better job than Dio has - a higher kill count

It's funny, because we cover this in the podcast I'll be putting up very, very soon.

We realized it was DIO because Vanilla Ice has 2 (Avdol and Iggy) while DIO has 3 (Jonathan, Kakyoin, and Joseph).
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn, I forgot Jonathan. Dio probably killed way more bystanders in the process anyway, now that I think of it.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, that was a pretty good rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
I thought so too.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry I'm late. Very, very, very, very late.

I've been on holiday so I haven't had the time to watch any JoJo. I'll probably won't see another episode until the day after tomorrow. So I'll miss out on seeing JoJo Part 4 Ep 1 the day that comes out too.

But still, I want to give all my thanks to /u/SmurfRockRune for setting up this rewatch. This was actually my first time seeing any JoJo. I only first saw part 1 back in December. I was on and off with it a bit until this rewatch rolls around and I finally have a reason to start again. Part 1 was good. Part 2 was amazing. Part 3 is amazing. Part 4 will probably also be amazing. 

I'm so hype for everything and I can't wait to flip my shit when I see part 4.

Once again, thanks to /u/SmurfRockRune for this rewatch, it was fun while it lasted.

ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA, I'm out.

reposting this easter egg from episode 5, aka the world's most hardcore Jotaro stalkers:

Ah, I shed manly tears when Jotaro said his farewells to Avdol, Iggy and Kakyoin. Also when they said goodbye to Polnareff at the airport.

Although I was sad seeing half of the team gone, I've never been more satisfied with an anime's arc ending. So many "ohfuk" moments, especially with Joseph, luckily he came back though.

Honestly think this is my favorite arc so far, especially the fact that there's so many characters that I really cared for and not just the main guy. Now I'm super hyped for part 4. Never read the manga but I hope it has a great, enjoyable team like in part 3.

DIO's VA became my favorite male VA with that road roller.

I finally decided to watch JoJo because I wanted to know what it is all about.

Give me more OraOraOraOraOra!

I have to say it was very fun to have this rewatch, the hype for tomorrow truly is unbreakable.

Well, here it is, the end of the journey. It was fun, wasn't it? From my heart, I truly believe it was fun. 

Jotaro shows us one last time how he is a good boy, a great boy. He loves his grandpappy, he saves his mom, and he's a wonderful and caring friend! Now he can finally get back to school! I bet Holly is going to miss Kakyoin and Avdol
>> ARTICLE
Yay, I actually managed to catch up \o/

At least in time for part 4.

Started about 4 weeks ago and couldn't just go to bed yesterday when they finally confronted Dio. Was well worth losing some sleep.

My quick thoughts:

Best JoJo: Joseph (Young and Old)

Best Stand: Mariah's Bastet, the magnetism episodes were hilarious.

Best Family: The Zeppeli's

Best Crusader: Polnareff

Best Pillar: Wamuu

Best Animal: Iggy turned out to be cool, but Pet Shop was an absolute madman.

Best Villain: [](#konodioda)

Favorite Part: Battle Tendency (2 > 3 > 1). Stardust Crusader's felt a little slow and I didn't enjoy it as much as Part 2, the cast and their antics were nice though.

Looking forward to see what happens in Part 4.

Feels good to finally be back home. I took a (Last) Train Home, and I've learned how much I like travelling by train. Comfy seats, free WiFi, outlets in the seats to charge your stuff, it's pretty great.

Anyway, enough about trains, let's get into this episode. Once again, I'm the worst with transitions (as you'll see in the JoJo Podcast we're releasing this Thursday that I'm announcing right now), so I'm just gonna use bullet points here.

- Did you notice that [Young Kakyoin had cherries on his shirt?](http://i.imgur.com/rSbTOXt.jpg)

- [Kakyoin finally hit something with Emerald Splash!](http://i.imgur.com/gj3ALER.jpg) [](#manly-tears "Too bad he'll never be able to celebrate it.")

- This episode brings my favorite JoJo song, [Noble Pope.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjg3Ib-y54) I've also seen it called Virtuous Pope, so I'm not sure which is correct. Regardless, I always think back to the 20m Radius Emerald Splash when I listen to it, and I get filled with both hype and sadness at the same time.

- This episode also led me to [the best porn video I've ever seen.](http://i.imgur.com/rC1KTWb.png) It's SFW, so feel free to click on that, but you might need a tissue ~~(   )~~

- [(Spoilers in Comments) Here's a video comparing ZA WARUDO with the old OVA version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIcmM9-56HU) They sound very different, but I love the tone at the end of the OVA version.

- I've seen some people wondering. If DIO is a vampire, does that mean his Stand is a vampire as well? Well, luckily, [Billy Corgan is here with the answer to that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=918te_rMS88&feature=youtu.be&t=4)

- You may have noticed (I didn't) a similarity between Kakyoin's death and Caesar's death. [Look at Joseph's reactions side by side.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/974/146/250.gif)

Apart from 20m Radius Emerald Splash, Virtuous/Noble Pope always makes me think of Polnareff/Kakyoin against Hanged Man.
>> ARTICLE
Good god... Being Joseph is suffering...
>> ARTICLE
Noble Pope is giving me too many emotions right now. At this rate I'm going to spend the weekend wrapped in a blanket, stuffing myself with ice cream, and crying whilst I listen to the themes of all the dead characters.

I didn't really notice the similarities between the two deaths until now. But there are certainly quite a few links there, Joseph's consistency in grief being only one of them. I suppose Fancy Guy was pretty much the Caesar analogue of this Part.

I prefer the current Time Stop. Especially the sound effect. I'm also fond of the All Star Battle chime, but it's less intimidating.

Ignoring how weird that sounds, yes. I have no clue who came up with the idea but good on them. My only gripe is that I wish that the music cut out when time stopped, at least for the first one. Especially since it was in the middle of a triumphant song.

Awww Kakyoin's background. He finally became friends with people who understood him! 

Dio going super saiyan.

KAKYOIN TRAPPED HIM! THIS IS EPIC! 

(I have a bad feeling Kakyoin is the sacrificial lamb to take down Dio.)

JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS FAST! WHAT THE FUCK?! HOW DID HE GET HIM SO FAST!

# NO KAKYOIN NO! SO NOT FAIR! HOW DARE THEY KILL BEST GUY ^^^of ^^^Part ^^^3!

Ugh fuck you Dio. Seriously fuck you! 

This is so depresing watching the barrier fade while Kakyoin's life fades ;_; ugh I'm so sad.

STOP POSING IN MIDAI WHILE THREATENING BEST GUY DIO!I hate you Dio! 

KAKYOIN FIGURING OUT HIS STAND WHILE DYING HE'S SO  SMART!

> I'll take that body back for my grandmother Erina.

> Oh right that random girl I NTR'd from your grandfather? Lame.

Ok I might have added the second part but you know Dio was thinking it...

KAKYOIN WILLING HIMSELF TO DESTROY THE CLOCK TO SEND A MESSAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BEST GUYS DO! 

> Noriaki Kakyoin has died.

I have to confess that I had Kakyoin's deadth spoiled for me a few weeks ago on a different subreddit. I didn't know *when* it would happen but I knew this would happen at some point. I was always on edge wondering if each upcoming battle would be his last and now it's actually here. He lasted so long while using his genius tactics to overcome tough enemies to save his friends time and time again. Even though I knew you were going to die Kakyoin, you're still the Best Guy of Part 3 for me and you will be missed more than any other JoJo character.

[RIP Best Guy](#not-raining)

Ugh when the hamon attack doesn't work!!

[](#WRYYY)

Ok but really how is Dio flying around right now? Fuck this shit. 

DIO CAN STOP TIME?! THIS IS NOT THE CHOICE OF STEINS;GATE!

Watching Dio kill Kakyoin with time stopped hurts me more the second time around. 

Why didn't Dio kill Joseph while time was stopped though? Weird. 

But **really** how is Dio flying?

Wrapping his body with Hamon because no one fucks with Joseph! Get fucked Dio!

# KAKYOIN DIED FOR OUR SINS! PRAISE BE TO HIM!

# NO DON'T KILL BEST GUY TOO!! 

(Rip cat because no dog was around?)

NO THE MUDAS!

NO DON'T DIE JOSEPH! 

# ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! PART 3 BEST GUY AND BEST JOJO DYING ALL IN THE SAME EPISODE?! I CAN NOT HANG!

> I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.

Spoken like a true badass. 

Too much coolness in one scene.

Now lets also take notice, if DIO had just avoided all of the tentacles in his timestop, Kakyoin would have had no clue what DIO's stand did, or he would have thought it was teleportation. But because he is a cocky son of a bitch, he cut all of the threads, and revealed his ability.

Yup! Thought the same thing :p
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I got to really like Kakyoin so it makes me more upset they decided to write him out of a good chunk of the season :(

Yeah I really wish they would've brought him back sooner! It felt like they could only focus on 4 of the group across the two seasons so they had to put Advol on hiatus and then once they brought him back they put Kakyoin on hiatus. If he was there the whole time I definitely would've felt even more upset :(
>> ARTICLE
> > Why didn't Dio kill Joseph while time was stopped though? Weird.

>Yup! Thought the same thing :p

DIO didn't have time there, it's just that talking is a free action, which can make it seem like he had more time to act than he did.
>> ARTICLE
Well implying his cooldown between is 5 seconds he could have used it right after :p
>> ARTICLE
The reason was because Joseph covered himself in hamon. DIO knows (somehow) that Joseph can use hamon so I assume he didn't want to take any chances.
>> ARTICLE
Freeze time and cut off his neck then go back? Wouldn't that work?
>> ARTICLE
I've got nothing. Best I can say is that due to hamon being pure energy it might be able to move in stopped time.
>> ARTICLE
Things that are touched in stopped time can move a little (otherwise DIO'd be unable to actually damage anything or throw his knives.) I've always figured that if he touched stopped Hamon, it'd flow again.
>> ARTICLE
Good enough! :p
>> ARTICLE
Well, Dio is arrogant too. Remember this is the guy that stopped time to physically pick up and move Polnareff down a couple steps, then walked back to where he was. And he did that multiple times.

Dio wants to win, but in the process I think he also really wants them to realize how superior he is.

Now that we all know The World has the power to stop time, I'd just like for everyone to briefly think back on how we saw him use it before for a moment.

We first saw him use it against Hol Horse. I've read people suspect he crawled under the chair to get behind Hol Horse while not disturbing the spiderwebs.

Next comes Polnareff and the stairs. Dio stopped time, walked down the stairs, physically moved Polnareff and walked back. Then repeated that 2-3 times. Just to fuck with him a little.

He also stopped time when exiting the coffin, but instead of attacking them he put Nimrod in and cut him up, because priorities. I'm pretty sure Dio could have won already if he weren't so arrogant.

Hey, DIO, don't you dare say anything about Erina!

Anyway, I really like The World power reveal scene on the Anime, along with the 20m Emerald Splash (which is, in the fighting games, Kakyoin's most powerful Super Move), probably among my top 10 coolest Jojo momments. I already knew due the memes that DIO could stop time, but that momment was still powerful to me. In the manga, the revelation happens at the same time, not after Joseph realize Kakyoin's message. I think David Productions did a good job in this aspect, to hold the revelation to after Joseph made the connection, so he finds out about DIO's power along with the viewers.

Well, rest in peace, Kakyoin. If wasn't for your sacrifice, we won't be able to discover DIO's true powers. While Kakyoin isn't my favorite character, and I agree that he is somewhat underpresented in the series, I still really like him. This episode give him a lot of backstory, and is saddly it was the episode he died, but better later than ever. Be at rest, cherry boy.

Poor Joseph, once again he saw one of his friends get killed in front of him. Joseph was smart by coating himself with Hamon, but The World is too OP.

Anyway, Joseph =(...

Well guys, I will ask you all one thing: DIO says he can stop time for 5 seconds, but the time stop scenes goes beyond that. So remember, ALWAYS, that the Time Stops work under [Frieza Time logic](http://i.imgur.com/6rT0Ao3.jpg):

So bear in mind that when DIO stops time from now on, okay? ^^v
>> ARTICLE
> Joseph was smart by coating himself with Hamon, but The World is too OP.

Let's just have a moment of respect for that move; because Joseph came *this* close to blowing off an arm. At *least.* Old boy has still got it.

>> ARTICLE
> Hey, DIO, don't you dare say anything about Erina!

72 episodes ago, Erina was a little girl that Jonathan defended in an attempt to become a gentleman. Over 100 years later, her grandson is a grandfather himself, vowing to take back Jonathan's corpse in her memory from the immortal DIO. We've come so very fair in this rewatch.

Episode starts out pretty menacingly with the car wreck. Go Kakyoin! Let's figure this shit out!

I don't think there have been any hints at Kakyoin's backstory so far (except perhaps him refusing to answer how many hours he's sunk into that racing game). It's sad - not only because he's alone but also because it's so relate-able. How _could_ he make any friends with Hierophant around, invisible to everybody else? Until he met DIO (and through him the Joestars), Hierophant was his closest and only friend, and Hierophant doesn't even speak. No wonder he was ready to go on a horrifying journey with three men he had only known for about a day - he knew that this was his only chance at making friends that could truly understand him. These past 50 days have been the highlight of Kakyoin's life. There was sadness and loss, hardship and pain. But there was also joy and laughter. Kakyoin almost lost his eyes along the way, but it was worth it all.

Beware, DIO! At this, the pinnacle of his life, the great Noriaki Kakyoin [has lured you into his trap!](https://i.imgur.com/hlqMPEh.png) [There is no escape from Hierophant Green](https://i.imgur.com/luleA3Q.png), not until [his best friend has figured out the secret to your powers!](https://i.imgur.com/mH5h8ND.png) It's useless, DIO!

Kakyoin's past is shown in a flashback. You all know what that means.  
He got taken out mercilessly by DIO, but not without helping out the team by realizing what DIO's stand power is.  
Welcome to ZA WARUDO, where epic music and a cool sound effect awaits you.  
Joseph knows how to keep DIO away with Hamon, at least as long as he needed to reach Jotaro and tell him the secret of DIO's stand. It's also a bit touching to see how after all these years, he still cares deeply about his granny Erina.  
Though that didn't last long either. Joseph is out, too and Jotaro trades the first punches with DIO as a setup for the fight next episode.

So I went back to check: When we see what The World does for the first time in the manga, it's 3 full pages of the same scene, at the same angle, where everything is all in the same place.

Except for Dio, who moves through and breaks Kakyoin's web. A great, 10/10 setup, visually speaking.

So far the DIO fight has not been what I was expecting. But then again, we still don't know what his stand does, so I guess we'll see:

* Wait...Kakyoin backstory? I do not like this at all. He's so dead.

* Kakyoin you have just joined the cool club with that awesome barrier technique.

* Wtf? What happened... He was just... thrown away?

* He got Kakyoin...Just like that... fuck

* Aw shit...It has something to do with time. And it cost Kakyoin his life to figure it out. Goddamn it, Jotaro get in here!!

* Well fuck...Time stop stand... How the actual fuck do you beat that!?

* They can't do anything. Not against something as broken as time stopping

* Oh, Joesph actually using his powers in a smart manner

* Shit! SHIT! SHIT! He got Joseph caught in it

* Noooooooo...fuck you, DIO! Not Joseph... Noooo...Noooooo...Nooooooo... sorry, gotta take a break.

* Yeah, needed a breather. That was intense. 

* Jotaro...please beat him before he freezes time

* Oh hell yeah! Back to good ol fashioned punch ghosts!

* Hehe... Good luck, Muda counter dude. You brought it on yourself

* Kakyoin, Avdol, Iggy, Joseph...all gone. Up to the two protagonists PolPol and Jotaro. Pull a part 2, Jotaro! Beat him!!

[Happy National Donut Day everybody!](http://i.imgur.com/IRPpiG1.jpg) ^^^I ^^^Hide ^^^my ^^^sadness ^^^behind ^^^dumb ^^^jokes.

Just for fun I want to see how many Dio songs I can fit in to this comment.

For real though this is a good episode and is the true beginning of the DIO fight. It makes me want to *Stand Up and Shout*! Kakyoin had a good little speech on how he was alone because of ~~Elephant~~ ~~Hermaphrodite~~ Hierophant Green and it's very sad and touching but is he ignoring the fact that he has AN INVISIBLE TENTACLE MAN on beck and call? If CLAMP didn't go the [MPREG route](https://41.media.tumblr.com/65c861c1e0db1d6dfb7b2bfb1f177977/tumblr_nalhqmtaUX1qepum0o3_400.png) they could've cornered the market on gay muscleman tentacle sex.

Back to the plot, after Kakyoin sets up his deathflags he plans to make Hierophant Green *Invisible* to trap DIO in his web. It is actually a very good plan and was the key of figuring out ZA WARUDO. DIO and Kaks have some back and forth before Kakyoin pulls the trigger to figure out DIO's stand. [It doesn't work](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dhXQjTttClI&t=23), DIO goes *Straight through the Heart*. I really like Kakyoin's death scene (not in a "I like watching Kakyoin bleed out" kind of way, the "It's a good scene" kind of way), the slow shift to greyscale is nice and adds to the sadness. And as much shit as we give Kakyoin for his Emerald Splashes when it comes down to the wire he hits the target.

After that scene we get Joseph vs DIO in the battle of foxy grandfathers. And I'm okay with that.

>Ah Hamon I had a small issue with that 100 years ago.

[\>small issue](http://thecasualotaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jojo8bisect1.jpg)

I like to think Joseph didn't use hamon during Stardust Crusaders because the plan was DIO would punch Joseph and he would explode.

DIO also hates cats. What animal does he not kill indiscriminately? This is also one of the coolest time stop moments I've seen.

Again with the oddly specific analogies, with Jotaro's comeback being "I'm going to beat the shit out of you." Always straight to the point with you Jotaro.

It's funny how the Stand stats are pretty much wrong most of the time. Case in point, ZA WARUDO has lower stats than Star Platinum, but it is better because why not.

Like yesterday I'm going to end this post on a song by Dio, in this case [Shame on the Night, on the album Holy Diver](https://youtube.com/watch?v=vABtNXuNZt8)

You know, I just realized that DIO's time stop effect is sort of a *rainbow in the dark*. Though it's more of a filthy, twisted thing than an awesome one.

That would've been funny to see as a parody or something.

Kakyoin backstory...this late in the game? [He's so dead](https://my.mixtape.moe/sxgxxx.webm) :(

So that ~~super saiyan~~ aura around Dio I guess is vampire powers?

Good thing they teased his death beforehand, gave me time to prepare emotionally...still hurts though.

Yay Dio's stand power is finally revealed!!

Yay Hamon came back! Awe it didn't do much...

It really looks like Goku chasing Spider-man lol

YES JOSEPH FIGURED IT OUT!

So I guess the reason he didn't kill Joseph right after Kakyoin was because he was just out of range? Or is there a cooldown?

So what's stopping Dio from stopping time and just chopping off his head?

Had to kill that cat...hate for Dio just grows...

I know talking is a free action but to use it here when they're stressing 5 seconds is a bit bleh

The crusaders dropping like flies :(

Ugh was hoping this wouldn't happen. Dio is so OP so to make things fair he has to play around, it's like he didn't learn anything over the years.

>> ARTICLE
Well, like I said in my comment, if the Planet "Will Explode after 5 min" Namek can explode after 12 episodes, I think DIO's power can be at any leight of time regarding the canon leight and the real world leight. =P
>> ARTICLE
It was just funny seeing him stress 5 seconds was a big thing when he was clearly going over it :p
>> ARTICLE
> I know talking is a free action but to use it here when they're stressing 5 seconds is a bit bleh

It gets ridiculous from here. But, to be fair, it worked well in the manga, because we could read Dio's monologue at our own pace, while we imagined the scene happened at the exact same time as he said it.

To adapt it into anime in real time action, they'll have to scrapped every Dio's monologue. And without his monologue, Dio would be a bland villain. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm not criticizing them too much for it just took away some of the importance of the whole 5 seconds thing :p
>> ARTICLE
Well, i could see where you're coming from, because it definitely irked me way too much when i'm watching it for the first time..

Though after i've familiarize myself with Araki's work, i started to become appreciative with every little crazy thing he pulled in the series.
>> ARTICLE
> Well, i could see where you're coming from, because it definitely irked me way too much when i'm watching it for the first time..

Glad I'm not the only one, with the amount of replies I got I thought I was being too weird. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, its understandable that people who love the series would like you to understand more about a certain thing you hate, so you could see thats its not as bad as you think it is..

Which is why i replied your "talking is a free action" comment. I think i replied to one of your other comment as well. Don't see it in a negative way (except when it really is a nasty comment). We just wanted you to enjoy the series the same way as we did.
>> ARTICLE
>So I guess the reason he didn't kill Joseph right after Kakyoin was because he was just out of range? Or is there a cooldown?

It's a cooldown, the cooldown lasts about the same amount of time as the time stop.
>> ARTICLE
So like a cool down of like 5 seconds then? Not much!
>> ARTICLE
There must be a cooldown, the 5 seconds thing wouldn't matter if there wasnt
>> ARTICLE
Yeah maybe they'll go into it in the next ep! But the whole PolPol step thing says otherwise!
>> ARTICLE
Too be fair, he knows he can kill them at any time. Unlike last time where he got too cocky when his powers weren't even that OP.
>> ARTICLE
Feels like the same to me, sure he's more OP now then before but he was still pretty OP in part 1 and he didn't win then either. You'd think he'd adapt.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair this is DIO we're talking about, he basically exists to be as much of an asshole as possible.
>> ARTICLE
He's an asshole because he's clever. He did so many manipulative things in part 1 and he adapts. 

Having him be cocky _again_ feels like just an excuse because they need to give him some weakness since they made his power too OP.

But who knows how it'll play out, this is just how it feels right now!
>> ARTICLE
Let's be honest here, his power is mind breakingly OP. Plus DIO is an egomaniac so he is 100x cockier than he ever was before.
>> ARTICLE
I gave his cockiness a pass in part 1 but now he should have learned from his mistakes and the fact these guys have beaten all 500 of his henchman he threw at them. Dio's cocky but he's also clever. 
>> ARTICLE
He was waiting for his neck wound to heal so he didn't go hunt them himself. Plus with the sun being his only weakness it would have made travelling difficult. He has learned, you'll see. He jobbed in part 1 a ton but he's killed off two guys. It's just that his power is literally god like so he thinks he can't be defeated this time. I like that what you're thinking is addressed a bit in the next episodes. So don't worry too much.
>> ARTICLE
As /u/dertswa687o said, DIO pretty much thinks his power is unbeatable, and to him this is the equivalent of Zeus fighting a leper. However [Extremely light spoilers for next episode, no actual plot details.](/s "He does show a bit more of his clever, strategic side next episode.")
>> ARTICLE
He thought the same in part 1 though, he's a smart guy he should learn.
>> ARTICLE
You underestimate just how OP a time stop is. DIO >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Dio Brando.
>> ARTICLE
It's more OP yeah but Part 1 Dio was also OP it's not like this is a brand new situation for him.
>> ARTICLE
DIO thinks he is literally a God. And he's killed off two of them so far. His power is absolute this time, it isn't just ice powers. Hamon is completely useless this time.
>> ARTICLE
DIO literally thinks of himself as a god. He is convinced without a shadow of a doubt that he cannot lose. As far as he's concerned, he can screw around all he wants.

And I mean, he did kill Kakyoin and Joseph. It's not like he's completely screwing around.
>> ARTICLE
> DIO literally thinks of himself as a god. He is convinced without a shadow of a doubt that he cannot lose. As far as he's concerned, he can screw around all he wants.

Pretty much Dio in part 1 and guess what he lost lol

> And I mean, he did kill Kakyoin and Joseph. It's not like he's completely screwing around.

And that's what makes the last part even more frustrating since he showed how easy he can kill people so why not do it again.
>> ARTICLE
DIO's stubborn. He's a god. He doesn't care.

Just like...... root for the good guys, enjoy the coolness, and don't think so hard about what's happening.
>> ARTICLE
> DIO's stubborn. He's a god. He doesn't care.

He's a god who's lost before, think he would try harder.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he lost, and then he got The World. And now he thinks he's even more unbeatable. 
>> ARTICLE
You're really hung up on this aren't you?
>> ARTICLE
And he's even crazier now. Trust me. He's completely different from Part 1 DIO. He literally abandoned his Brando name.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't seem completely different as he's still being dumb and playing with his enemies. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, and he's different as some later parts will show. But that would be going to major spoiler territory. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a more accurate difference is that he's both changed mindset and physical mentality a bit. 

Remember that in episode 3(or 4?) of Jojo when he discussed the limitations of a mortal man, and how no matter how much scheming he tried some situations were impossible for him to achieve? This scenario where he tried to play the long game for 7 years or so, waiting for Jojo elder's death, utterly failed, and after that his main goal has been to rise above limitations as well as fear. The fear part is especially vital for explaining his current really arrogant method of combat-he does not flee fights, does not evade projectiles or emerald splashes despite not knowing their exact power, but instead takes it head on without fear to show his utter superiority. This is quite different from the initial Dio Brando whose goal was to manipulate and use any means necessary to attain power beyond that of his humble beginnings-rather, it's the DIO that wishes to show he is truly fitting of being named God.

Also, he spent 100 years in the ocean in that box after having swapped bodies and gained respect for Jonathan Joestar, and also gained what he believes is the strongest stand in Za Warudo, and so much time experimenting with Za Warudo to the point he is fine with letting others try taking shots at him, confident that nothing could kill him.
>> ARTICLE
> So that ~~super saiyan~~ aura around Dio I guess is vampire powers?

Honestly, Super Saiyan aura is the most accurate thing you can say here. This fight was happening around the same time Goku first went Super Saiyan and was fighting Frieza, and Araki just thought the Super Saiyan aura would look cool, so he added it.

>Yay Dio's stand power is finally revealed!!

And now you don't have anything else spoiled for you! (that I know of)

>I know talking is a free action but to use it here when they're stressing 5 seconds is a bit bleh

I feel like it probably worked better in the manga, but when it got moved to anime it just seemed so long.
>> ARTICLE
It's the classic "stand power is inversely proportionate to intelligence of user" principle. The World is so obscenely strong, it makes DIO fail to realize that there's no actual limit on the time stop. It just lasts as long as he's still monologuing.
>> ARTICLE
> And now you don't have anything else spoiled for you! (that I know of)

Nope going in blind for the rest!

> but when it got moved to anime it just seemed so long.

It was comical on him making a big deal of reaching 5 seconds when clearly he's frozen it for way longer :p
>> ARTICLE
I have heard it called 5 seconds **of action** before, though. If you notice, he does spend a bit of time standing still and talking.
>> ARTICLE
He would kill in speed chess then!

I really like the thought of DIO using his powers to cheat at games haha.

He'd make a hell of a goalie.
>> ARTICLE
I think all humans have the instinctual reaction to use time powers to cheat. It is so common, ask anybody what they would do if they could stop time and the answer will be either rob a bank or creep on people.

This Time on [Kakyoins Final Sendoff]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S49AGe3lkoY)
 
So today we say goodbye to our red-headed friend. You went down like an absolute champ, actually pushing DIO to use his ability to get in a single punch, and even using your very last breath to convey a message to Joseph. This is another in the long list of characters that will live on forever in the TRUE MANS WORLD
 
One reason that I believe that this series is one of the greatest anime series of all time is the perfect use of the OST. Virtuous Pope is the ultimate fight song for the minor characters, as it really conveys this feeling of an epic battle against overwhelming forces, only for the character to triumph in a brilliant blaze of glory. The way that they cut out the song as Kakyoin is blown backwards into the water tower in an instant, incomprehensible attack shows that if Kakyoin had been fighting anyone else, he would have won, but because of DIOs incredible power, he lost. [Here is my favorite creation involving Virtuous Pope, as it combines the most hyped up and epic song from the entirety of the JoJo OST with the raw and powerful moment in which Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 against Majin Buu]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsFPGS0WJDU)
 
The rest of the episode revolves around Joseph running from DIO and his piecing together of Kakyoins final hint. Interesting fact about Josephs escape, in the OVA, they had him flying instead of swinging from building to building with Hermit Purple. Which is unusual considering how they handled Jotaro and DIO fighting in the end of this episode and the next, as the OVA had them pushing off from building to building while this version has them straight up flying instead of that. I suppose the Hermit Purple scene was done like that because of animation limitations in 1993. But they did a great job with the encounter between Joseph and DIO on the rooftop, with Hermit Purple snaking around the roof and exploding in the static electricity of his Hamon. It was a really cool cut.
 
 But a really cool change that this anime does is prolonging the suspense in DIOs power, as we dont see him stopping time to punch Kakyoin until after Joseph had pieced the hint from Kaks together. In the manga, they show us what is happening immediately, but in the anime they decided to opt for a much better idea, letting us piece everything together just like the characters still are. Later parts in JoJo do a very good job of this even in the manga, having us be in the dark about what is happening and instead using sound effects and visual cues from the protagonists perspective to give us a feeling of mystery while still giving us as much chance to piece together what is happening as they have. I actually have plans to make a long analysis on JoJo with this as the main focus at a later date, so I dont want to go too far into it. They also added a whole section with Joseph talking about Granny Erina in his encounter with DIO, and it was interesting to see DIO respond to it. I love almost every change that DP makes to the manga as it always works to add something interesting to the fight it occurs in.
 
Another thing that happened today is that DIOs true power has finally been revealed. He can stop time. This has been a meme for as long as time has existed as well. [My favorite meme that spawned from this]( http://imgur.com/oSxLwNu). DIOs power is interesting, because he really isnt limited to the short range that his stand has. He is more limited by how much ground he can cover and how effectively he can murder someone within his stopped time. This creates an interesting divide, as while he has a much better chance of murdering people if he uses it up close, it is equally possible for him to murder someone at a long distance, as any object he touches is temporarily able to move through the stopped time, and he also has a certain ranged ability (although, I wont lie, Araki forgot about it) that can snipe people from a very long distance, called Space Ripper Stingy Eyes. The ranged attack is less likely to kill, but keeps DIO safe while he waits for his ability to recover (it doesnt have a cooldown, it just tires him severely, but as a vampire he recovers faster than normal people, so it isnt super limiting.) and the close range attack is a sure kill, but it involves him putting himself at risk.
 
Joseph got hit with a ranged attack, so there is always the chance he is still alive, but a knife to the throat is pretty difficult to come back from. Jotaro is going in close, so that is dangerous. I came up with a theory yesterday at work that would have made the final fight feel much less asspully than it does, but there is a major spoiler in here, so avoid it. [Part 3](/s I think the fight would have been much more interesting if Jotaro did not also have the ability to stop time. The fact that objects DIO touch can move within the stop time would be a cool concept to explore. If Jotaro had, instead of just doing the magnet trick in his rush, had also attached something else to DIO, like a string from his jacket, they could have still done the magnet misdirection and had Jotaro fight without the sudden reveal of SPs true power. Him winning by shear wit would have been more interesting than him winning due to a newfound power, but that power really works in Jotaros favor in the later parts at making him the cool, overpowered, mentor character.) But thats just my opinion.
 
Enjoy this fight, everyone. It is one of the greatest fights in anime for a reason. I also hope all of you are watching the BD version of this fight, because DP did a really good job of touching up this fight post production. Also there were some quality frames in this part in the original airing because of just how much was going on. But even if you are watching the unedited version, it is still an amazing fight and will be the most hyped shit ever for the next two days. I once again wont be able to post a writeup tomorrow because of work, but I will definitely post on the finale.

NOO JOSEPH!

Well sadly due to reddit and the internet, was already spoiled that he dies. That and Dio's stand power as well. Still a bit sad Joesph had to go like that and Dio's stand is pretty neat. I like the loud buzzard sound associated with ZA WARUDO.

Poor Kakyoin though, his death was pretty brutal. Nice that we got some characterization for him towards the end, but it really is a shame that it couldn't be done earlier. It was nice he finally did something, but honestly again he feels wasted and had the same problem Caesar had from Part 2. Hell they both got characterization just before their demise.

Here it is! Kakyoin's 20 Meter Radius Emerald Splash! 

If you listen closely in this episode you can here the sound of The World's power every time it's activated.

And Kakyoin takes a terrible hit! But in doing so he figures out the secret to Dio's stand! He does his best to send a message to Joseph. And then......he dies. Rest in peace Kakyoin Noriaki.

Dio then goes Super Saiyan and begins to fly.

Joseph figures out Kakyoin's message! The secret to Dio's stand is that The World can stop time!

He stops time again to get behind Joseph!

The cat sees Dio and knows it should probably gtfo.

He stops time again!

And then Araki has a cat killed instead of a dog. He hates both cats and dogs!

"Muda muda muda muda muda muda! MUDA!"

Joseph is down for the count too! When will the madness end!?

"Yaro."

"I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer."

Jotaro has the most massive balls ever. And he's bad mouthing Dio already.

It's interesting how The World and Star Platinum have pretty much the same design on their hands.

"Muda muda muda muda muda muda!"

"Ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora!"

Seriously,fuck Dio.He's an ass (and we won't be working with him),but he's still cool.Rip Kakyoin,he saw through Dio's stand and that will hopefully help Jotaro/Joseph to beat Dio once and for all.Judging by the stand power card,The World is weaker in two points than Star Platinum.So mathematically we get to the result that ORAORAORA > MUDAMUDAMUDA

Damn, Kakyoin getting all philosophical here, talking about how and why people connect with each other. It makes me like him even more.

Wow, Hierophant Green is subtly one of the most powerful stands in the show. The multitasking it can do is tremendous.

"ZA. WORLDO" ***DOOM***

Oh shit Kakyoin got rekt.

No! Kakyoin! You are my favorite! Don't go!

Go Kakyoin! Go!

OH GOD DAMN IT KAKYOIN IS DEAD. FUCK YOU DIO.

Of course Dio and fly. Because vampirism.

And we hear the first of Dio's many chronal raspberries. Get used to that "DRNT" people.

Damn, seeing that punch again just makes me wince. It doesn't help that I am watching the Flash alongside JoJo.

Hey, can y'all just stop being dicks and help the dude who fell off the roof?

So... if Dio can (eventually) stop time for an infinite amount of time... does he literally end the world? Or something? This is confusing.

Also, at least Dio believes in karmic retribution. Everyone who didn't help Joseph is kinda f'd. Also also, we will now need a stat that shows how many cats have been killed.

OH FUCK ME, NOW JOSEPH IS DEAD TOO. 

Mods, plz nerf zaworldo.exe in next patch. Plz. PLZ.

Wait. Hold on, we haven't gotten the little subtitle that says "Joseph Joestar has died" like we got for Kakyoin, or even in part 2.

Jotaro: "Though I fly through the valley of death, I shall fear no evil"... or something like that. Or he can just say that he's gonna beat the shit out of Dio, that works too.

Also, I realized something. During the credits, there is a point. Where  Jotaro, Joseph, and Polnareff are separated from Avdol, Iggy, and Kakyoin by a canal. It's literally the river Styx.

We didn't get it for Avdol either. Not until the end of Vanilla Ice.

And so, the MILF hunter gets rekt without even saving his loved Holly. At least he gave Joseph an important hint.

>> ARTICLE
Forewarning: Wow this is a long comment. Apparently I had a lot to say. I suspect that they're probably going to be staying this length for the last few episodes, so sorry in advance for that.

You know what, Ive got a fair amount to say about Fancy Guy, so Ill get all the other stuff out the way first.  
I specify Fancy Guy because I do not believe for a second that JoJos dead, because there was no confirmation before the episode end, so hes probably going to be saved somehow. Though even if he is, having a knife through his windpipe is not exactly conducive to good Hamon usage.

Whilst were talking JoJo, I feel like Hermit Purple has had a considerable buff (despite Dios insistence that its the weakest Stand). If you look at its power graph (side note: I hate those power graphs, theyre the source of so many problems) you see that its got a Range stat of D, thats less than Star Platinums C which goes against both what we see, and Fancy Guys claim that Jotaro would have to get closer than either of us would because both of us have well big range). With its range buff it actually becomes a cool Stand which has potential to be used as a powerful tool and weapon.

Weve now had the Time Stop power confirmed, and I really like the way its shown. The five second limitation is interesting (though those were some very long five seconds), meaning that the area of effect is limited by Dios speed rather than just Worlds Chartreuses range. This potentially puts paid to my idea that Chartreuse can copy powers, but it could just be Dio being misleading. After all, if hes copying (as I suspect) his Time Stop power from JoJoJo the last thing hed want to do would be to let JoJoJo know he has the power. One thing which does still give me hope in being correct is the fact that Platinum and Chartreuse seem to be pretty damn close in punch skill.  
Of course its pretty likely that Im wrong, and that Dios copying of Hermit Purple and JoJoJos potential prison skill were just examples of the creator introducing elements and then forgetting about them, like they did with Wham!s attacking of anyone who enters his shadow, or Silver Chariots after images, or HoHos Elephant.

And now to the the main event of this episode: Fancy Guys death. Man, I was so sure he wasnt going to die, I think in part because all I could see of his wound was a black void so I had no way of knowing how bad it was, but there were other reasons as well.  
Dadvol and Iggys deaths were consistent with their arcs, and also played into the arc of the Frenchman. Consequently I found them to be really effective and emotional. However Fancy Guys death came out of nowhere, without really being a part of his or anyone else's arc, almost as if he died just so there could be a sacrifice. It caught me off guard, but in a way which made me say Huh. I didnt expect that, rather than a way which evoked more emotion. Im definitely sad to see him go, he was my favourite character in this part, and frankly I think that he should have been the main character (though Ill get into that a bit more at the end of the season), but the way he suddenly died muted that sadness. Hopefully well get to see his going to heaven bit at some point, and then Ill get to have a bit more of an emotional catharsis about it.

Theres a question which I found myself asking early in this episode: when did Fancy Guy name Hierophant Green? From the bit of his backstory we saw whilst him and JoJo were spidermanning around, we know that it was called Hierophant Green even when he was a child, but he said that no-one he knew had ever been able to see it. So how did he know to name it after a Tarot card? Did a Stand bearer show up, name it, and then get the hell out of dodge, or did he just happen to name it something suitable? As always I suspect that the answer is that Im overthinking it.

Man, Fancy Guy had so much more potential in him. Nothing ever came of his art thing (the thing which earned him the earlier name with the unfortunate acronym) because it was just a way of showing that JoJoJos injury was definitely because of him, but it could have been more. Then theres his ability to possess people, something which he only used when he was introduced and when he kind-of-not-really did it against Deaths Whatever-colour-I-picked. Thats such a cool power for a good guy to have because its such a bad guy power. Its a powerful, useful ability with tricky ethical connotations, and thats something which it would have been interesting to watch him deal with, but instead it was just swept under the rug.  
Then we have his facial scars, something which would have stuck with him past the end of the series if hed survived. Its a little thing which could add an extra level to his implied story afterwards, but instead hes dead. Maybe he could have been proud of them as a symbol of the journey he went on, or maybe they could have been source of insecurity, leading to him wearing his sunglasses even after his vision had fully recovered.  
His isolation in his childhood tied in really well with Greens agoraphobia and hiding, and it would have been nice if wed found out about the former more than an episode before his death, and if the later had come up after it was first mentioned.

You know what, Im just going to stop dancing around the issue and get right to it. Im salty as hell about Kakyoins death. [This is a picture of me right now](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/d8/7d/aa/salt-factory-of-janubio.jpg).

Now that hes dead Im going to take another look at his Tarot card. Id been meaning to do this for quite a while now but never really found the right time to do it. What Ive previously said about his Stand was Im going to wait until I know more about him before I draw connections, so Im pretty much working off a blank canvas.  
The Hierophant is a bit of a weak card. By this I mean that most of what it does is done better by other cards--its a bit of a mix of the High Priestess and The Emperor--but it does have a few things which more strongly relate to it. One of the cards ideas is of harmony in a community, as opposed to simply leadership, and Fancy Guy certainly invokes this. Whenever there was a crisis within the group, he was generally the one working to mitigate it, and to get everyone working together again. He wanted everyone to be getting along and working together towards the shared goal, and didnt get distracted by his own stuff.  
The card also invokes the idea of how the experience of a journey can be the most important bit, and Fancy Guy reflects this in how much the journey has obviously meant to him.

Its a shame to see you go Fancy Guy. Youll be sorely missed. Hopefully well get to see you turn into a cloud at some point and have your proper send off.

Personally I think Kakyoin was killed the way he was simply so Araki could show just how dangerous Dio was. Kakyoin was never a pushover so people see what happened to him and go, 

"holy shit Dio too op please nerf."

Also known as The Worf Effect. What a way to go.

> Whenever there was a crisis within the group, he was generally the one working to mitigate it, and to get everyone working together again. He wanted everyone to be getting along and working together towards the shared goal, and didnt get distracted by his own stuff.

This. This so much. This and his isolated childhood pretty much sums up Kakyoin as a whole. He didn't take the spotlight much, but everything he did for the group was essential. And those fights he did actively participate in would've been extremely costly should he have failed at his part.

There's just something about the combination of his elements that make him unforgettable to me. Aside from Iggy (who was basically dragged into this mess against his will), he had the least amount of connection to the group, and yet devoted so much to it - even if he owed the Joestars his life, it would still take a lot for an introverted 17 year old to run away from home with a group of almost-strangers just to save one of the strangers' mother.

Now onto other things :3

> his art thing

It was just him ambushing with a Hierophant Green. The art was just for drama points I think.

> ability to possess people

While a shame, this actually plays into his inner conflicts of both having a somewhat screwed up personality from his upbringing and wanting to get rid of it. His quote from the Tower of Grey fight (something about Hierophant Green trembling in euphoria at the thought of tearing something up, can't recall word for word) and his reactions after being saved by Joseph/Jotaro in the very beginning sum it up. Being screwed up/antisocial/etc. is part of him, but he was ashamed of being such a person that he tried to refrain from letting that out unless he had no alternatives (20 meter Emerald Splash vs. The World).

I'm going to stop before it gets out of hand. I am hopeless when it comes to Kakyoin character analysis shit. I take this series way too seriously.

>Dios copying of Hermit Purple

A big fan theory is that the Hermit Purple he used was actually Jonathan's Stand and not his own.


>> ARTICLE
I really don't like this theory no matter how much sense it makes.

My mind rejects the fact that Jonathan would've had a Hermit Purple-esque stand. It just doesn't suit him. He'd more likely have a punchy stand or a healer stand than Hermit Purple.

Here we see Kakyoin's final victory. While he might not have come out of it as powerful as he did his past wins, he still landed a very important blow in the fight against DIO. You aren't alone anymore, Kakyoin, and you didn't run away from life itself, you met it head on for your friends. 

This episode was one of my favorite uses of Hermit Purple, using it as a coil to conduct hamon. It's kind of like using Hermit Purple to it's greatest ability is the peak of being a hamon master. Having a psychic connection to an invisible powerful vine that only people with other stands can fight off being able to have a constant stream of hamon energy seems like it would be something very useful if Lisa Lisa had, and it would have come in handy against the Pillar Men. 
>> ARTICLE
This was the moment when End of THE WORLD became my favourite JoJo OP (even if I still love Bloody stream for the song more). Taking some excellent advantage of the CGI animation to do that sweet camera movement

I would ask how Jotaro is flying, but I just assume cuz Araki thought it was cool

Jotaro punching Za WARUDO in the gut was hype 

I love how Dio's skull has a heart embedded in it somehow.

Great ora ora ora. Might by my most satisfying one yet.

I figure anyone with a stand that can float and is strong enough to lift it's user can do that. I interpret it as he was bringing out his Star Platinum inside of himself, and he's making it carry himself as it moves around.

Considering how in the next episode [Part 3](/s "His clothes turn to dust as well as his body when he is thrown into the sun after his defeat"), I assume he used some vampire ability to generate his clothes. So maybe the headpiece is part of his skull

Goku went super saiyan in June 1991. The Dio fight started in early 1992. In the next season there are quite a few nods to Yu Yu Hakusho (which started airing a couple months after Diamond is Unbreakable began).

This is it guys. Tomorrow is the final episode. In case you didn't see it, I'm gonna say two things again here.

1. The /r/Anime Podcast has recorded a spoiler filled (up to Part 3) JoJo episode that will be released 2 or 3 hours after the rewatch goes up tomorrow, so look forward to that.

2. I'm gonna do a final thread on April 1st, the day after the rewatch, for a general series discussion. I'll be including a bunch of fun polls in it. Shoutout to /u/AmethystItalian for giving me the idea after doing it in your Amagami rewatch.

Alright, we're back for more with DIO's World Part Thr--- [what in za warudo is that?](https://i.imgur.com/10ae0c4.png) Why would you open the episode on that image?

You will probably ask yourself ["Why are they flying?"](https://i.imgur.com/ezDzzQ1.png). The answer, of course, is that this is JoJo and the rule of cool always trumps logic in JoJo. Dio can fly because he's a vampire and apparently those can fly but there is no reason why Jotaro should be able to.

> With this the Joestar bloodline will finally end.

Yeah well you got taken out by a generic harem MC in a stupid weeb internet contest so who *really* wins here? (Sorry guys I'm really salty right now so I have to pull out all the shots.)

JOTARO IS RESISTING THE WORLD! BECAUSE ITS NOT CALLED DIO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURES FOR GOOD REASON!

Why is Jotaro flying now? Guys when did these powers become a thing?!

> Kono Dio

Some things never change, like this phrase never getting old.

[](#konodioda)

Oooo a magnate changed the game! 

OMG WAS HE FAKING IT?! HE CAN STILL MOVE!!

Does Dio still heal rapidly? That might pose a huge problem. Shit he healed! 

Dio's just going to throw some knives at him? Pls. 

(Always posing even frozen in time midair)

Omg Jotaro actually got stabbed. Omg. He's barely gotten hurt before this is insane. 

STABBED IN THE HEAD?! OMG HOW CAN HE COME BACK FROM THIS?!

[](#overwhelmed)

Omg he blocked it somehow?! So smart. 

# FUCK YES THERE'S POL THE MC COMING TO SAVE THE DAY! 

Please don't kill him too!

Wow random police coming around to get themselves killed. 

He caught the bullet! He's slowing his own heartbeat down! 

# HE ORA'D HIS HEAD! JOTARO ORAED HIM! 

> Nah I don't feel bad about this at all. 

....are you shitting me? Fucking Dio trying to rail behind a car? Are you kidding me?!

> This place is taken you can't escape.

FUCK HIM UP JOTARO! ORAORAORA HIM!

I'm just singing a mantra of 'please don't kill Jotaro', with a  couple of "fuck DIO" inter-pressed in between right now:

* Best way to start an episode ever!! Full on stand rush full with flying and smug DIO. 

* Ouch, he used Za Warudo!

* Hooooooolllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy shiiiiiiiiiiittttttt... End of the world should've won the best OP contest. That added scene was fking brilliant

* Nooooo, don't kill Jotaro.

* He can move!! He can moooove!!

* Oh hey... Jotaro is super sayan too

* Jesus... This guy just keeps spamming that shit

* Nooo.. Don't! Jotaro do something pls!!

* He moved!! umm...How?

* Can he even kill DIO though? Only Joseph could use Hamon... Oh fuck it all

* Kakyoin being best guy from beyond the grave

* Oh shit. DIO is being smart, that's never a good thing

* Shit!! The knives got him! Shit shit shit...

* He was ready...with books... Jotaro, I love you! in a non-sexual kinda way

* DIO is being smart again. FUCK!!

* PolPol is here!!

* Yeah fuck that... He can use his time stop even when his head is a freaking Shish Kebab...

* Fucking hell... DIO is being careful. Dude, go full on cocky and *let them beat you!!*

* He caught the bullet... He fking caught it! Oh god...This is so intense, I've been holding my breath for a while now

* What happened to DIO though?

* That knife throw!! Nice!

* Based super sayan Jotaro!! HELL YEAH!!

The tragedy is that the entire OP is only mindblowing once you've come this far and understand that every shot has some bit of cool significance. Even if this version or the SFX version got posted, all people would say is "Oh, I guess the OP stops for this guy, weird. Time to vote for Flyers."

Not even, they would just say they like the other OP more cause it's hype or they like the song more. The contests are a sham.

This is a good episode. I saw a few people saying that they were disappointed that the DIO fight didn't have very much actual fighting, but this episode was pretty much all fighting.

The episode starts off with a bang. DIO and Jotaro are already fighting and once again the stand stat charts lie. ZA WARUDO has the same power, speed and less precision but DIO wins the stand rush. Up next is one of my favourite shots in all of Jojo with DIO and Jotaro just *stand*ing there while shockwaves are happening between them. It's a cool visualization of stand fights from a non-stand user's point of view. There was another one of these shots, way back in Dark Blue Moon where Star Platinum is punching the shark but I prefer this one. Jotaro then starts [flying for no reason.](http://2new1.fjcdn.com/pictures/Through+sheer+force+of+anger_af8261_5628998.jpg)

Then there is the sick ass opening with the time stop. This is great, and wordier people than I will talk about it better than I can.

Jotaro Bring DIO on the ruse-cruise with the magnet trick, making DIO think he could move in stopped time and then making him think that he couldn't so he could get revenge for Kakyoin.

DIO terrifying that poor woman and making weird analogies in true Jojo fashion. Has DIO even been on an airplane before and if so, what was that flight like?

DIO showing off his knife trick. This is a cool sequence even if the CG was very notice able. It also shows us that even good stands can turn to shit if the user is injured, with Star Platinum's A precision fucking up and putting a knife in Jotaro's brain-bucket.

DIO making sure that Jotaro is dead, [for good reason](http://i.imgur.com/wKQkPyF.jpg). Polnareff comes in with the assist and does about nothing. I love DIO's backflip onto the rock to watch Jotaro, it's great. DIO than gets a cop to shoot Jotaro, mirroring the first episode where Jotaro take a cops gun and shoots himself in the head and proving he can stop bullets.

Jotaro's ruse-cruise continues to the point of almost killing himself to get an edge on DIO. That takes some stones man.

I love how Jotaro says he's putting gasoline on DIO to track him and then pulls out a lighter. It reeks of bad censorship and it's hilarious.

Jotaro is in the manhole (heh) for some reason. I think it's supposed to be a Fist of the North Star reference, I don't know.

DIO turns the ruse-cruise around on Jotaro and gets a blood transfusion to kick off the final episode. See you there.

Today's Dio song is [Stand Up and Shout, also from Holy Diver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjCBV6o_DSE)

>  It also shows us that even good stands can turn to shit if the user is injured, with Star Platinum's A precision fucking up and putting a knife in Jotaro's brain-bucket.

always tough it was intentional, since he had the magazine there, part of the keikaku to fool DIO
>> ARTICLE
From how he said it "Good thing I put those magazines there" makes it sound like it was a backup plan.
>> ARTICLE
Well, from now on JoJo is much more about smart fights and interesting powers rather than just fighting, so we should enjoy our ORAORAORA vs MUDAMUDAMUDA while we can, before we see things like [Part 4 the mildest of spoilers](/s "spaghetti punching")

Oh god that's hilarious.

> I love how Jotaro says he's putting gasoline on DIO to track him and then pulls out a lighter. It reeks of bad censorship and it's hilarious.

Wait how is this censorship? I just assumed Jotaro was gonna set him on fire.
>> ARTICLE
The manga also has Jotaro directly say that he's going to set DIO on fire because he can't afford to wait for sunrise to finish him off. So it's not like it's a weird but faithful line from the manga, they had to change that line for the anime.
>> ARTICLE
But... but Avdol has actually set people on fire and that was fine?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because Jotaro's a minor and it's only okay for adults to set people on fire?
>> ARTICLE
Okay yeah typical censorship then. That sucks.
>> ARTICLE
It's not exactly to track him if the goal is to light him on fire.

/u/PM_ME_YOUR_SWORDS is right then. Seems real pointless. It's like covering up Jotaro smoking. We still see what's happening.
>> ARTICLE
>Jotaro is in the manhole (heh) for some reason

It's because it was taken.
>> ARTICLE
Heheheh. Manhole.

Anyways, then it's a bit of a paradox. He's in the hole because it's taken but it's taken because he's in the hole. [Part 5](/s "Maybe Diavolo used King Crimson and Jotaro just rolled with it")

>/u/A_Hint_Of_Lemon couldn't make it, so they asked me to post their comment for them. Here it is.

OK, starting the intro as usual, nothing to see here--

*ZA WARUDO!"*

Holy shit. Dio's Warudo is so powerful that it breaks into the holy realm of the intro video. Look at his smug face. It also explains the weird blue/pink shade that is in every intro up to this point. This intro has gone from uninteresting to good to now fuckin' amazing, though I hope there is more sfx next time around (though I am watching it on Crunchyroll, maybe that has something to do with it?)

Oh! There's a twitch! Dio looks stunned! I don't think we have ever seen Dio look stunned before!

Yes, Dio, they are the same, right? Same fighting style, therefore similar moveset. [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](/s "Though Star Platinum's true powers may actually have been revealed early on")

Jotaro is so in Dio's mind right now.

Wow, we are getting a lot of moments with Dio being surprised. I like it. This flashback is neat

This is actually bad. The longer this fight goes, the stronger Dio gets.

Uh oh, JoJo (he deserves to be called that now) was only using magnets and trickery. He's wide open.

Or not. That was brutal.

Dio confirmed misogynist?

That's a lot of knives. Where does he keep them? Hammerspace?

Oh damn it all. Jojo's wasted.

Wow, hanging with grampa Joseph really did rub off on JoJo.

Man, Dio is anticipating every move JoJo makes. Those years of experience really paying off.

POLNAREFF FOR THE WIN!!!

Oh damn it! So close!

"Joestar's Egyptian Tour Group". I kinda like that name.

"SAYONARA-DA POLNAREFF-DU"

Wait, how do you even flip like that?!

Damn, stopping his own heart. That is really impressive.

DIO GET REKT, SON.

Yes Dio, this is what happens when your skull is obliterated.

Yes! Light him on fire!

Oh! The music's starting!

JoJo with the knife moves!

Random sewer JoJo is best random JoJo. Also more proof that [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](/s "JoJo already knows how to stop time, not just move in it").

Yes! The moment that you've all been waiting for, Dio getting pummeled! 

Oh crap!

Can't wait until tomorrow!

So here's something I wanted to ask yesterday. With Kakyoin being dead an all, who can realistically stop Death XIII?

Also damn Jotaro, taking acting to a new level by actually dying for the act.
>> ARTICLE
Basically anyone can stop Death XIII as long as they have their stand summoned before going to sleep/getting knocked out
>> ARTICLE
As odd as it sounds, Boingo could pull it off (with some help). Thoth would be able to predict that a baby would try to attack through a dream, probably followed by an illustration of Hol Horse/Oingo killing said baby, thus removing the threat.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, but if they see the baby's stand in Thoth, that would mean they're already in the dreamworld. And since they're joke characters, no matter how much they try to defy fate, they'd still die.
>> ARTICLE
Being joke characters aside, they could kill the baby before they fell asleep, assuming Thoth showed them the baby's location and stand ability.
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively, since they're joke characters, they'll manage to just barely survive through idiot luck. And they're bad enough people that they'd let a baby die, so it's plausible that they could kill Mannish Boy before he kills them.

The epic final fight with DIO has begun! Even acknowledged by the hijacked OP where Dio freezes the credits right in front of Jotaro's face.  
The opponents probe each other for weaknesses. The only reason why Jotaro isn't dead yet is DIO's past experience with Joestars and resulting caution. Every twitch of Jotaro could mean a punch to the face for DIO.  
DIO is slowly pulling off all the moves we know from all the Mugen memes, this time freezing time and throwing a ton of daggers right at his opponent.  
As Jotaro was about to be beheaded Polnareffs tries to get some MVP points by impaling DIO's head on his rapier, but no sell. DIO stops time, punches him aside and Polnareff is out cold.  


After Jotaro finally pummels DIO's head in he reveals that this wasn't even his *final form*. To be continued tomorrow. (speaking of final forms and Super Saiyans, these chapters of the manga came roughly a year after the Namek saga came to an end.)

A tie with PolPol again.
>> ARTICLE
No PolPol point for that sweet headshot?? Well as we can probably guess who the last episode will star (hint: it's the one named JoJo), RIP memes.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, if I'd give points for 3 minute or less appearances the counter would be pretty much a mess. I decided to clean that up. 
>> ARTICLE
> A tie with PolPol again.

Won't be lasting long. I think it's pretty obvious, even for first time viewers, that next week is gonna be a Jotaro episode. Polnareff sure put up a fight, though.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, seeing as how almost all of the episodes were paired up, I wouldn't quite count Dio's fight as more than 2, esp since the other characters did so much for the earlier parts of the fight, and because the last episode, from what I remember, wasn't just Jotaro but had everyone remaining be a pretty big deal, but I might be remembering that wrong.

never heard that before, i don't watch soccer though and won't start for the world cup

The OP: End of- ZA WARUDO! 

That was some serious hype right there. And the rest of the episode was super-hype as well. Is Jotaro going to kill DIO once and for all? GAH, HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCKING SHIT DIO the worlded the fucking opening, he really is OP.


Jotaro can fly now.

 [](#ok "thats fine I guess.")

DIO's five seconds are like a minute

Polnareff true protagonist confirmed

Joestar's Egyptian tour group LOL

Jotaro stopping his own heart with his stand was cool as fuck

Is the heart part of his skull now? Is Dio growing a horn or something?

the music after DIO gets his skull caved in is amazing

"This place is taken you can't escape" best part of the episode, (except the opening changes)

I thought DIO was going to live through this episode, then I thought he was going to die, but then he became the joker

>> ARTICLE
> but then he became David Bowie

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
> HOLY FUCKING SHIT DIO the worlded the fucking opening, he really is OP.

This might be my favorite thing to see reactions to. Deaths happen and whatnot in tons of anime, but how many shows have the antagonist come in and take over the OP? There's a few out there, but not a lot.
>> ARTICLE
It caught me completely by surprise. I thought that DIO was just going to cut the opening short and actually attack Jotaro right then and there
>> ARTICLE
This makes me HYPED for what they going to do with Part 4 openings!
>> ARTICLE
I'm all for the idea of [Part 4 Spoilers](/s "having the OP start with with Kira adjusting his tie, and then starting over from the beginning to show Kira adjusting his tie again after Bite the Dust.")
>> ARTICLE
So uh, they're just both floating for no reason other than to look cool? Ok. 

HOLY SHIT! ZA WARUDO IN THE OP! THAT WAS SO AWESOME!!

I feel like Dio is being way too cautious, but then again, he has been rekt in the past because of his overconfidence. 

How is it possible to have 2 users with the same type of stand? I feel like this is the only time it could happen because of the JoJo bloodline. 

I still don't understand this flying business, but whatever. I guess Araki needed to make the fight super epic. 

Here comes more of those random analogies. 

Oh wow, Jotaro the trickster. 

IT WAS A COUNTER RUSE!!!

Poor lady, seeing a guy fly in with a missing leg. 

Oh shit, knives. That's actually a good strat from Dio. 

JOTARO NO!!!!!!!!!!

Omg Jotaro, don't scare me like that.

POLNAREFF WITH THE SAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

But it wasn't enough :(

A gun is actually pretty useful here. Hopefully he doesn't shoot anywhere lethal. 

Jotaro is crazy for tanking that shot without reacting. 

Jotaro is really lucky that Dio keeps saying everything that he is gonna do. 

Holy shit, that punch was brutal. Also, why does Dio's skull have a heart on it?

He finally got Dio! YES!

WAIT! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Oh god, this is too crazy. 

>> ARTICLE
>How is it possible to have 2 users with the same type of stand? I feel like this is the only time it could happen because of the JoJo bloodline.

It's not that uncommon in Jojo actually.
In part 3 alone we have:

Hermit Purple and The Passion

Star Platinum and The World

Wheel of Fortune and Strength

Osiris and Atum

>> ARTICLE
> Hermit Purple and The Passion

Is The Passion Holly's stand?
>> ARTICLE
The Passion is the name they use in Over Heaven? (I'm not sure, but its in one of the side materials) to designate DIO's Hermit Purple


>> ARTICLE
> How is it possible to have 2 users with the same type of stand?

Remember that time DIO used Hermit Purple?
>> ARTICLE
Whatever happened to that? There was also that time where he was surrounded by roses which I assumed to be Holly's stand. Those stands probably have uses in this fight. 
>> ARTICLE
My understanding is that Araki originally planned for The World to have the power of all other stands, but rightly decided that that idea was kind of lame. However by that point Hermit Purple had already happened, so his retcon explanation is that it was actually Jonathan's stand.
>> ARTICLE
That was the best use of an opening I've ever seen. So fucking hype.
>> ARTICLE
The Copy theorys back on the menu boys. Hear me out. This episode revealed to us that Star Platinum has all of the same powers as Worlds Chartreuse, *all* of them. Not only are they equally punchy, but they can both stop time, and both allow their bearer to fly in a golden blaze (incidentally I really liked the way that JoJoJos learning of that was handled). The two Stands are exactly the same, the only difference weve seen being that Chartreuse has slightly lower stats on the graph thing (though I dont pay much attention to that based on how much I dislike those graphs). Weve previously seen Stands which were in the same category, such as Fools Orange and Geb both being bound to a substance, or Wheel of Christine and Strength both being tied to vehicles (coincidentally they were also the only two non-coloured Tarot Stands which I didnt add a colour into the names of), but weve only seen Stands which are exact copies when Dios involved. Weve seen the Star Platinum-alike which hes currently using, and also the Hermit Purple type Stand he was using for spirit photography.  
What if the way that he stole a Joestar body (wait, why am I not calling him DiJo? Im going to start calling him DiJo) meant that his Stand was generated as one capable of copying the Stands of other Joestars (if I understand it right, then whatever he did to get his Stand caused the other Joestars to get their Stands so it should be able to work).  
But DiJo was genuinely surprised that JoJoJo could move within the Time Stop. How does that work if hes copying the Joestars? Well heres the thing: I dont think he knows thats his Stands power. He definitely doesnt know everything about his Stand, as he didnt know he could stop time until he did it; so what if hes been copying JoJoJos Stand this whole time and never realised? In the same way that he copied Star Platinum, he might have accidentally copied Hermit Purple one day, and thought that was just another setting of Worlds Chartreuse, or--as many theorise--that it was Jonathans Stand.  
I really like the theory that the vine Stand he used is actually Jonathans Stand as it ties into stuff well: its a vine Stand like Josephs and Hollys, his non-use of it now could be due the greater link he now has with Jonathans body making it unusable, and his growing inability to use it works well with DiJos personality and the bit where he told Joseph that Hermit Purple was the weakest Stand. However Im going to be sticking with my Copy theory for the time being because its mine and Im pleased with it.

Im really liking the way this fight is going, and this episode had some really good back and forth in it. Both of the characters really had their time to be the one controlling the conflict. JoJoJos magnet gambit felt positively Joesphian, almost too much so with the sleight of hand which would have been required to pull it off. Also his knife-proof magazine armour was exactly the kind of silly which Ive come to love and expect from JBA.  
JoJoJos actions whilst faking his death were pretty damn hardcore. He literally stopped his own heart by grabbing it really tightly with his soul. He also straight up put his life on the line to protect his French friend (though can you blame him? The creators killing off characters like hes worried that hes going to be taxed for every one left alive at the end). The Frenchmans brief but kind of effective attack was also really nice.

The way the timestopping was handled in this was great. Especially how JoJoJos more limited time stopping was shown. It gave him a single block or strike against DiJo in every Time Stop which makes it dangerous for DiJo, even though he still has most of the power. 

JoJo was certainly still alive this episode. We saw him to be so at the end, and as we *still* havent gotten the Joseph Joestar has died screen, Im going to assume that hes going to live through the blood sucking as well.  
That screens an interesting beast in that regard. I can see why the creator put it in, as it gives a full confirmation that a characters died, and stops them going But wait. What if hes still alive in the shadow dimension. Hes definitely coming back out. But the downside is that by showing it when characters die, you automatically make potential deaths seem less serious by not showing it.

Its almost surreal to think that its the final episode tomorrow. Since January my episode a day has become a part of my routine, so itll be strange to suddenly stop. Oh well, Im sure Ill be able to find something else to fill in the gap, and Part 4 will be here to satisfy my JoJo fix. 
>> ARTICLE
> Not only are they equally punchy, but they can both stop time,

This hasn't exactly been revealed yet at this point of the rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
There is actually one more point to the copy theory later in the manga when [Later Jojo](/s "DIO uses what might've been Crazy Diamond's power to heal Pucci. It has the issue of Crazy Diamond can only revert things and Pucci was born with his injury.")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 6](/s "I'm pretty sure that Dio didn't have a stand yet when he first met Pucci. And even if he did use Crazy D's ability, it can only revert things back to a previous state, and Pucci was born with that foot.")
>> ARTICLE
[Up to Part 6](/s "Crazy Diamond doesn't have to revert things to the way they were: Josuke warps what he reverts when he's angry, and he intentionally chose to merge Angelo with stone for eternity. Perhaps DIO learned how to calmly warp things, and he used that to fix Pucci's foot. Since Crazy Diamond's power is described as stemming from Josuke's kindness and gentleness, it's possible that DIO wasn't even capable of using the full repair ability. That would explain why he never tries it in Part 3.")
>> ARTICLE
That makes sense, the only issue is that [Part 4](/s "I think Araki retconned the warping thing since it never happens after Angelo")
>> ARTICLE
I want to say that [Part 4](/s "Josuke smashes and warps some furniture in the second half when he's pissed off about Kira getting away with a new identity. He definitely never uses it for anything plot-relevant after Angelo, but I don't think it was retconned.")

Definitely so, it won me over very early on. There's no way I'd be writing this much about a show I didn't love.
>> ARTICLE
Good to hear! Welcome aboard! It only gets better from here!
>> ARTICLE
Can we take a second to appreciate how badass Jotaro is? He just tanked a dozen knives, then takes a gunshot to the leg without reacting, then STOPS HIS OWN FUCKING HEART just so he can trick Dio into coming closer.
>> ARTICLE
Well he's based on Clint Eastwood...

Does anybody have that picture of Clint doing the Jotaro pose?

I think I saw it on KYM once. Lemme do a quick google

Lmao what.

Blame the LN. That's what DIO believes there :P

> then takes a gunshot to the leg without reacting

He never got hit, though. He just grabbed the bullet between his pants and his leg.

meh, still badass. I'm just pumped for tomorrow's episode where we get another one of Dio's signature memes

Oh, it's definitely still badass.

ITT: people realizing that End of the World should have won the /r/anime OP contest (yeah, I'm still a little bit salty about how early it was eliminated)

I don't even know what I'm going to do for the next episode, I have so much to say, so many videos to link, my post will probably be huge.  
>> ARTICLE
God, I was saltier then the ocean seeing the JoJo's OP lose. ALSO THE SYMBOLISM WAS SO GUD.
>> ARTICLE
[The OP](https://my.mixtape.moe/zuzscn.webm) blew my mind when I first saw it. I was actually grabbing something from the kitchen and I walked back in just before "End of-ZA WARUDO!" Nearly dropped everything in shock. At this point, you've seen enough of Part 3 to interpret the rest of the OP, but I'd advise waiting for the SFX version before doing any super-long writeups on it.

I adore [this opening shot](https://my.mixtape.moe/makzuj.webm) where they briefly show what the clash looks like to ordinary people. I say it a lot, but these shots are great reminders that Stands are the visualizations of psychic powers and that these fights would be even more bizarre to follow as a bystander.

The flight takes a bit of getting used to, but I suppose Araki gave the go-ahead on it. Whether they were actually flying or just taking superpowered leaps combined with Jojo's time dilation was always a bit unclear even in the manga, but I don't really mind it here. The same goes for whether DIO's aura was meant to be seen or not. It's a neat way to visualize that oppressive charismatic power that even the strongest characters feel from him. Part 4 used auras more often than Part 3 to signify power, so I wouldn't be surprised if David Productions wanted to help get viewers used to the concept.

I wonder if The World's power to stop time actually does come from all the times that Dio Brando ended up in a tough situation and felt like time was slowing for him. Like when he trained as a boxer, or when he had to cut off his own head for a chance at survival. He was sinking into alcoholism as a human, and part of the appeal of drinking is that it slows down your bodily functions and dulls the pressure of situations. It's a power that fits him very well.

Of all the bizarre analogies made in the final stretch, the flight attendant's probably the most well-remembered. [This is my favourite explanation of the scene.](http://nenamartinez.com/translation/chibidio3.png)

Jotaro's bluffing was the best weapon he truly had this episode, but he really let his coolness get in the way of his judgement. In the end, a bluff of DIO's turned everything around in the last minute. If Jotaro hadn't punched DIO across a crazy distance (as he's done to all the Stand users that have personally pissed him off) and simply crushed the vampire's skull instead, he'd have won this episode.
>> ARTICLE
1: That DIO is adorable

2: I always thought of the reason DIO has his a timestop was due to the fact he stole Johnathan's watch once.
>> ARTICLE
> Part 4 used auras more often than Part 3 to signify power, so I wouldn't be surprised if David Productions wanted to help get viewers used to the concept.

We've even already seen something like it in the Part 4 trailers. Josuke's stand comes out of some pink aura while Part 3 stands appear out of thin air.

> Of all the bizarre analogies made in the final stretch, the flight attendant's probably the most well-remembered. This is my favourite explanation of the scene.

That's honestly the most adorable Dio I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro and Dio begin floating. On today's episode of Dragon Ball Z.

Dio says he'll so no mercy and kill a Joestar quickly. What the fuck have you been doing for the last two episodes fucking around then?

Dat opening. People probably figured out before this that the silhouette we see behind Jotaro was Dio but now we actually see him. Before that he stops time which even stops the op and walks past Jotaro to get in place.

I believe before this the only evidence of Dio being in the op besides the silhouette is there is a frame or two of The World appearing in the glass Star Platinum breaks and while Star Platinum starts punching as the singers go "Ora ora ora" there's a brief moment where you can see The World's fists punch back. Pretty sure that's only been in the last few episodes though. Very easy to miss.

Jotaro's finger twitches even though time is stopped. This happens in the op too if you know where to look along with Joseph's and Avdol's deaths and Kakyoin's 20 meter radius.

Anyone know the name of the ost track that plays when Dio notices Jotaro's finger twitches? I've listened to all the soundtracks but don't seem to remember that one.

Now Jotaro goes super saiyan as well. We full DBZ now.

If Dio wasn't so arrogant can you imagine how scary it would be for him to see someone move in the stopped time. He had quite the reaction seeing it for the first time.

Jotaro hauls off and punches The World through stopped time! Dio's leg gets cut off by glass!

"Fetch my leg from over there."

Even the pant leg reattaches. 

I like how when Dio stops time to get behind Jotaro here we see Jotaro's head suddenly turned around without seeing the movement. Right here we were outside Dio's World and Jotaro was inside so we miss his head movement. Nice little effect.

It's the part where Dio whips out all the knives! Before any Jojo anime had aired I had saw snippets of this fight through clips of the 90s ova. Seeing Dio whip out the knives from his pockets was something I had originally been waiting for. Nice to see it again.

Jotaro just happens to have a bunch of magazines on hand that he can stuff beneath his clothes. In his hat too. Alright Araki.

Awww yeah it's the main character Polnareff! Coming again to save the day! But Dio stops time! He is unharmed! Oop well nice try anyway Polnareff.

Jotaro purposely twitches to save Polnareff's live. Dio immediately notices and places his attention back on Jotaro.

"We're the police!"

"We have guns pointed at you."

This actually makes me laugh.

The ways Dio checks to see if Jotaro is really dead is excessive but necessary. Poor Jotaro has to stop his own heart. His eyes go empty. Then they go even darker.

But then he starts his heart back up and punches at Dio. Dio stops time but it's too late. The extra second Jotaro has is enough for Star Platinum to connect. Dio's skull shatters!

Then Dio has trouble moving. He stumbles and feels sick. He doesn't realize it kinda fucks up your body a little to have your skull shattered and your brain hanging out.

Dio tries to escape by entering the manhole but Jotaro is already waiting for him, Naniiiii!?

He tries to stop time but Star Platinum is too fast and Dio finally gets oraed a bunch of times! Counter guy! How many oras did Dio take there?

Dio flies through the air and lands beside....Joseph!? What Dio is evolving! Congratulations your Dio evolved into High Dio!

Next episode is the finale guys! And then the day after is Part 4! How hyped are you right now?

Damn I type long ass comments.

>> ARTICLE
> How hyped are you right now?

It cannot be measured with common hype-o-meters.
>> ARTICLE
All the hype-o-meters are shattering like they're scouters from DBZ.
>> ARTICLE
About the books, you can see Jotaro falling close to a bookstore earlier in the episode, he got them from there
>> ARTICLE
Ah okay that makes much more sense.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah DIO is pretty much the coolest mother fucker to ever exist.

Also can we respect the fact that Polnareff, who at this point doesn't actually know what ZA WORLDO does, manages to almost kill DIO.
>> ARTICLE
> Also can we respect the fact that Polnareff, who at this point doesn't actually know what ZA WORLDO does, manages to almost kill DIO.

That's a good point. He actually jumped into battle without even knowing what the enemy Stand does just to try to save Jotaro.
>> ARTICLE
That knifes barrage move DIO does is another of his Supers in the Fighting games. Generally called "The Checkmate", it's really one of the most iconic scenes in JOJO.

Touhou made a tribute to that, if I'm not mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
There's also a reference to this in Skullgirls, where a character pins to opponent to the wall with knives. It's called "Checkmate incision."

I've also heard that Mad Dummy from Undertale could be a reference to DIO (with his knife-throwing and "Futile. Futile! FUTILE!"), and there's a character in High School DxD who is basically a child version of DIO (a vampire who can stop time).

So if you see manly men fighting while going super saiyan, you probably should not approach them, even if you are a police officer. 

I was planning on posting this yesterday when stopping time was revealed, but I forgot. I was spoiled as to Za Warudo's power before watching this. So when Pol was trying to walk up the stairs, I just kept imagining Dio stopping time, picking Pol up, setting him a stair back, and then returning to his seat. 
>> ARTICLE
I was spoiled on the power by reading an episode review for episode 21. Which is pretty annoying, considering the reveal isn't until 22. So thanks for that, Anime News Network.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Would not have expected that from ANN. I got spoiled in Youtube comments which is pretty much browse at your own risk.
>> ARTICLE
I got spoiled by the memes xD.
>> ARTICLE
Other than that, I got Kakyoin, Iggy, and Avdol's deaths spoiled for me by an improperly tagged spoiler here. They had it as [JoJo Part 3 Spoilers](/s "Those 3 deaths") while the show was still airing. This wasn't in a discussion thread, by the way, so I kind of assumed they were actually talking about the anime and not the manga.

And I also read a lot of stuff on the wiki and spoiled just about every death and twist in the manga before I got to them. Didn't stop me from loving it, though.

>> ARTICLE
Jotaro against DIO is probably the best match up in the series so far. The dynamic between Jotaro and DIO is so different from everything else so far. All of the other crusaders sans Iggy (who regrettably didn't make it =c ) had prior involvement with DIO. Dio is the reason Joseph grew up with no one but Granny Erina, and he is linked to the Pillarmen, and to DIO Joseph is the successor to the only man in the world (aside from Vanilla Ice) he ever respected, using even the same powers that defeated him the first time. Avdol was terrified of DIO and thought his evil needed to be extinguished, Polpol-chan and Kakyoin were both also scared of DIO at first but now want to get back at him for making them evil. DIO understands the three of them and recognizes they are willing to die to take him down. 

But to Jotaro, DIO is nobody but that bastard who is trying to kill his mom and his friends. DIO expects this to matter more to Jotaro, being the latest in the line of the Joestars, and being the strongest of the Crusaders who are coming to kill him. For DIO, this is a crowning moment and climactic battle, but Jotaro doesn't give a shit about that vampire bastard, he just wants to kill him to get it over with.

[You were expecting DIO, but it was me, Nukesaku!](http://i.imgur.com/VJdb2Xp.jpg)

The way the show handles DIO's stand in these episodes is fantastic. It truly is ***ominous*** and while at this point it's probably easy enough to guess what The World can do (or at least narrow it down to just a few possibilities) it is damn hard to think of how the Crusaders could possibly fight it. You know the heroes are in trouble when they'd rather jump out a fourth story window than stay and fight the enemy they've spent months hunting down.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly it was confusing as hell to gueess what it was. Araki was just trolling.
>> ARTICLE
Yay we have more DIO being deliciously evil. Haven't had that in a while, missed it actually.

[](#scrumptiouslymoe)

Polly made a great stand against DIO too (y'know, before whatever fuckery DIO's stand did to him)
>> ARTICLE
> Yay we have more DIO being deliciously evil. Haven't had that in a while, missed it actually.

There's a lot more to come, too.
>> ARTICLE
Was Dio even planning to conquer the world or anything this time? It seems like he's just been dicking around naked in the dark for the past six months banging hot Egyptian girls (and then murdering them). 
>> ARTICLE
He is waiting for his head to completly assimilate Jonathan's body, since even beyond the grave, Jonathan is still fighting him, before moving on with his plan.

And he is doing so by sucking a lot of blood.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but he knows the Joestars are coming to get him. It would probably make their job a lot more difficult if when they showed up the entire city of Cairo was his vampire army.
>> ARTICLE
That would attract tons of unwanted attention, for DIO it's better to lay low until he has the power to take over the world. He was certainly not wasting his time but I'll have to stop here because of spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't understand why. Back in Part 1, Jonathan and Zeppeli couldn't leave Dio alone for a single night or else he would gain enough power and followers to conquer the world. Now he's even stronger than before because of Za Warudo, the only people on earth capable of defeating him are on their way (but taking multiples months to get there) and he hasn't even left his house.
>> ARTICLE
Taking over the world is much harder than it used to be a hundred years back though. His stand is strong sure but not strong enough to hold back an army yet.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't had the Speedwagon foundation to pinpoint Dio's location back them, neither a world where information could arrive at any place in the world just by some seconds. 

There is a big difference in attacking a backwater village in the 19th century to attacking a big city in the 80's of the 20th century.

DIO is buying time, after all, he NEEDS that. Remember a Stand is as powerful as it's user health, and DIO need time to recover to make The World even more powerful.
>> ARTICLE
>Yay we have more DIO being deliciously evil. Haven't had that in a while, missed it actually.

That was such a great scene. DIO really does pull off 'evil' better than most villains.
>> ARTICLE
Pulls it off better than 90 percent, most villians just end up being cringy and edgy trying to be "evil".
>> ARTICLE
Despite only one episode's appearance, I quite liked the Senator's scene. He went from normal person to insanity within a minutes, while DIO was being DIO as usual. His VA did good job.

Also [spoiler for next episode](/s "The World's stand power isn't revealed yet, but the production gradually adds that distinctive sound FX to be recognized when he used it.")
>> ARTICLE
Just caught up recently, in part 1 I hated Dio, but in this episode I'm actually liking him quite a bit, mainly due to the part with the senator.

Dio's stand seems super OP, I'm exited to find out how they deal with it!

I've been listening to this OP non stop as soon as I've heard it, also exited for the special effects added onto it!

I had no strong feeling for DIO in part 1, now hes easily one of my favorite villians.

Will do! I don't go nearly as in depth as others here but I'd still like to give my thoughts :) 
>> ARTICLE
Well, we finally got a taste of DIO's "The World", and I really liked that Araki are still kepping the secret of his Stand, leaving people confused like the heroes until finally the secret was unrelavel.

This builds The World powers as such a unknown, powerful threat. The effect is really visible.

I think was a nice touch. Too bad that it's a dank meme, so very few fortunate people are able to arrive to these episodes unspoiled.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to reassure you with the fact that when I watched JJBA a couple months back I was unaware of the dank meme so I entered unspoiled, and was able to thoroughly enjoy the next episodes :)
>> ARTICLE
As a rewatcher I'm super excited for the ending of this rewatch.

Just so I can shared the huge amount of amazing JoJo AMV/MAD's, I legitametly thing JoJo has the best AMV's of any show, even if only for the different versions of Voodo Kingdom.

Also I love how Araki creates an entire character, with a backstory personality and motivations, who only exists so that DIO can fuck with him, top quality.

And lastly, DIO is the most terrifying person ever 0/10 would not battle. 
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, what other AMVs have you seen? I personally think One Piece has the best. 
>> ARTICLE
the jojo MAD'S are so fucking well done, especially part 4,5 and the one part 7 with SOUL'D OUT [Alive]

Who would've thought the day would come when I'm rooting for PolPol...

* Wtf is up with the mindgames...... Why is he going down?

* Eh... I legit have no idea what the stand is at this point. It could be any of my earlier theories, or none. Hell, it could be a combination of all of them.

* I love the change to the OP

* DIO...you missed your calling as a Philosophy major...

* Oh hey...Gay guy's deepest fantasy... Totally called it.

* The rest of the gang are here!! And..... DIO runs away... What is this, a video game??

* It hurts hearing Avdol and Iggy died for PolPol... Odds are more will die in the DIO fight.

* What on earth? Nukesaku got in the coffin... Huuuuhhh!?

* I really admire the fact that they're thinking things through

* Props to the studio. The OST and sound effects are awesome this episode

* Should I care about this senator's life story? Well, I don't...

* What on earth does this stand do? Mirror actions on a vector or something?

* At least it seems to have short range.

* Jotaro stealing bikes like it's nothing new

* Kakyoin...you tried your best. Not your fault. DIO just uses cheat codes

* WTF! He threw the body at them

* Ahhhh...Next episode feels like a deathflag farm already.

Dio looking fabulously evil like always. 

Pol went up, Pol went down, you can't explain that!

This reminds me of the infinite stairs from Super Mario 64. 

Oh cool, I noticed the stairs moving under Polnareff during the OP, which reflects the scene we just saw. 

MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!!

That was a legit coordinated point. 

At least Jotaro was nice enough to break the window instead of the wall this time. 

That was a very awkward analogy. Not a fan of such crass humor tbh. 

Ok, wtf. How?! He was opening it, and then he was inside it. This is some spooky shit. 

Damn, they've been falling for a while. I kinda doubt the house was that tall. 

Again with the low brow analogy...

Nice bribery Joseph. 

Capes are a bad idea Dio. You should probably take it off before it gets caught on something. 

\>Yare Yare Daze

Dang Dio, that's a fab walk you got going on there. 

Poor Senator Philips. All those accomplishments and he gets rekt by Dio. 

Polnareff, you shouldn't believe everything you see in movies. 

Oh god, those poor civilians :(

Nice kick Jotaro. 

The blood on his car...and he won't even have his life spared. RIP. 

Holy shit, Dio makes emerald splash look like nothing. 

RIP Senator Philips. He was ok I guess?

You may have already noticed, but the last quarter is basically Jojo's Bizarre Analogies. There's a few starting with D'Arby the Gamer, but from here to the end you can basically count a new strange analogy or two every episode. 

There is no reason for this.

Dio still the biggest bad out there...

Jotaro has a pretty special kick!

Za Warudo has a short range like Star Platinum, should be an interesting finale

Kakyoin just keep running :(

[Next few episodes but you should be fine as you have been spoiled on the power](/s "You should know that based on his power, that close range doesn't limit DIO because the timestop is universal.

[Spoiler](/s "But I think it's more about The World effective range as a Stand, not the range of the power so it can make use of it's power.

The main character meets the main villain. Epic music plays in the background. But it wouldn't be a Polnareff scene if there wasn't something funny in it (not counting death scenes).

[Finally, the big reveal! A truly menacing title card.](https://fat.gfycat.com/GiddyAdvancedFattaileddunnart.webm) (Seriously, I love this animation) Finally the time has come for our hype to become reality. Play the opening! The time has come for the end of THE WORLD!

[Does DIO legit just have a throne in his room?](https://i.imgur.com/dtLcMxQ.png) No, not even in his room, in the fucking staircase.

[The World joins the fight in all its golden glory](https://i.imgur.com/7eI0mZ9.png) and after almost two whole parts, we finally are re-united with the _MUDAMUDAMUDA_ we've all been waiting for. But wait! [The competing main characters have arrived!](https://i.imgur.com/5EWluuY.png) The fools. Their poses are _useless useless useless_ before the mighty DIO!

[Are you sure about that Polnareff?](https://i.imgur.com/zebUnCz.png) I'm caught up with The Flash and if that show has taught me anything, it's that enough Speedforce could definitely make this happen.

[The canon-defying coffin!](https://i.imgur.com/BPNaY2A.png) We meet again! (or is it a different one?) They're pretty smart about this. Don't approach the coffin without any light nearby. Because once you open it, DIO will - [NANI?](https://i.imgur.com/LMB6USP.png) [I was expecting DIO **but it was me, Nimrod?**](#konodioda)

You thought this were going to be 4 episodes of the crusaders fighting DIO? You fool! Their abilities are _useless useless useless_ before the might of THE WORLD! These final four episodes are a return to the vampire horror genre of Phantom Blood, [and our heroes](https://i.imgur.com/McKiChP.png) will be [running for their lives!](https://i.imgur.com/9SKgou4.png) [Except the main character of course.](https://i.imgur.com/R5WMnVk.png) He has lost too many friends to run away now.

Old Joseph rarely looks cool or intimidating or badass. [This close-up of him is great though.](https://zippy.gfycat.com/FatalConfusedAbyssiniangroundhornbill.webm) I don't swing that way but just saying, if I was Mariah and was watching this scene...

["Shut up, I was good friends with Speedwagon and I _will_ buy your car, stop resisting!"](https://i.imgur.com/oC2PHx9.png) I like to imagine that this isn't JoJo using weird JoJo colours but that the money is actually gilded.

Vampires killed his friends and now Polnareff has snapped. He's killed one vampire already, and [he's not gonna stop until Silver Chariot rips through DIO.](https://i.imgur.com/ajYOaiI.png) Be very afraid. Everyone that has stood in Polnareff's way in this series is either dead or near death. And he's even teamed up with [the second protagonist](https://i.imgur.com/ywOlxEt.png).

It feels weird hearing DIO say "Speed". I keep expecting to hear "Speedwagon" and then I get sad that we only have regular unnamed narrator guy left now.

Senator Wilson Phillips has internal monologues. That can't end well for him. This is the fastest a character has turned mad since the woman in part 1 who devoured her child.

[DIO deflecting Emerald Splash is a great scene](https://my.mixtape.moe/ycwyxg.webm) but honestly, has Emerald Splash ever actually worked in this series? It gets points for being a ranged attack, and one with a really short cooldown, but it just seems a bit weak. _Useless_, some might say. At least The World's range is quite limited, whatever it does.

[I really don't understand this part.](https://i.imgur.com/v9AVLu5.png) Since both Hermit Purple and Hierophant Green have a higher range than The World, shouldn't they try to stay _outside_ of The World's range? Surely if they enter the 10 meter range, even undetected, they put themselves at far greater risk.

That car crash is brutal, and really not Joseph's fault. The credits appearing at the same time as shit starts to go down is a great choice and brings back memories from Roundabout - fitting, seeing how we've come full circle and returned to DIO.

Kakyoin has figured something out! Perhaps with this discovery, the crusaders will be able to actually fight DIO! Let's find out tomorrow!

Attacks are included in the 'get within 10 meters' part. Ranged or not, you have to be able to physically touch DIO in order to damage him.

The only times Emerald Splash has worked in an actual fight are vs Jotaro and Tower of Grey :3
>> ARTICLE
> Finally, the big reveal! A truly menacing title card.

So I get that it says "The World 21" because he is the last (twenty first) tarot-stand user, but why isn't it called The World 21 like Death 13? I assume it's a stylistic choice but why add it at all?

>> ARTICLE
The cards all have numbers on them (for a quick reference watch Walk Like An Egyptian, which shows the stand cards for all crusaders except Iggy), it just usually isn't part of their name (just like Strength, The Fool, and The World don't have any colours in their name). No idea why Death 13 was an exception.

Hmm. So they do. Odd that I never noticed.

Araki probably made it Death 13 because just Death sounds lame.

Not counting several people Dio killed in the sideway.

In the Manga and the OVA they show that.

We finally have the long awaited fight against DIO. During the first half DIO is fucking with Polnareff's head, in the second half DIO is hunting Kakyoin and Joseph in their pick-up. Surprisingly, Jotaro takes a back seat in this fight. At least for the moment.

Shit where did this come from, I was playing Ico.

So DIO has finally arrived. GOOD!

The start of this episode is great with DIO and Polnareff's staircase shenanigans. DIO also make a compelling argument, if not for the fact that Polnareff knows he treats his minions [Part 6](/s "bar one")(red spoilers apparently don't work on mobile so I won't be using them until they are fixed) like shit and sends them to die against the Stardust Crusaders. In this episode DIO showed how charismatic and FUCKING TERRIFYING he can be, with the Polnareff conversation and with Senator [~~Armstrong~~](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dXRtdgDbBNU) Phillips.

Just after the DIO and Polnareff talk the rest of the gang (the living ones) shows up. Not much happens in this scene, but I would like to point out that Jotaro is the first to notice that Avdol and Iggy aren't there. This is a nice (if very overdue) bit of character development, showing that he does care a lot about the friends he has made in this journey. Aside from that it shows that Jotaro is still cool as a cucumber, even when >50 feet from what is pretty much his mortal enemy. The scene afterwards with Nukesaku's death was just more of ZA WARUDO. [Part 3. Literally next episode, come on](/s "It is pretty interesting that ZA WARUDO seems to be relocation of people, not time stopping. I haven't read part 3 (I went straight to DU) so I don't know if it's like that in the manga, but it is a nice bit of misdirection by Araki.")

This fight set up is perfect. The fact that Vanilla Ice was a vampire was a good reminder of their strength after a season of super vampires and then two of stands. But the fact that they can only *fully* kill DIO in about twelve hours (If I'm right it's about late October/early November so it should be about 12 hour nights) really puts on the pressure to not get killed.

The rest of the episode is just following DIO. Not much to note other than I thought the "There's room on the sidewalk" line was chilling and the rather odd fact that ZA WARUDO has a ten meter range. This is huge for a power stand and [part 3](/s "more or less ignored for the rest of the fight. It could be said that DIO doesn't abuse his range because he is so cocky that he can beat anyone that he lets them get in his range, but still")

And now and oddly appropriate for Jojo song, here's [Lonely Is The World, by Black Sababth (Ronnie James Dio era)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AU0BG2advEY)

DIO IN THE FLESH! SHIT IS GETTING REAL! 


> But right now, I don't feel any fear at all.


This line normally means doom for most magic girls so hopefully Pol isn't a magic girl today. 

Fuck is going on with the stairs?? Oh no it's an endless loop. 

I love how stairs are used in the JoJo OPs from the first OP to this OP and how the they show the distance between the good guys and bad guys. 

No Pol don't submit to Dio! DIO'S STAND APPEARS!

> Muda muda muda muda!

It's back! 

AW SHIT THE GANG IS BACK! AND ALL TOGETHER! 

DIO DON'T RUN! 

> Where are Advol and iggy?

Pls don't.

It is the Joestar destiny to face Dio! 

IT'S THE LOOP! THE DEADLY LOOP! 

> felt like an icicle stuck up my ass.

Oh did it now....

Well this is a pretty far fall. 

This is bad that they're fighting at night. Very bad. 

> as certain as a belch after drinking soda.

These analogies are quite interesting. 

Oh wut? Dio is out of his mansion? For some reason I thought he would stay there the whole time. 

Aww Jotaro having Pol's back with a yare yare daze is so heartwarming. 

Omg the Dio strut! I can only see him doing this to MJ in the background...

Sentor Phillips ain't fucking around with Dio...but he's gonna lose anyway. 

THE LOOP OF DOOM! 

Omg Dio having him run over everyone meanwhile Jotaro is kicking a motorcycle back into working. Idk who's cooler. 

> You'll spare this senator's life won't you?

Dio gonna Dio.

SHIT IT DOESN'T WORK ON DIO! 

Using the Senator as a projectile? Why not I guess!

Dio too scary!

>> ARTICLE
Should tag those as spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Many of the previous arc titles have placed the Stand over the user (Bastet's Mariah) or just excluded the user altogether (The Empress, Death 13). DIO's World holds up DIO unambiguously as the main threat. His Stand is all but excluded. It's not "DIO no Warudo", with the name of the Tarot card in English. It's "DIO no Sekai."

This isn't a fight against The World. It's a fight against DIO, and Cairo is now DIO's world.

From this episode onward you should start noticing how certain scenes reflect the OP. It's up to you to figure it out, however. ;)

The two mothers basement episodes on the OP details are amazing for that stuff.

The ultimate hype train starts now. It's also probably a good idea to watch the opening from here on out if you've been skipping it and watch it carefully.

Eh? Polnareff went down the stairs instead of up? He seems so confused. Gee I wonder what could have caused this. He's literally teleporting down the stairs.

Where did the chair come from!?

Dio reveals his stand, The World!

"Muda muda muda muda muda muda!"

Then Joseph, Kakyoin and Jotaro coming to save the day!

Polnareff breaks the news to them about Iggy and Avdol.

"Yes. I have always known him."

Can you imagine this? Knowing your whole life that the reason your grandfather died was because of some maniac vampire who lusted for power. Joseph is how old now? In his 60s? 60 something years knowing of Dio.

"As certain as when you piss in a strong wind, it'll get on your pants."

This series is full of quotable dialogue.

"Eh?"

Nukesaku was in the coffin! Yet he was also the one to open it!

They dive out the window to get away!

Joseph is fuckin stacked with money. Just buying shit left and right throughout Part 3.

Dio with dat sexy cape.

Anyone have a stitch of Dio's face at around 14:55? His face doesn't quite fit all in one shot.

He is Senator Phillips! A politician! And he can't even escape the car!

Dio commands him to drive on the sidewalk, mowing people over.

[Jojo Part 3 90s Ova spoilers](/s "I believe you actually see the people get run over in the ova. Pretty brutal.")

Dio flicks one emerald and completely avoids Emerald Splash!

He fuckin throws the senator at them!

DIO use his Stand to get chairs for dramatic effect, apparently.

From a later Part in the manga, "Make her docile like a winter catfish" is one of my favorites.

It's pretty simple. Some guys are trying to subdue a girl and one of them keeps yelling "Make her docile like a winter catfish!"
>> ARTICLE
No wonder non stand users are so confused in this series. People show signs of being hurt without a source and they're saying all this weird shit!
>> ARTICLE
I love how when Nukesaku opens the coffin, he doesn't even seem all that surprised when he winds up inside of it. He's just like, "oh, I guess I was what was inside the coffin!" It doesn't matter to him that it doesn't make any sense, he's just so satisfied with that being the truth of his world. He tried to open it up, but he was the thing inside of it all along, he's perfectly happy with that. 

It gives me the chills when Jotaro talks about how he feels DIO's presence and they have to get out because it's truly dangerous. I mean, after everything else they've been though, nothing has been so strong before that they just need to cheese it because of how deadly it *feels* before. It makes it easy to understand how big of a threat DIO has become.

Oh crap!! DIO is Bowser and Polnareff doesn't have enough stars!

More seriously this episode was great, the build up to the coffin felt way more like something from the first two parts then any of the other fights, can't wait to see what happens next. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, time for shit to get serious...

Dio with scariest lip-licking 0/10 would not kiss.

Also, I forgot how much I love/hate Dio's trolling.

First official "ZA WORLDO!" And it's said by Pollnareff of all people!

So, obvious question then. If humans live to attain peace of mind, what does Dio live for? And for that matter, what would give Dio peace of mind?

Mudamuda's back, everyone!

Cavalry's here!

Dat finger point.

Avdol...Iggy... :'(

Of course there's a coffin.

Kinda smart how it's not shown what Jotaro is thinking. It makes him unpredictable, though unfortunately it also makes him seem unrelatable.

Nukesaku, what you just did is betray Dio.

Dufuq. I mean, I know what Dio's powers are, but, wow. Being so out of the loop must be so confusing.

That's the spirit Polly!

Jotaro with clever plans, Joseph must be rubbing off on him.

Polly and Jotaro: most bromantic moment in the show so far.

Dio's strutting should be a gif.

"Do you think you are going to get away with thi-" YES. YES HE IS. BECAUSE HE'S DIO. DUH.

Well that senator went from 0 to cray-cray real quick.

That whole traffic scene really sums up Dio's opinion of anyone but himself well.

Of course all you had to do was kick the motorcycle. Or well, have the main character kick the motorcycle.

OK, so we know that The World has limited range. Thus Dio will force the gang to face him directly.

Nice to see Kakyoin back in action, his range will surely.

Oh shit.

Oh, alternate credits!

Wow and here I thought Dio's clothes and The World's appearance was just simple creativity on Araki's part. He puts references in everything.

> NEW: The World appears to have a diver's breathing apparatus on his back. This is a reference to Dio's most famous song, Holy Diver.

And here I thought Antfish was at fault for Holy Diver.

The World might be a reference by the Black Sabbath song "Lonely is The World" from Heaven and Hell. It came out in 1980 and was sung by Ronnie James Dio after all.

There is also a theory that The World's design is based on the Dio song "Holy Diver", due he having two oxygen tanks on his back as well.

I love Dio
>> ARTICLE
Well here we are at the end, the final arc of the rewatch, the battle against Dio.  
I still find it really dissatisfying that Dios the bad guy of Part 3, but I cannot deny how good a bad guy he is. Hes got an undeniable charm to him, and also an aura of flamboyance which could have easily become comical, but which manages to enhance his menace.

The mystery around his Stand has been a really nice counter to the fact that we already know all about his Vampire abilities. It gave him a bit of mystery which he would otherwise have lacked. Now that weve actually seen it in action and had both Fancy Guy and the Frenchman point out that its More than just superspeed, I think its pretty clear that [it can](/s "stop time.") This is obviously a crazy powerful ability, held in check only by the limits of its range, which is a really good limiter considering the power.  
The parallels to Star Platinum are obvious, theyre both crazy overpowered, have fairly limited range, and attack with fists, and this brings me back to a previous theory I had about [Worlds Chartreuse:](/s "Ive mentioned before the idea that Chartreuse can copy the abilities of other Stands (such as the times weve seen it perform spirit photography whilst looking like Hermit Purple), so could it be that the reason it has so many similarities with Star Platinum is that its currently copying Star Platinum. If so then this would imply that Star Platinum is also capable of stopping time. Ive already mentioned that Star Platinums activities in the jail hint towards it having another ability which JoJoJo isnt consciously aware of, and stopping time would fit the bill.")

I loved the interactions between Dio and the senator. We got to see a man whos very powerful in the real world suddenly plunged into another world (no pun intended) where hes insignificant. It also showed us the disdain Dio has for regular people, not even thinking highly enough of them to hide his powers from them, and seemingly not even considering how ploughing down a bunch of people to get to his goal faster might be a bad thing.

Considering that the Nazis and SWF were capable of handing a large number of (admittedly non-Stand having) Vampires with the use of UV lights, youd have thought that JoJo would have brought at least one with him, what with the fact that they were on their way to fight a Vampire. I know it wouldnt have been *that* much help considering his abilities, but it would surely have helped a bit.

Anyway, Im looking forwards to the rest of this fight. Im eager to see how the whole thing goes down, and if they ever mentioned what happened to HoHos Elephant. Maybe Worlds Chartreuse took it.

Your theories are pretty interesting to read. Looking forward to seeing your reactions when the abilities are actually revealed.

I'm not even sure it was unintentional. Looked like they thought something was a little bit off, so they decided to just fuck with him.

They were pretty surprised to see Jotaro somehow take a dump, go to the cleaners and also beat them by foot to the hospital. I'd say they weren't really aware. Plus its Polnareff.

Oingo is one fantastic singer. That beautiful voice

So this might be a case of Polnareff and Joseph being idiots but if they legitimately thought Jotaro was an imposter why didn't they ask him to bring out his stand? I would however like to point out that Araki purposely got the two people who had dealt with a shapeshifter before out of the fight.

This episode also marks the start of Iggy's process of transforming from a [horrifying looking monster](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/6/6c/IggyOriginal.png/revision/latest?cb=2014091406151) to a [cute anime dog.](http://i.imgur.com/5gTqPz8.jpg)

Can I nominate Khnum for the worst stand. I mean the only other ones are [Part 5-6](/n "Notorious BIG, Rolling Stone and Highway to Hell. Given that two of those require YOUR DEATH") and Khnum is still on that list speaks volumes about how shitty it is.

The ED in this episode is fantastic.

Don't forget Ebony Devil, Holly's stand, and [Part 4](/n "Cheap Trick").

What did Ebony Devil even do again? I just remember Polnareff getting fucked up by a creepy doll, but the doll was the user, not the stand, right?
>> ARTICLE
It gets stronger the more you hurt the user and can possess something to attack.
>> ARTICLE
The Stand was bound to the doll. The thing was, the Stand is powered by Devo's hatred. So Devo lets himself get beat up by his opponent, then leaves and camps out somewhere nearby while he lets the little doll rough up his opponent with his knives and spears and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Holly's stand is just killing her because she's weak willed, it isn't a part of the stand. From the vines it might've been some Hermit Purple type thing. But yeah those are some crappy stands.
>> ARTICLE
Crazy how [Part 6 and 8](/n "planktons, a baby, and trees") have more fighting spirit than her.
>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/n "Achtung Baby aka Shizuke also")
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted the "lack of fighting spirit" thing not as her having very little willpower but as her having no violent instincts at all.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, even simple creatures and babies can get angry/try to defend themselves. Holly's a pure person who isn't even as violent as a baby, and that's why she doesn't have the fighting spirit needed to control her Stand. She's got willpower in spades, that's why she tried to act as if she wasn't sick in front of everyone and how she's still hanging on. But she doesn't have it in her to harm others.

If you want to get into later cases, it's notable that [Parts 4 and 5](/n "when Josuke and Giorno are children during Part 3, Crazy Diamond makes Josuke deathly ill like Holly's stand did. He gets better, though whether it's just because the Crusaders killed DIO or because the image of the pompadoured stranger saving his life awoke his fighting spirit is left vague. Meanwhile, Giorno has no mention of becoming sick during his childhood and he even uses Gold Experience by accident as a kid when he needs to. Since Josuke had a loving family situation and Giorno was neglected and abused, perhaps Giorno had more fighting spirit at that age than Josuke.")
>> ARTICLE
Completely agreed.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think that Thoth is even worse than Khnum.  At least Khnum does something.
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing, Thoth actually just starts making people near it start dying. It's pretty powerful, if indiscriminate and imprecise.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, so it has a passive power?  It seemed like it just read the future, and told exactly what was going to happen, which couldn't be changed in any way.
>> ARTICLE
it's very likely that thoth causes people around it to die since basicaly every prediction is about death
>> ARTICLE
Not explicitly but the fact that it predicted 3 deaths and a bus crash means it has a high likelihood of having one.
>> ARTICLE
It should also be said that the brothers were inches away from actually killing Jotaro. Thoth is pretty useful, if you have a goal that you plan to pursue in the near future.

> Who's in our car?

Omg someone doesn't know how to play GTA. 

OH RIGHT HE CAN CHANGE HIS FACE! I WONDER IF THAT MEANS HE BLOWS HIMSELF UP...

He even knows to say *Yare Yare Daze*. Such a powerful stand!

I know its for the plot but the Stardust Crew is way too gullible...except when it counts like Kakyoin and the baby. 

Welp fake Jotaro is fucked. Death Note gonna give it to ya! 

> You're not a fake are you?

So close to the truth! 

Hahaha I bet they know and they're just trolling this guy at this point. 

(Side note why is Joseph driving *again*)

They really should be catching onto this Jotaro...OH RIP BAD GUY! 

The real Jotaro could've died and Pol and Joseph wouldn't have noticed. 

Also how is this guy still talking after getting blown in half? 

> You were always so shy but now that you kill people with a Death Manga you've grown so much. 

Yeah but his laugh still sucks. 

Peace bad guys. Neither as competant or as scary as I thought you'd be.  This ending is interesting...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXEX_VUI-E0  I just have to be the one to share this before anyone beats me too it. This is my favorite comedy mash-up in recent memory. 

The way Polpol kept asking Oingo stuff like that, it makes me wonder if Jotaro usually just gets annoyed with him, or if this sign of his character starting to open up more that he does play games like that more often now. 

Also kind of sad for Boingo, he was starting to show a stronger side of himself, and then he immediately gets beaten up.

Some might ask why I gave Kakyoin the point for being impersonated but not Jotaro.  
I see it from an audience perspective. When we see the rero rero meme, it's just Kakyoin for us, since it got revealed at the end of the episode that Kakyoin himself actually does that stuff. The episode also began with the impression that Kakyoin might be really doing all that weird shit.  
This episode we were never under any illusions that this is Jotaro. There *might* have been some stuff related to him when they were talking about his party tricks, but my guess is that they suspected something and were just messing with Oingo.

>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna be honest, if I was you I would've put this episode as none of the crusaders and just have an "other" box.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely more Joseph and Polnareff than anyone else. I'd say it counts.
>> ARTICLE
I love this episode. Some of my favorite parts from the JoJo series is when the villain becomes the focus of the episode/chapters and we see things from his point of view, like the [Part 4](/s "Kira") stuff.

And it is really amazing that the crusaders never realize they were under the "attack" from 

   ^^i ^^had ^^to ^^do ^^that

And while I'm a big Yes fan, and progressive rock fan in general, I have to admit that Oingo Boingo Brothers ending is not only the best ending in the history of anime it is also the greatest song ever made. 

edit: also, it was here that Hirohiko Araki kinda predicted 9/11 in the manga. See [this](http://aminoapps.com/page/anime/9545884/jojos-bizarre-adventure-predicted-the-9-11-attacks) for more info. It's not a tinfoil hat theory, but a VERY bizarre coincidence IMO.
>> ARTICLE
One of my favourite episodes.

Of course Jotaro smoking is censored, but someone disguised as Jotaro? Fair game.

 In the end they didn't even know the Oingo Boingo brothers existed.

 Also the GOAT ED. Boingo's deep voice is genuinely nice to hear.

This was such a legit episode. Probably gonna be one of my favourite Jojo episodes just because it was so fun. Plus that ED is great. 
>> ARTICLE
With Deaths Amber only one of the Crusaders knew about the fight, but here none of them realised (somehow). This means that the Crusaders have actually beaten two more enemy Stand Bearers than they thought they had, so theyll arrive at Dio thinking they still have two more to defeat. This is sure to create a bit of awkward confusion, but I have no doubt that as soon as Dio and the Crusaders realise what happened theyll have a bit of a laugh about it, and part as friends.

I like how the Crusaders didnt consciously do *anything* to thwart the Brotherss plans. The Brothers were instead thwarted by the vagueness of their predictions.  
However the Crusaders really should have been in a position where they were actively thwarting. For quite a while Ive been surprised whenever an enemy Stand caught them by surprise, simply because in their position Id be shouting THIS MUST BE THE WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND! every time something even slightly unexpected happened. However this episode really took the cake in that regard; JoJo really dropped the ball.  
He was paranoid enough to suggest that they stop drinking from unsealed containers, but somehow is fine with his Grandson suddenly wearing different clothes (which he has done for all of ten minutes up until now), having a different sized hat, being not where they expected him to be, and acting very differently. I know that it WAS THE WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND, and that people usually cannot change how their faces look; but when you know youre fighting supernatural enemies you really should be considering that fact.  
That reminds me of something I forgot to mention yesterday: Blind Guy told us that Hermit Purple can read minds. Why is this not more of a thing. I can believe that hed never tried it before, but now that the Crusaders know about it surely something of a thing should have been made about it.

I liked the underwhelming nature of the enemy Stands today. The fact that the older brother still gave the Out Stands have NO WEAKNESSES! speech seemed wonderfully self parodying when you consider that Thoth was the only Stand/Stand bearer who actually harmed them.  

Speaking of their Stands, my rough guess of who the nine Egyptian gods would be has already failed due to  Khnum being one of them (though I was right about Thoth). The reason I didnt guess at Khnum is quite simply that Id entirely forgotten about his existence. Well maybe not entirely, after reading about him a bit its possible that he might be That Egyptian god who did pottery stuff, I cant remember his name but remember reading a bit about him once, as the given name of this pottery performing god might imply, I had forgotten his name, but remembered reading about him once.  
God Khnum molded peoples bodies, so Stand Khnums ability to make a guys face moldable is pretty fitting.  
Thoth however I had not forgotten about, Ive got a small statue of him on the chest of drawers next to the chest of drawers next to my desk. He was the God of the Moon, Magic, Writing, Reading, and Wisdom. He was a Psychopomp, an Arbiter of Godly disputes, Scribe to the Gods, and was also the Moon (some of the other gods were also the moon, mythology is confusing). In his free time he convinced snakes to guards books in rivers.  
Considering how many things Thoth did, it would actually be quite difficult to make a Stand which didnt in some way relate to him. Stand Thoth relates to him in the sense that it imparts knowledge through writing, and those were his main two things. Also he could probably see into the future, that guy had more superpowers than Superman.

This episode was really fun, I wouldnt mind seeing more of the Oingo Boingo brothers (you cant fool me subtitler), maybe the Crusaders might actually notice them next time.

This is sure to create a bit of awkward confusion, but I have no doubt that as soon as Dio and the Crusaders realise what happened theyll have a bit of a laugh about it, and part as friends.

Maybe they'll go out and celebrate his birthday or something.
>> ARTICLE
> Did he? My subs didn't mention anything about that.

In mine that was the reason he gave for killing himself; it was the only way he could be sure of protecting Dio's secrets.

>> ARTICLE
Mine merely has him note that Hermit Purple can spy on them and so he won't say anything that could put DIO at a disadvantage. My (rudimentary) knowledge of Japanese isn't picking out anything about mind reading in his lines, it might just be an interesting interpretation in your subs.
>> ARTICLE
That's probably the case, if the actual lines had mentioned the mind reading then there's no way that it could have been ignored like this.
>> ARTICLE
He does say it in the anime. A bit after Jotaro asked him 'What the hell were you thinking?' after his suicidal attack, as soon as you hear him mention 'Joseph Joestar...', that's the line where he explains that Joseph can read minds with Hermit Purple.



Word for word: Joseph Joestar's Stand, Hermit Purple, can unfortunately detect what you are currently thinking after all...

Different translators might have changed the line to fit more with what the English audience is used to.

>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, that's amazing. I'm really surprised then, my mistake. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. Mine said that he killed himself because he knew they would try to interrogate him for information on his allies.
>> ARTICLE
Only 2 hours this time... Yay:

* Wow... never thought I'd see the day Khnum actually gets animated.

* Wait...... 2 Stand users.... At once!? This is simply unprecedented!!

* Of course they want Cola... Joseph has a history with Cola

* Let's change cafes.... Oh no...The other one is burning. Seriously, no one even did a double-take?

* Iggy saves the day 2.0

* That younger bro has a creepy laugh

* I am not entirely sure where the Khnum liking comes here. Khnum was considered one of the aspects of Ra. He was, at various times, considered God of rebirth, creation and the setting sun. Khnum was also regarded as the god of the Nile's source. I have to say, there are plenty of Egyptian deities that are more related to shapeshifting than Khnum is.

* Well that brings us to Thoth, possibly my second favorite Egyptian mythology character. Thoth had many roles attributed to him as a god, mostly relating to the arts of magic, writing, and science. Funnily enough, this stand doesn't seem to represent Thoth, but actually just the *book of Thoth*. The book of Thoth was said to contain a spell that allows the user to perceive the gods themselves. Most pieces of literature seem to regard that as a method of seeing the future. There's also Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck, which I'm personally unfamiliar with, but is said to predict the future. Araki apparently agrees.

* Hahah... He's masquerading as Jotaro. That premonition haha

* Lmao, Iggy is MVP so far. Single-handedly handling two Stand users

* Oh please... If they can't show Jotaro smoking one cigarette, with five we will only see a blacked out screen

* This gives me a new perspective on how much annoyance Jotaro receives per day.

* Aahahahaha.... He stepped on it. RIP

* Why exactly are they butchering/censoring the brothers' names?

* That was the most random stand battle ever haha

* That ED is the best thing I never even knew I wanted

* Ooooh, Anubis next ep hype!

Oh... TIL that's a band name... Didn't see musical reference guy's comment yet.

All of the enemy Stand users have had music references so far, and the music references are still going strong in the manga.

I can't wait to see how they will butcher my favorite Egyptian mythology figure... It will most probably be glorious!

Of course they don't change the names of the gods.

Who is that? Anubis?

Nah... That would be Horus... And Osiris to some extent

The Horus and Osiris fights are the ones where everything gets real. Real hype. Easily part of the Top 5 in Stardust Crusaders.

Well, Osiris was the beginning of my 10/10 for JoJo.

It's not "Osiris", it's "Slifer, the Executive Producer". Kappa

* In the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting game, Kakyoin's ending theme is [almost an exact copy of Stairway To Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRNSECTjGk). Take a listen! I won't count this towards the total, because it's not in the manga or the anime, but it's still interesting.

**Current Reference Counter: 49**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
I've got a small little fact to add to today's reference. No spoilers here, so don't freak out when you see the words "Part 7" coming up in a bit.

In Part 7, there is actually a character that you see on a leaderboard named Zenyatta Mondatta. I got a chuckle out of that when I saw it.
>> ARTICLE
[](#ohmygod "I should read more Part 7...")

HOW COULD YOU SAY PART 7 JUST LIKE THAT?????
>> ARTICLE
I knew a person in College that was able to do Jotaro's trick. Not with 5 cigars, sure, it was just one, but he was able to drink with the cigar in his mouth as well, without soaking it!

How do you even discover this trick?
>> ARTICLE
I never found out how he did that, actually. Maybe there is a whole way to do that. But was amazing, regardless.

Maybe he learned with his parents/uncle/other friends. I dunno. Putting the cigar in the mouth isn't a too obscure trick, it seems.

This manga is so ugly...also why are there heads so long?! Also not a fan of that kid's laugh :|

Iggy saving the day but wow that lady throwing plates..the dog abuse continues

Was really hoping they figured it out with all that glaring in the car, my fault for expecting more from PolPol lol

Fun little episode that had little to no impact on the Crusaers, I hope they make a return though!

I like to think they did figure it out, they just decided to screw with him.

Iggy's male. I mean, Iggy is even a guy's name.

But yeah, Iggy isn't dumb, just an asshole.

male anime characters being voiced by women is quite common

Hmm I think reddit may have eaten my comment so let's try and see if I can remember what I wrote.

Okay Oingo goes right ahead and hits the guy with a pan all casually.

Polnareff sets a cafe on fire with his cigarette. He's an idiot.

Iggy's appearance starts changing already. Thought it didn't happen until [Part 3 spoilers](/s "The Petshop fight.")

You know Oingo may have had a little better luck if he could completely disguise his whole body. Get Jotaro's clothes and actually get the hat shape right.

"Aw you failed."

"Jotaro! Are you alright? Oh my god!"

And here it second best ending people! Treasure it.

Wow, did it ever feel good to get to watch a brand new episode of Jojo for the first time in a while. After 2 months, I finally get jump on the hype train to all the way to part 4 after putting it on hold waiting for the re-watch to catch up. Reading everyone's reactions every day was great, and I hope to join in more going forward. And, while I may have spoiled some of the major plot points for the rest of this season for myself, I'm excited for all the crazy stuff in-between.

> And, while I may have spoiled some of the major plot points for the rest of this season for myself, I'm excited for all the crazy stuff in-between.

Don't worry too much about that. I spoiled so much stuff for myself in the manga, but I still loved seeing it for myself.

* Oingo Boingo brothers best siblings since Jonathan and Dio.

Yeah, I've shocked a couple of friends with that one. [Part 6](/n "I had never put together the moon connection, though.

I absolutely love the Oingo Boingo ED.

We've made it to Stardust Crusaders Season 2! One of the main reasons I like this season is because I feel like the fights provide a bigger sense of danger. Even just in this episode Kakyoin's eyes got cut!

I've got a few things to share with you again today, and it'll actually be more than one! Let's get right into it, shall we?

- The OP in this episode might have sounded familiar to you. It was performed by a group called JOSTARS, which is a pretty fitting name for this show. Actually, you've probably guessed this by now, but it was a group put together specifically for this season's OP. Now the reason why I say it might have sounded familiar to you, is because the 3 members of the group are TOMMY, Coda, and JIN who performed OPs 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

- Araki was a huge fan of Dragon Ball around the time this Part was being written, and was actually pretty good friends with Akira Toriyama, so it's no surprise to see some DB inspired character designs in his work. [Like this SPW guy.](http://i.imgur.com/7ewIB5l.jpg) I'm actually having difficulty finding a good picture to compare him to a DB character, but maybe somebody can help me out?

- The scene where [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/NPUR98O.jpg) was being taken is actually anime original. The reason it was added in was because in a later Part, [you actually see the same photo](http://i.imgur.com/OiH7oly.png) even though you never saw it being taken. I love this change by David. Whenever they need an extra minute or two to fill an episode, they add some relevant content.
>> ARTICLE
> you actually see the same photo even though you never saw it being taken.

You know the group looks kinda odd compared to what I've usually seen of manga pics. Polnareff and Avdol look younger somehow.
>> ARTICLE
It's because Araki's artstyle changes from part to part.
>> ARTICLE
Yep didn't realize that scene was from a different part.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a DB fan right here. I'll try to see if I can come up with a DB character that guy might resemble. You mean the guy who's face is more in the center of the screenshot, right?

I'm actually having a little trouble thinking of who might be the fit for that face, right now I'm thinking it might be Tienshinhan, Nappa, or Nam. 

Edit: Android 13 resembles him a little bit too, but he's a movie-original character, not one of Toriyama's. The movie-only version of General White kind of has a long chin like his too, but idk. Edit again: Ninja Murasaki also had a bit of a long face like that too, but I don't think that's any more likely
>> ARTICLE
Is that Photo part 4?
>> ARTICLE
[Answer](/n "It's from the very, very beginning of Part 5.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, Best OP is finally here and it rings in [the End of THE WORLD!](https://i.imgur.com/jQFQHPV.png) Surely a glorious event but one we'll have to keep looking forward to as this episode first [has to introduce a new character.](https://i.imgur.com/ECYU2pM.png) Alright Kakyoin, screw you. Not everyone knew there was a new character coming! And how do you even know what I just wrote?

I guess it really is the first episode of the season. How do I know? [Ask Expositaro](https://i.imgur.com/Rt7Zg8m.png) and [he'll probably explain it to you in great detail.](https://i.imgur.com/XiZLvnJ.png)

[Look at them friendly faces.](https://i.imgur.com/l8x7h02.png) [These are faces that just scream "ally".](https://i.imgur.com/5joCx6U.png) It's a good thing these nice and friendly people [didn't join the crusaders](https://i.imgur.com/FUEHBqY.png), else they [would have been](https://i.imgur.com/iwWnXTp.png) in [great danger](https://i.imgur.com/SLhZHZL.png). I'm joking of course but seriously, did any of you first-timers initially think that these pilots must be the enemy, or perhaps controlled/created by an enemy stand? I sure did when I watched this the first time.

Introducing! [Iggy, whose face suggests The Terror.](https://i.imgur.com/2gbpf0q.png) And our newcomer immediately goes for [Polnareff's weak spot!](https://i.imgur.com/z7CHeY4.png) Avdol was right, our now-slightly-less-silver-haired crusader could never win against [this beast of nightmares.](https://i.imgur.com/WBP0K1Z.png)  
Just kidding of course, Iggy's actual stand is [The Fool](https://i.imgur.com/PT60Oiy.png)! A sand stand, coincidentally perfect for the setting of this season. Unfortunately Avdol never explains why a dog has a stand that looks very Native American inspired so perhaps our rewatch stand analysis guy can do that instead.

[The face of defeat.](https://i.imgur.com/Bf2lSqM.png) [Joseph got a new hand](https://i.imgur.com/tdB13cw.png), not that it'll be of any use. How often has that thing been destroyed again? [And here's the famous photograph](https://i.imgur.com/xePzC8D.png), which also doubles as a great wallpaper ~~and I suspect will be the image of the day.~~ you have failed me OP!

[A safe trip?](https://i.imgur.com/13R1ja3.png) [Not in this show!](https://i.imgur.com/9wahyxb.png) [Never!](https://i.imgur.com/uZRcLRq.png)

[Who could it be? I dunno Avdol](https://i.imgur.com/FOJLm1j.png), perhaps the guy whose name and stand are in the title of the episode? [No? Okay.](https://i.imgur.com/fhewOfk.png)

[It attacks based on sound?](https://i.imgur.com/54XGa8r.png) Crap! That's like the second most useful technique in the series (the most useful being one that attacks based on posing). They're screwed!

[Don't you think you're overthinking this a bit, Stick?](https://i.imgur.com/GS3LLXi.png) How would he know you're "only" four kilometers away? More specifically, why would you think that?

The ED is a bit boring for now but don't worry, it'll get better. That said, who is that [handsome hatless man](https://i.imgur.com/XGexpZz.png) in the ED? I'm pretty sure they never included that character in the series. ^^^^/s
>> ARTICLE
> That said, who is that handsome hatless man in the ED?

His name is Polnareff
>> ARTICLE
The OP is great because it feels like a woven story unto itself. Kind of like the show itself being put in a song form. Starts off sounding mysterious and ends in a bang.

The ED is a nice juxtaposition from all the insanity that happens in an episode and a nice, relaxing bookend.

Yeah, as for suspicious looking characters, the helicopter crew really did seem suspicious. But it seems Araki keeps making everyday civilians look goofy or menacing to throw the readers up for a loop. It's nice the anime doesn't skip a beat there.

As for Iggy and his Stand looking Native American, it could be because [spoiler](/s 'Iggy is from New York City and maybe he has picked up a stand power in Manhattan, which used to belong to a Native American tribe')
>> ARTICLE
> which also doubles as a great wallpaper ~~and I suspect will be the image of the day.~~ you have failed me OP!

It's not the screenshot of the day because I wanted to talk about it with more detail.

>> ARTICLE
> How do I know? Ask Expositaro  and he'll probably explain it to you in great detail. 

For some reason this is precise adaptation of manga, even though the manga is not divided in seasons like anime. The author might think it was good to re-introduce the situation to readers on arriving on Egypt, but the line is awkward in manga too.

Wow starting day 49 of watching JoJo. Somehow I can't remember a time when I wasn't watching JoJo and it's weird to think that this is the last batch before new JoJo! 

> It should be about time.

YES IT SHOULD! LETS DO IT!

Is this OP straight up Unlimited Blade Works? Right off the bat I'm not a fan of the song at all but the visuals are pretty cool. 

> It's a helicopter.

> You don't have to state the obvious.

Sass is back in full force! 

A helper? Who the hell is this? I'm not ready for a new JoJo crew member. I bet its a dog or something.

> What's this stick stuff?

Pls Pol its too early in the episode for this shit. 

Oh wow it really is a dog. It's probably going to die in a typical JoJo fashion. 

This dog sucks. Poor Pol. Immediately defeated. 

Doge- 1. Pol-0.

> Sorry Pol but I'm not about to get my hair ripped out, too.

Kakyoin sass is best sass. 

This dog seriously sucks. Worst new addition to the team. 

Awww a cute picture to remember the fam with....before the dog gets Pol

Oh shit there's a 2 week time limit! 

> 9 men and women

The new villains for this season! 

> It would appear he's trying to stop us from reaching Cairo.

Yes that was exactly what happened for the past 24 episodes. 

Doge picking up on something? Might be useful after all. 

Blind Stand user? 

Why is Joseph driving? They are going to crash. 

Oh shit RIP Speedchoptor.

Weirdest way to die, choking on water. 

OH SHIT THE WATER IS GOING TO ATTACK! SHIT! 

Oh no the water guy! 

# HE SLASHED KAKYOIN! PLEASE BE OK! 

Kakyoin might be blind but this dog is just straight up chilling.

Everyone is falling from the car but Jotaro is hanging on looking cool af.

Shit is getting messed up.

> Is this OP straight up Unlimited Blade Works? Right off the bat I'm not a fan of the song at all but the visuals are pretty cool.

I'm with you. This is my least favorite OP by a good margin (the ORA ORAs at the end are DUMB. I said it. Fight me.) and I don't understand why it's so popular.

This is how JoJo openings work. You're like ehhh the last one was better, then before you know it you're listening to the current one on repeat.

Yeah especially since this season is more memorable and ever week it hyped me up. Especially those last few episodes.

Welcome to Iggy's involuntary desert road trip. Our first Stand user from Egypt has appeared and he's a blind man using sonar and radar with his cane. The idea of having something as basic and necessary for life like water being a deadly weapon that drowns people in the middle of the desert is pretty terrifying. Kakyoin's eyes got sliced and I feel like Polnareff shares this episode overall with Iggy, in part because he gets in a pretty *hairy* fight with him.

My first time watching this I needed some getting used to the new OP, but later I could appreciate how this made the entire season feel like the final fight.

>> ARTICLE
Iggy taking the early lead. He'll be passing Avdol in no time!
>> ARTICLE
Help I can't stop listening to the new OP on loop.
>> ARTICLE
Good, embrace the hype.
>> ARTICLE
I'm doing all I can to stop myself from yelling ORA ORA ORA along with the song.
>> ARTICLE
Why stop yourself? I yell it every time.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite crusader is now here! Iggy!

The Fool would be probably broken if Iggy wasn't just a tiny dog!

Now that we saw all the Tarot Cards bar The World, which one you guys have as favorite?
>> ARTICLE
Death 13. That design was fucking sick. Thought the juxtaposition of it's user being a baby was weird.
>> ARTICLE
I really like Hanged Man. The design is [sick](http://biginjap.com/39650-thickbox_default/jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-part-3-statue-legend-hanged-man-special-color.jpg), it has a cool power, and the fight is probably my favorite of S1.
>> ARTICLE
Justice. Damn cool design and powers.
>> ARTICLE
> Now that we saw all the Tarot Cards bar The World, which one you guys have as favorite?

I've always liked the gun Stands, with [Part 5](/n "Sex Pistols") being my favorite in the series, so I've gotta go with Emperor.
>> ARTICLE
You know this season is going to be hype since the OP even has ORA ORAs in it

The car lasted longer than I thought

And that's why I'm a cat person, that dog is just ugly and gross

Dog threatening the Alpha of the pack, makes sense.

So it feels like nothing has changed from the last season except now there's more episodic bad guys and a dog but I'll believe in everyone saying it gets better.

>> ARTICLE
It's still episodic, but the quality increases, if that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Plus we get the climax and the adventure comes to an end. 
>> ARTICLE
The Stands here are more "tactical" than doing direct combat, most of their powers are only functional in specific cases and they almost never engage in combat until the Crusaders beats the user itself

IMO it also takes a more comical turn because it is the type of comedy were the villain stalks and try to kill the MC only to fail in a ridiculous way, kinda like The Coyote and the Roadrunner from the Looney Tunes
>> ARTICLE
I'm a dog person but Iggy is a really weirdly behaving one. Like, more like a mutant dog than any dog I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
He looks pretty cute when he's just by himself not doing much but when he start opening his mouth it all goes downhill :/
>> ARTICLE
His design changes a bit as the show goes on and he looks much better. He won't always be ugly! 
>> ARTICLE
Good to know!
>> ARTICLE
I actually like his earlier design because it looks more like a real Boston terrier.  The later design just looks weird like Araki grafted a human face onto a dog.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I like both but I think the most iconic Iggy moments would have been really interesting with this design.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, Part 3 really is just a 48 episode show. The split in seasons is only because of how anime works with all the split cours and breaks nowadays. I wouldn't really expect a sudden drastic change here... more like continuous gradual improvement.
>> ARTICLE
> like continuous gradual improvement.

I'll take it. Makes the last season feel like filler a bit though.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the stands give off a bigger sense of danger. Not sure if you noticed but Kaykoin got rekt. 
>> ARTICLE
> Not sure if you noticed but Kaykoin got rekt.

Well we'll see how his eyes fare after it settles down!
>> ARTICLE
I like this episode a lot, some people might not like Iggy, but I love him! I love doggos, especially Iggy because he's a SUPER ZANY pugger doggo with a sandy stando

Iggy is a crazy smart little pupper who likes caffeines and the fartings, and he knows how to get away from other evil guy's standos, there's no stopping this zany doggo.

But we already had BLOODY STREAM...
>> ARTICLE
Kek. Bloody Stream is fabulous but end of the world is much more hype.
>> ARTICLE
I think the hype builds as you get further into the season. I wouldn't say that it starts hyped.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I saw the new OP for SC season 2 I was so disappointed. I think because there was less cool animation. But as you go on and start noticing all the references to the events in the show, and realize all 3 past singers are doing this OP together...something just clicked and now it's pretty much tied with Bloody Stream for my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
The SFX version puts it above Bloody Stream for me.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely this is my 3rd rewatch so I'm definitely hyped.
>> ARTICLE
I love that photo.

Another small detail I like is seeing Jotaro smile at his comrades in arms showing he enjoys/cares about them. Just something I think was quite prevalent this episode. 

As for the new Stardust crusader [being a dog...well...](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/48paig/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d0lheu3)
>> ARTICLE
> Another small detail I like is seeing Jotaro smile at his comrades in arms showing he enjoys/cares about them. Just something I think was quite prevalent this episode.

He's come so far from not giving a shit about anyone to taking the heat off one of his fallen comrades and saving his life! 
>> ARTICLE
It's a good point about the dogs, but have any of the other dogs had Stands? This one can definitely defend itself.
>> ARTICLE
And now it's time for my second favorite Opening: Sono Chi no Kioku!

You know I always thought the Speedwagon guys looked suspicious but now I figure they're just happy to get away from Iggy.

I love that The Fool's hind legs are wheels. In fact the entire stand seems to be a fusion of a dog and a car.

Outside of Dio's stand there are no more tarot cards left! Will these new stand users have something else? Agh I can't remember.

I love the idea of a blind stand user. Quite unique.

Oop the Speedwagon guys are dead. This must be the work of an enemy stand!

Welp rip Kakyoin's eyes.
>> ARTICLE
> Will these new stand users have something else? Agh I can't remember.

Yeah, they have [](/s "Egyptian Gods.")
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes that's right. I completely forgot about that. Man it's only been about a year since this aired and yet I've forgotten so much.

This is why rewatches are important!
>> ARTICLE
**Yare yare daze**

Holy shit new op is so gooooood!I'm even more hyped for the added sfx at the end now.Anyways we get a new dog that I hope it wont be just another kill count for Dio,remember that he hates dogs?This season will be a pain in the ass because it's gonna be two parted fights every time :/ .I'm posting like 7 hours late to the thread because my university classes and tutorials started and I'm like 16 hours at the uni, I barely find an hour to watch JoJo.See you all on the tomorrow's thread where I will be late again ***menacing***
>> ARTICLE
> remember that he hates dogs?

That's the plan! They'll wait for DIO to lose his temper when he sees the dog and to let his guard down. ^^/s

* In the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting game, Kakyoin's ending theme is [almost an exact copy of Stairway To Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRNSECTjGk). Take a listen! I won't count this towards the total, because it's not in the manga or the anime, but it's still interesting.

**Current Reference Counter: 48**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
Not to be too nit-picky, but I think Iggy is a guy.

Yeah, sure... what's gonna be next, calling best grill Speedwagon a guy as well?

Yay more Jojo's! I finished the first season of Stardust Crusaders a few months ago, so I've been waiting for the rewatch to get to this point. It is good to be back. I missed Joseph's yelling. Also end of the world is best OP.

New season, new OP, and new character. Fun fun fun.

Sorry, we have to wait until Part 8 for Fun Fun Fun.
>> ARTICLE
So I have one comment for the first part of this episode. Why are all of the Animal stands super OP. Wu-Tang has a boat that he can freely control along with being very smart for an orangutang , Iggy has a stand made of sand so it can't be hit [Later Jojo](/n "Petshop's Horus is a killing machine and can destroy cars on a whim, Ratt and Bug-bitten can turn people into meat cubes, Mister President is the second best defensive stand and then whatever the fuck Foo Fighters is.") Is it just to offset the fact that they are animals and can't pose?
>> ARTICLE
Can we count [Steel Ball Run](/n "Magent Magent and Funny Valentine as better than Coco Jumbo's power. Because one physically cannot die while crouching and the other causes other people to die when he is hit.")
>> ARTICLE
[SBR](/n "I wouldn't call D4C a defensive stand, I'd say it has defensive capabilities. Otherwise King Crimson would be above Mr. President in defence due to perfect pre-cog or Za Warudo due to time stop. I did forget about 20th century boy however that also has issues, as shown in his defeat.")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 7](/n "I am more referring to D4C Love Train specifically as a defensive stand. Seeing as Funny can't be harmed while in it and it reflects any misfortune off of him and to others around him. He was planning on using it to defend an entire country at the point that he acquired it. Base D4C is a mostly offensive and evasive stand though, so that would be a fair judgement to not count him on the list. And 20th Century Boy is an incredible defensive stand, you just need to not get into a situation where you would die if you had to do anything.")
>> ARTICLE
In balance terms, it's just because being an animal is already a drawback, it's harder to be inconspicuous and you can't interact with other stand-users easily or use weapons. Bigger drawbacks = bigger bonuses, RPG 101.

In-story, I would imagine that being more instinctive and unclouded by doubts/overthinking/worries makes a Stand stronger, as its user is more in-touch with their own physical and mental self instead of being bogged down in philosophy and strategy. Consider: humans need tons of training to become effective hand-to-hand fighters, but animals are often born into the skill through instinct and genetics alone. Of course, being unable to strategize effectively is another huge drawback in JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
[Part 6](/n "Who said FF can't pose?")
>> ARTICLE
Wu-Tang Forever was busting out some sick poses too now that I think about it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm finally here... With the motto of 'Better super late than never':

* I love the new OP. It's hype incarnate, has a lot of callbacks to Sono chi no Sadame, *and* it has free 'Ora's.

* When will they stop being surprised at Joseph's Unlimited Funds Works?

* Disclaimer: I don't like Iggy much either.

* His stand looks very cool though.

* Oh hey... New enemy Stand right off the bat

* And he's blind.... interesting

* Poor Speedwagon foundation employees. Their mere existence is a death flag

* Ooooh, Water stand!

* So... A stealth stand operating from a large distance...That actually makes sense.

* Oho... It goes after sounds

* And now you really can't get anywhere...not without moving

* Oh, it went after the car. Haha.

* I never thought I'd say this, but my hopes are hanging on a dog.........In Jojo.......

* That's a fairly quiet ending theme

* Theory time: Since we exhausted Tarot cards, I think the next Stand theme will be Egyptian mythology: Gods and mythical beasts and the like.

OP is hype, those lyrics though. The whole OP has ton of spoilers if you know what to look for. Damn is it hype, even if some of you don't like it it will grow on you.

I always heard that while watching, but I never focused too much on it.

Once we get to the end, I've got a video to link that'll point out all the neat little secrets, so that should be fun.
>> ARTICLE
>if you know what to look for.

That's precisely it. This opening is chock-full of spoilers, but they're so subtle you *have* to already know the spoilers in order to notice what's being spoiled. It's a spoilerific spoiler-free opening. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, pretty much every Jojo OP is like that, specially Bloody Stream. That's why I like them so much.
>> ARTICLE
The other OPs lack the subtlety I mentioned... especially Bloody Stream. 
>> ARTICLE
You know, now that I realize the manga's arc happened in the early/mid 90s, I kind of wonder if this episode took hints from Tremors with the sound-based enemy attacks in the desert. Loved the sensation of fear the characters had in interacting with the sand and I immediately remembered Tremors and it had the same premise.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible. This chapter would have come out around the same time as the movie.
>> ARTICLE
i hope people who went silent or even dropped during the first Stardust Crusaders part return, we are getting less people most of the comments are just replies from the people still loyal to the rewatch...
>> ARTICLE
Im not commenting as much as I used to, but Im still watching.
>> ARTICLE
Wait until we reach the last 10 episodes. 

;)
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much what happened during airing. People complaining less comments and then bam.
>> ARTICLE
Well, so the last Crusader comes to our screen. I gotta say I never liked Iggy that much during my first time watching until those last episodes. You end up loving that golden eared mutt (Seriously, the fact that its fucking inner ears are golden always bothered me). A fun fact that might have already been mentioned countless times (it sucks to live in Europe and have all the americans comment 13 hours before I can even watch the episode O.o) is that during the previous OP you could see 5 stars and then a sixth one approaching from far away. When you listen to the OP with the SFx you can hear a dog howling, and that's Iggy for you.

Appart from that, I'll have to mention how sick the scene where the pilot gets killed is when watched uncensored and how cool the change in the color scheme was during this episode. I love reddish-purpleish tones a lot! 
>> ARTICLE
Well this is just wonderful. I knew that my Tarot knowledge was going to stop being relevant at some point due to running out of Tarot stands, what I didn't realise is the the Stands from then on were going to be named after Egyptian Gods (I'm assuming that's the new standard rather than just this episode). Fortunately for me, Egyptian Mythology was one of my passions when I was younger, and I still have a decent amount of knowledge about it.

Seeing as we're on the topic, let's get into it. Firstly the new Tarot stand which has been introduced, Fool's Orange. As the dog seems to be joining the Crusaders I imagine that we'll find out more about it, and so the link to the card will grow, but right now there is one incredibly strong link. In the symbolism of the Fool card, there is usually a small dog at the Fool's heels, the dog is just such a dog.  
Apart from that I think it's too early days to be drawing many more connections, but I can tell you something which really surprised me, and that's that Fool's Orange doesn't have an A in Growth Potential. The whole point of The Fool is that he's starting out on the journey, and whilst he may be an idiot he's got a lot of potential to grow.

Now, let's look at Geb. As the Egyptian Gods aren't archetypes the links will probably be much more circumstantial. Also there's a lot more to know about Egyptian Mythology than there is with the Tarot, so expect to see more gaps in my knowledge.  
Also I'm going to get one thing out of the way right now. Egyptian Mythology is a mess. This is due to the fact that the same mythology was used by several tribes who split and reunited over many years. Small changes had the chance to turn into big ones, and when tribes reformed the disparate elements were often smushed together. If you want a good example of what I mean look at Thoth's somewhat inconsistent parentage.  
Anyway, Geb was the Egyptian God of the Earth, and Brother-Husband to Nut the Goddess of the Sky. The two were the children of Ra (or Amon, or Amon-Ra) who fell in love. They became inseperable due to their love, but as they were the Sky and the Earth, this meant that there was no room for the Sun (Ra), so he got super pissed with them, and forbade Nut from giving birth to her incestuous babies in any month of the Sun. Thankfully Thoth saved the day by doing something with the Moon. It's been a long time and my memories are hazy.  
The link here seems to mostly be that Stand Geb, as a being of water moving through the earth, represents the two major building blocks of the Earth, which God Geb represents.

I really liked the introduction of the Stand User. The way that he missed the fly with his fingers, but hit it with the rock gave a nice sense that he's incredibly skilled but not infallible.  
The whole thing reminds me of Earthbender from Avatar, for obvious reasons. Obviously the Stand User came first, but I'd be interested to know the extent to which "Blind person who sees through vibrations" was a common trope when the character was made.

Anyway, I'm looking forwards to seeing how this season unfolds. I like that it's setting out the number of Stand Bearers in advance, it gives a nice sense of progress.
>> ARTICLE
> If you want a good example of what I mean look at Thoth's somewhat inconsistent parentage.

He's got like 5 parents including himself. That's just confusing.

Worst Jojo character is here. :(

Worst JoJo character? In the anime, maybe.

Still don't see how he's the worst when we have all those villains.
>> ARTICLE
Been lurking, but since the Egypt arc is so good, I'll participate more, as I have more to say. 
From here on (I think) every stand encounter is a two-parter, And the fights are much more creative and memorable.   

on this episode we meet iggy, who seems like such an asshole, I also thought it was kind of weird that a dog would have a stand when I first watched part three (the old ovas), But then I remembered the orangutan.

Yeah, when ever they drop Part 3 or just stop watching it. It's mostly from people on season 1. I've seen a lot of people say they like hamon more. Its crazy especially when you get to this last season. Part 3 finale made it one of my favorite battle shounens of all time. I have never been so hype for an episode every week. Stands are limitless, hamon would have been boring. Could you imagine if hamon replaced Stands in Part 3?
>> ARTICLE
I think hamon is cool because the way it was utilized by Jonathan and Joseph was cool but that's more of them being smart and tactical and less of hamon being great on its own. It's still cool but stands are much more creative. 
>> ARTICLE
Hamon is all nice and dandy, but would get stale for a while, since, believe or not, Hamon follow rules, despise being capable of "do anything".

Things that Stands do aren't not even close to possible with Hamon, or Vampiric Powers.

Stands brings a lot of variety in the table. I love Part 2, is one of my top 3 favorite parts along with Part 4 and Part 7, but I understand that Hamon is very limited.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know, I used to miss hamon at first but I got used to Stands and the lat few episodes of Part 3 just blew me away with how crazy they are.
>> ARTICLE
Stands get progressively crazier. Part 5 has a stand that most people still don't understand.

Hey, I get it now!

I think!

Maybe!

> Wait does Jotaro's hat have hair on it?

The shot of him putting his hat back on, and his natural hair merging with the hat hair is strangely disconcerting.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow the most bizarre part of JoJo is his hat hair situation.
>> ARTICLE
[Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/8uaBBRb.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I'm convinced some loser pranked Jotaro at some point and put glue in his hat. Jotaro put it on without noticing and it dried. The next time he took off his hat hair came with it. That's why his hat looks like that.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's supposed to be torn oddly, like the back is torn out so the back of his head is hair and the tuft on the hat is fabric but Araki just said "fuck it" and fused them.
>> ARTICLE
Probably exactly that but damn if it doesn't look like a hat shaped metroid sitting on Jotaro's head.
>> ARTICLE
It's like the hat is molded from his hair!

Maybe the hat stays too much on Jotaro's head that it developed a symbiote relationship with his body already.

I loved the end of the D'Arby fight. One of my favorite things about JoJo is how I can never seem to figure out how what the protagonists are planning even though it seems so simple after it is revealed.

There's a scene later in the manga that further solidifies that as a JoJo reference. It has to do with using someone's sweat to tell if they're a liar.

Jotaro's video game adventures continue... Which is kinda a shame. I wanted to see Joseph play some.

* He can see their soul? huh... Well, that's not overpowered. It's actually fairly balanced except it's user is skilled with it. IMO that's how all stand user should've been

* I'm getting increasingly suspicious of the OP showing Jotaro's Star Platinum destroying a mirror. Seems like a reference I'm not getting

* He managed to trick him. Based Jotaro

* Boom! He did it again. And Telence is sweating buckets

* Oh damn! Joseph was controlling the options. Haha

* " Are you going to do the 'Ora Ora' thing?" Hahahahha, Telence visualizing his own beatdown

* Are we out of Stand users?

* Nooooope... Now we have freaking *Vanilla Ice*

* WTF?? I know DIO needs blood, but you don't have to cut off your friggin head

* That stand looks seriously scary. And it can like...Teleport? Or does it go invisible? It's probably gonna be OP as hell considering it's the last hurdle.

* Vanilla Ice reminds me a lot of the Pillarmen

* Lol... Since when did Avdol have detection abilities?

* Oh...They defeated an illusion stand user just like that. Nice!

* HOLY SHIT!! THEY JUST KILLED OFF AVDOL....AGAIN.....

* Yep...OP as expected. And I'm not exactly ecstatic that it will be a Polnareff battle. Still hopeful the rest of the gang shows up because I'm pretty sure he needs the help. Plus, I'm sensing some deathflags from Iggy.

Btw, are you planning an end of rewatch discussion or do we just morph the last episode thread into a pseudo-series discussion?

I'm trying to find a proper place to guilt you and Amethyst into a rewatch. :D

Oh dang, so that explains why he was asking a bunch of questions during the game. 

Maybe I just didn't notice this before, but I saw the outline of Dio near the end of the OP. Nice that they're adding in more little touches. 

YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!

Oh shit, D'Arby got rused. 

Jotaro the cheater, how terrible. But that explains how he could win when he's never played video games before. 

D'Arby is sweating like crazy, damn. 

Just use your gaming skills D'Arby. Holy shit. You don't need your stand powers to beat these casuals. 

Seems like the D'Arby family has a secret power to age instantly when they lose. 

Actually, that explains everything. Gaming master Joseph was the one who won, not the casual Jotaro. 

NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! Are you gonna do the ora ora thing? YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! What a great line.

RIP D'Arby younger. Should've just relyed on pure gaming skill instead of stand shit. 

Says Vanilla Ice, subs are Cool Ice. Copyright issues, y...

Holy shit, did he just kill himself just for Dio? That's hardcore. 

What. The. Fuck. That stand just fucking ate itself. And it ruined the door. That's gonna bring down the property value. Nice going _Cool Ice_.

Oh shit, dropping those death flags. 

Whelp, that was a super quick battle. 

RIP Kenny G. Glad Araki likes smooth jazz. 

AVDOL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Avdol :(
>> ARTICLE
> What. The. Fuck. That stand just fucking ate itself. And it ruined the door. That's gonna bring down the property value. Nice going Cool Ice.

I love DIO's reaction to that, too. Like, I feel like they've been in multiple bases, Ice just keeps on blasting through DIO's walls and he never gets around to directly telling Ice to knock it off.
>> ARTICLE
What I really like about this episode is that Jotaro is not some poker-faced teenager only. He actually is a pretty good thinker behind that cold stone face.

I like how he didn't flinch when getting help from his grandfather too. Shows a level of camaraderie there that people don't expect from such a serious kid and a goofy old man. 

The way Dio is starting to more openly go after the Jojo team is pretty scary too, as Avdol looks to be the first prey. Even when Dio is losing his underlings quite fast, the way he is so willful in his attacks is unnerving. Like he knows he is still way too powerful compared to the Jojo group.
>> ARTICLE

This episode we see Jotaro mentally breaking another D'arby with one of the funniest things this season. (YES YES YES YES)
And as we still carry an idiotic grin from that, the show gives us the middle finger and unceremoniusly kills off Abdul (again).

Hell I'd say people would probably even be still laughing from Iggy one shotting Kenny G. Only like a minute or two apart.

Jojo looks so much cuter with his hat off

Arghh he beat another person by just scaring them

Are you going to do the Ora Ora thing hahaha that was a funny moment

Vanilla Ice? He doesn't even look like a ninja...

Just a normal self decapitation...nothing to see here

[What I thought of when his stand ate him](https://youtu.be/J_jOd9ohHGE)

Iggy finding that guy in  the wall was pretty great.

No don't kill Avdol again :(

>> ARTICLE
>Arghh he beat another person by just scaring them

It's been awhile since I watched this fight but that's... not... what... happens? I seem to remember that he tricks D'Arby the younger into thinking he's the one playing and he does use his demeanor to trick him into focusing solely on him... but that's so Joseph can play the game instead. So it's not really, "Jotaro's self-confidence wins the day." It played into his victory, but there was also Joseph's cooperation and a keen strategy.
>> ARTICLE
That's how he overcomes his "mind reading" but D'Arby just gives up, you would think with that much practice in the game he'd still be okay enough at it to play it out without relying on his stand.
>> ARTICLE
When you rely on something to win and you suddenly lose it, it'll mess with you big time even if you have the skill to actually win.
>> ARTICLE
Think he'd have enough confidence in his skills considering he was playing someone who had never played before.
>> ARTICLE
Joseph beat him, so I'm cool with it.
>> ARTICLE
> Jojo looks so much cuter with his hat off

I thought so too! He needs to rock that look more often!

[](#rerorero)

Aye. Jotaro is quite the hunk without his hat (or with). [It's incredible how awesomely windswept his hair looks. ](http://thatwritingthing.com/wp-content/uploads/scene31441.jpg)


>> ARTICLE
The lack of hat hair must've been the works of a stand

Now I'm imagining SP quickly ruffles his hair whenever he's taking hat off
>> ARTICLE
Just like [part 4](/n "Crazy Diamond fixes Josuke's pompadour") 
>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/n "Crazy Diamond can't fix Josuke, though. That includes the pompadour, doesn't it?")
>> ARTICLE
Shhhhhhhhh.

[Part 4](/n "It's actually an interesting question since hair is just dead cells so it might no be counted as "part of him". Same thing with clothing, do you think Crazy Diamond could heal Josuke's clothes if they're just in the closet but not if he's wearing them. Or if Josuke got a prosthetic limb could he heal that or would it count as part of him? It kind of just seems like a matter of interpretation.")
>> ARTICLE
It's worth noting that [Part 4](/n "Crazy Diamond works on Josuke's blood when he bleeds on things, but only after the blood's dried and it only recombines with the other bled blood. It seems like if it's not actually in/on him, it doesn't count as him.")
>> ARTICLE
You think he'd have massive hat hair :p
>> ARTICLE
>No don't kill Avdol again :(

Don't worry, I'm sure the void only grazed his head!
>> ARTICLE
oooo I like this new stand. And he's got the seiyuu to back it up his evilness.

I hope Abdul ain't dead, want more time for him to shine. 
>> ARTICLE
When in doubt, always blame Tokiomi
>> ARTICLE
I hope some of the later JoJo parts have Norio Wakamoto (I know he did Hol Horse in the 2000 version) and Jouji Nakata be the main antagonists or something. They're like the perfect villain voices. 
>> ARTICLE
Although not guaranteed, Nakata does voice a major villain in EoH. I hope they won't change the cast when we get to that part.

Great now you spoiled when he appears :<

Kind of unavoidable if I wanted to talk about him at all...

You can just say that he appears in later parts instead of specify which one

That's too ambiguous. Someone who's read only Part 5 might think that it's okay for him to see. 
>> ARTICLE
[Stone ocean spoilers](/n "Gay priest will be arriving shortly")
>> ARTICLE
Do you liked the conclusion of the Young D'Arby fight?
>> ARTICLE
Eh not really. Still unsatisfied with the entire fight tbh. I liked the Old Barbie fight better overall and this felt like a weaker version of it.  
>> ARTICLE
Joseph and Jotaro really trolled Terence with this cheating.

"Dogeeee!" 

And Terence gets rekt.

Then we move over to Avdol, Polnareff and Iggy.

I like how Dio actually momentarily forgets Avdol and Polnareff's names. Being a vampire does not seem to give you a perfect memory.

Using his stand, Vanilla Ice slices off his own head! 

His own stand eats him! Then, in order to teleport, it eats itself! Truly a bizarre adventure we have here!

But then he makes a hole in the wall, much to Dio's displeasure.

I know it was for the sake of the show but if Avdol had indeed set the mansion a flame that would've actually been bad for Dio. It's still day outside. If the whole place burned to the ground he may have been exposed to sunlight. He does mention though that it actually would've been bad for himself, Iggy and Polnareff though.

Thanks to Iggy, Kenny G has retired without even a fight.

"After you see this writing and turn around, you will die."

"I'm going to poke my head out of my stand's mouth and look silly as fuck."

Alright guys all aboard the feels train. Avdol is actually dead this time. I heard the reason Avdol came back in season 1 is because fans told Araki they wanted Avdol back so Araki set up that plan where Avdol faked his death and was simply injured.

Araki was kind to the fans here. But it was too good to be true and so the Ageless Mangaka giveth and the Ageless Mangaka taketh away. Avdol is dead again. What say you, first time watchers?
>> ARTICLE
Managed to get it up on time for the 2nd day, too! I'm pretty impressed with myself. Probably won't be answering any comments until pretty late again today. Lots to do and lots of JoJo cosplayers to take pictures of.

With Erased ending yesterday I'm still sad and we lose Avdol for real now,just fuck me up fam.Polnareff/Iggy cmon,make some Vanilla Icecream out of him
>> ARTICLE
You could say that Avdol got...

*ERASED*
>> ARTICLE
YES! We've finally made it to VANILLA ICE! Something that I've wanted to talk about forever. I HATE VANILLA ICE fuck this vampire worshipping scum. That being said, I hate him as a person, but as a villain, I think me hating him so much is a testament to how well he fills his role. His devotion to the worst man in world (as stated by Speedwagon, so that is fact, DIO is the worst man in the world) is impressive, and his stand is nothing to toy with. if there's anything I can't dislike about Vanilla Ice is that his quick killing of Avdol just goes to prove that he's the one who really earns with his power to be by DIO's side, more than any of the other enemy stand users. Everyone else who bragged their butts off to the crusaders and thought they were invincible have very little if anything on what Vanilla Ice can do with Cream. Like you have Dan of Steel feeling all smug about what he can do with The Lovers and VI just thinks "I can just eat you", he sees what Yellow Temperance to can do, "I can just him," he sees Judgement's corpse army and fog "I can just eat her." The more simple a stand is, the more terrifying it is, as they said.  

But even more importantly than any of that: MAH ZANY PUGGO DOGGO IGGY GOT ONE MORE KILL FOR THE GOOD GUY! Yeah! Go Iggy! Zany mutts forever!

Due to a recent rule revision [(seen here)](https://redd.it/4781vp) all spoilers must include the title of the source being spoiled in the description of the spoiler tag.

When spoiling something from a non-anime source the red /n spoiler tag must be used in place of the standard /s spoiler tag. Example: \[KonoSuba LN 5](/n "is an LN"), which appears as [KonoSuba LN 5](/n "is an LN")

That was a satisfying end to this fight. It makes sense that the way Jr Darby would be beaten would be by a fairly obvious cheat which Mr Darby would never have fallen for. The thing is that it wasn't *really* even a cheat, it was just someone else playing. it didn't make the game any easier, in fact it was harder for JoJo because he had to pretend he wasn't playing. The only reason their cheat worked was that Jr Darby was relying on his powers rather than his skill.

Up until the reveal I thought that it was going a different way, and I'm going to briefly tell an anecdote to set the stage.  
When I was in Uni I knew a guy who was a professional poker player. Most people would play against him at some time or another (not for money, just with chips) just to have a go; and he always won. I was one of the later ones to play against him, and he said it was one of the most frustrating matches that he played. Don't get me wrong, he was still winning, but he just couldn't read me. With everyone else he'd been really good at calling bluffs and all that, but he couldn't even guess at how good my hands were. After about 10 minutes he turned to me and said "You don't know how to play poker do you?", and I said "No, not really." He couldn't tell how good my hands were because I couldn't.  
I thought that a similar thing was going on here. It took JoJoJo a while to figure out how to bat (though looking back it might just have been that JoJo took control), so this being JoJoJo's first time bowling it might make sense that he wouldn't know how to do that. He might have been intending to do the pitch he described every time, but incapable of actually pulling it off. 

Anyway, then we had the non-fight against the illusionist. I guess we'll never get to know which God his stand was named after (unless the nine Gods have already been used, which would be really weird). It was satisfyingly brief, though Dadvol's sudden detector flame could have been really useful at some earlier points in the show.

Then finally we have Vanilla Ice. That's right subs, you still can't fool me. You may be saying "Cool Ice", but I can hear what he's really called. This guy goes all out, he cut his head off because Dio wanted some blood. You can give some blood without killing yourself guy. His power also seems to be fittingly all out. His Stand eats him and then eats itself. That's pretty out there.  
On a side note, I loved how unimpressed Dio was with Vanilla Ice damaging his door.

Anyway, looking forwards to more of Vanilla Ice, and to seeing if Dadvol's actually dead this time. It's possible that the disintegration sphere only grazed his forehead.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess we'll never get to know which God his stand was named after

His Stand is the beginning of all Stands being musical references. His Stand is called Tenore Sax.
>> ARTICLE
Jotaro had a cool ending to the fight. I think Joseph took over just after D'Arby told them what his stand could do and that's why Jotaro declared his pitch. It was either that or when Joseph was telling Jotaro what a scrub he was. Speaking of people being scrubs, I got Terence (D'Arby the Gamer) and Daniel (D'Arby the Gambler) mixed up in my reaction post from last episode because the CR subs don't use their names because copyright.

Speaking of copyright, Cool Ice is hilarious and the reason I watch CR subs, because then the subtitles are people freaking out about someone named *COOL ICE* and that's funny to me. He had a great into, cutting his own head off before obliterating the door. Also, am I the only one reminded of Joseph and Whammu when DIO cut his wrist to bring Vanilla Ice back to life. Someone pointed out to me that in the DIO/Vanilla Ice scene, VI wasn't wearing pants and DIO was only wearing pants, who then went on to make a "we know who wears the pants in that relationship", ignoring DIO's true lover Jonathan and/or [Part 6](/n "Pucci")

I disagree with Avdol's thought process. I know it makes it more dramatic when he goes on about how you should save your self and then sacrifices himself to save Polnareff(again) and Iggy. Maybe it's the small part of my brain now dedicated to strategy games any how three injured troops are better than one healthy one most of the time.

What would've happened if they didn't kill Kenny(you BASTARDS). Would the note on the wall have still been there. Truly one of the great mysteries of our time.

One last thing, "My dimension of darkness" sounds like a euphemism for his asshole. Just saying.

Hey guys, remember that time Jotaro bluffed so hard that his opponent aged 30 years and passed out? Good times.

So, I meant to post this yesterday and I completely forgot, but at least we're still in the same fight, so it's still relevant. Did anybody else think that [Osiris looked a lot like Handsome Squidward?](http://i.imgur.com/XtbuCl3.png)

 I'll be honest, I've never been a huge fan of Osiris. Most of the other enemies are remembered for their Stand rather than the enemy themselves, but it is the exact opposite with D'Arby. D'Arby was definitely the star of the show, until Jotaro bluffed him like a motherfucker.

The awesome thing about D'Arby is that his Stand just allowed him to force people to play his game; it was his own human, finely honed skills that made him dangerous.

After an aggravatingly smug, annoying shithead like Alessi (and a frustrating amount of Part 3 villains of the week), D'Arby was a breath of fresh air. And a sign of how tense some of the coming fights were going to be.

This is going to be some Light vs. L level mind games . 

Why did Jotaro prove how good he is at seeing the shuffled cards instead of just wait till the guy tries to cheat and bust him on that? Unless it works in psyching the guy out seems kinda pointless. 

NO WHY IS HE TOUCHING A BOOK? PROBABLY CHEATING SOMEHOW SHUT HIM DOWN! 

Jotaro catching him and breaking his finger like a boss. I trust his methods again. 

UGH THIS IS SO INTENSE I CAN'T HANG! 

# HE'S LOSING

# HE'S NOT TOUCHING HIS CARDS

# HE'S BETTING ADVOL'S SOUL TOO! 

(Hopefully this doesn't become Kakyoin's Solo Adventures...)

# EVEN THE BOY IS IN ON THIS! HOW WILL THEY COME BACK FROM THIS?!

NO DON'T BRING POOR KAKYOIN INTO THIS!

I love how they're censoring him smoking again after two episodes of Pol's dick being shown. Classic Japan. 

Jotaro is the epitome of too cool for school. He's psyching out his opponent like it's nothing. 

> I still have the right to raise.

# JOTARO WITH THE SHOT BOIII!

Time to see Jotaro kick some metaphorical ass:

* Star Platinum has so many uses.

* I love how they show you D'arby's thought process and obscure Jotaro's

* Go Jotaro!! At least it won't be a cheating game

* D'arby is by and far the best stand user so far. He's not even fighting for DIO

* Shit... Stakes have been raised

* This is D'arby's strength. He's basically holding all 5 of them hostages at once without so much as throwing a single punch or shedding a drop of blood

* Haha...Jotaro has the best poker face in all of anime

* See, Jotaro is smart. He can't win a gamble against a seasoned gambler, so he goes for psychological warfare

* Did I say they raised the stakes? Bullshit... The stakes have went to outer space to chase Kars by now

* Wow, everyone is working for him

* Even Kakyoin!? Holy shit. Exactly how far did Kars get thrown out there!?

* Ah yes. We mustn't see Jotaro smoking. It promotes rude behavior and stuff

* Oh yeah. Star Platinum can get him stuff outta nowehere. OP

* *R-R-R-R-R-R-Raise dattou!?*

* Even Holly got dragged into this!!

* I don't know enough about Poker, but can't D'arby just pull back at a disadvantage at this point?

* Seriously... Jotaro best poker face EVER!!

* The sheer mental pressure holy shit!!!

* Best anime bluff I've ever seen. Hands down!

* Either D'arby got rekt by the mental pressure, or DIO's stand can turn people mad.

* Yeah...My second favorite Jojo episode. That was simply amazing!

I like how low the ORA and Stand counts are. Like, you'd look at that list and assume that this was a filler/low action episode from that alone.

>Either D'arby got rekt by the mental pressure, or DIO's stand can turn people mad.

It was legitimately just the stress of the stakes that caused D'Arby to age and lose his mind. It's not a flesh bud situation, Jotaro's bluffing was just that intense.
>> ARTICLE
>I don't know enough about Poker, but can't D'arby just pull back at a disadvantage at this point?

In poker, when your opponent raises, your only two options are to call (match their bet) or fold (give up whatever you've already bet). Since he'd already bet Joseph and Polnareff's souls, folding is sort of exactly what he did.

Jotaro has the best poker face ever. More Jotaro acting cool is great. This episode had me laughing at how ridiculous it was, especially with the Star Platinum cigarette. Though I felt the ending with him getting frightened out was a bit over done in terms of how long it played out.

This was an interesting episode. Hardcore gambling (and you thought sports anime is ridiculous). Jotaro is showing off and playing it cool while Abdul loses his shit so much that he awakens his inner Speedwagon and takes the narrator's job from there on.
And this instance of Speedwagoning makes me say that he shares this episode with Jotaro, even though he was a bystander.

I think it's actually interesting that the audience is often able to hear the protagonist's thoughts during battles except the ones that depend on outsmarting each other. During the N'Doul fight we were able to hear Jotaro's whole thought process while we were locked out of it this episode by shifting the POV to Abdul.  
It's a smart way to keep tension. And it's definitely better than protagonists who even act defeated in their own thoughts before announcing that everything went just as planned. (Looking at you, Yami Yugi.)

Oh my god Yami vs Jotaro who would win!?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I'd give it to Yami. Jotaro's actions up to this point have been to overpower the enemy with sheer ability (strength, accuracy, lung capacity) and, when that isn't an option, to wait and bluff cooly until an opening appears (the cigarette smoke trick with the Impostor Captain, Qtaro Kujo, antagonising Dan, catching a sword with his internal organs).

Yami is very skilled at games, especially Duel Monsters, and he is very willing to call bluffs even when things are tense. That combined with Star Platinum's uselessness in a duel means that it would be tough for Jotaro to get the upper hand.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much how I saw it too. I think it'd be really cool to see though.
>> ARTICLE
And so begins the MC wars of Polnareff and Jotaro.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad i caught up with the rewatch just in time for this fight's conclusion. Contrary to popular opinion i didn't find the last fight to be too bizarre i mean it was definitely weaker than the fights leading up to it but it wasn't that bad. But this one just blows it out of the water. The setup episode was pretty good, but the conclusion is just downright amazing.

Poker mind games aside i think that the highest possible stakes combined with the capable antagonist that is Barbie-kun really sell it. This guy manages to almost defeat the whole current team without lifting a finger. The stamp collection part does make him just a bit creepy by JoJo standards and adds to the overall tense atmosphere. But he's really scary because he's a gambler first. Cold and calculating, working for Dio not because of fear or because he's being controlled, but because it's thrilling to gamble against strong opponents. And he gets just that, Jotaros bluff was both amazing and hilarious i totally lost it at the smoothie part. Obie knows logically that Jotaro is bluffing, attempting to call with all his might but his soul giving up first puts him out of commission. Him getting a taste of his own medicine was an amazing way to finish the fight.

All in all this is in my opinion the strongest fight in part 3 so far, fingers crossed for an amazing finale. Would probably put it pretty far up in the overall series if i weren't such a Joseph fanboy. Besides most of Battle Tendency is pretty much like this mind game and tension-wise, just without the set of cards.

So a lot of people are saying that Jotaro ony out bluffed D'Arby when he really didn't. He bet all of the souls so that the only thing D'Arby could call with was the secret to ZA WARUDO, which would've killed D'Arby if he said it. So it wasn't just bluffing.

I did like this victory because it was another case of Jotaro's competence, wit, and cool-under-fire demeanor scaring the hell out of and overwhelming an opponent, I especially liked it when Star Platinum broke his fingers. What I don't like as much is how Jotaro's whole plan revolved around D'arby's soul giving up, knowing he couldn't risk giving away Dio's secret. What would have made this win perfect is if Jotaro made D'arby give up as well as having gotten the winning hand. It was set up perfectly for that to happen too, since he kept distracting D'arby, making him mad, and proving that Star Platinum could move things so fast D'arby can't see it. Between all the betting, the stuff like Jotaro's drink, and D'arby's overblown reactions and when he focused on the boy who was giving the cheating away, Star Platinum could have replaced all of Jotaro's cards twice just while D'arby was looking at other things. The timing of Jotaro's bets was perfect for it too, it seemed like he was trying to make something happen by stopping in between each round of betting. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's much better that he didn't get the winning hand and that he didn't cheat. Poker is a game of psycological warfare and is all about predicting your opponent and making them fall for your plans, whether to bait them to raise when you have a good hand, or force them to fold when you don't. In this case, Jotaro proved he was the better player by psychologically manipulating them into falling for a bluff.
>> ARTICLE
It also honors D'Arby's skill and Jotaro's resolve. Star Platinum is fast, but it got the cigarette and drink unseen because D'Arby was focusing on the game and not nearby tables. Jotaro knew that even Star Platinum wouldn't be able to tamper with those unevenly laid out cards without the risk of D'Arby noticing. His only hope was to avoid actually touching the cards and seed the idea that Star Platinum might be fast enough to have already made the switch.

No opening this time because we need all the time we can get for this epicness.

And now one of, in my opinion the best episodes of Part 3. Last episode set it up and this episode we see how Jotaro gets out of it.

Oh man Star Platinum is so good he can see the cards as they're being shuffled.

Based on these two episodes I'd actually really love to see an anime like Kaiji but with Jojo characters.

"Okay! Open za game!"

Star Platinum grabbed and pulled Daniel's finger out of place! He broke it!

As I believe /u/SmurfRockRune said yesterday this episode and last episode have quite a few differences between the tv broadcast and the blurays.

For anyone who didn't see it yesterday [here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jt6k9j3qds&feature=youtu.be) 

"Nani!" He'll wager Avdol's soul as well!

Even the kid works for Daniel! The odds are stacked against Jotaro!

He'll wager even Kakyoin's soul!

Annnnnd Jotaro's face suddenly turns black as he smokes. I love how you can see Star Platinum just for a split second as he lights Jotaro's cigarette.

"Geeeeh!" And then all of a sudden he has a drink.

"R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Raise!" Long ago before any of the Jojo anime had aired but I had known of Jojo I saw a screenshot of this scene in the manga. I had been waiting literally years to see that moment get animated because: He wagers his own mother's soul as well!

He can't call! Dio would kill him! His hair literally turns gray before our eyes!

Daniel literally loses his mind! He retires!

Jotaro had a trash hand. The ultimate bluff.

Bit late to this one again. Late enough that I need to do the next episode as well. I wasn't actually busy or anything this time, I just got *way* to into Stardew Valley over the past few days and everything else fell by the wayside.

Anyway, the episode. I loved it. The Mr. Darby 'fight' is easily my favourite of this series so far. I love Darby as a villain for so many reasons, but the core of it comes down to what Dadvol said to him: "You're not powerful, but you're still well strong" (paraphrased). Mr Darby is a weak villain; he wouldn't stand a punch ghost of a chance against JoJoJo and Star Platinum, and the way Platinum casually breaks his fingers when he cheats is proof of this.   
So he doesn't try to take on JoJoJo in an even fight, he gets leverage over the crusaders and then forces the fight to the battleground where he has the advantage.  
I mentioned this last episode, but I loved that his character and abilities actually meshed together properly, both of them influencing the other.

This fight was also great because of how well it displayed JoJoJo. There have been very few episodes where I actually feel that he was portrayed well, and I think it's down to the fact that he was introduced with someone saying "Wow! This is the most powerful punch ghost I've ever seen. You're automatically the best." This has meant that most fights are far too trivial for him to actually ge to display *him*. It wasn't until Anubis literally said "JoJoJo is calm under pressure" that I understood that was meant to be his gimmick, because he rarely got the chance to show it. In contrast I understood that JoJo was resourceful and that Jo was tenacious much more easily because I actually got to see that in the ways that they fought. Star Platinum's overwhelming power means that JoJoJo wins most fights without any issues.  
In this fight JoJoJo was actually under pressure because he couldn't just let loose with Star Platinum, so we actually got to see him remain calm. We had a similar thing with Steely Dan of Steel, since he couldn't use Star Platinum there either. 

I liked the way that cheating was treated in this gamble fight, with it being an expected component which the players had to look out for and stop, as opposed to something which simply wouldn't happen. It made the gamble fight into something more than just trying to read the other person. It then allowed for the fantastic way that JoJoJo finally beat Mr Darby, something which wouldn't have worked as well if cheating hadn't been an active part of the game.

I didn't mention it yesterday, but Osiris is the God who watches over the underworld, and the souls which are there. Thus the link to Stand Osiris' soul stealing.

I loved this episode because the characters in it felt really complete, and really got to show off their abilities and characters. I do have one criticism of this episode, but that's just how stupid the cigarette censoring got. It pisses me off a bit that by paying to watch it on Crunchyroll I'm getting a worse version of the show that I would if I torrented it, but that's not at all the show's fault.
>> ARTICLE
As a poker player, I was very much looking forward to this part. I did notice the second dealing after SP broke D'arby's finger, so props to David Pro for putting the small detail in the frame. Also, Jesus Christ this was some bluff. I've only seen 'in the dark' calls from people going all-in with very few chips left, so that made this a very interesting move from Jotaro. 10/10 battle.
>> ARTICLE
Why did Jojo tell him that instead of using it to call him out or help him win? :/

Barbie hired this kid too?! UGHHHH

Oh ya Kakyoin exists, also where is Jotaro getting these chips from?

Woah Jotaro don't bring Holly into this!

Obie is pretty gross..this like minute of him spasming was a bit too much for me

Woah that screenshot?! Censor that!
>> ARTICLE
> Why did Jojo tell him that instead of using it to call him out or help him win? 

Because Darby would've cheated anyway.

Jotaro did that not to tell Darby that he knew the order of the cards, but to give Darby a message that he won't be able to cheat the order of the cards. It was a warning.
>> ARTICLE
Probably would have been better ways to do that and he still cheated so not much point!
>> ARTICLE
I'm convinced they only had D'Arby spazzing out for so long to stretch out the episode length. It does feel a *bit* too long.

What did you think of the way Jotaro won?
>> ARTICLE
Kinda wanted more, was hoping for a little more skill rather than just bluffing. If Barbie hadn't cheated and known Jotaro's hand before I think I would have liked it more.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way. I said the same thing and got downvoted too lol. It's dumb to introduce a character that's a gambler and have him lose due to a bluff that stupid. I enjoyed this battle, but how everything was won is disappointing. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one, makes me feel a bit more sane :p
>> ARTICLE
...?

Bluffing is a skill. And cheating/outsmarting your opponent was the entire idea behind the match-up in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Well full on bluffing when your opponent knows your cards was pretty silly, he outsmarted his opponent because they suddenly made D'Arby an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
Except Jotaro didn't know this. And he made D'arby think that the possibility of Star Platinum changing his cards. Knowing DIOs stand power just screwed him even more.
>> ARTICLE
> Except Jotaro didn't know this

D'arby knowing is the key to that no Jotaro knowing...

> And he made D'arby think that the possibility of Star Platinum changing his cards. 

He did that with the speed of breaking his finger/noticing the shuffle/deal




>> ARTICLE
Yes with all of that. Plus DIO sealed the deal. He didn't want to take that chance and his soul quit. D'arby thought that small chance of Jotaro being to change his cards would have made him lose. Jotaro physiologically defeated him and add on him raising the stakes D'arby couldn't take it and quit.
>> ARTICLE
He had all the information still. So all it took was to bring up Dio for barbie to lose  everything that pretty much made him who it was?
>> ARTICLE
It wasnt just that, it was all the mind games by Jotaro and him knowing how terrifyingly strong DIO is and that he would die if he somehow lost. I don't think you're understanding, Jotaro beat him mentally. It's what Jotaro was doing this whole episode.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it's completely, absolutely, without a doubt within Jotaro's character to win through sheer confidence alone.

And hey, perfectly bluffing while your life is on the line definitely requires some skill.
>> ARTICLE
You just think a gambler like Obie would be better with his **years** of practice...
>> ARTICLE
He is a much better gambler, and his mind is probably a steel trap.

Except Jojo's talents basically lie in his immense self-confidence. 

When the two were matched against each other, experience lost to talent. At least that's how I saw it.
>> ARTICLE
If they didn't make such a big deal of his history or the fact he **knew** Jotaro's cards and that he also lost before going to the end maybe it wouldn't bug me. 
>> ARTICLE
>the fact he knew Jotaro's cards

I found that to be the best part. 

For D'arby, his constant worry was Star Platinum. Experience can't help you with spotting lightning fast movement.

So, the guy wasn't 100% sure about the cards. Maybe he miscalculated. Maybe the boy messed up. Maybe...Maybe...Maybe...

And the stakes keep getting higher, and you start wondering if, with all those variables, are you *entirely certain* you're winning!?

The guy matched up against his worst possible opponent. Someone with more self-confidence.
>> ARTICLE
All he had to was play to the end, him conveniently losing before that was pretty lame.  Again if it was some random playing I'd be fine with it but the dude was a seasoned gambler you think he'd handle it better. 
>> ARTICLE
The key here is the warning shot earlier. Once Darby starts to doubt, the physical pain from his finger makes him doubt even more
>> ARTICLE
Star Platinum is very very fast. It's FTL confirmed by Araki.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but the thing is, D'Arby was watching the table really closely. If any of those cards seemed to suddenly be in a different spot by even a millimeter, he'd have noticed. He also might feel the air pressure changing from Star Platinum's sudden movements. It was too big a risk no matter how you slice it.
>> ARTICLE
He was overwhelmed by Jotaro's confidence. Even though D'Arby was absolutely sure he was going to win, Jotaro managed to break him by creating an unexpected situation. D'Arby panicked. It's mind games.
>> ARTICLE
I'd understand if it was a normal random but they made a big deal showing his pedigree beforehand. 
>> ARTICLE
> Woah Jotaro don't bring Holly into this!

Why not? If he loses, she's dead anyway.
>> ARTICLE
But it's Holly ;.;

Not if Iggy solos the final boss!

Nah man. The years of raising Jotaro finally kick in, and she masters her stand and takes on DIO alone.

I'd imagine at first she tries killing him with kindness. Offering him amazing cooking as a peace offering. Then while he's busy stuffing his face, (because let's be serious mothers make the best food) she ora oras him to pieces.

She makes Jonathan's favourite meal for DIO using one of Erina's old recipes, and the sheer nostalgia of the food causes Jonathan's body to start channeling Hamon and fry DIO's head.

WE MADE IT! PET SHOP HYPE, LET'S GO!

If you remember back to the Anubis fight, I pointed out that [one of these 9 Stand users was a sword.](http://i.imgur.com/rhEK7Vb.jpg) Some people said that Anubis had taken a user and that they were the ones under the robes, which is plausible. Well, now we know that one of them is a falcon, too. Explain that one.

I really like this episode, as it starts to humanize Iggy a little bit. We start to understand him a little bit more, how he really has no beef with DIO at all, and was just dragged to Egypt against his will. We also get to hear his inner thoughts for the first time, instead of him just looking like an asshole.

I don't wanna say too much, but a common complaint I've been seeing in these threads is gonna get taken care of next episode, so I think some people will be happy about that.

Some people will also be happy about something we saw in the next episode preview, but I don't wanna say what it was for the people who don't watch that. If you did watch it, then you already know, and you may have screamed a little bit.

My god! Pet Shop is one scary bird! He is so intimidating for a bird!

I really like Horus. It's not a original Stand power, but you simple can't overlook how "cool"(ha) it's raw power is. Horus is just a very powerful Stand in terms of combat, and I kinda like to see really cool Stands that are just powerful from time to time.

It doesn't help that Pet Shop is Meta Knight god tier in the Capcom game as well. He was VERY, VERY broken that he got ban from Jojo tournaments.
>> ARTICLE
Dios pet hawk is called Pet Shop? Thats an interesting name for a bird. I guess it makes sense though, Dio is famously a big fan of the Pet Shop Boys so hed probably name his hawk after them.

Seeing as this episode deals with pets, Id like to take a minute to talk about HoHos elephant. I know Ive harped on about this elephant a fair bit--definitely way more than is necessary--but I just cant get over it. The man rode in on an elephant, an literal elephant. If that elephant was in a room then Id be addressing the elephant in the room both literally and metaphorically.  
Im going to cut short any further elephant talk now, because otherwise Ill probably end up writing a book about that elephant in this comment, instead Ill just give the summary of my opinion: An elephant is for life, not just for an intro.

Whilst Im on the subject of stuff which isnt really relevant to this episode, I rewatched The Princess Bride yesterday and it finally hit me that the Frenchman is based on Inigo Montoya. I clicked straight away that Centerfold being identified by having two right hands was an homage to Montoyas search for the man with six fingers on his right hand, but thats all I noticed at the time. Now that Ive rewatched the film I really see how deep the similarities run.

Anyway, Im four paragraphs in so I think I should probably get to this actual episode. Pet Shop Boys is terrifying. Its a direct, unrelenting threat in a way which most other Stand bearers arent. It has no desire to grandstand or anything like that, its simply a killing machine. Iggys fleeing from it was reminiscent of bits in films where a character is trying to escape a pursuing aircraft, and gave a similar feeling of helplessness. On of the things which sets PSB apart from the other Stand Bearers is that it isnt an assassin, or a conman, or a thug; its a predator. Its a predator out to kill its prey, and its incredibly good at doing so.  
It pairs really well with its Stand as the ice is so effectively used as a weapon. Its attacks are swift and brutal, which is exactly how a Hawk should behave.  

I think that Iggy talking was unnecessary, and that the episode could have worked just as well without it. By having Iggy talk (I know its more representative than actual speech, but its the same for my purposes) it suggests that he should probably be able to communicate with the Crusaders by Stand telepathy. However having him talk did allow him to say Good Grief, and cement his place as Snoopy alongside JoJoJo Brown.

PSB is a really great enemy because of the fact that theres no bluster. Its a killer and its out to kill. Its simple and deadly. I look forwards to tomorrow and to seeing how long the Crusaders sit there waiting for that beggar to return. That guy must have been boiling with a suit under that cloak, so at least his death by ice will have refreshed him a bit.

I really hope they go back to serious episodes from now on, they're practically at DIO's doorstep:

* What's up with the broken hand guy?

* Haha... Never mess with Arabic beggars. These guys mean business. 

* Smartest thing you could possibly do: Ask the beggars! Avdol is the smart one for a reason

* So...Exactly how many stand user are left? I haven't been counting. 2 or 3, I guess. One of them being Horus.

* Haha... Dogs picking on Iggy. Dream on

* Really!?!?! FKING KILLING DOGS AGAIN!??

* Wtf is up with that bird?

* Iggy can think... Umm... Sure.

* Oh, an actual falcon as Horus. I like that. I like that a lot. Petshop hype!

* I liked Iggy more when he wasn't a cardboard shounen protagonist.

* *Chibi and Buchi??* Those two did not look like no *Chibi* nor *Buchi*. 

* I don't care if you're a falcon, or if you're a stand user. You don't just eat dogs, what the actual fuck, Araki!?

* And Iggy easily climbs to 2nd coolest in the gang with one iteration of 'Yare Yare'.

* Uh...You searched for 3 days and *then* decided to go for the informant guy?? Why!?

* Yeah, hate to tell you this but it's nearly impossible to escape a falcon.

* Hell yeah! Go, Iggy!!

* And now a Bruce Lee reference.

* Petshop be like: This isn't even my final form!

* The firepower on that stand is just insane. Zyra's E with Heimerdinger's W

* Wow...Well, Petshop seems to rely a lot on his stand, while Iggy barely used his and spent most of the fight running away. Would love to see the tables turned next episode.

* As for Horus...haha. I don't even need to find the link. His name literally means "falcon". He was often said to possess an all seeing eye: The eye of Horus. I really can't see what is his relation to ice, though, so that's probably Jojo-original.

>Araki saying "You know what would be badass? A falcon that can shoot ice missiles!"

I was imagining the creative process behind Jojo the other day, and arrived at the conclusion that it was basically Araki saying 'fuck you' to all the laws of the universe, ignoring criticism and writing whatever the hell he wanted.
>> ARTICLE
That's what makes JoJo so fun! Araki doesn't care about great storytelling or logic. He just wants JoJo to be badass and fun.

I just wish he wouldn't butcher so many dogs, goddamn it!

Araki has two pet peeves:

One is dogs

Other are eyeballs.

Well, I can't imagine we'll find many dogs inside of DIO's mansion, so it should end soon enough.

I really love that they gave Iggy a voice for this. Really changed how I thought about him.

Same. I hated Iggy before Pet Shop. From Pet Shop onwards, you understand him a bit better, and it makes him more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
One of the most hype double episodes in JoJo has begun! Pet shop is a fucking majectic bird and a murderous one at that. I mean: [look at this fucking bird and tell me that's not the most majestic thing you've ever seen.](http://i.imgur.com/PWIgNPy.png)  
I barely contained myself to tell Ora counter guy that this is the most obvious Stand-User combination yesterday :p  


But we also got our very first Iggy solo episode in this. We finally get to hear his thoughts, his reasoning, him being an asshole... right before we start  rooting for him. You go, little guy!

>tell Ora counter guy that this is the most obvious Stand-User combination yesterday

I had absolutely no idea the bird was a stand user. IIRC he appeared with DIO at some point, but I kinda forgot about him. Plus, the *god of storms and chaos* was Alessi's stand. I'd say the stand match-ups don't usually make sense.
>> ARTICLE
I know... I just really wanted to give exactly this as the hint. But on the other hand I didn't want to spoil anything. So I was a bit tormented.
>> ARTICLE
Pet Shop is fucking brutal. Glad to see an Iggy episode, though.
>> ARTICLE
The beggar's reveal was legitimately more surprising to me the first time around than Avdol's return. Though I shouldn't have been so surprised: the beggar's turf thing is completely real and there are some who get rich from begging. They're not all exactly high-rollers, but a tourist area combined with a culture where donating to beggars is good for your religious well-being can be fairly profitable for beggars.

Isn't it interesting that animals tend to have mechanical Stands that are very powerful but somewhat simple? (giant cruise liner, dog-car that controls sand, dinobird with ice powers, etc.)

I really like Pet Shop's powerset, as [massive Part 3 ending spoilers](/s "his power to freeze the physical subtly parallels his master's ability to freeze time.") He's also shamelessly blunt and efficient in his duty. Most of the Tarot assassins and even the 9 Egyptian Gods have had some measure of discretion with their Stand use. Even Mariah, who caused quite a commotion with her ability, directed all the fuss and attention towards Joseph and Avdol.

Pet Shop will mutilate you and your car bloodily with a massive chunk of ice in the middle of Egypt.

Don't fuck with Pet Shop.
>> ARTICLE
Christ I'm late.

* The hawk is a stand user?!

#NANI?!

* Iggy can talk?!

#NANI?!

* We found the mansion but the guy who found it is dead?!

#NANI?!

* Dogs died?! NA- oh wait that's normal.

* ED, how I missed thee.

* Pet Shop has a strange design, seems to be the Hawk's from a *West End* town EYOOO!! Sorry, that joke was just *Always On My Mind* UP TOP!

Great episode, it's awesome to hear from Iggy's POV. Hype for next Ep!
>> ARTICLE
The rest of the gang needs to *go west* and meet up with Iggy.
>> ARTICLE
Man, we're a lot closer to the end than I remembered.

Iggy talking was a huge shock to me, but I got used to it pretty quick. 

Port Shop is one scary motherfucker. It's not even the stand that's quite terrifying, it's his determination to kill Iggy.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's weird how close we are with 10 episodes left.

The whole last third is basically them arriving at [](/s "and attacking") Dio's mansion...

*get hype*

Dat fuckin screenshot of the day. That guy's no beggar.

I love how Iggy just randomly stumbles across Dio place.

Annnnd Araki kills another two dogs. When will this heartache end!?

And there's Pet Shop. If you guys couldn't tell this is kind of a serious stand fight.

Welp Beggar dude is dead. Car's totaled too. All because of a giant ice spike in the sky.

Every time I hear about how powerful falcon eyes are I get envious. I'd love to have vision that lets me see kilometers away.

"I don't care if some human kid dies."

You totally do.

Can you imagine seeing a falcon eating your beloved pet. Horrible.

Iggy coming to save the day. I love his theme. It's so hype.

No matter where Iggy goes Pet Shop is waiting. It's like he can teleport.
>> ARTICLE
AWW HECK! IT'S FINALLY ANOTHER IGGY EPISODE!!

It's dogs vs falcons and the goal is Dio's stronghold! I like this episode because it has ZANY Iggy and Pet Shop, they're a pair of SUPER FAST DOGGO AND BIRDO FLYING AT *INCREDIBLY* FAST SPEEDS!!!

Also, a little point of fact, Falcons are not the fastest birds in the sky in every type of flight. They only reach their fastest when they fold up into a free-fall dive-bomb. Their horizontal and ascending flight speeds are not so extreme.

But in case anyone actually made it to this point and still needed to do some distinguishing between JoJo and reality, do not let dogs fight with falcons, not even if they're stand users, just keep them separate.

* In the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting game, Kakyoin's ending theme is [almost an exact copy of Stairway To Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRNSECTjGk). Take a listen! I won't count this towards the total, because it's not in the manga or the anime, but it's still interesting.

* Jean Pierre Polnareff is named after French musician Michel Polnareff. In some translations, he's called *Jean Pierre Eiffel*, named after band Eiffel 95.

**Current Reference Counter: 54**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite fight in Stardust Crusaders, I'm really excited for those watching it for the first time!
>> ARTICLE
I think I can see why Dio keeps Pet Shop as a pet/Guardian:

-Wears a burgundy-colored vestment and feathers

-Enjoys killing

-Ice powers

-(special eyes)

He's similar to Phantom Blood Dio.

Hey guys. Congratulations on making it past Set/Alessi. This is the fight I was most worried about losing people during, and if you're in this thread, you either made it, or you're gonna tell me how shitty JoJo is now. If it's the latter, then good riddance. We don't need that kind of negativity anyway.

Watching this episode, you may have thought to yourself "Man, if only Alessi had encountered Joseph and we had gotten him turned back into Part 2 Joseph. That would have been amazing!" Well, you're not the only one. I've got a few things to show you regarding that.

- [An artist from David Production decided to draw a sketch of what that might look like.](http://i.imgur.com/vW8yAk7.jpg)

- /u/MysticBlackmoon over at /r/StardustCrusaders [drew up a comic of what it might have looked like.](http://imgur.com/a/SUGY7)

- In Heritage for the Future, a fighting game released for PS1 and Dreamcast back in 1999, [you can actually play as Young Joseph as if he were turned young by Set.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me6sKX6awk4) Looks like there might be some spoilers in the credits, so don't watch that far.

As for my personal thoughts on this episode, I actually had a hard time watching it, both the first time, and again here on my rewatch. Whenever they reveal the woman as a fetus, I feel a little bit sick to my stomach, and I am not a fan. I don't really ever wanna watch this part of the Alessi fight again. Maybe I'll just skip it if I ever rewatch the series.

My personal favorite fight is coming up next, so I'm pretty pumped to see it again. I'll have some things to share about it tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
>My personal favorite fight

Well, it is very

**GOOD!**

Yea, definitely the weirdest fight so far. I can get past the shota part but this was just such a weird fight. Definitely a low part, especially coming after the Mariah fight but 1 bad/weird fight out of the past 60 episodes isnt bad at all.


In summation: this episode was weird.
>> ARTICLE
Additionally, you can fight Alessi as Young Joseph under the right conditions when playing the RPG Seventh Stand User, which I thought was kickass.

Honestly I can't see why people would drop Jojo at this point. After 2 and a half seasons of bizarre shit they should know this is par for the course.

Yeah, it was mostly a joke. I don't see one episode this far in turning somebody off of the series completely. Maybe if it was episode 1 or 2.

It would have been fucking great indeed.

Yeah the fetus face is not something I ever want to see again, and I've only watched this episode once. If I do rewatch this at some point I'll probably skip these episodes. 

Also in the video of the fighting game I was very disappointed that Iggy's super had a static screen with hit effects after he grabs his opponents face. Instead they should have just had him fart after the grab. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a very old game, haha. I think he does have an attack where he farts if you're against Polnareff in All Star Battle.
>> ARTICLE
oh cool.

Looked it up, here's the video I found for anyone interested https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEn7E2FdALM 

>> ARTICLE
The original attack is that he comes flying in and bites their face, but the makers of the game decided to include a special variant when facing Polnareff. It was definitely a good idea.
>> ARTICLE
It isn't specific to Iggy v. PolPol, it is a change to the special when using a specific Iggy skin.

Ah, okay. I haven't actually played ASB, but I've only ever seen it used against Polnareff. Makes sense. Who better to show it off against?

Eyes of Heaven will be my first JoJo game, and it's one of the big reasons why I bought a PS4.

That would have been amazing...now I'm upset it didn't happen :/


>> ARTICLE
This did actually happen in the Capcom JoJo game (likely just as an excuse to include Young Joseph as a playable character).
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be honest here.

I was never creeped out by this episode, and in fact find it quite entertaining. The scene where Polnareff is hiding in the ball was cool, kid Jotaro just punching the dude in the face was great, and Polnareff being best boy once again by doing the right thing.

Is it my favourite fight? Fuck no it's no where near the coolest in JoJo, it's not even the best of part 3, I prefer literally every other fight in the second part. Honestly I dislike blue moon the most because it was just boring, the only thing it had going for it was the early mindgames, and shark punching.

Also I don't understand why people don't like it because Alessi is creepy, of course he's creepy he's a bad guy, you're supposed to want him to lose.

In conclusion, Polnareff best boy.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I think this fight's just fine in the manga, but for some reason I hated it in the anime. I think the creepiness becomes more apparent when you can't just glance through manga panels. That and the sounds.
>> ARTICLE
And so the fight against Set's Alessi comes to an end. His first mistake was [to underestimate Polnareff](https://i.imgur.com/TvROq7M.png) - doesn't he know that depending on how /u/CardonT counts this episode, Polnareff is now the main character? Yare Yare Daze, he really should have paid more attention. [He can't even do a good](https://gfycat.com/RewardingWavyIbis) [](#rerorero) impression.

Episode 2 of shota Pol being naked. This show really is all about him. If they end up killing him its gonna be a huge hit. 

This guy is such a creepy pedo

Uh fuck this guy. Worst pedo of all time. There's only one attack left...

Wow really?

> A main character would never do that.

Well Pol is the actual MC so f u bro. 

Pol going straight for boobs instead of taking out the bad guy.

OMG HE TURNED HER INTO A FETUS? WORST PEDO EVER! 

Pretty cruel and powerful stand actually. 

Ugh this episode is getting rough. Can someone please kick this guy's ass?

This guy can't even rerorero in a dank way. 

YO POL GOT THE DROP ON HIM! DO IT POL! 

JUST KILL HIM THOUGH! 

OMG IS IT BABY JOTARO TIME TOO?!

Somehow Shota Jotaro is just as badass as older Jotaro! It's awesome.  and somewhat redeems this episode.

Alessi blasting off again! 

Aww Pol fell in love but he has to be such a tsun so she won't get hurt! I hope he'll be able to return to her someday.

Also please bring Kakyoin back!

Alessi's comment about how "no main character would do that" reminds me of the Super Best Friendcast and their discussion about how the most powerful Stand would be one that made you shit your pants, because you could not be the main character of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and shit your pants. The only way to counter that Stand would be to be a goofy side character with no shame, like Polnareff. By the way, don't search out that video, because it has serious Jojo spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
That's the first thing I thought of when I just heard that too. I love that video. Do you remember how far the spoilers go? I think they mention The Lock?
>> ARTICLE
They also talk about end of part 3 stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Well, The Lock is Part 4, so it's further than the Part 3 stuff.
>> ARTICLE
They also talk about Part 7's Jojo a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, right, right. So basically, anybody that is even slightly interested should go read all of JoJo, and then come back and watch the video.
>> ARTICLE
That was far more Polnareff baby penis than I cared to remember.  
I'm not sure whether to give Jotaro a point for dealing the finishing blow. He didn't care to show up for 95% of the fight and then he came in hogging all the glory with his way cooler child transformation than Polnareff's. In a shooter Polnareff would flame him for kill stealing (and that's what it was, effectively. Alessi ran away from a *three-year old Polnareff* who figured out how to slice up is face. He had this in the bag.)

Nah this was definitely Polnareff's episode.

I love that Polnareff has actually taken the lead now. The jokes are true!

I think Jotaro will eventually walk away with the title, if only because [not really a spoiler](/s "he gets the four-part Dio fight mostly to himself") but it will be damn close to the very end.

Yeah, definitely the worst and least enjoyable 2 episodes of JoJo so far by a long shot. At least it came with a satisfying conclusion of mini Jotaro smashing the crap out of Alessi. 

That fetus especially.

[](#peasants)

Alessi actually lampshaded on the fact that Polnareff is basically the main character...

Also, nice to see Polnareff get a love interest. Hopefully he comes back to her at the end - if he's still alive (I know how much you like killing good characters, Araki!).

**Current Reference Counter: 52**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
Quite unimpressed with this battle so far, gonna wait and see if it picks up:

* I don't believe for one instant that this battle will get PolPol so much as injured

* Dumbest *asspull* ever

* "A main character would never do something like that". Well, that's Jojo for ya

* Ouch... She went back all the way

* Seriously... What the fuck is up with this stand being so OP? He doesn't even need to aim all that well

* Jotaro....any time now...

* Why do you think you have 3 chances? Just close the door

* Pfff...Chariot stabbing him actually hurts?

* Oh hey! It's Jotaro

* Shit. He got Jotaro too

* Uh... Kid Jotaro is the best thing I never knew I wanted. Best 'Ora's I've ever counted

* Haha... Star Platinum smiled

* RIP Alessi. Pretty disappointing for the 'Set' stand

* Oh...Love interest for Polnareff... Booooooo~

* I'm rather surprised it wasn't Iggy who won the fight for them

* So like...Does he still need to destroy the camera?

* Alright. Honestly the worst bit of part 3 for me. I hated Alessi, didn't care for Polnareff, and I damned sure wouldn't care for all the poop jokes made. Thing is, this episode belonged back in season 1. But to bring this after N'doul and Mariah's epic battles!? No, hell no! I really hope this doesn't set the standard for the upcoming stands. Though by this point I'm pretty sure DIO's stand will look something like a gay guy's deepest fantasy.

Honestly for me I liked it because little kid Jotaro is just as much a badass as seventeen year old Jotaro and the plan Polnareff comes up with is pretty clever. Certainly not the best though after N'doul and Mariah.
>> ARTICLE
>So like...Does he still need to destroy the camera?

I think it's just a habit at this point. He hasn't tried printing out a spirit photo without smashing the camera, so he probably hasn't realized that it's [totally unnecessary](https://my.mixtape.moe/ersspz.webm).
>> ARTICLE
Lol, hell no. This is one of the worst fights of Part 3. Next one is a lot more creative. 
>> ARTICLE
>  I really hope this doesn't set the standard for the upcoming stands.

Set is actually one of my least favorite fights in the entire series, not just the anime. This is definitely not the standard. In fact, starting next episode, we reach the point where the series started becoming a 10/10 for me.

>Though by this point I'm pretty sure DIO's stand will look something like a gay guy's deepest fantasy.


You have no idea how hilarious this is.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually more disappointing in retrospect.

Why, after some really amazing stand fights, would you go with this troll fight?

Moreover, *this* is Set's stand!? God of storms and chaos must be rolling in his sarcophagus
>> ARTICLE
You will get your amazing fights.

As a Jojo fan, for me, all the fights after this one, except one, will all be great fights, and the reason why I still like Part 3 despise it's shortcommings.

They are really that good.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, that one other fight after this is still great, even if only for the cold open of that first episode of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
I think I like little Silver Chariot better. Can I keep him mommy?

Also how did Pol not bleed out from his wrist being cut. JoJo characters must have super fast regeneration. Like in the last arc I don't think Joseph and Avdol took the nuts and bolts out of their arms. And Avdol was crushed by a car and then was walking at the end of this episode. At this point I don't really question Araki though.
>> ARTICLE
It makes more sense in later Parts. From 4 onward, there's almost always a character with some sort of healing power.
>> ARTICLE
They are taking Kakyoin's eyes seriously. Too bad he's my favorite character (and is going to be back soon right????)

Soon^TM

[My own screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Wep71zM.jpg)

I love moments like this
>> ARTICLE
The little "Pamiiiiii" that little kid Chariot does is pretty adorable.

He shit himself! Polnareff shit himself! The ultimate plan!

"A main character would never even think about doing that."

Alessi breaking the fourth fall quite nicely.

This is, for me, one of the darkest moments in this series. There are a few more worst than this but reducing a person's age until they are reduced to a fetus is pretty terrible. 

Damn you Alessi! You turned Polnareff's Shota Adventure: Onee-san Edition into Polnareff's Terrible Nightmare!

Oh no! Alessi learned his own version of Kakyoin's Rero Rero! Pero Pero!

I don't know where Alessi got the logic that Polnareff could have gotten into the stuffed bear. What, did he get a sewing kit, tear the bear open, climb inside and then sew it back up in the few seconds it took Alessi to chop through the door?

Why does he jump out the window!? And lands right beside Jotaro, who, at this point in the series is immediately suspicious of anyone he deems not normal.

And now for my favorite part of this entire fight. Little seven year old Jotaro gives no fucks. Jotaro gives no fucks no matter what age he is. If can't use Star Platinum he'll use his own fists. With little kid sounding oras.

Polnareff had a moment here. A moment where he could connect with this Onee-san. She saw what happened so whatever Polnareff told her she may not have found too far fetched.

Jotaro puts his hand on Polnareff's shoulder, supporting his bro.

The spirit photo shows the actual building Dio is in! Who's hyped!?

Someone else probably mentioned it but how awesome would it have been if Joseph was the one with Polnareff instead of Jotaro. Getting de-aged to his Part 2 age and kicking ass would have been awesome. I kinda feel like Araki missed a chance there.
>> ARTICLE
> Getting de-aged to his Part 2 age and kicking ass would have been awesome. I kinda feel like Araki missed a chance there.

I would've loved to see this.  Just as it looks like Alessi is about to beat Polnareff, the camera pans behind him and young Joseph is there, removing a tommy gun from his pocket.  Would've been a great callback to Part 2.
>> ARTICLE
I love the idea that as Set turns back Joseph's time, various kinds of weapons just magically appear in his ~~ass~~ pockets.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know where Alessi got the logic that Polnareff could have gotten into the stuffed bear. What, did he get a sewing kit, tear the bear open, climb inside and then sew it back up in the few seconds it took Alessi to chop through the door?

Could have climbed in the back after cutting it open with Chariot. I'm pretty sure Chariot can still cut through a stuffed animal.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that would work. Makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to say it once more. I liked this arc. But then again, it might be that I generally like any shit you can throw at me, even if it's Polnareff's.

I'm having a problem understanding Polnareff's body in the screenshot of the day. Like, where does his neck come from O.o

That Golden Chariot tho, cool as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
If he really wanted to kill him there's many other ways than drowning...

Also more poop jokes..._yay_

Nice Shining reference albeit gross though

RIP Kuma ;.:

Star Platinum's smile still creeps me out

_Polnareff pls_ don't just kill your best ship like that :(


>> ARTICLE
> RIP Kuma ;.:

At least it's not Albrecht. Although, what if it was and then it beat up Alessi?

>_Polnareff pls don't just kill your best ship like that :(_

It's all about being a good person and....not making someone fall in love with someone who's on a mission with a decent chance of death or something like that.

Wow, I can't believe so many people's problem with this fight was fetus baby.  
  
Maybe its because I'm messed up but I thought the shit joke would've been more of a problem.
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't have a problem with neither of those.
>> ARTICLE
Neither do I, but I was sure people would give the fetus a pass because lets face it, at this point, you've seen weirder shit in anime.  
  
But a poop joke is usually considered low brow humor and would turn the fans off more.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I get your point. Anyway, even though it might be a low brow joke it's a kid we are talking about. They find this kind of stuff hilarious so it kinda goes with the character.

What I mean is that I don't see it as a joke with the only purpose of making people laugh/smile but as a """combat strategy""" a "kid" could use in such situation.
>> ARTICLE
It seems that the way I felt about these past two fights was inverse to how most other people did. I couldn't stand (no pun intended) Bastet--and I'll be the first to admit that I was unfairly over-negative in my comments on it, I may not have liked it but that's no excuse for forgetting one of the golden rules--but this has been one of my favourite fights in a while.

I really loved the way that Hair Bells was characterised. His character and abilities were really linked, and it's easy to see how having those powers would cause his personality to turn out that way. Thanks to Seth's abilities, he rarely ever has to face an opponent on equal footing. He gets to revert them to a child, or even a foetus, and then he has the advantage. He clearly loves overpowering a weaker opponent; he likes to play with them because he can, because there's little they could do to stop him.  

His abilities also influence his insecurities. He's scared of adults because they're actually on even footing with him. When he spoke to adult JoJoJo he was looking away from him, unwilling to form eye contact. The same goes for his interactions with adult Frenchman last episode. When the woman takes the Frenchboy with her Hair Bells immediately backs off, because suddenly an adult's in the picture. He never really confronts her, instead staying away until he can turn her into a foetus. It's even shown in one of the first things he does, where he first ascertains that the mud spilling boy's parents aren't near before kicking him. he wanted to be sure that he wouldn't find himself in an unnecessary confrontation with an adult.

His other insecurity is shown when Frenchboy actually manages to put up a fight. Whenever the power balance wasn't firmly in Hair Bells favour he became visibly distressed. It happened at the times when Silver Childiot injured him (was did Silver Childiot talk anyway? I can't remember ever hearing Silver make noise before now), and when the Frenchboy managed to fool him with the mirror trick. Hair Bells's superiority over children is such a deep ingrained part of his persona that anything which challenges it brings him great distress.

I didn't do the Stand God comparison yesterday, so I'll do it now. I have an awful lot to say on the subject of Set, but I'll cut it down a fair amount to prevent this becoming an essay. Much like Thoth, Seth is the God of a lot of different things. He's God of storms, metals, deserts, desserts, chaos, violence, and foreigners. The last one is important, as it led to him being retconned as an especially evil god after Egypt started to have major problems with foreign invaders. Sure he'd always been a bit of a dick, he cut up his brother and hid his body parts all across Egypt, and that's not exactly something a nice guy would do, but it's pretty standard for a god. I'd say that the main links between Stand Set and God Set are that God Set killed his brother due to jealousy, and Hair Bells seems pretty jealous of functioning adults, and then the fact that God Set's main foe was his nephew Horus, who was much younger than him, which is mirrored by Hair Bells's fighting of children.

I found it interesting that the card depicted Set with a bird face. He sometimes has one, but normally he has the head of a non-existent animal something which is highly unusual among Egyptian gods.

Since I noticed that Silver has two swords in the OP I keep on waiting for the new one to show up, and I keep on being convinced that it's about to happen. I thought it was going to happen with Anubis because Silver dual wielded in that, then I thought it would happen in this episode due to the reversion in age and hand cutting. It's bound to happen at some point, but the question is when?
>> ARTICLE
Silver Chariot's second sword in the OP is Anubis. [It's even the same pose.](http://i.imgur.com/dMFZPEg.png) They simply made it another rapier to avoid spoiling people.
>> ARTICLE
[Later Jojo](/s "He does use it against Vanilla Ice.")
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with you about the Alessi fight: I thought it was one of the more interesting ones in the series up to this point.  It feels to me like people are confusing being disgusted by/hating the villain with the episodes themselves being bad.  Alessi is supposed to disgust you and get under your skin -- the guy is like an even more fucked up version of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, and he's a deplorable coward to boot.

I really liked the way Alessi's personality influenced the way the battle played out, it made the threat of Polnareff dying feel much more scary IMO.  Up to this point most of the stand users were just different flavors of cocky, overly-confident assholes and you could pretty much always tell that none of the protagonists were in real danger of dying as a result -- It would have been too anti-climactic to have them die to generic pond scum.  Alessi, on the other hand, is an 11/10 on the "fucked up" scale, drifting between lucid, cowardly moments and full-on "I've been snorting bath salts for the last 24 hours" moments at the drop of a hat.  He felt unpredictable and, after the whole fetus fiasco, pretty damn terrifying.  The ability to render someone physically *and* mentally inert with such ease (stepping on a shadow), on top of making their memories regress as well, is pretty damn scary.

I definitely preferred this fight to many of the ones that came before it, particularly ones like Anubis where they were just straight-forward melee battles.  Unique and unconventional fights like this are part of the reason I love JoJo, so it was kind of shocking to see other big fans of JoJo turn their noses up at this fight.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the Alessi fight. I also like poop jokes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people are bitching about this episode. My first watch through I thought it was one of the more entertaining fights. I also had to immediately google whether Polnareff's love interest ever payed off. 
>> ARTICLE
Hope you didn't run into any spoilers doing that. I definitely found some regarding Polnareff when I looked online for stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh immediately haha :/  ha
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't ruin your enjoyment much. I knew just about every twist and death before I got to them in the manga, and I still loved all of it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I've found that since I first watched the first episode of JoJo and started reading after I finished the current amount of anime that I don't think I've ever loved another series more. It's really cheesy, but halfway into episode one I knew I was hooked.  I find it to be infinitely entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
[I mean I don't even fucking know anymore.] (https://youtube.com/watch?v=GY7sMsgyuJw)
>> ARTICLE
I expect you'll have a much different reaction tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
And here we have the episode where Alessi proves that he can't even win fighting against children! I wish Polpol-chan had just buckled down and gone on a balls-out offensive with Chariot before the mirror trick, I don't think there was any way for the bastard to defend himself against even the little sword, otherwise he why would he have wound up running away in the end anyway?

I don't think that any fetus is supposed to look that cute, with big pleading black eyes. But she was anyway. Polnariff and unnamed lady both protected each other from the asshole, maybe they'll get together after Dio is beaten. 
>> ARTICLE
Next couple of episodes will surprise everyone in a good way!

Probably along of the ones of the most entertaining of this whole season.
>> ARTICLE
It's my personal favorite of the season, possibly the whole series.
>> ARTICLE
Not really finding the ending of this fight satisfactory. I just don't feel satisfied with a 7 year old beating the shit out of a grown man, a muscular one at that. Not to circlejerk the whole "Young Joseph" thing but really, the great weakness of an age-regression stand is older opponents. 
>> ARTICLE
Being muscular in Jojo universe (at least until part 3) is as common as having two hands in real life.
>> ARTICLE
Even if he was fucking anorexic I don't agree with him getting his shit handed to him by a prepubescent child
>> ARTICLE
Late to the party, by like 12 hours.

All I am going to say is that I wish Alessi was in the "Killed" bracket as opposed to the "Retired" bracket.
>> ARTICLE
Did you see how high up he went? No way he survives that fall.

No, no, no you're thinking of the Hotsprings episode, which I honestly don't remember showing his penis. Parallel Works were some sort of a musical OVA featuring the characters in alternate settings or just doing random shit.

On to the new stand user. I hope this one is as exciting as the last two:

* It's pretty interesting how they're making the battles happen simultaneously

* What........the........fk....is up with that guy's haircut?

* He reminds me of that terrorist chick in Mirai Nikki

* Beating on children to show he's a bad guy... I mean...At least no dogs were harmed in the making of that introduction

* I love how there a few eastereggs in the arabic shop names

* Just saying...Iggy has already surpassed PolPol for me...

* Gee... This Alessi guy is a really bad liar

* Wtf? He became a kid!?

* Umm.. kiddy PolPol is ugly. Just felt like putting it out there

* So, how was he planning to take them both on without separating them first?

* And the crowned king of super overpowered stands is.........

* PolPol just got saved by pure luck

* Figures PolPol would get lucky with a girl the only time he can't really enjoy it

* This is why I don't like PolPol. Life-threatening stand user coming after him and his mind just erased all that cuz boobs. Wanna bet he doesn't even remember who J. Giels was?

* Oh, the old 'switch with the girl who's washing his hair, so I can continue washing it in her stead, and thus throw away the element of surprise' trick. Yeah, screw smart stand users...

* Now let's come to Set: The guy is a freaking disaster-load of trouble. He was the god of storms, eclipses, earthquakes, and even the desert (signifying the unknown). There was a time back in the day where everything bad was blamed on Set. That's why it's hard to get a clear image of his lore.

Luckily enough, Set was the name for the boar that swallowed the moon each month, obscuring its light. That's the closest relation I can think of to shadows.

Frankly, Apophis would've fit this role more.

I think Alessi was waiting for a momment where Jotaro and Polnareff was distracted to turn both into kids.

That's what I think.

>* Beating on children to show he's a bad guy... I mean...At least no dogs were harmed in the making of that introduction

It was actually to show he is a coward

> It's pretty interesting how they're making the battles happen simultaneously

Should get rid of some of the "Why aren't they going looking for them?" complaints. Makes me wonder if Araki was hearing the same thing at the time of writing.

>I love how there a few eastereggs in the arabic shop names

Oh, really? That's awesome. What were some of them?

>Wanna bet he doesn't even remember who J. Giels was?

Well, he probably doesn't. His memory went back to what it was when he was that age. At that point, his sister wouldn't have been murdered yet.
>> ARTICLE
>Well, he probably doesn't. His memory went back to what it was when he was that age. At that point, his sister wouldn't have been murdered yet.

That confused me the first time I read this arc. From what I understand, Polnareff naturally gained his Stand at a really young age, but he didn't start seriously training with it until Shelly was attacked and murdered. For a while, I was under the impression that Pol manifested Silver Chariot *when his sister died*, which would really warp both of their ages at the time of the attack.
>> ARTICLE
Polnareff was probably born with SC, just like how Kakyoin was born with Hierophant Green, and Avdol was born with Magician's Red.
>> ARTICLE
>What were some of them?

Well, most of the shop names that appear behind Mariah say different variations of   which translates to (The protected 'female') and that's what Bast the goddess was called.

There was also a  hotel in Iggy's scene, which translates to 'Puppy hotel'.

And I'm not sure if this is referencing anything, but Iggy also runs past a shop called 'Eternal Happiness'.

Oh, and I believe there was a perfume shop called 'the horsemen', too.

I'll try to make note of them from now on, but it gets complicated with two counters.

>His memory went back to what it was when he was that age

I was actually referring to PolPol in general, with or without transformation

Don't worry too much about it. I was just curious since you mentioned them.

A few things. I love how Iggy is such a little shit all the time. It's fantastic. I *hate* Alessi so much. Much more than Steely Dan. Baby Silver Chariot is pretty cute, but it brings up some odd things when you think about it.

1. Polanreff had SC since he was around seven years old, which means he probably learned how to fence after he got the stand. Does this mean people get stands based on their future? [Part 5 onward spoilers](/n "We do know that stands can see the future, very short term with King Crimson, A few minutes in advance with Thoth and potentally years ahead with Rolling Stone. Also stands can see what the user needs, such as with GER, Maid in Heaven giving Pucci the exact stand he needed and Tusk act IV.") Also, do stand users learn from their stands? Because Polanreff is an expert swordsman, so did he learn it to use SC better or did he get the information because he has SC. It also begs the question if stand users knwo what their stand does by nature, and if so [Part 3](/s "Why did Joseph not know he could make maps with Hermit Purple or Jotaro not know Star Platinum could Stop Time?") Just a thought.
2. How strong are Mannish Boy [Part 4 and 6](/n "Shizuka and Emporio") if they have full powered stands at such young ages. 
3. It begs repeating, I hate Alessi.
>> ARTICLE
[Part 3](/s "Didn't Star Platinum just gain the ability to stop time as he was fighting The World? I always thought that's what the "Development Potential" stat meant: How likely it is the stand will get a new ability. As for Joseph, he probably always knew his stand had that weird telepathic ability, just not the whole extent of its uses")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the Jotaro part is true. Remember, when he first got his stand, he thought he was possessed by an evil spirit. Star Platinum always had its abilities, Jotaro just wasn't aware of them. I think [Part 3 BIG SPOILER](/s "he figured it out after DIO pointed out their stands are almost identical and after finding out he could actually move while the time was stopped. Since DIO's stand is what makes him able to move in the world of stopped time, I think he figured he could have the same abilities.")

>> ARTICLE
It's worth noting that [Part 3 finale/very early Part 4](/s "Star Platinum's stats during Stardust Crusaders are different from its stats early on in Diamond is Unbreakable. Developmental Potential falls from a consistent A to either C or D. The stats are supposed to be objective, so it makes sense that developing the ability to move in stopped time/stop time is what lowered its future potential to develop further.")
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of "growth potential" as the user's ability to discover his/her stand's aspects.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Joseph knows that Hermit Purple can make psychic imprints. He doesn't understand it perfectly (he still smashes his cameras to get a single Polaroid while Dio understands that a tap is more than enough), but every other use of Hermit Purple is just an extension of making a psychic imprint (rearranging syllables to make a sentence, generating video inside his brain, making a map, etc.) Well, that and physically using the vines to grasp things.

Also you're right on the money with the Development Potential stat.
>> ARTICLE
Mannish Boy was stated to be a genius, so it makes sense that he was mentally strong enough for your example. With the Part 4 one, [Part 4](/n "Shizuka did not have control of her Stand at all. It was out of control.") and for Part 6 [Part 6](/n "Emporio's Stand wasn't really all that powerful. It makes sense that he could easily control it from such a young age.")

You're part 6 spoiler didn't work. Just a heads up.

What you say make make sense, but it still is rather abnormal that they could even get one instead of getting the stand sickness.
>> ARTICLE
> Fix your spoiler dude.

Oops, I missed the bracket and hit 0 instead. Thanks for the catch.

>What you say make make sense, but it still is rather abnormal that they could even get one instead of getting the stand sickness.

I think the sickness only affects people with offensive Stands. Holly's Stand could possibly be offensive, we don't know. In any case, it clearly had a physical form that it used to choke her and worsen her health. [Part 4](/n "We could say the same thing about Shizuka. Shizuka's sickness may have just manifested as a Stand that wasn't under her control.")
>> ARTICLE
No problem dude.

That is really interesting. The only other case of Holly style Stand Sickness we see, unless I'm forgetting or haven't read it yet, is [Part 4](/n "Koichi and Echoes. It also is worth pointing out that Echoes isn't an offensive stand until ACT 3.") Maybe you're onto something.  Maybe Araki forgot, who knows?
>> ARTICLE
Looking through the thread, I just remembered something.

[Part 4](/n "Koichi's Stand sickness is completely different from the one that Holly had. The arrow will either give you a Stand or kill you, and Koichi was dying from the arrow, not his Stand, until Josuke healed him using Crazy Diamond, thus giving him his Stand instead.")
>> ARTICLE
[Part 4](/n "Don't forget that Josuke had it too. When he was 4, he gained Crazy Diamond and was struck with a terrible fever.")
>> ARTICLE
I completely forgot. So now [part 4](/n "with a sample size of 3, 2 are combat stands.") Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
[MFW I lose my live reactions.](http://i.imgur.com/GQ8fP5n.jpg)

I'll keep it short today and say THIS STAND USER IS CREEPY AS FUCK! He's like the opposite of Hisoka but just as creepy. 

Also saw way too much of Pol's junk this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Alessi best guy. Kek
>> ARTICLE
I really like him as a character (not as a person, he's a really bad guy). The fact that he's actually pretty scared of other adults is a really nice bit of depth, one which really works with his Stand.
>> ARTICLE
> he's actually pretty scared of other adults

You know I somehow didn't notice that exactly, I'm excited to see that in the upcoming episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The Hisoka comparison is a good one. Hisoka wants to fight strong opponents even if they're children, while this guy just likes to beat up children. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah at first when I was watching I realized he reminded me of him but he didn't have that coolness that Hisoka had by wanting to crush stronger opponents.

Also fuck his hair. 
>> ARTICLE
His hair is quite bell-ow average, I'll admit. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, here it is boys. I really want to write something about how much I hate this "fight" but words simply fail me. I really think these two episodes are the worst in all of Jojo so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this fight is... strange. It's definitely the worst fight in the entire series for me. It's way too drawn out.
>> ARTICLE
Still think Oingo and Boingo was on par or worse.
>> ARTICLE
Even if you don't like Oingo/Boingo, at the very least it was a single episode and it was a comedy episode that treated itself as a comedy episode consistently. This arc is longer than it really should have been and the serious parts feel a little meloddramatic IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care for it much either. It has a couple of fun moments, but it doesn't quite make up for it for me. 
>> ARTICLE
How he is finally defeated is pretty great, I'll give it that much. But everything else is just cringey to the extreme.
>> ARTICLE
What really bothers me about the fight is the fact that Araki missed such a blatant opportunity to [Alessi's Sethan fight](/s "have Alessi de-age Joseph to his Part 2 incarnation.") That's the first thing I thought was going to happen when they introduced "this guy ages you backwards" man, and they don't do it!
>> ARTICLE
Fr I completely agree
>> ARTICLE
Young Joseph would be too OP. 
>> ARTICLE
Even he wouldn't be that stupid to put a fighter back to his prime. His own schtick is to fuck with the opposition, doing that to Joseph is the exact opposite

Though the Baoh-reading Joseph could still beat him up I reckon
>> ARTICLE
Maybe he didn't know? Maybe he would think, [Alessi's Sethan](/s "This guy only developed a Stand recently... if I de-age him until he doesn't have a Stand, he won't be able to see or harm my Stand and he'll be powerless against me!")
>> ARTICLE
He likes to turn people into kids because he likes beating up weak people, so at best you'll only see Part 2 Joseph in a shift of age but he'll quickly revert to kid Joseph, which would still be hot blooded but I don't know if he's physically capable to beat Alessi.
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that he'll still put him back as a young man first, which would be an idiotic move. The reason why he uses that stands that way is so he doesn't have to fight young fit men

Given how fit Joseph looks at that age, it is not unreasonable to assume that he would be fit as well at the age of 18
>> ARTICLE
[Alessi fight](/s "Araki really should have reversed the teams for the Mariah and Alessi fights. Joseph and Avdol being stuck together was entertaining, but can you imagine Polnareff being stuck to Jotaro in suggestively homoerotic positions? And Avdol being reduced to a child only to be saved by young Joseph Joestar would have been the hypest shit of the entire series.")
>> ARTICLE
It really was a missed opportunity.  I could see it going something like this:

* Alessi Hits Joseph and Avdol with his shadow, Both split up and run in opposite directions.  

* Alessi follows Avdol.  Battle ensues.

* Avdol is eventually so young that he can no longer fight.  Things look grim for him.  Cue the frontal camera shot of a crazed, smug Alessi: "Once I kill you, your buddy Joseph is next!"

* The camera pans to the side to reveal young Joseph standing behind Alessi: *"Ohh, you think so?"*.  [He then proceeds to pull a tommy gun out of his pocket and tears Alessi to pieces.](https://youtu.be/Q5MCXgVmoKw) 

I realize there would be better automatic weapons available given the time difference between parts, but I think the tommy gun would only make the scene/reference gun more hilarious.

Hair Bells had a gun. A real gun. Good for him.  
Whilst a few of the Crusaders have means to protect themselves from bullets, not all of them do. And even against the ones who can, its still worth a try. Imagine how much better the bigger one of Oingo and Boingo might have done if hed had a gun with him (though hed still have to deal with Thoths prophecy). Theres something Ive always liked about characters who work in a supernatural framework, but still make use of more mundane technology. Hair Bells job is to kill people, so he has a gun with him, it makes a lot of sense. The Stand bearer from last episode should have tried a gun, if shed used iron bullets she would barely even have had to aim.

Also wow. One of the Crusaders finally figured out that you can check for Stand Bearers by bringing out your own Stand and seeing if theyll react. Maybe theyll try doing this with Stand telepathy at some point (though the mechanics of the telepathy are never really explained, so it might be that you have to specifically direct the thought at a particular Stand(s) which would prevent this from working). Whilst were on the subject of Stands invisibility, is Fools Orange invisible to non Stand bearers? The reason I ask is that its specified to be made of Stand, and in the same episode that it was introduced we one of the Speedwagon Foundation guys saw and reacted to Geb, whos made of water. I guess it comes down to if the sand which makes up Orange is real sand or not. But anyway, Im getting distracted, the core of what I wanted to say is Good plan Frenchman.  
What wasnt as good a plan was not immediately stabbing him. It looked like Silver was getting ready to take Hair Bells to stab town, and then stopped when Seth revealed itself. I understand that the point was to intimidate the guy, but the great thing about an intimidating preparation of an attack is that its both intimidating, and a prepared attack.  
Theres an alternate universe version of Stardust Crusaders which I often find myself imagining, one in which the Frenchman uses Silver Chariots incredible speed to react immediately and fatally to any threats. That series goes much faster, with most enemies not even managing to get out My Stand is called Draw 2 Blue! It suggests the blue draw two card from Uno. Before he stabs them in the head. There are a few who manage to avoid this and actually have a proper fight, but it still really thins the herd.

I get the feeling that JoJo (that being Joeseph for anyone who doesnt know my labelling system) isnt going to meet Hair Bells, which is disappointing to me. It would be nice to see Battle Tendency JoJo again. Im not totally giving up hope on it yet, but the next episode preview didnt exactly fill me with hope.

I look forwards to tomorrow. I like Hair Bells (as a character, not as a person), hes a coward, and I think they can make some of the best villains. So Im eager to see what else he has in store for us.

Quick note, totally off topic. I was really confused by the fact that this thread went up an hour ago until I remembered about American DST. For some reason it never occurred to me that that would effect this thread.
>> ARTICLE
Just letting you know that stands that effect physical objects and are made of physical objects are visible to normal people. So a stand like The Fool is totally visible to normal people (except for the color that we see when it is in its full form). But there are also stands that can generate things that are physical objects (think Magician's Red's flames and Justice's fog) that are not visible to everyone else as it is generating a stand form of that object instead of utilizing that physical object.

I don't know if Araki ever contradicts this later on like many of his other stand rules, but this is one of those rules.
>> ARTICLE
> is Fools Orange invisible to non Stand bearers?

It is not. The Fool, like the other elemental Stands, is constructed from actual sand/dust particles in real life, so normal people can see them as well.

The same goes for Stands that are bound to other physical objects, such as Anubis, who manifests through a sword, and Thoth, through a blank book.

When these Stands are hurt, they don't transfer wounds to the Users. Only the physical materials are damaged/dispersed.
>> ARTICLE
>Whilst were on the subject of Stands invisibility, is Fools Orange invisible to non Stand bearers?

Stand invisibility is tricky because there's 3 basic levels of visibility and sometimes it's not 100% apparent which Stand is which.

There are Stands visible to everyone all the time because they inhabit some physical object (Strength, Anubis) and Stands that are visible to other Stand users but invisible to non-users (Star Platinum, Silver Chariot). There are also a few Stands that are invisible to non-users and visible to Stand users, but which have powers that are *somewhat invisible/hard to see even to other Stand users*. Some visible Stands can set up an invisible trap or trick, essentially. When Hierophant attacks Jotaro on the steps in Episode 2 without being seen or when Lovers has a tentacle tied to its leg that isn't seen by the camera when it tries to go into the little girl's ear, its tentacles are meant to be somewhat invisible.

With The Fool, I believe it actually manifests itself through physical sand and so it would be visible to mundane people, but I don't know if we ever get any bystanders to confirm that.
>> ARTICLE
> Whilst were on the subject of Stands invisibility, is Fools Orange invisible to non Stand bearers?

Hmm, I'm not sure. I can't recall any specific uses off the top of my head in which there were other people nearby. Maybe I'm forgetting one that'll come up later.

>Quick note, totally off topic. I was really confused by the fact that this thread went up an hour ago until I remembered about American DST. For some reason it never occurred to me that that would effect this thread.

The little girls playing in the mud is scarily similar to the girls from my childhood. Was making mud pies a thing with everyone all over the world?

Alessi's face is so weird. And his hair looks like moose antlers. He should be called Moose Man.

He's such a scumbag. Making sure the kid's parents aren't around so he can get away with beating up an innocent child.

Stealing the guy's sandwich. Iggy is best lil shit.

He fuckin sees Avdol and Joseph in trouble and walks away. Best lil shit.

I love the way they have Polnareff transition back to a little kid. They show absolutely no foreshadow to it until they reveal his voice sounding younger. The manga probably doesn't reveal anything until they actually show little kid Polnareff.

I think I said this when this episode first aired but you'd think Jotaro would recognize the clothes and hairstyle on little kid Polnareff. Polnareff didn't help things though with losing his adult knowledge. Could've at least mentioned the stand user.

Little kid Chariot is adorable.

Alessi still manages to get hurt.

Today on Polnareff's Shota Adventures: Onee-san edition!

And Alessi had to come along and ruin it by making it creepy.

I do like how the screen does that typical horror movie thing where the screen goes black and grey shapes dance all over the screen.

* Look, I know this is JoJo's **bizarre** adventure, but seriously.

* Alessi is fabulous and douchey, but he looks stoned. I love him.

* AND POLNAREFF IS OUR NEW MC, EVERYONE!!

* *annnnd* he's a kid.

* Polnareff. You pervy French bastard. Sacre bleu!

* That was a pretty cliffy cliffhanger. Left me *hanging* for more if you catch my cold.

No fav line for now. Nothing that stood out.

It is a genuinely interesting fight, it just feels weird to watch. And if I remember correctly, [next episode spoilers](/s "the end of the fight is a bit boring.")
>> ARTICLE
Alessi is the only enemy stand user who I think infuriated me even more than Dan. But not for being as overconfident and jackassy (though he was that too), I hate Alessi because he is so pathetic that he openly admits and seems proud of the fact that he can't beat up anyone who isn't a child, and also that he beats up children, except for when it's Polpol-chan because even as a toddler Silver Chariot kicks ass. This is why I firmly believe every toddler should have swords, you never know what kind of sickos are out there.

I also like that this is the episode where Polpol-chan meets his soul mate

We've made it guys! This is my personal favorite fight in all of Part 3, and it's definitely up there for my favorite in the whole series as well. This is the point where I decided that I was gonna give JoJo a 10, unless everything from here on out just sucked, and it totally doesn't.

So like somebody told me back in the discussion thread when this episode first aired, if you wanna watch a show that is similar to this episode, go watch Kaiji. This fight is the sole reason I watched Kaiji.

> So like somebody told me back in the discussion thread when this episode first aired, if you wanna watch a show that is similar to this episode, go watch Kaiji. This fight is the sole reason I watched Kaiji.

I actually watched Kaiji before any of Jojo aired so when we finally got to this fight I was like, "D-Did we just drop into Kaiji?"
>> ARTICLE
From what I understand, this fight was right on the forefront of gambling manga as a genre. Kaiji's mangaka was actually an early trendsetter, having started his famous manga Ten (which still holds up pretty well, and is directly connected to Akagi) in 1989 around the start of the gambling manga boom.

Most early gambling manga basically spun out of mahjong manga, where the focus was more on playing a game and character dynamics than on clever mind games or playing for high stakes. Therefore, the feel of the manga and the twists all tended to be focused around the intricacies of mahjong. To this day, there are quite a few mahjong-focused manga series out there. Even Kaiji went into a mahjong arc at one point, and it's commonly considered a bit tough to understand by English readers because it's clearly written for readers of mahjong manga who casually understand a lot about mahjong.

The D'Arby fight, published in 1991, was an early example of psychological gambling manga concepts being applied to a mainstream kid's shonen as opposed to more niche seinen mahjong manga, as well as the gambling side of things being applied to a variety of less complicated gambles. Like Ten, the cheating and the metagame is just as important as the game itself in terms of building tension and presenting both sides with problems to resolve. The literary DNA of this arc not only influenced later Stand battles in other Parts that are more like situations/puzzles/gambles than violent fights, but it certainly contributed to later shonen series in general as well.

Ahhh the classic Sphinx riddle. Somehow I appreciate [this version](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/779/015/e91.png) a bit more than the original. 

The fam has reached Cairo but somehow Kakyoin isn't with them so it's not the same at all :(

Why are you guys trusting this bartender and his ice tea?!

This guys is probably an enemy stand user. 

> Gambling with souls.

Yeah enemy stand user for sure. Trying to send Pol to the Shadow Realm. 

Yeah legit in the Shadow Realm. SAVE HIS ASS GUYS! WHAT IS HE DOING TO POL'S SOUL?!

NOOOO SAVE HIM! That was such an anticlimactic way to die I hope he comes back! 

This is possibly the scariest stand user yet! 

JOSEPH GOING HARD IN THE PAINT! BUT I'M SO SCARED OF THEM ALL LOSING THEIR SOULS! 

I love that Joseph is actually cheating because the old Joseph would've done whatever it took to win by outsmarting opponents. 

NO DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO OUTSMART JOSEPH! 

How did he lose his soul before he even put the coin in? So not fair. 

UGH THIS IS TOO INTENSE! SO NOT COOL! 

# WHOOPS HIS ASS JOTARO! 

Somehow the most intense badass part of this season happens when there's no fighting!

> Ahhh the classic Sphinx riddle. Somehow I appreciate this version a bit more than the original. 

I saw a nice variation as well. The Sphinx asks the same question but Oedipus responds with something like,

"Hmm, probably one of those new pokemon. There's over 700 of those things now. One of them has to get different amounts of legs as it evolves."

The Sphinx says, "You know what that's good enough I can't expect you to know the actual pokemon name."

I still have to watch that! Is it all mind games?

Yes, 4 cours of mind games (and then 2 more parts of manga to read... it's actually kinda like Jojo in that the manga is split into parts).

Before I get started I need to get something out the way. Im *crazy* tired right now. So my writings going to suffer. Sorry in advance.

This was a damn good episode. I can see why people were so hyped up for this one.  
Mr Darby is a cool villain. Hes not especially powerful in direct terms. His Stand steals the souls of people whove already accepted that their soul is forfeit. Thats something which could very easily not be a threat, but he makes himself a threat by becoming indispensable, and forcing the Crusaders to dance to his tune. One thing I love about Mr Darby is that hes logically immune to punch ghosting. By the time it becomes clear that he should be punch ghosted (we can assume that the characters arent going to say Your design is too interesting for you to not be a bad guy. Have at you.), hes already taken the Frenchsoul, and thus put himself in a position similar to Steely Dan where he cannot be punchghosted.  

As I just said, the way that he controls the Crusaders is similar to Steely Dan of Steel, but what he does with that power is entirely different. Danny Steel was a dick, and used the hold he had over the gang to be a dick to them. Mr Darbys playing a different game, by which I mean hes actually playing games. Hes a gambling addict, and hes using the power of his Stand to indulge this. Much like Hair Bells, his power and personality actually mesh together in an interesting way. His gambling allows his Stand to function properly, and his Stand gives him a means to practise his gambling.

Im really looking forwards to tomorrow. Both to getting to see the next episode, and to being less tired.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the noob question but: What is punch ghosting though?
>> ARTICLE
Star Platinum ora oraing things and or people. Jotaro did think his stand was an evil spirit at first after all.
>> ARTICLE
People refer to Star Platinum (and other similar stands) as Punch Ghosts, because they have a very simple concept. They float over someone's shoulder and punch the shit out of their enemies.

Pretty much. Technically speaking, most Punch Ghosts that show up later have interesting twists to them.

It was fun watching Joseph and Obie go at it but we all knew Joseph was going to lose, sad to watch that part though :(

The whole mind games part is fun and all but it loses some impact when you know the result...

Barbie though is weird, what's on his face? I do not like characters that control everything and have everything go their way so looking forward to the next ep to see how they beat him!

I've been hearing great things about today's stand, and I'm quite interested to see where this goes.

* Oh, they reached Cairo. Pyramid hype?

* I never even considered that they wouldn't know where to go 

* Ooooh, this guy seems cool...and menacing. Not to mention I'm a sucker for card tricks

* Let me guess... Poker stand?

* God bless you Avdol. He actually considered that the guy might be a stand user

* Wooooooow! Osiris is all I wanted it to be and more. Moreover, it fits his lore nearly perfectly

* Yeah, I'm kinda happy that PolPol was the first to go down

* Umm...Shit...Guy has a whole album of souls

* Joseph has some balls. Though that seems like a really risky game

* That slow coin hover was more exciting than some entire battles back in season 1. Holy shit!

* When Joseph cheats, he does it pretty damn well. Also, couldn't he just use Hamon?

* A stand user that actually looks worried and not super confident. You're starting to develop better taste in minions, DIO-sama

* Calm yourself, Joseph. Calm yourself.

* Oh shit.......Shit.......SHIIIIIIIIIIT

* Ok, D'arby is a bloody genius

* Best Stand EVER!!

* A lot of people think Osiris is the god of the underworld and death, while that's not entirely true. Osiris is the god of transition, resurrection, and regeneration. This is why I said this stand is amazingly fitting.

Hamon is probably pretty obvious, isn't it?

It'd be pretty clearly cheating if the liquor started glowing and crackling! I took the fact that Joseph's got such an expert understanding of surface tension to be a reference to his Hamon training, though.

Osiris really is a brilliant Stand, and possibly the most fitting to both its Egyptian god counterpart and its user. Plus it [looks handsome](http://i.imgur.com/GYBEIIT.jpg).

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.

They're finally in Cairo. What would've taken them a few hours in plane has been over a month of traveling but they're finally there.

Daniel's voice has quite an accent. I can't help but feel he's an american like Joseph. All dat engrish. And what is that stuff on his cheeks supposed to be anyway? Facial hair? Seems to have odd lines for facial hair. I don't think I learned what is was the first time around.

"Good!"

By now both Avdol and Jotaro are pretty much suspicious of anyone who doesn't seem to be a regular person.

I feel like Polnareff was careless here. They were dealing with a weird guy and yet he was careless with his words and look what it got him. Avdol's words from the J'Gail and Hol Horse fight still ring true.

"Barbie-kun."

I feel like Joseph being an expert on surface tension is probably related to Hamon.

I love how Daniel pants after dropping those first 5 coins. He feels the pressure, even if he's confident he can win.

Annnnnd Joseph's cheating. And we wouldn't have him any other way. And then the laugh he does. Just like Jotaro said Joseph, you're a scoundrel.

"Go ahead! Mistur Joestur!" Dat engrish.

Joseph may be a confident scoundrel like we saw throughout Part 2 and most of Part 3 but he's an old man now, he can't take this stress. It's does him in.

Daniel is, for me, the most dangerous stand user so far. He defeats people without ever having to make a fist.

A different part of Last Train Home used here today since some credits had to be in the episode. 

The is the first time so far in this rewatch I felt tempted to watch the second part to this fight in the same night. I know what happens but the temptation was real.

Damn my comments are long.

For people who say that Joseph shoulda just used Hamon, remember that Hamon tends to create a somewhat visual spark effect, as well as the SHIIIINNNNNNN-ish sound effect. If Joseph were to cheat, he has to do it undetected.

I mean, I think it works so well because the atmosphere for the whole episode was suggesting that notion of "Shit's about to go down". D'Arby's playing mind games. Joseph's trying to fight back. It really felt like the pillar men fights all over again. Which is 

#Fucking glorious.

From what I hear, the next part is even better. So I hope I get to say

It's my personal favorite fight. D'Arby is just so charismatic and scheming, I love it.

I feel the first time watchers jerk over Part 2 fights a lot lol. Now that I think of that, I was also like that until P Shop and everything after.

Along with having one of my favorite engrish moments of the entire series so far, this is hands down one of my favorite "fights" of part 3, nay, in all of JoJo. And starting with this fight we get nothing but awesomeness from here on out. Except for maybe [Future spoilers](/s "Hol Horse and Boingo") but still even that one was mostly entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
This was a great episode to watch considering I just finished watching One Outs. I really enjoy the tension in these gambling games.

We back to mind games again! Though personally I feel like this one lacked the intensity of the fights of Part 2.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah maybe that's why it felt a bit off for me as I kept thinking back to part 2 shenanigans.

Part 2 had me at the edge of my seat on how the fights would play out.

This was felt more like "Oh, okay."

Oh! It's that so? Wait until the next episode, then. You won't be dissapointed.

What we got here today was just a preview.

Lol, I thought part 2 fights were lackluster. They just inolved Joseph pulling shit out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
There are two more actual combat-based fights (not including DIO!) coming up that I think are on par with or even better than Joseph v Whammu in Part 2. Darby the Gambler is the first point at which I actually started enjoying Stardust Crusaders, and from here to the end is my favorite part of JJBA so far.

I honestly found Whammu fight pretty boring the first time I watched it. I found DIO and Cream easily better.
>> ARTICLE
> Darby the Gambler is the first point at which I actually started enjoying Stardust Crusaders, and from here to the end is my favorite part of JJBA so far.

I guess that's why so many people say that from Japan to Cairo, everything was just filler. =P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree so far. I liked the set up of Part 2 where Joseph would always do something ridiculous that would make you think he would lose and then he pulls some genius plan out of no where and win. 

But this 2 parter still has potential to be as awesome as some of the Part 2 fights! 
>> ARTICLE
Darby has been the first villain since N'Doul (and I was more excited for Iggy then anyway) who I was actually looking forward to seeing in this! I hate that he's a cheater and how many people who's souls he stole, but he is an exciting villain and you know that anyone who can outwit Joseph is a serious threat! [Go ahead! Mister Jousterr!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYg0Ae1VQk) I bet when he did that he was getting back for being called Barbie

Edit: Oh no! I almost forgot! I was really surprised that Joseph didn't have any hamon tricks for keeping the drink from spilling! I know he's out of practice, but that seems like it should have been an easy one for him

I got curious why everyone kept shouting ZA WORUDO on reddit/group chat and I accidentally spoiled myself. Don't search it if you don't know what it is people.
>> ARTICLE
I remember thinking that Dio's stand was literally the world and he could just make the whole planet disappear if he wanted to.
>> ARTICLE
Bad idea. With the planet gone, there's nothing to protect Dio from the sun.
>> ARTICLE
to bad that an explanation of Dios Stand was one of the things that brought me into JoJo.... i never got to theorize on it either :'(
>> ARTICLE
I wrote my prediction in my own post, but I might as well go spoiler tag it
>> ARTICLE
I misinterpreted the memes, I thought his power was [spoiler](/s "The ability to summon steamrollers to drop on his enemies"). 

That would still be a pretty cool power, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Due to the fact that it's based on The World, and that card deals with the idea of completion and all encompassing-ness:  [I think it](/s "can use the powers of other Stands. We've seen it previously use Hermit Purple's spirit photography and it looked like Hermit Purple at the time, so maybe it can do the same with other Stands. As for how he managed to teleport today I'm not entirely sure, but that might be an ability of a Stand we haven't seen yet. Or maybe he didn't teleport, and that was a flesh construct made by copying Yellow Temperance's powers, and he managed to seeming vanish by use of Vampire powers.")

[There's one other possibility that I can think of, and this one harks back to episode one. ](/s "When JoJoJo was in the jail cell, he had all that stuff which Star Platinum had managed to get for him. Much of it was stuff which he probably shouldn't have been able to get whilst he was in a jail cell. Even when you consider Platinum's incredible speed the stuff would still need to be able to fit through the bars, and would need to be within Platinum's not stellar range. So maybe Platinum has another power which JoJoJo doesn't know of yet. If Platinum was capable of teleporting things, then that could explain how it managed to get the things into the jail cell. We already know that Dio's really good at finding the best way to use power from the fact that he's exactly the same kind of thing as all the vampires who were goons in Battle Tendency, but he used the power much better. So maybe he figured out JoJoJo's powers and used them to teleport himself.")


>> ARTICLE
First time viewer, your second paragraph made me think of something.

[spoiler](/s "When Dio used Hermit Purple, he didn't smash the camera. We've seen Joseph do lots of cool stuff with Hermit Purple, but before D'Arby he still smashed the camera. It could be a hint that Dio can figure out more about a Stand's power when he uses it than even the original Stand user, which makes your point make a lot of sense.")
>> ARTICLE
Also as a rewatcher, I thought it was [his Stand](/s "teleportation")
>> ARTICLE
And please include spoiler tags just in case!

When I was first watching around this point, I thought that his Stand [Speculation I had at this point](/s "gave him full control over the area around him. Like he could move whatever he wanted at will instantly.")
>> ARTICLE
I had a similar theory but [later episodes spoiler](/s "I only thought about it later on when Polnareff (I think?) encounters Dio and tries to run upstairs")
>> ARTICLE
Like Trafalgar Law? 
>> ARTICLE
Room

>> ARTICLE
I have no idea. I haven't seen much One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
Basic idea, he can rearrange any items within a certain space around him. 
>> ARTICLE
Too bad I played the Capcom game in the past. I never had the chance to theorize what Dio Stand can do.

=(
>> ARTICLE
Aw, that's too bad. I didn't know until I got spoiled the episode before the reveal while this was airing. I read an ANN episode review, and they decided to mention it.

I feel a bit bad for Oingo. He sort of just gets caught up in Hol Horse's plans.

Also the ED was a step down from the earlier Oingo Boingo one. Oingo's voice really had a depth to it that Hol Horse couldn't dream to match.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I have always loved Hol Horse's version way more. I think his voice is just way better.
>> ARTICLE
> Also the ED was a step down from the earlier Oingo Boingo one. Oingo's voice really had a depth to it that Hol Horse couldn't dream to match.

I agree. I love that they made a second one to include Hol Horse, but I prefer the one with Oingo.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I prefer the one with Hol Horse. He keeps going on with, "Is it okay to believe in the book?" and Boingo's all, "Yeah! Believe in this book!"

They show that while Hol Horse is unsure he's gonna go along with it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Hol Horse is back on the scene! Watch Dio kill him just because

Dio breaking random bitches like it's nothing. I'm just waiting for the Dio rap video. 

We haven't seen Dio in so long that I forgot that he's practically a god now. 

Dio calling Hol out for being a huge pussy is pretty awesome. 

Even though Hol is kinda shitty across the board, it's intereting that he's the only one not completely sold by Dio. He seems to be the only one not completely entranced by Dio's charisma so that's pretty impressive. But now he's going to try to fight him and it's going to end poorly...

I can't tell if Dio respects him now or this is a fake out that will lead to a grusom death. 

wait why are they on a plane...OH WAIT KAKYOIN IS BACK RIGHT? HYPE!! No...its just Hol Horse ugh. I miss Kakyoin. 

Is Dio in the suitcase?? oh no its just that Death Manga kid. Wow what a winning team. This kid with the shit laugh and Hol slightly useless Horse. What will their first move as a team be

> Kid pukes.

Yeah pretty much how I imagine this team will work out. 

They still can't find the building! What a mysterious building. 

> There's no way something that ridiculous could happen.

But this is JoJO's Bizzare Adventures after all! 

Hmm does this mean the comic will happen or no? 

Ahhh that's right Hol "killed" Advol and the crew doesn't know about the death manga kid. 

Little kid busted or nah??

And up his nose it goes. (Ugh worst pun)

Ugh Death Manga is the worst. So weird
>> ARTICLE
> We haven't seen Dio in so long that I forgot that he's practically a god now. 

I really like how it's spelled DIO now to separate this character from Dio Brando the human.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see more of new DIO to see how different he is from Dio Brando.
>> ARTICLE
The name DIO is basically because he's decided that he's no longer tied to his father. He doesn't consider himself a Brando anymore. Now he's just DIO. (Dio also happens to be Italian for God. He literally calls himself GOD now.)
>> ARTICLE
I just now realized we got no foreshadowing whatsoever to who might be the next stand user. Huh...

* Oh, Hol Horse. I sorta forgot all about him

* Yeah, serving DIO seems like a bad idea for people with  heart issues.

* Eh...His left side is weak? I like that. Weaknesses are always nice to see in immortal beings.

* Dude... He just told you he can heal. Like... Wtf do you think a bullet will do?

* So... [DIO's stand seems to be](/s "one of two things based off of this. Either short range teleportation or a time stop of some sorts. Both of which are broken OP.") Sasuga DIO-sama!

* Wait... Boingo? This could be a really scary combination

* That comic was hilarious

* He's gonna... Drop kick her?

* Oh...That actually worked out

* Guys...Like...Just ask an architect. Most cities have different looking buildings in different parts of the city. Architects know that  kinds of stuff

* "There's no way something that ridiculous could happen". Umm...You do realize this is Jojo's bizarre adventures, right?

but how did he move without removing the cob webs?


>> ARTICLE
Don't get me to start theorizing. That never ends well.

Alright, we can get 3 points from that confrontation.

* DIO was able to move from point A to point B without any visual cues to tell of it

* DIO did this in a split second. Not allowing Hol Horse to see the change at all.

* DIO's motive wasn't to kill Hol Horse, but to scare him into submission/make a point, so we can assume he used his stand in a flashier way than usual

Using that as basis, we can narrow down the possibilites:

---

*Everything below will be a prediction on DIO's stand. I'm not about to tag it all, so proceed with caution.*

---

* Teleportation: This was my first thought, based entirely on the fact that he didn't touch the webs. It makes sense in context, and it follows his card namesake, the world, in that the whole world is open for him to teleport to.

* Time stop: I wouldn't have thought this if I hadn't watched Fate/Zero before. Thing is, we are already aware that DIO matched up against most of the stand users he sent out and *beat them*. This implies that his stand was more capable than theirs. This is when I started to doubt my teleportation theory. Simply because it's not a viable counter to all those stands. The only reasonable answer left is moving at a ridiculously high speed that they can't see you. Well, that's not how stands work. Jotaro's stand moves itself very fast, but doesn't make Jotaro one bit faster. From this I can only concur that DIO's stand seems to mess with time or possibly people's perception of it. 

* Illusion: the most ass-pull of all enemy powers. He could have a stand that simply shows the opposite something completely false, such as an image of him sitting quietly on the sofa.

* Stun/Daze: This is one of my weakest theories, but it basically thinks that DIO merely stuns his opponent or stops them from thinking for some amount of time. Allowing him to leisurely stroll around the sofa and go behind Hol Horse. It's not like we had a clock to confirm, though.

And that concludes my thoughts on the matter. No dogs were harmed in the making of this essay.
>> ARTICLE
You might wanna put spoiler tags on your speculation, as others have done.
>> ARTICLE
Well, first of all, I addressed that in my comment. It's way too long to tag it all. I put a big warning that said possible spoilers.

On another note, it's been a few days since I made this, so anyone who's following the rewatch has probably seen it already. A bit too late to spoiler tag anything.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't defeat any of them, they just either respected him, wanted money, or are just scared shitless of him. Mariah wanted the D though. And if he would have passed through them they would have ripped.
>> ARTICLE
>either respected him, wanted money, or are just scared shitless of him

Well yes. For a stand user to be scared of someone, that most probably means they're scared of his stand, not his pretty face.
>> ARTICLE
Also DIOs charisma they just know they can't beat him. Like explained in the first season. And yeah, they are probably scared of an immortal vampire.
>> ARTICLE
>they are probably scared of an immortal vampire.

I don't see why. It's not like they're dogs or anything...
>> ARTICLE
He's different then before, I didn't really find him memorable before. But part 3 made him one of my favorite villians. And yeah just remember no one knows hamon apart from Joseph. They just know he's immortal and is OP as fuck. Just being near him Hol Horse was terrified. 
>> ARTICLE
Are you actually counting the oras sang in the opening? I'm also wondering where those 17 oras came from.
>> ARTICLE
Yes...Ever since the beginning. Since I resolved to count the 'Jojo' ones way back in Part 1, it seems downright wrong to just skip this one.
>> ARTICLE
You sir certainly have some dedication. Will you be counting Josuke's Doras as well?
>> ARTICLE
I have absolutely no idea. I've been relying on manga readers/re-watchers for stuff to count. 

I really don't think I would like to keep a count in the airing discussion threads, though. I've tried and it's just not really fun in there. Feels too much like Karma whoring, I guess.

So, no... I'm not planning to count outside of rewatches.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds understandable. We'd all probably be too busy frothing at the mouth at how amazing it is to keep a count of things anyway.
>> ARTICLE
> Dude... He just told you he can heal. Like... Wtf do you think a bullet will do?

He probably assumed that the healing only works if DIO is still alive (well, as alive as a vampire stuck onto a human body can be) and thought he might be able to kill him before the healing kicks in.
>> ARTICLE
A headshot is also legitimately capable of killing DIO, since his powers all stem from his brain. Though the bullet would have to completely blow apart the brain: Jonathan cut Dio's brain in half and it healed up just fine. In general with mythical monsters, destruction of the head works, so I could see why Hol Horse might have decided to try.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in Phantom Blood, Dio told Jonathan that he only was able to survive because he kept his head. 

I suppose that destroying a Vampire head basically could not kill the vampire, but sure put him out of comission.
>> ARTICLE
> Guys...Like...Just ask an architect. Most cities have different looking buildings in different parts of the city. Architects know that kinds of stuff

And they kinda did. They know it's south somewhere. That's a start!

When did we have 17 ORAs? You must be counting the OP.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. I've been counting it since the beginning. Would've been unfair since I always counted the 'Jojo's back in part 1.

Basically every 17 Ora  count means no Oras in that episode.

Any ones less than 17 are episodes where they skipped the opening most probably
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's kinda what I figured. Makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
I was considering making a bit of an analysis/prediction about DIO's stand, but since that kinda made part 2 anti-climatic, I'm probably gonna scrap it.

Edit: Ended up [writing it anyways...](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4b5bqu/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d16an8l)
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad that they chose to move SHOOTING DIO, one of my favourite standalone chapters in this Part, to this position. Originally it took place between Alessi and D'Arby the Gambler, which was a nice breath of fresh air but a poor transition to D'Arby. The OVAs adapted it much earlier, at the start of OVA 6 before the Enya/Justice arc. That was a good way to keep DIO hyped up during the middle of the series, but it mostly worked there because they cut out such a large chunk of the Part's content. This is honestly the best position for it in a full adaptation. It's a perfect reintroduction to Hol Horse, it fleshes him out along with DIO's current situation and it helps fill out this arc, which is just a bit too long by itself to be 1 episode but not quite long enough to be 2.

Recall that the power of a vampire in Jojo comes from incredible control of the human body. It's the whole "we only use 10% of our potential, what if we used Stone Mask trepanation to unlock the rest?" myth. If DIO can't even heal 2 fingers at the same speed, and they're both healing slower than his healing speed in Part 1, he can't do a lot of his old vampire tricks. This is one of his few moments of admitted weakness in the series, and yet DIO at his most open and vulnerable is still enough to intimidate the hell out of Hol Horse. It says a lot about the gulf in power between the two.

I like how the cabbie reacted to Hol Horse speaking to nobody and to Boingo's vomiting, but was willing to look past the whole "foreigner pulling a bound and gagged local child out of a suitcase" thing. You've got to pick and choose your battles.

The way they play Hol Horse kicking the lady is really well done. For a moment, you might think that he wants to see if he'll really get money out of it if he gives it a shot. But he's a lot nobler than that, and it's a good way to show off his sharpshooter eyes. This whole arc really plays well because Hol Horse is the protagonist at a serious disadvantage, and because his problems stem from his inability to be the leader by himself or in a duo. Boingo is kind of the same, and so we have two followers desperately hoping that the other can take the lead. It's a fun dynamic.

One thing that this season of JoJo has done well compared to S1 is comedy. Lotta fun moments.

Always enjoyed this beginning scene with Dio... it's just so creepy and, as always, the anime does a wonderful job of selling the sheer presence (in terms of charisma and power) that Dio has.

* Nice POV switch to Hol Horse for this episode. Watching him shoot the shit with Dio and Boingo was great.

* Dio's ZA WARUDO seems to be a very interesting stand.

* Wow what insane predictions. These could neeeeeevvver happen. /s Let's see how they work out.

* Holy shit he stuck his fingers up Polnareff's nose and he doesn't know what to do. Brilliant.

I'd watch the adaptation, or at least give it a try.

I'm hoping that if Part 3 gets a dub they at least try to do something with Joseph's engrish. It wasn't really noticeable in Part 2's dub.

There was plenty of presence in the reworks of the Engrish lines. "Real outstanding work, Caesarino!" They just had Diskin replace the Engrish with silly bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
> Why isn't Hol Horse a good guy, He's too charming for Dio!

Avdol was originally planned to be killed off for real when that bullet hit him, but he was brought back by popular demand... some people have theorized that Hol Horse was meant to replace him. There's some official art of him posing with the Crusaders, sans Avdol, and he gets a lot of screen time, and he seems like too much of a face to be working with DIO.
>> ARTICLE
I like how they gave Dio a "weakness" or a reason that he's not doing the dirty work himself, much better than previous parts! It may be a bit lame but it's good enough for me.

woah Jojo with the lewd manga! Not cool!

I'm surprised Dio doesn't keep Boingo around himself for his future seeing...guess there's no point in knowing the future if you can't change it?

I like how Hol Horse knows that PoPol is strong, respect the MC!

Man this ED is rough...this art is just so _bleh_ , makes me really appreciate the normal one!
>> ARTICLE
Dio is such a good charmer and a liar that we never know for sure though. But his explanation did make sense at least.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's better than in part 1 when he could have easily beaten people himself but chose not to. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with Boingo Stand is that it show the future, sure, but the predictions are too vague. Being so vague actually is the major problem of the Stand.
>> ARTICLE
Also, it doesn't show you what you need to do to shape the future to your best interests. It just shows you a very vague guide to one specific future. If you don't like the future Thoth shows you, it won't help you create a different one.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm surprised Dio doesn't keep Boingo around himself for his future seeing...guess there's no point in knowing the future if you can't change it?

I would say that DIO probably genuinely believes that he can never be stopped, so he probably doesn't feel the need to see the future.

>Man this ED is rough...this art is just so bleh , makes me really appreciate the normal one!

I love how wacky it is. It's the last one we'll be seeing IIRC. So now you can back to appreciating the normal one.

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.

According an interview with Araki Dio Brando wasn't actually named after Ronnie James Dio, that's pure coincidence. Dio is just the italian word for god, Araki didn't realize the connection to the musician until people told him.

**Yare yare daze**

I loved this episode because we had Polnareff in a funny situation,Hol Horse and a ~~Oingo~~ Hol x Boingo ending! I wanna talk about the first five minutes where Hol meets Dio.Was that Dio's stand?If it is ,it could be either some sort of teleportation or stopping time.Even though stopping the time doesnt match the theme of stands,but since the op has lots of clocks,a clock tower the crew is climbing ,it might be.Also symbolizes that the crusaders are on a short time limit to save Holly.I will be watching the next episode now since I'm super busy tomorrow and will try to join the discussion again.Have a good day/night people
>> ARTICLE
I don't blame Hol Horse for being nervous around Dio. He probably has a very frightening presence. 

I saw a small animation someone made for the Dio and Hol Horse scene before. [Jojo Part 3 spoilers just in case](/s "They wanted to show how Dio could get behind Hol Horse without touching the spider webs. I won't reveal what happens because spoilers but let's just say it did involve Dio crawling between Hol Horse's legs. Something tells me Dio doesn't actually do that there.")

Probably not a good idea to butt in front of a guy that can make a gun appear out of thin air. But of course these idiots don't know that.

Since it's been nearly a year since I last saw this I didn't remember why Hol Horse had that suitcase. A change of clothes? Nearly every character in this anime wears the same clothes day in and day out. Ah of course he has Boingo tied up inside.

"Don't work yourself up. You'll get sick."

Too late for that.

I like how in Boingo's manga Hol Horse' eyes go right through his hat.

He did it! He stuck his fingers up Polnareff's nose! It's just as hilarious the second time around.

There we go guys. Best ED. Even better than the Oingo Boingo one.

> There we go guys. Best ED. Even better than the Oingo Boingo one.

Nah. Oingo's singing is way better than Hol Horse's.

Eh I feel the way Hol Horse sounds kinda unsure makes it better for me but to each his own.

You should probably still spoiler tag that description of the fan animation. [reason why](/s "One of the possible speculations at this point is that The World allows teleportation, and this basically confirms that it doesn't do that, leaving only very few other options.")
>> ARTICLE
Done. Just to be safe.
>> ARTICLE
Hol Horse is actually a good singer. So was Oingo, now that I think about it. And Boingo is good enough.
>> ARTICLE
This time on HoHo's Bizarre Adventure he puts a kid in a suitcase so he only has to buy one plane ticket.

I'm going to drop calling him Hanibal. His appearances are infrequent enough that the fact he first arrived on an elephant has probably been forgotten by most. So where's the elephant now? Is it still wandering around that town? Has someone else adopted it? Is it on a Bizarre Adventure of its own?

I like HoHo. So many of the other bad guys are obsessed with helping Lord Dio, serving Lord Dio, and impressing Lord Dio, but HoHo mostly just wants to get paid. He helps Dio because he sides with the most powerful person, but in this episode he actually entertains the idea that that might not be Dio. I really liked that he thought about how much easier it might have been to take out Dio and switch sides.   
We then get to see Dio demonstrating a Stand ability. [I speculated on what this might be in a reply to another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4b5bqu/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d16sf3j), but it's suitably mysterious that we cannot yet know for sure.  
Also I'd just like to take a moment to address how dissatisfying I find it that Dio is the bad guy again. It kind of invalidates the ending of Phantom Blood, and I get the strong feeling that the creator didn't intend to bring him back at first. Don't get me wrong, he's a fantastic villain but I don't think it's essential that the villain be him.

This was a really nice part one, and set the stage very well for the next episode. I'm glad we have the background on Thoth from the Oingo Boingo episode, especially because it feels like we know more about it than HoHo. He doesn't yet seem to have understood how the predictions from Thoth can be limiting as well as informative, though I'm sure he'll discover that soon.

This was a terrible episode to watch in the library, was laughing too much.

I imagine the Egyptians are like "Who the hell are these crazy foreigners". Especially with Joseph. Seems like he gets particularly screwed with everyone else thinking he's gone off the rails.

Also, [hnnng](https://my.mixtape.moe/yfpnie.webm). Poor Mariah, your only crime is being associated with Dio. Wish we had more of her.

I did not expect this kind of humour from Jojo, really caught off guard lol

I hate when shows make characters look ugly on purpose, no need for that bleh.

Alright Jojo more unexpectedness with this boob joke.

I mean why not carry something more dangerous or in actual pockets?

This magnetism music though...

Now she has knives?!

How did Avdol move? Was the magnetism strong enough at that time? This girl was terrible at knowing her own powers, shame she's such a dumdum since she was actually pretty cool.



>> ARTICLE

If you noticed, we actually have two comment faces that came from this episode. We have [#josephcrying](http://i.imgur.com/6IeYXqb.jpg) and [#jojosafari](http://i.imgur.com/o0fsib2.jpg).

[](#josephcrying "Not a lot of comment faces cut off the rest of the screen.") [](#jojosafari "Bet you guys didn't even notice Avdol in the background and get spoiled before he came back.")

So in the year or so since this episode aired, I've seen multiple people complain about the ending of this episode. They claim that the ending with Mariah being crushed contrasts so much with the light-hearted comedy of the rest of the fight, that they get completely turned off.

I completely disagree with this. I don't think there is that much of a contrast there at all. She didn't die, it wasn't super gory, and it wasn't very dark at all. It was not that different from Joseph and Avdol almost getting hit by a train, the guy getting impaled by his own nails, or Joseph almost getting pulled into the escalator.

I get a bit annoyed when I see that complaint because it makes me think that they weren't paying attention to the rest of the fight, and were only paying attention to the comedic moments.
>> ARTICLE
On another note, I really dig some of the female character designs in JoJo (Lisa Lisa and Mariah especially). It's like the animators realized that athletic booties exist! XD
>> ARTICLE
Dude I thought the ending was the best part. She was fucking with them the whole episode and so the ending was so satisfying. 
>> ARTICLE
Something I really appreciate about Stardust Crusaders in general, which is quite apparent here, is how human the background characters are. They may be foreigners in a Japanese manga from the late 80's/early 90's, but they're treated as normal people and we get to see a wide variety of people with varying jobs. Not only do Joseph and Avdol choose not to derail the train because of the accident it would cause, but the anime version makes a point of having the townspeople note the cut track and shut down the cut line so we know there wasn't a horrible accident in the area right after this arc. It just strikes me as really good-natured writing, and it makes the bad things that happen in this city as a result of DIO's servants more tragic than if they were happening to totally unrelatable gaijin. 

You can actually feel the blows to Avdol's image and Joseph's pride during the compromising position scene. It's like an old hag beating you with an umbrella: the embarrassment will leave worse scars than any physical strike. The joke aged pretty well too: no matter the era, you just don't want to be pressed against your friend's genitals while Egyptian children watch. It's a pretty universal thing.

Mariah's inventiveness really makes her one of my favourite Part 3 villains. A punchghost vs some sort of strange killing gimmick is one thing, but photograph vines and pyrokinesis vs a slowly growing magnetic force is the kind of weird matchup that makes later parts of Jojo's so compelling! Plus the dual theme of magnetic attraction and Mariah's attractiveness is just a really interesting dynamic. She needs to stay just close enough for Bastet to work, while staying just barely outside her enemy's range. So simple to beat in theory, but so difficult to trap in practice.

I do love how Joseph makes his Part 2 philosophy completely clear this episode. The Joestar Secret Technique is never about leaving a fight, but about changing the circumstances to get the upper hand and protect others. I kind of wish Joseph's sex appeal was just a little stronger or Mariah had a little more pity. It would have been cool to have a Stand battle end with a respectful draw and a retirement that doesn't involve near-death!

Yes, Joseph compensated for his screwed-up prosthetic hand by using Hamon on the sewer water to hold himself down while Hermit Purple was focused on the wires. One of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it extra anime details.
>> ARTICLE
That's an interesting observation about the background characters. So many shows use them as dumb fodder, and while JoJo is definitely guilty of that at times, it's nice to see some human in them occasionally.
>> ARTICLE
These last two episodes were probably my favourite so far this season. They had an interesting fight against a weird stand, and the humour was great.

It also focused on Joseph, who might be my favourite character. I really liked how unlike some of the earlier episodes with a focus on him they didn't make him completely incompetent for most of the fight. Instead he and Avdol are caught off guard by the unorthodox tactics that Mariah uses.
>> ARTICLE
When this season was airing, this episode was the point were I gave in and started reading through the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Bastet is definitely the beginning of a trend in JoJo, where the heroes will be suddenly thrown into battle against an extremely unusual Stand power and try to desperately figure out how it works and what they can do.
>> ARTICLE
JJBA is full of puzzles
>> ARTICLE
Like I said during yesterday's episode Mariah doesn't even need to run now. Avdol and Joseph are too slow.

As you can see this is the ultimate episode for yaoi fans.

Oh god it's the old lady! She feels lead on! This takes place in the 80s doesn't it? Homosexual relationships were probably still frowned upon.

"Hurry! Hurry Avdol! I'm starting to cry!"

This is totally a typical Joseph moment.

"Help me! Oh my goood!"

And they land right beside Mariah.

"Son of a bi- Oh shit a train is coming!"

Well snap one plan gets ruined and Mariah loses her cool.

And now probably the most lewd thing to happen in the Jojo series since Joseph peeked on his own mother bathing, Boob expansion via a shirt full of nuts and bolts!

What Joseph says is true. While he has turned and ran in the opposite direction of an opponent no opponent has gone undefeated if he was involved in the fight.

Polnareff calling people stupid. Pot, meet kettle.

The magnetism is getting really strong now. The poor guy's bike!

This is the second enemy stand user to admit they're attracted to a Jojo.

And they continue on their way to their previous task: getting some breakfast.

Poor Mariah. All bones broken. Retired.

>  This takes place in the 80s doesn't it? Homosexual relationships were probably still frowned upon.

Yes, it takes place in 1987. This particular section was probably released in 91 or 92?

A few of them (Mariah included) will spend the rest of their days eating from a straw, I'm sure.  

At least that's what I think "unable to recover" means, if it's not "unable to recover in time to defend DIO".
>> ARTICLE
I would advise against that, to be honest. Please save yourself the embarrassment.

My time for an edit. Thread goes up an hour "earlier" because in my country, we've shifted our clocks forward one hour. If it makes it easier for you, then that's great!

/u/CardonT, I think this mention will notify you?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, in that case it will last until March 27th
>> ARTICLE
So I like this part much more than the first part. We see some cool stuff like Mariah being a stone cold motherfucker, watching people get run over by trains. I also think that she might just be really into gay dudes. She was watching Joseph and Avdol's predicament for minutes when she could probably just kill them and admitted that if she wasn't literally crazy for DIO she would be into Joseph. It makes sense that she's into older men, DIO is like 118 now.

 I also enjoy how it is much more creative stand usage and not ORAORAORAORA to win. It helps that Bastet is entirely passive. The magnet tricks were cool and that ending was just as brutal as the first time I saw it. I disagree that she is alive, she should be dead.

All in all, not my favourite stand fight but better than I remembered.

Man did I not like this episode.. Stardust Crusaders is my least favourite part, but I've still being enjoying it, this episode however was just silly, and not in a good way as has been the case with many other episodes.

I spent this whole episode incredulously saying "Just kill her" to the screen, because seriously. Why didn't they just kill her? At any point Dadvol could have imolated her, and JoJo even had his Stand around her neck at one point. But instead they just kept being idiots.

The core problem with this episode was that it was in two parts. If it was in one then I'd probably have been fine with it, but it wasn't. Anubis was a good enough bad guy to fill two episodes because the first was mostly lead up to the French/JoJoJo fight, but this didn't have anything like that, instead it was two episodes of watching some characters be ineffectual.

I cannot imagine that there'll be any other Stands as pathetic as this one, and hopefully if they are they won't be given two episodes. I look forward to the next episode, because I'll enjoy it more than I did this one.



...Wait. What the hell was that ring made of?
>> ARTICLE
She kept her distance.

Remember that Dio minions know, to a big extent, everything about the Crusaders stands, that go from power to range. Avdol Stand is a middle range Stand, while Bastet is a long range stand.

I don't think it's very cute either. Before this aired, people kept hyping up Iggy as a great character, and I was really disappointed when he was introduced.

So I've heard, not sure how anyone would like him!

Because he's a proud and naughty zany doggo!

He does get better, he's just a shithead at the beginning because, as Jotaro said, he was just taken from his house, flown to Egypt, and told to fight a 100 year old vampire.

Home would be a better word. He didn't actually have a house.

Hahah, that was what I thought, but he did have a pretty sweet gig going on before Avdol and Joseph caught him.

Anubis is the first of a type of Stand we will return to see in the series: "The Rogue Stand".

Rouge Stands can live without a user, and perform their normal powers without being comanded by a user.

In Anubis case, the Stand is the Sword, otherwise he won't be able to deflect Silver Chariot's attacks.
>> ARTICLE
Rogue stands seem so weird. How would they be created then? Do they just ditch their user after they die or something?
>> ARTICLE
Well since Anubis was an egyptian god perhaps he just possessed a sword and so there never was a creation process.
>> ARTICLE
The stands aren't actually gods, they just "suggest" them. Just like the stands in season one aren't actually tarot cards. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah I thought I remembered hearing that this was the real Anubis when this first aired.

there's a stand in [later part spoiler](/s "part 4 that does not have a user at all, and instead traps passersby, they give no hint as to how it came about")

I always felt bad for Chaka. He killed his dad and was then mind controlled by a magic sword. Actually what is it with Japan and cursed swords/swords that slowly kill the person that uses it?

I love this interaction between Chaka and Polnareff. Just two enemies standing side by side, waiting for the other to stab them.


I freaking love Anubis. Easily one of my favourite stands in season two with my one gripe being that it doesn't really have anything too cool about it except for the whole "rogue stand" thing. I makes up for it by having one of the coolest fights. I think I'm just a sucker for rogue stands in general.
>> ARTICLE
>I think I'm just a sucker for rogue stands in general.

Me too. My favorite Rogue Stand is the series is... I will put a spoiler on it, but even so, I won't say it's name(since is a big spoiler), so I will just leave this here:

[Part 5](/n " "The Requiem plays quietly..." ")
>> ARTICLE
well [same spoiler](/s "technically that's just polnareff's powered up stand that he has no control over, not a stand without a user but I'm arguing semantics sorry")
>> ARTICLE
I consider it a Stand who had gone Rogue. If the user can't control it, and there is no more connection between the two, it's a Rogue stand, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Same with [Part 6](/n "C-Moon")
>> ARTICLE
All you had to put was part 5. But yeah, that stand is pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the camera work when Silver chariot was going around the pillar. That was quite neat. 

This new stand is interesting too, with a weapon itself being a stand. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the fight around that pillar is short, but it's so awesome.
>> ARTICLE
So this episode brings something to light that's kinda funny to stop and think about.

Back in the finale for Stardust Crusaders Season 1, we saw [the 9 enemy stand users](http://i.imgur.com/rhEK7Vb.jpg) that the Crusaders will be encountering in Season 2. As we now know, the guy with the cane in front is N'Doul, the little guy is Boingo, and I'd assume one of the ones next to him is Oingo.

Now that we've met Anubis, just think. One of those 9 users is a sword. Like, just a straight up sword. I always chuckle a little bit when I imagine a sword wearing a big robe and bouncing around.

This episode also brings us an extremely subtle reference to Part 4. [Part 4](/n "If you noticed near the end of the episode, in the barbershop, Jotaro is reading a magazine about marine biology. I'll link the picture below. In case you weren't aware, between Parts 3 and 4, Jotaro actually went and got a PhD in marine biology, so I love that David added him reading a magazine on that very subject in a barbershop.")

Not really. One of them is way shorter than the others.

Another possibility would be that it's [S3](/s "Vanilla Ice, since he's actually the 10th Stand user. He doesn't have an Egyptian god card and is therefore none of the Egypt 9")

Maybe Anubis possessed someone to be able to meet Dio, no?

Don't bring logic into JoJo.

If it was possessing somebody then, why was it just sitting in the road?

Anubis drains life from those around it. So it's safe to assume that someone who physically wields it is drained of life much faster, forcing Anubis to change hosts from time to time.

Anubis is kind of a dick, so maybe he wanted to slaughter some random farmers for no reason.

* Sweet sword dupes from Polnareff. Didn't know his sword was a crossbow too.

The album serves as an introduction to the band after *Last Train Home*'s use in Stardust Crusaders. Nice to see JoJo boosting the popularity of a band that not many people will have heard of.

This season is getting *really, really* good.

Is the OP always the same? The reason that I ask is that whilst watching it today I noticed that Silver Chariot is shown with two swords, if its the same every time then its a bit of a coincidence that the episode I noticed this is the same one in which French Frenchington laments on having only one sword. Im guessing that hes going to get the other one pretty soon. [Possible Spoilers for next episode](/s "Probably in the fight against JoJoJo which is probably going to happen next episode. 
If we rate obviousness of foreshadowing on a scale of 1-10 then Id say that the Frenchmans Not even JoJoJo knows about *this* secret fighting technique that I have! is probably about a 7 (Mark the Nazis Next week I return to my homeland to marry my sweetheart was a 10). I dont get why they specified JoJoJo here, if hed said Not even my fellow Stardust Crusaders know about this attack then that would have included JoJoJo without being so on the nose.  
Having said all of that, if there is not a fight between those two tomorrow then Im going to look like a right idiot. And as Im away tomorrow I wont even know until Sunday.")

Anubis is a god Ive always found interesting, largely because of his parents (quick reminder that Egyptian mythology is a mess so everything Im about to say is only true some of the time). Nut and Geb had five children Osiris, Isis, Seth, Nephthys, and Hathor. Osiris and Isis married, as did Seth and Nephthys, back then incest wasnt really a thing, or rather it was so much of a thing that it was unnotable. Osiris and Isis had a son in the form of Horus who carried on the incestuous tradition by marrying his aunt. Nephthys wished to also have a child but Seth had other ideas. How did Nepthys deal with this situation? She did what any rational person would do, she seduced her Brother/Husbands Brother/Sisters Husband Osiris, got pregnant with his child, then convinced Seth it was his. This child was Anubis.  
Anubis was originally the God of the Death, the one who looked over the underworld, but lost this role to his father. The canonical reason for this is that Osiris himself died, and so took rule over the Underworld where he now resided. It was actually due to the combining of tribes, with the Priests forming a story which allowed for both Gods to have reasonably held the position at some point. After being made redundant Anubis became something of a full time Psychopomp (that is to say a post-death guide).  
Stand Anubis does some well good killing, seemingly able to drain the life from beings touching it (as it did with those flies), which is the main link I can see.  
I really like the idea of Stand Anubis. I know that Sword what makes you well good with sword but also controls your mind has been done before, but this is a pretty good implementation of it. I like the fact that the Stand itself is actually the one in control here, something which I cannot offhand remember happening before. Though that raises the question of who went to Dios meeting on behalf of it, and who left it where it was found.

Anyway, Ill find out for sure on Sunday when I watch the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Why is he even being left behind, he can see through the eyes of his Stand. 

In theory he can't. Do you remember the fight between Polnareff and the devil? Chariot couldn't get a hit on the doll because Polnareff couldn't see shit from below the bed. That's stand specific afaik, but hierophant needed Joseph's hermit in order to see inside Joseph's brain, so I guess Kakyoin cannot see through hierophant.
>> ARTICLE
He can, but Hierophant Green shares the damage that Kakyoin received.
>> ARTICLE
> he can see through the eyes of his Stand

In Hierophant Green's case (and most singular close/mid ranged Stands), damage is shared between the Stand and the User, meaning if one entity got their eyesight taken away, the other wouldn't be able to see either.

> Silver Chariot

The OP is consistent :3 My conjecture to why he mentioned Jotaro specifically is because he's closest with Jotaro compared to the other members on the team due to their age and mannerism and whatnot. So it's like a 'Not even my most trusted friend knows about this secret that I'm showing you!' sort of exclamation.
>> ARTICLE
I'd forgotten about the fact that the damage sharing goes both way. That makes more sense now, thanks for reminding me.
>> ARTICLE
> If any of us are by themselves they might get attacked by Dios guys or something. Except Fancy Guy who can be left blind in a Hospital without any fear of him being attacked. Why is he even being left behind, he can see through the eyes of his Stand.

YAY I'm so glad Kakyoin isn't blind! But sad that they're leaving him behind :(

Unrealistic that people would find Iggy cute but ok. 

Iggy- 2. Pol-0. 

Tough times on these Egyptian streets for this kid. Looks like he'll get a sword and everything will be daijobu.

No big bully you are not the chosen one! 

Wow thats a lot of blood to shoot out of his hand. 

This guy is like Egyptian Saber. With his hair he could probably be the next JoJo.

Don't try to take the special sword from Egyptian Saber...oh whoops accidentally stabbed. 

Oh that tool was his dad? What a dick. I mean RIP Dad. 

This sword is so *edgy* randomly killing everyone.

This is some Katanagatari shit right here. 

Annubis is a pretty legit god. I'm surprised there was another Stand position open. 

Oh this kid is an edgy villain now.

I'm so glad Pol wasn't corrupted...but destroy the sword!

**Current Reference Counter: 50**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.

This is a pretty scary stand tbh. It's like the thing, but with a sword instead of a thing.

Anubis hype!

* Oh, they're gonna separate from Kakyoin.

* Haha, that reciept is total bullshit. It says the bed costs 4 times as much as the medications. And a hospital bill for less than 100k is bullshit in and of itself anyway. But, I'll give them props for getting the Arabic right. No grammar mistakes AFAIK. If anyone's interested in the full thing, just get me a screenshot and I'll edit in the translation

* Heh... They think Iggy is cute. How innocent

* Iggy's troll face is simply legendary

* So the version I'm watching has no subs for the OP lyrics. Anyone mind linking me to one with lyrics?

* Ooh, that's a nice looking sword

* A stubborn sword, too. Haha

* inb4 the sword is a stand user

* What? I was right!?

* I'm gonna need to see more of the sword before deciding its relation to Anubis

* Oh, well... It looks like a Jackal headed guy so that's okay

* I just realized that the sword must've been wearing a robe and walking around when they spotted the 9 stand users

* So it's a Polnareff battle. I was actually looking forward to Iggy fighting... Because, you know... Dog vs dog...

* So while it seems to be slower than Chariot, it obviously has more power

* Ok...That was the coolest Stand attack I've ever seen. Props to you PolPol

* Iggy saves the day 3.0

* Freaking PolPol. Get your priorities straight

* RIP PolPol

* I'm not entirely sure about Anubis. He is usually depicted as the god of death, and it sure seemed like the sword drained the life of everything around it. That seems to be the only similarity I can tell of so far

It's nice to stop and think about that. I always get a good chuckle.

As I thought, it's a lot cooler with subs
>> ARTICLE
as someone else noted, it's possible anubis had another user at the time


>> ARTICLE
Anubis had me thinking, that if there are Stands that have enough of their own conscious that they aren't just used by one master, are there Stands, rogue or otherwise, who's powers are that they have their own psychic powers and their thought processes and wills are separate from their masters'? And if there is, could it be possible for a conscious Stand to have a strong enough will that it could even do something like making it's own Stand?

Crazy theories aside, Iggy is being such a ZANY DOGGY again today! The other crusaders really should have taken him more seriously when he was barking at Anubis. Polpol especially was silly this episode, he even knew when he was fighting Chaka that the sword was the Stand but he took it anyway!
>> ARTICLE
I won't go into specific examples because future part spoilers, but Stands' consciousness - if they have any - are just reflections of certain aspects of the Users' personality. Maybe something they keep hidden from others, maybe an aspect that even they don't know themselves until they are put on the spot, etc. So no matter how intelligent and independent they may seem, they are still just extensions of the Users' own consciousness.

That's real nice. While Walk Like An Egyptian and Last Train Home are not bad ending themes by any means I love Roundabout way more.

Hopefully for Part 4 we get a song the end of the episode can transition into.


>> ARTICLE
Best song I can think of to have lead into the ED for Part 4 would be [Crazy On You by Heart](http://youtu.be/OZuW6BH_Vak).  But I would much rather have [Build Me Up, Buttercup](http://youtu.be/iol0B-clFFM) because it fits the tone of the earlier half of Part 4 much better.

I've been pushing [Money For Nothing](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iwDDswGsJ60) by Dire Straits for the ED. Could you imagine the build up?

Right just gonna go listen to all three of these songs. Being only 23 years old means a lot of this music I've never heard before. Jojo being filled with musical references is a beautiful thing.
>> ARTICLE
On my Ipad right now I have 47 songs from artists referenced by Jojo. If you want to find sixties to eighties rock and jazz, just pick a Jojo character and go from there. It gets better when stands start being named after music also. We have the very first one now with Cream and they only get better and more blatant from here.

Holy shit this transition is as good as the one with Zepelli!Maybe even better.

Wow that's brutal. I really feel the ED lost something when it couldn't do the transitions into it.

Holy FUCK. I think this is easily the best episode yet for part 3. This fight was intense and very reminiscent how I felt back watching Part 2's battles. This fight really illustrates why some stand battles are just straight up better than others by a long shot. JoJo is at its best when characters are pushed to their absolute limit. When you see characters almost dying, gravely injured etc makes the fight just so much more better to watch with greater investment. 

While some stands have interesting gimmicks, in the end that is all they are. A lot of the enemy stands were weaker compared to the SCs and had to rely on rather cheap one trick pony gimmicks in order to win. Those fights were more solve the mystery trick and it is an easy win. When characters are pitted against opponents who are straight up more powerful than them (so essentially our heroes are the under dogs) and have to outsmart them to win, the show is easily much more enjoyable and interesting to watch. This fight and fights against Anubis and Pet Shop as well as many of the Part 2 fights are the reason why I ultimately love JoJo. 

Also Polnareff showing why he's again the best JoJo character in part 3 by far IMO. If this is where he goes out. 

[](#poltears)

Then I salute him.

Agreed, its that last ditch effort that really makes JoJo characters so fantastic and easy to root for.

Counter-intuitively, that's exactly why D'Arby the Gambler was such a great Stand battle. Even if there wasn't a single drop of blood shed or a single ORA, D'Arby took out half of the group that faced him. He was decisively better at gambling and trickery than any of them were, and all his Stand needed to do was to force them into a situation where his favoured skills were important and their usual skills and powers were nearly useless.

There are many later enemy Stands that turn the battle into something bizarre, but the ones that are the most beloved push the heroes into a hopeless situation that they can still logically get out of. Whether it's a Stand that can physically take out buildings or one that needs to be beaten via aggressive Christian rap, the important part is the overwhelming threat of the situation and the desperate struggle of the characters.
>> ARTICLE
It's just that Star Platinum is incredibly over powered, so they need to have some sort of trick to even be able to fight him. And Vanilla is probably even more OP. He would be able to defeat anyone, even ultimate Kars.
>> ARTICLE
All I can say is that if you love these sorts of intense fights, I hope your body Is ready for the battle with DIO.  I watched it originally with 3 of my friends, and we were all leaping out of our seats and shouting at the TV for the entirety of it.

Totally agree with you that Jojo is at its best in these sorts of scenarios. Vanilla Ice is a beast, and it's one of the few times in Stardust Crusaders where you honestly don't know if the protagonists are going to make it out alive due to the fact that he's clearly insane.

I forgot to post this yesterday but as we approach the end of the series, I will start posting every character's song, either as a tribute in the episode they die or at the end of the series. You won't have to worry about spoilers, I'll post links to a youtube mirror that doesn't show comments or related videos and I'll watch the video itself to make sure it's spoiler free. If I can, I'll link the Donut's music videos because I really like them and they're subtitled, but unfortunately some of them have vanished from youtube recently.

That said, here is the tribute to the Scarlet Crusader who (again) is no longer part of this journey - [Fire of Soul](http://viewpure.com/u4OYH2Cs7Ms?start=0&end=0)!

Nobody can escape from [this face of terror](https://i.imgur.com/C1OMwid.png). Nobody without the ability to erase themselves from existance anyway.

[No Joseph, they aren't.](https://i.imgur.com/l2rbudS.png) Avdol at least isn't.

You know shit's weird when [people start having 8-packs.](https://i.imgur.com/AaDv6IF.png)

FoolDio was a great idea. Shame it misfired so spectacularly.

[Polnareff saying what everyone has been thinking for the entire season.](https://i.imgur.com/5BvpayW.png) Iggy chose the wrong series to be a dog in. But fucking damn it, who had thought that out of all villains, the one with the least intimidating name and stand name would by far be the strongest and most violent.

Iggy still has a chance to survive! Though he really should retire after this battle, we all know how DIO feels about dogs and Iggy is in a really bad condition anyway.

Polnareff with the tongue action again. Vanilla Ice will never rerorero again.

[But I refuse!](https://i.imgur.com/qV1Ka84.png) Wrong damn part, Vanilla Ice! Refusing Is Unbreakable doesn't start until next week! And Polnareff even says that this is "Kuraisi". Could we argue that sand crystals are like "diamundo"s?

Yes! Sandman to the rescue! Best Dog is gonna save Best Frenchma-- [oh fuck this shit.](https://i.imgur.com/XnRkPL4.png)

----

Without spoiling anything, next episode looks pretty hopeless just judging from this one. Avdol is dead, Polnareff's death hasn't been confirmed yet but it looks like he's gone as well, and Iggy is as good as dead and certainly unable to finish Vanilla Ice Cream on his own. The remaining three crusaders aren't even aware of Ice's abilities, and with the exception of Star Platinum's speed their abilities are useless against it anyway.

----

This is a bit unrelated but I forgot to join the rewatch when it started and only joined when you guys already were at Stardust Crusaders. I just now finished rewatching Phantom Blood and now I'm really confused by it. I liked it when I first watched it, then I watched Battle Tendency and Stardust Crusaders and thought those were way better but still liked the first part. Then I read the Phantom Blood manga and didn't like it at all. Now I've rewatched it in all its glorious BD detail and think it's great. What is wrong with that part?

And is it just me or does Araki [really like](https://i.imgur.com/CtoIMSD.png) [this kind](https://i.imgur.com/986YmVS.png) [of hairstyle](https://i.imgur.com/xePzC8D.png)?

MrDonutTheDonut's JoJo videos are great. The Joseph one (OH MY GOD, JAAHHH) is a favorite of mine. I'd post it here but there are spoilers at the end so I won't.

About Phantom Blood, a while ago, even before the PB anime aired, I was looking through a scanlation site, trying to find a new series to read, and there was JoJo. But I couldn't get into it, not only because of the old scans, but I got tired of reading DIO being a dick to JoJo. But I really liked the anime, and while it is still my least favorite part, it was really fun to watch. And also it had Speedwagon, how can you not love Speedwagon
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'll post the ones with spoilers in the final episode (or at least the link to his mega account, since some of the videos have been taken down from youtube).

I think a major part of my enjoyment this time were Speedwagon, the incredible colours from the BD version, and of course Roundabout. The manga version just falls short on all three of these (it has Speedwagon of course, but it just isn't as fun when you can't hear him shouting in the background).

>reality is cruel.

Jojo is too real today.

I know we aren't finished with Vanilla Ice yet, but he is an amazing villain an we see it today with him kicking the shit out of Iggy for making him damage an image of DIO. Along with a terrifying stand that could probably [Part 3](/s "go toe to toe with ZA WARUDO") makes him a great penultimate villain.

Polnareff's death scene is great in the saddest way. Unlike Avdol's which was shocking due to the speed, Polnareff's was long and drawn out. Araki is fond of sudden deaths but I think that when he does draw them out they are very well done.

And to make this horrible tragedy of an arc (Two deaths and one gravely wounded character) slightly better, [Here is a video of someone making fun of Vanilla Ice's name](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ljlZMJFOFyE)

I actually teared up a bit the first time I saw this episode. It's odd: on the first watch, throughout most of Stardust Crusaders I found myself a bit let down by the monster-of-the-week format and thought that none of what was happening had much impact on the plot. But whenever the Crusaders start dying towards the end here, I realized just how much all of those earlier episodes made me care about all the characters. Every death hit me like a half-ton truck of emotions, and I found myself going back to watch all the hilarious and happy misadventures these guys got into in the past. Each episode develops the characters and their relationships with one another so subtly that you don't even realize it's happening, and then they start dying towards the end and you want nothing more than for things to go back to the way they were. 

Watching Iggy and Polnareff, two of the funniest and most lighthearted characters, get the life beaten out of them is truly depressing. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I just found this...  :/

Anyways:

So after I watched this, I decided I need some happiness in my life and ended up binging 8 episodes of Konosuba.... No regrets (dat episode 9 doe)... I might've ended up giggling in inappropriate places though:

* This guy really has the scariest stand so far. It just gives me goosebumps.

* A guy who can like...travel in dimensions and your first attempt is to barricade the door?

* Ahhh... I'm beginning to think Avdol is actually dead. Fuck that... I'm beginning to think everyone except the Joestars is going to die.

* PolPol finally realized that not all Stand users come with a manual that teaches you how to defeat them

* Jesus, PolPol's totally lost it

* Ooooh, impersonating DIO for a sneak attack. Love it!

* Well fuck... Fuck... Fuck... FUCK!!

* Fucking hell, stop kicking Iggy!!! STOP WITH THE FKING DOG TORTURE, ARAKI!!

* God fucking damn it... I don't see Iggy surviving this

* Oh...He can't see outside it... That's... a good weakness.

* Who the fuck stays alive after getting stabbed in the mouth!??

* This guy is fucking crazy... and smart. That's never a combination you want to see in an enemy

* I know you're going with option 1, but... Option 3 looks...more realistic.

* Holy shit! Holy shit.... PolPol lost... Fking hellllllllll... I did not think it would go like that...at all. I think this is the closest I've ever been to binging the rest of it.

Dat screenshot of the day. Too spoopy.

Smurf's thread is late! This must be the work of an enemy stand! Hurry everyone! We've got to save Smurf!

Yes Polnareff! Avdol is telling you to fight! Kick Ice's ass!

Yes let's just put furniture in front of the door to stop the stand that makes things disintegrate. There's no way this plan can fail!

Iggy's tail points straight up! He's a crusader all right!

The front of his foot! Ice cut off Polnareff's toes!

Dio: Wow Polnareff sure is being loud down there.

This was kinda a good plan they had. Dio would wonder why Ice was taking so long to kill Polnareff and would be curious. Unfortunately the plan didn't work.

And now for, in my opinion, the most brutal and most graphic beating in all of Jojo so far. Ice stomping on poor Iggy.

Even while being beaten to death, Iggy is still our little shit. Grinning at Ice like that. What a badass.

Eat that Ice! Stabbed in the mouth!

Polnareff loses two fingers to that bastard!

Part of his thigh too! These are grave injuries!

And poor Iggy, beaten and near death, still stands up to help Polnareff. Man's fuckin best friend.

I believe this is the first stand fight to last more than 2 episodes.

I really like the way they laid out Vanilla Ice. [next episode](/s "It's technically 2 episodes, but since the beginning and end of the fight are half-episodes, they get to play with the pacing and have cliffhangers where they wouldn't have been if it was a traditional 2-episode split.")

I think Smurf is already dead. Ran into a Vanilla Ice cosplayer and we all know what happened next.

D'Arby the Gamer technically was 3 episodes (introduced at the end of an episode that I wouldn't count, then 2 episodes, then a few more minutes). But I do believe this is the longest fight yet.

I didn't really bother with the rewatch because I started and finished Jojo only 3 weeks ago, but this episode was so good that I had to rewatch it. I still cringed when Iggy was getting the shit beat out of him and nearly teared up when Polnareff died. Easily the best episode of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck.  
Well fuck. I just.. I wasnt expecting that ending. I was sure that there would be some asspull to save the Frenchman, but there wasnt. I suppose it might now be that theres some way to get them out of the Dark Dimension, but who knows?

There are a few things in JBA which make it fairly obvious that it was serialised, and the Stand names are definitely one of them. I realised today (after going back and counting them) that Jr Darby was the last of the 9 Egyptian Gods (also I looked it up, and it seems that there is a concept of 9 specific special gods in Egyptian Mythology, its called the Ennrad, however for some *bizarre* reason it isnt the 9 used)(also I didnt do a God/Stand comparison for Jr Darbys Stand because I had no idea who that God was), which means that the Stands in Stardust Crusaders are named after the 22 cards from the Tarot, 9 arbitrary Egyptian Gods, and then at least two *other things*. I cannot imagine that the creator went into it with that as the plan. I could accept that theyd planned both the Tarot and Gods, but no more than that.  

Vanilla Ice remains a cool villain, and I assume will continue to do so into tomorrow. Hes a really good implementation of the unhinged, mentally broken bad guy. His powers are cool, but not broken; or at least that was the case until he just started to ignore the fact that he was dead. Silver stabbed him through the brainstem, thats not something you can just shrug off. This is one of the few bits in Part 3 when Ive felt that something was actually unfair towards one of the protagonists. The Frenchman managed to figure out the bad guys weaknesses, then plan, set up, and execute a killing attack. He earned that victory (incidentally, if were doing a post rewatch final thoughts type thread then Im probably going to be using that word an awful lot in talking about my issues with Part 3 compared with 1 & 2), but for no apparent reason the bad guy didnt die.

I liked that Fools Oranges shapeshifting powers are getting more use. The whole Dio thing was a really cool plan, although the fact that the fake Dio spoke does mean that Iggy should have been able to communicate with the Crusaders just fine, but we can ignore that. It also lead to that bit where the bad guy was just savagely beating Iggy which was actually an effective iteration of killing the dog due to the fact that its a specific dog. Vanilla Ice was just laying into him, it brought to mind Dios introduction but more drawn out and against a smaller dog.

Anyway, I look forwards to seeing how this whole thing turns out tomorrow. Will the other guys meet Vanilla Ice? Is the Frenchman actually dead? Whatever happened to HoHos Elephant? Hopefully Ill find out tomorrow.

From now on, except Dio's The World, all Stands names are based on bands, musicians, albuns or songs. =)

>but for no apparent reason the bad guy didnt die.

Oh, there is a reason, and the reason is obvious.

Even if Iggy could, he never really wanted to because of the treatment he received. He was just too damn proud and stubborn of a dog.

That was the Anubis fight, they just didn't show sword because of spoilers.

The dual wielding was a while ago when he was possessed by Anubis. They changed Anubis's sword to a regular Silver Chariot one for the OP to not spoil too much.
>> ARTICLE
>What the hell PolPol dies without showing dual wield Silver Chariot!? 

He did, it was during the Anubis fight, the OP didn't show the sword in detail

Oooh,I get it
>> ARTICLE
A Stand that creates an unstoppable invisible void that destroys anything it touches and allows you to protect youself by travelling inside of it. VS a French swordsman who can't take a poop without risking his life and a farting dog with sand control. I love Jojo's matchups.

You know, I wonder if Iggy's fake DIO actually had a face. Even if he got to see the spirit photos and listened to descriptions, he probably didn't have enough to go on to make a perfect copy. Nailed the pants though.

[next episode](/s "The sunlight in this room has been a bit of an issue in the past since Vanilla Ice says DIO wouldn't enter a room where sunlight streams in. I think it's just a cautionary thing. DIO spends his time in the dark and wouldn't bother remembering exactly when each room is safe to enter. Even though the direct sunlight wasn't getting much farther beyond the windows during this fight, it probably fills the room at different times of the day, so DIO would avoid it out of principle.")

It always blows my mind a bit to watch the TV version, where Polnareff's undetailed foot bleeding needed to be blacked out but Iggy bleeding as he's getting kicked over and over again was totally fine. I'm actually happy that it worked out like that, it's a good illustration of how you can get something really disturbing and violent across without it getting censored.

I don't know whether that ending makes me feel worse for Polnareff or Iggy. I mean, Pol had the survivor's guilt going on moreso than Iggy did, but now it's all up to Iggy. Poor pup gave up a paw, lost two friends in front of his eyes and his internal organs are probably mush now. All in one afternoon.

Wouldn't recommend watching the preview for next week.

One of the most brutal and intense fights in the series. Iggy got brutally beaten up, Polnareff's fate, as now, is unknown, but looks grim. Vanilla Ice has a pretty op Stand.

[Part 5](/s "I've seen game footage of wheelchair Polnareff before I got to this episode. Back then I legit thought that's his injuries from this fght when I got to see it. It' weird that he DIDN'T get into that wheelchair after this episode.")

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot to mention this yesterday but that ending scene from yesterday's episode is one of my favorites because it truly makes you scared and genuinely nervous for our heroes. Very well done. Now for today's episode. I love dogs, I have two at my home, so there are some scenes in JoJo that are a little unnerving in how some dogs are treated. (RIP Danny) So needless to say the part with Vanilla Ice going bat shit crazy on Iggy was hard for me to watch, even more so because Iggy is one of my favorite characters in Part 3. Even though this is my second time going through this madness I still reacted emotionally to what went down. And the madness doesn't end here folks. This fight ain't over yet, and even then there's still DIO. I warned you to prepare your anuses. 
>> ARTICLE
This is why I hate Vanilla Ice the most. No one fucks with Iggy that much, anyone who kills dogs in JoJo is a bastard, but Vanilla Ice is the worst, he's just like a miniature Dio, holding the same opinions on dogs that the little shit Dio had when he first came onto the scene, and they're dead wrong. Iggy the Zany doggy is the best. 

That scene about Polnariff having no options, that life is cruel, was too rough for me. It was damn good and effective, but it's harsh, it's true. We all need Iggy's in our lives to save us from those evil Creams. You make that asshole eat your sword, Polpol-chan! 
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting for that foot in the ice to turn into sand...it never did ;.;

The bird explanation felt really out of place, I mean it's Jojo I don't think many people wold question why  abird is underwater lol

This bird is actually scary, finding him in that hole  was freaky

MC says he beat the bad guy with the half the episode left and he actually beat him? :O

Happy Iggy got some saved by his karma!

Awe Jojo no! I was hoping for a cooler Kakyoin comeback scene than that, such waster potential :(

This recap with the old OP, nice! Liked that line of Jojos too

What weakness is in Kakyoin's heart?

They make it seem they'll fight Dio in the next episode with all that hype...

Another weird silver thing on face person..wonder if they'll explain it this time!

>> ARTICLE
> Another weird silver thing on face person..wonder if they'll explain it this time!

They don't say WHAT it is but you know WHY he has it in next episode

I think the weakness is refering to the time he met DIO and was (reasonably) scared out of his mind.

So like everyone has that weakness then...

I already told you. The Pet Shop fight is super educational. I bet you've never wondered exactly what allows a falcon to win a fight against a dog underwater, but now you know.

>This bird is actually scary, finding him in that hole was freaky

Reminded me a lot of One Punch Man this time around.

Good Guy Jotaro. Breaking down the plan in the most simple way possible.

Probably his love for Holly and cherries.

BTW guys, here a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Fqvd1W358) of how broken Pet Shop was in the Jojo Capcom game. Just see how much he take to blow Devo's HP bar.

Anyway, finally Iggy got a reason to get invoved in the process of kicking Dio's butt. All he needed was motivation! Thank you, Pet Shop!

Also, I'm proud that we didn't got a lot of Mr.Freeze puns in the previous thread! I holded myself good as well!

Wow, no wonder he was banned from being used in tournaments. That chain of attacks seems almost impossible to stop.

He is the only character who has a "infinite". He also has a very tiny hitbox and good poke damage skills.

I think Capcom forgot to beta test him. He is the only overly broken character.

I think the second on tier is Young Joseph (yeah, he is in the game =P)

[](#miiaembarassed)

I haven't been able to participate in any of the rewatch threads lately

But that doesn't matter right now. What does matter is how *fucking* hype this fight was. This fight is great because Pet Shop gives no fucks. He will hunt you down and kill you like the predator he is. And it is awesome. 

It also has one of the most unintentionally funny moments in Jojo, which is when Pet Shop just kind of shows up beneath Iggy. Why and how did he get there? The answer to both of those is "Araki thought it would be cool" and he was [god damn right](http://i.imgur.com/gallery/w8i6ho2).

I also like this fight because it is much more like part 6 and 7 fights in that it is 'User
and Stand vs User and Stand' as opposed to the stand vs stand fights that make up most of Jojo. Same reason I liked Anubis, the stand couldn't be used autonomously.

Even the narrator though Pet Shop was a bastard. 

This episode also has a really happy ending with Iggy being (mostly) alright and Kakyoin returning from the hospital. That and the Stand Proud rendition+recap is GREATO DAZE!

>I wonder if this guy is a stand user

Mother fucker, everyone you've met has been a stand user so when a guy with his frigging initials on his earrings I think it can be assumed he's a stand user.

Also the fact that he's INSIDE OF DIO'S MANSION AND FLOATING.

One of the biggest reasons I love this OP so much. I bet none of the first timers noticed that.

I've learned so many weird fact from Jojo that it's stupid. For example, did you know that women on average have a lower body temperature than men? Or that certain moulds grow better at lower altitudes? How about anything to do with the golden rectangle?

I think Araki just read a lot of those weird fact things and think about how to make them work as stands.

Yeah I read that recently in JoJo, didn't know anything about it. I didn't know about the bird lungs either, so either my biology class sucked or I just forgot it (which wouldn't be surprising because I already watched this episode once and still didn't know it).
>> ARTICLE
The good old block the enemy from releasing his power so he blows up from the inside trick. Works every time, be it dragons, Pokemon or a falcon shooting icicles like missiles.
Poor Iggy lost a paw, though. If he had only opened up to his comrades earlier, this might not have happened. But he stil made it work and that's what counts.

No doubt though that Pet Shop is fucking dead. Even the episode says OBLITERATED

By the way, how much of a dog is a paw? *looks at counter*

It was cool of them to bring back Stand Proud while the Crusaders are standing proud. Iggy was awesome this episode- we get to see some of his past as a stray dog kingpin, and he manages to take down Dio's magic teleporting bird. 

We're entering the home stretch now- the hype only gets bigger from her.
>> ARTICLE
>we get to see some of his past as a stray dog kingpin

Yeah, it fleshed out his backstory really quickly and simply. Plus it gave us the ultimate canine visualization of "[fuck bitches, get money.](http://i.imgur.com/d1ki38W.png)"

I really liked that we got to indirectly see one of Joseph and Avdol's previous bizarre adventures. The two of them a few years younger, trying to find a Stand user in New York and eventually facing off against a farting dog playboy with a dog-car-robot Stand that controls sand. I'd love to see more of that.

Wow pretty vicious cutting off your own leg to get away! Iggy going hard in the paint!

Thank god for Adovl being the brains of the team in Kakyoin's absence.

So birds are just OP? Pls Narrator-kun. 

How is a bird the scariest villain so far? 

Yeah deflect them Iggy! Fuck that bird up! 

Uh oh the bird is entering his final form! 

FUCK THE BIRD IS IN THE HOLE! NO IGGY NO IGGY!

You know it's bad when Iggy and Kakyoin are the brains of the operation.

I gotta say, that bird was pretty fucking terrifying. I would not want to be against a bird like that. Definitely among the most intense fight scenes of part 3. 

Iggy was pretty great this episode, definitely like him a lot more after these past 2 ones though what I really would have liked was him and Polly bonding together since they seem to be the closest.

Hey, just thought I'd offer a heads up that the convention center (at least in the past) doesn't have WiFi, and that cell reception can be really bad with so many people there (though I think it's better during Sakuracon than PAX).

Hey Smurf quick question, are there any events to get hyped about at this year's Sakuracon? Last year they had a Garnidelia and Kanako Itou concert but I'm having a hard time getting hyped this year, what looks good?
>> ARTICLE
Check out the Anime Offensive Show Ep. 3. I'm the one hosting that show and it's been successful for the last 2 years. I'm also the one Smurf is tagging along with at this Con.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been able to find much information about the panels, what kind of things do you guys do during the anime offensive show?
>> ARTICLE
It's like a late night show/ Conan type of show, but with anime. Monologues, segments, and funny vids are shown with awesome hilarious content. This is my 3rd time doing this, and myself and my associates are really thinking this is going to be the best show so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like a fun time, I'll make sure to show up and hopefully I get a chance to introduce myself.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome man! 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea. I'm not really sure what to expect, to be honest. I've got a friend that goes every year, and I'm just gonna tag along and have fun.
>> ARTICLE
There's definitely going to be a lot to do but the whole reason I went last year was to see the first few episodes of UBW Season 2 before it aired in Japan, just that one event made the whole convention for me. The concerts were also awesome, I really wasn't expecting such legit performances even though I was familiar with the artists.

But the work of an enemy stand might disruspt you.

"Oh we're just as bad as Jotaro and the gang. Instead of going and seeing if our friend is currently engaged in a Stand user fight or not we just sit around waiting. We're horrible friends."

Dadvols going to be so disappointed when he finds out that the Ice Stand was beaten without him. Hell be all like Awwww. But I could have just melted the ice and looked wicked cool (no pun intended), I was looking forwards to getting to use fire attacks to completely nullify my opponent's abilities. For his sake I hope that he never finds out, so that he gets spared that disappointment.

Yesterday I said that Pet Shop Boys was terrifying, and I stand by that today. That bird is terrifying. She somehow managed to find Iggy in the Nile (a river so big that Julius Caesar once said Wow thats a big river), and then proceeded to be terrifying at him. Realistically Iggy shouldnt have stood a chance, the only reason he won in the end was that PSB inexplicably spent 20 minutes charging an attack which wed previously seen her fire off 6 of with zero charging time. Maybe she just wanted to make sure that Iggy was super terrified when he died, but it still seems irresponsible.

Its good to see Fancy Guy return, now with the addition of sunglasses. I like the glasses because it gives the impression that the Speedwagon doctors arent magic. Yes they restored his sight, but the glasses suggest that his eyes are still sensitive. I also like that the scars have remained. If Im totally honest I think that Fancy Guy would have made a better protagonist than JoJoJo (though obviously hed be JoJoJo if that were the case), I think that his powers make him a better fit for the position.  
Speaking of Fancy Guy, what exactly is the weakness in his heart? Because from context Id guess that its his desire for older women who are also JoJoJos mother, but I might be wrong.

I liked his entrance, particularly the fact that he forced the disabled dog to limp unaided to his friends in order to preserve the sancity of it. Carry the dog?! No way. Ive been planning my return for weeks. The dog can fucking walk.

Next on the agenda: theres something which I noticed in the OP which related back to my theory about Dios Stand [which I mentioned a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4b5bqu/rewatchspoilers_jojos_bizarre_adventure_stardust/d16sf3j). [My theory was](/s "that Dios stand can copy the powers of other Stands. In the OP the whole Ora Ora bit is done in two parts, seemingly opposed. They take turns and then both go at once. Its possible that this is done merely to suggest that Star Platinum is doing an exceptional amount of punching, even for it. And when you consider that Platinum is the mayor of punch town, thats a lot of punching. But it could also be symbolising that Dios Stand is punching right back at him with an equal amount of punching, quite possibly as a result of copying Platinums punch power. Will Worlds Chartreuse challenge Star Platinum for the mayorship of punchtown? I guess well have to wait for the final battle to find out.")

The next episode looks like it should be cool. Floaty Guys managed to make a hell of an entrance thanks to his floating powers, so Im expecting big things.
>> ARTICLE
That's a very nice theory, you'll be surprised at how it actually turns out.
Think about when Anubis stated he could never hope to defeat Dio, and when Hol Horse tried to shoot him.
>> ARTICLE
> the weakness is his heart

Don't worry. Not that he's back we'll have some dedicated screen time for it :3

And an additional non-spoiler hint for your theory: think back to the episode where Hol Horse was in DIO's mansion.

Manga reader / many-times-rewatcher here. Your theory is awesome! I had a very similar theory to yours. But it'll have to wait until DIO's stand power is revealed. After that I'd like to discuss it with you.

I'm really interested to see how this one will go down. Goooo, Iggy!

* Come to think of it, I've yet to see Iggy's stand used offensively. Like...ever.

* Avdol. You smart. I like that

* Oh shit. He lost his leg!

* Petshop is the most persistent stand user so far. The irony

* Finally, some counterattack!

* Petshop's been spamming his freezey beam for a while now. Doesn't he run out of juice at some point?

* Holy shit! He got him!! Take that, birdbrain!

* Nooooo...Iggy...Don't kill him. He's the 2nd coolest member of the crusaders!

* Huh? The Chibi Buchi kid! 

* Petshop got so rekt

* Soooo... one stand user+DIO. 9 episodes. This gun be gud.

* KAKYOIN IS BACK!!!

* You pissed off the wrong dog, DIO-sama

* DIO could so easily just rent the building next door and be done with it.

* Eh... I'm trying to think of an egyptian god popular enough that's left unused so far. Drawing blanks.

* I loved that montage at the end. Reconfirming their convictions.

* Much like me, the crusaders suck at counting and they forgot there's one more stand user to come

* When that door opened, I got flashbacks to Whammu vs Caesar

* Why does this guy look like D'arby?

Oh no. Ra is ignored by his own mythology. He literally got shit on by half the Egyptian pantheon. He's famous, sure. But his lore is full of misery.

Omg I finally caught up. I started part 1 on the first, basically marathoned it over one night. Didn't think I would finish before part 4 started, let alone be able to join the re-watch.

That bird, best villain and best fight of Part 3. We might be banged up, but all the crusaders have united and we march headfirst into the enemy.
>> ARTICLE
Nice to have you! You've joined just in time for the best part of the show (in my opinion).

Woohoo, Kakyoin's back! All of the crusaders are back together finally! Isn't that great?

Well before that we have the important resolution to the cliffhanger to zany Iggy and Pet Shop's fight in which......THE SUPER ZANY DOGGO IGGY DOES A BUNCH OF RUNNING AND SWIMMING AT SUPER HIGH SPEEDS! AWW HECK ICE AND SAND AT MORTAL KOMBAT! IGGY HAS TO GO DO A HECKING DIG AND BEAT UP THE EVIL BIRDO!

My midterms finished up today, which means I can be more active in the rewatch starting tomorrow. 

Pet shop was an interesting fight. We got to hear Iggy's thoughts, which was pretty cool. And now we're finally at the house Dio is in. Can't wait to finally confront Dio!

**Yare yare daze**

Man,this episode was so intense and good.First we see Iggy in a really bloody fight and that finisher on dio's bird was brutal,I loved it.Kakyoin with them shades tho,slick af.I liked that they used Stand Proud in front of the mansion,made me super hyped for next episode.See ya tomorrow people

* Iggy lost a whole leg and then BROKE HORUS' BEAK WITH HIS BARE TEETH.

* KEKYOIN IS BACK WOOOOO

* THE WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND!!

* oh cool another D'Arby next episode.

Fucking sick episode. We're at the homestretch, boys.
>> ARTICLE
And Iggy loses his foot. This actually left me kinda down when it first aired because it sucks to see Iggy suffer like this. I wonder where he got the bandages to wrap himself up?

Pet Shop must have some good senses to know that Iggy was underwater.

And then digs to where Iggy digs through. What kinda bird can actually swim around in water and dig a tunnel? Dio must be some damn good trainer.

I can only imagine how it feels to have your beak bit so hard it gets crushed and then have your own attack blow up in your face.

Our fucking bro is back. Kakyoin Noriaki has returned. He spent most of this season recovering but now he's back! So good to see him again.

Anyone who is watching this for another time and is not a first time watcher anyone else find it odd that [Jojo Part 3 spoilers](/s "The crusaders that receive fairly serious injures are the ones that end up dying? Avdol gets stabbed in the back and shot very near his brain. Kakyoin nearly gets his eyes clawed out and Iggy loses a foot. Interesting that Araki has the ones who had the most serious injures die.")

Iggy didn't care before but he's lost a leg now. He wants Dio dead.

And once again we get to hear Stand Proud. We even see all five Jojos up until this point. George, Jonathan, Jorge, Joseph and Jotaro. 

This is an important moment. Three big moments happen in Part 3 that I think are very notable. Arriving in Egypt, arriving in Cairo and now arriving at Dio's mansion.  

Terence floating down the hallway like that is so creepy.

I didn't ever really notice it. I think that might just be a coincidence.

It probably is a coincidence but I wonder if perhaps Araki planned it that way.

It is badass, but it's definitely not the most badass thing to come.

It was this episode when Iggy went from sucking to being cool af for me the first time I watched. Man, he was the fucking king of the NY stray dogs. It even sounds like a gang's name.

Anyway, lot's of hype for the upcoming episodes but Smurf, I'll be out on vacation to Amsterdam until Monday as well so, you might end up seeing a bunch of late comments on Monday/Tuesday for all these episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm this was a great, although dragged out episode. 
Petshop is literally the only stand user Avdol would have no trouble against, and he missed the fight.
All I could think about in this fight was "ice, ice, baby".
Anime only/first time watchers are gonna love next episode. YES YES YES.
>> ARTICLE
> All I could think about in this fight was "ice, ice, baby".

Wrong fight to be saying that in.
>> ARTICLE
I always laugh when I think about Star Platinum and Silver Chariot stopping mid-fight just to [walk over to a busted fire hydrant and hit each other through the water.](http://i.imgur.com/yJOlVBf.jpg)

There's no reason for it, it's just something that Araki thought would be cool so it exists. And I love it.
>> ARTICLE
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool
>> ARTICLE
I would like to think that when Stardust Crusaders was made, Araki got a lot of inspiration from all the schlocky action flicks of the 80s and early 90s and that campiness is filtered through his imagination. It is actually a pretty interesting snapshot of pop culture of that era.
>> ARTICLE
> There's no reason for it, it's just something that Araki thought would be cool so it exists.

Well, that's Jojo in a nutshell isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
> And I love it.

It definitely is. It's one of my favorite things (I say that a lot. I guess I just have a lot of favorite things) about JoJo. I'm pretty sure Araki just wrote down a bunch of really cool shit, and then tried to tie them all together afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
There are definitely arcs where it's very clear that Araki learned about something interesting at the time (the shape of parfait glasses, the behaviour of abalone) and he *really* wanted to share it with everyone.
>> ARTICLE
How about that Beetle Tendency?
>> ARTICLE
The Silver Chariot and Divine Anubis combo scene is why Chariot dual-wields in the OP. They gave him a second rapier just to avoid spoiling anyone. It's also amusing that Anubis calls himself and Chariot Stands that are experts at dual-wielding when technically neither of them can dual-wield without picking up a sword that isn't already part of them.

Yes, Jotaro still remembers Star Finger. It's just that it's rarely useful when ORA ORA ORA is an option, and Jotaro likes to fight through clever applications of ridiculous power and stone-faced bluffing rather than gimmicks. For example, catching a blade with his abs and intestines. Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/sMnh1tp.png) is the shot I always show people when I explain that Star Platinum expresses Jotaro's feelings throughout Part 3 because it's so clear. While Joseph would have actually done the gesture himself, Jotaro wants to do it but would rather look cool so SP has to deliver the sass.

Notably, Anubis is confirmed to be a Stand that kept existing after his user died, and he clearly admits that he can't beat DIO's The World in a fight. So we can infer that the ability to memorize and learn to counter any move after seeing it once is useless against it. Especially since Anubis, having been convinced of this, probably *has* seen The World in a fight. I wonder if the Crusaders will have any more luck than Anubis.

I just adore that by this point, a shot like [this](http://i.imgur.com/CMxUFzm.png) isn't even notably bizarre and is even a little menacing. Do you think Iggy foiled Anubis on purpose? I've always wondered how to interpret the show afterwards where he's smiling at the sun. Also a little sad that Anubis will rust away. I was hoping that, being unable to return to the land, he would drift eternally along the Nile and eventually stop thinking.

One of my favourite Stand battles in this whole part next time!
>> ARTICLE
I just realized that kid is oddly muscular; Look at his arm.
>> ARTICLE
We get confirmation that The World is DIOs stand, most people should know by now.
>> ARTICLE
> Yes, Jotaro still remembers Star Finger.

This particular use was anime original, though. It's just David having Araki's back like "We got you."

>Do you think Iggy foiled Anubis on purpose?

Definitely. Iggy isn't dumb, he's just a shithead. He stopped Oingo Boingo twice and I'm sure neither one was unintentional.
>> ARTICLE
Based David. I was wary when the 2012 anime was announced, but they really have been going above and beyond. I've read the manga, but every time they make a change it always feels so utterly natural and *right* that I barely notice.
>> ARTICLE
Probably the best straight up fight so far for Part 3 in general. I loved seeing the stakes of the battle be rather quite high and having Jotaro *actually* be pushed to the limit for once instead of him coolly just ez 1 shotting the opponents. While a lot of the other stands had some interesting tricks and gimmicks which kind of became a mystery of the week to solve the enemy stand, a brawl is rather refreshing.

Also [Mr. Crabs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/MrKrabs.png) scumming Anubis. 
>> ARTICLE
Just a heads up... you haven't seen anything yet hehehehe it gets x10 better imo
>> ARTICLE
It's spelled with a K, actually. Mr. Krabs.

It's always refreshing to see a character as powerful as Jotaro actually get into trouble. I think this goes back to why I believe so many people prefer this season to the first Stardust Crusaders season, in that the fights feel like they have more danger. Just a few episodes ago, we had a character get cut and temporarily blinded!

"Zetai nee, zetai nee, zetai nee, zetai nee..."

Jojo villains really like using the same words over and over as emphasis on stuff. Lovers did this as well. And we all know how it's Dio's favorite thing.

Catching the fuckin sword. That's actually probably pretty easy for Star Platinum.

I've said it once and I'll say it again. Daisuke Ono does a great job as Jotaro. He portrays such an intense voice as Jotaro.

Duel wielding? Oh my gooood!

Oooh Star Finger back again!

Just punching the sword into little pieces!

I love how Star Platinum puts its hand to its ear.

While Anubis is shouting about how he's gonna kill Jotaro,

Polnareff: Here's a band-aid.

Jotaro: I don't want it.

Iggy saving the day accidentally.

Accidentally using your phasing through walls power and making your situation worse.

Anubis started out as a pretty serious stand but by the end he's hilarious.

Haha he cries.

I believe this is the first time the anime says a stand user has retired.
>> ARTICLE
Aww yes, the probably coolest thing to happen in 2015:  
SILVER CHARIOT DUAL WIELDING  
Also Jotaro vs. Polnareff. That kinda needed to happen, if only to symbolically fight for the show's MC spot. Jotaro took that home, but you can't trick the counter, mister!  
Also there's a MVP point for Iggy for being the one to land the finishing blow on Anubis... sorta. Though that wasn't nearly enough to get on the counter.  
I'll count the three users of Anubis as one person today, but I'll write them down for the heck of it (yes, even the cow).

* As I said... Chariot has the edge in speed but loses out in power. Here's hoping Jotaro makes a move soon

* Oh, damn... He wouldn't fall for the same trick twice.

* I'm getting Shokugeki manga vibes from this guy

* HE CAUGHT IT!! HELL YEAH!!

* Ouch...It got Polnareff!

* That's bullshit OP. He can even use stands of people he possesses!?

* This is some seriously hype fight

* Sasuga Jojo...Should've figured they would be the origin of Dual Wielding.

* Also, I've been drawing some strong parallels to Brandon Sanderson's writings. Anubis (the sword) is quite similar in nature to Nightblood from his Warbreaker book.

* He's stronger than Jotaro....fk....fk....fk......

* Oh shit!! Jotaro got stabbed!!

* Jotaro... You're a freaking legend!! Anubis got rekt so hard

* Iggy saves the day 4.0

* The dude lived for 500 years and he's afraid of rust?

* A totally deserved humiliation. And the scene at the bottom of the river was hilarious

* My favorite stand battle so far. Stakes were raised, PolPol wasn't starring it, and Jotaro was. Perfect recipe tbh

* A hot evil chick stand user!? HYYYYPPPPPEE!

* Now that Anubis has made an appearance, I have a feeling the next episode will feature either Isis or Bastet. Most prominent goddesses in egyptian mythology

**Current Reference Counter: 50**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
The original user of the Anubis stand was called [Caravan Serai](http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Caravan_Serai), in reference to the Santana album "Caravanserai".
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that was mentioned in the anime, only the manga.
>> ARTICLE
At first my reputation for this enemy was quite high as Chaka looked like really straightforward and cool villain when he had the sword, like Jotaro said. It would be good rivalry of the Crusaders if he survived longer. Then it's revealed that the actual stand inside the sword is a god of dog or wolf? And the comedic closing of the fight. It turned into complete opposite from the initial coolness, but overall great episode as usual.
>> ARTICLE
The god Anubis in proper mythology is a jackal, so I assume he was supposed to be a jackal here as well.

I really like the screenshot of the day. Polnareff has the best double poses with his stand.

Some super intense fighting here. Kinda feel bad for the enemy stand. But that's what he gets for being a dick and mind controlling our hero.

Iggy farting some more... _yay_

Sword vs sword is great and all but I don't like how Jojo just stays there watching for so long!

I want to say Star Platinum is OP but this series has Dio so no matter how Star Platinum gets Dio is probably 10 levels higher...

Was really hoping JPP would pull the sword out, battle of the MCs now!

So we've had evil Kakyoin, Jotaro and now JPP...evil Old Joseph when?

He cut the Caesar belt :(

"Here's a band-aid" hahaha PolPol you the best

For such a serious and powerful enemy I wasn't a fan of the second half on how they ended up beating him.

"To think all of that happened without us" lol it feels like most of the stands they run into when isolated :p

GIRL HYPE?!

**ORAORAORA!**

Dual wield Silver Chariot and we get a hot grill next episode?!

Thanks based Araki.
>> ARTICLE
Polnariff being possessed by Anubis was seriously terrifying, because Anubis was already adapting to Star Platinum's abilities, and Chariot is himself a worthy opponent. Even Jotaro can't easily handle two stands, especially since using a sword is already Polpol-chan's specialty. It's a common and I suppose easy to use trope that when you have a hero who is normally as unflappable as our Jojo, it just goes to make the battle more impressive when we see him starting to hurt and bloodied. I actually got scared watching this the first time, if Anubis was able to picked up and wielded one more time after that stabbing and Jotaro on his knees, that probably would have been the closest to being killed he's been. 

Unlike Iggy, Anubis is not a good zany doggo at all! But still, when that child threw him, he also became an INCREDIBLY FAST DOGGO FLYING AT SUPER HIGH SPEEDS! 
>> ARTICLE
This episode had a cool fight in it, and that was about it. It's quite nice to have an episode every now and then which is mostly dedicated just to a cool fight, though it's not exactly my preference.

Stand Anubis is probably my favourite Stand from this season so far. Admittedly that's not really saying much as there have only been three others, and they included Stretchy Face and Dickhead comic, but I like it more than the water one, and I liked the water one. The fact that it's bound just to a sword, and that it is the Stand itself which is in control rather than the holder is really interesting, also that it doesn't prevent the holder from using their own Stand (and because the Sword itself is the Stand, it can be held by other Stands). It's also noteworthy for almost being an opponent whom JoJoJo couldn't beat simply by having the Punchiest Ghost.  

The fight between Silver and Platinum was a damn good one, one deserving of having an episode around it. It had nice dynamics, nice set pieces, and a real sense of danger in it. The one thing which I didn't like it was that Silver Chariot didn't feel anywhere near as fast as it should have.  
How the hell was that Barber able to do anything to Silver Chariot? How much was the Sword boosting his speed that he was able to keep up with Silver? Now take that speed boost, and apply it to the already incredible speed of Silver Chariot (which I am pretty certain is supposed to be faster than Platinum by default), and then ask yourself how Star Platinum was even remotely capable of keeping up.  
To be honest I don't blame JBA for this. Superspeed is hardly ever handled well in media, largely because the creator's don't think out the ramifications of it before putting it in. The best implementation of it I can think of was One Punch Man, and that was largely helped by the character's apathy.

Apart from the fight, most of the stuff I had to say is stuff I mentioned last episode. Now to the next one, to find out what the point of that "There are many races in Egypt. This man is Indian, why is he in Egypt?" bit was.
>> ARTICLE
People forgot that Jotaro is right: Iggy got dragged from his good life as a stray dog in New York, without he wanting, to fight a battle he doesn't care.

People take too hard on Iggy. I doubt anyone would be happy if someone forcefully recruited you to fight a vampire guy and his minions in the middle of the desert.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't forget and I never blame Iggy at all, in fact he seriously pulls his weight on that team too, Iggy is a good, if zany, doggo. 
>> ARTICLE
And we all know how that vampire guy feels about dogs.
>> ARTICLE
RIP Danny. =(

You guys remember that time that Jotaro threw a dog at a blind guy? Good times.

Now is as good a time as any to share a really terrible picture I made a while back. I'm really sorry about this. [Minor Early Durarara Spoilers](http://i.imgur.com/CKu9mWP.png)

One interesting thing I noticed this episode is that even in the BD, [this shot is censored.](http://i.imgur.com/jBoYwBJ.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Forgive my ignorance, but what is the BD?
>> ARTICLE
BD stands for BluRay Disc.

It's mostly uncensored, but it seems like a few things are still censored.
>> ARTICLE
Whenever Jojo smokes they censor it out cause he's underage. That one does make sense to censor in the blu rays if it was on TV, but seriously, how does censoring that hide anything of what he is doing
>> ARTICLE
Well, the smoking isn't censored on the BDs.
>> ARTICLE
huh, I must have been watching the airing by accident. Well too late for that because I already binged ahead yesterday. Damn, that lived up to everything I expected, joined my top 5% that has 10/10
>> ARTICLE
For those who don't know, anime censorship is imposed on TV anime scenes in two ways: either the studio animates the scene uncensored and then puts an effect over the offending scenes, or they just don't draw the details that would cause offense in the first place. The upside to the first route is that uncensoring for the BDs is very simple and it allows for multiple levels of censorship (broadcast, pay-per-view channel, streaming, DVD/BD), while the upside to the second is that you literally don't have to do the work behind the content you censor. Maybe stick a line or two there with some skin color and then black cloud or fog it up. Then just draw it in for the uncensored release, if you get one. It also lets you choose just how sexy/gory it's going to be after you've already got some audience reactions.

I don't know for sure, but if I had to guess I'd say that a lot of the censored gore/body horror shots in the TV broadcasts of all the seasons weren't fully drawn until the BDs. David Productions does a great job of managing the budget, but especially in Parts 1 and 2 the TV episodes looked significantly different than the BDs because they didn't have the cash or time to do everything properly in the style they wanted. Gore has detail to it and doesn't even get appreciated during the TV broadcast, so it makes sense that they'd wait until the show brought in some money and then draw in the gore while redrawing subpar scenes and generally cleaning up the animation anyways. They definitely did some censorship of drawn elements (Jotaro smoking), but that seemed rarer than just backing out the detailed parts of really gory scenes.

That would also explain the scenes that are censored on the BDs: either they ran out of money, didn't see the need in making uncensored versions of scenes that got their point across well even with full censorship or thought that the gore would be too gratuitous (like how the Pillar Men's wounds had a glowy effect rather than just being red and meaty.)
>> ARTICLE
Not even the BD is safe from the black cloud stand.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's weird, I noticed that there are some instances where the censorship has remained in the BDs.

Now that the N'Dul fight is over, I can finally post this. A while ago, /a/ discovered a comic named Diesel.The comic was made in 1997 and you could say, that the Diesel author was heavily "inspired" by JoJo. Just see for yourself and you will probably find some strange similarities to the last episode and JoJo in general. Sadly only one issue of Diesel was ever released so we will never see the authors totally original plot unfold.

Here is the comic: http://imgur.com/a/jGJVg

Jotaro is a pretty great baseball player. [Later in the season](/s "Not the best at 'Oh, That's A Baseball!' though")

Next episode has the second best ED. Look out everyone. I'm going to be posting those memes for sure. 100%. Yes.

N'doul is a pretty good guy. [His backstory is really sad though](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350258/synopsis)

Just letting you all know that at this point it is safe to watch the first half of Antfish's abridged series, and the first episode of the second half. Do it for the sake of my memes. You won't get some of them if you don't watch it.

RIP female viewerbase, you will be missed until Kakyoin gets out of the hospital.

Because I didn't post yesterday, I will say now that the current OP and ED are the best visually that the series has ever had. There is so much symbolism and so many easter eggs that I can't wait to post MothersBasement's video about it when the final spoiler is revealed.

In my opinion second best. There is one that's just slightly better. Get hype either way though.

Ahh yes, the Egyptian Gods. If you already thought the tarot connections were tenuous at best, then I'm sure you'll love these stands.

But damn if their names aren't stupid as hell.
>> ARTICLE
> Already we have a stand made out of water, who somehow apparently suggests the god of earth. 

Well, we have Iggy, who is a geokinetic, so that niche is occupied already; N'Doul however is pretty obvious because he goes by vibrations in the ground.

Some Tarot cards are 1:1 spot on (Magician, Tower, Chariot), some are tenuous (Lovers' "connection"), some are random, the Sun is literally just the fucking sun, and then there's Temperance, which is literally everything Rubber Soul is very much *not*.

Bast is fucked though.

I mean, Geb is literally the Earth, which is mostly water. So connection found.

* Rubber Soul is named after a Beatles album. While disguised as Kakyoin, he eats *beetles*.

* J. Geil is named after the *J. Geils Band*. In some subs (such as the Crunchyroll subs), he's called "Centerfold". This is the name of the one (1) hit song of the J. Geils Band.

* Best husbando Hol Horse's name could be a reference to one of two things: The band *Full Force*, or the music duo *Hall and Oates*.

* Polnareff's sister Sherry is named for a Michel Polnareff song, *Tout, Tout Pour Ma Chrie* (Cherie = Sherry, get it?)

* Nena is named after the German singer of the same name, best known for *99 Luftballons*.

* ZZ (that's "Zii Zii" for you people watching the bad subs) is named after the Sharp Dressed Men, Los Tres Hombres themselves, *ZZ Top*.

* Enya (that's Enyaba for people watching the shitty subs) is named after the Irish singer-songwriter *Enya*.

* Steely Dan (or "Dan of Steel") is named after, you know, *Steely Dan*.

* Arabia Fats is named after *Fats Domino*.

* Mannish Boy is named after the Muddy Waters song of the same name, *Mannish Boy*.

* The chickens Avdol's dad cares for on the island are named Prince, Lionel, and Michael. These are named after *Prince* (one of Araki's favorite musicians), *Lionel Ritchie*, and *Michael Jackson*.

* Cameo is named after the band, you know, *Cameo*.

* Suzi Q's butler, Roses, is named after the band *Guns n' Roses*

* Midler is named after singer/actress *Bette Midler*.

* Best girl Iggy is named after singer *Iggy Pop*.

* N'Doul is named after the Senegalese musician *Youssou N'Dour*.

**Current Reference Counter: 48**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.

**Yare yare daze** 

Man,this time i tried to catch some unusual stuff from the op.It looks like Silver Chariot will be dual wielding and that's awesome.I guess they show all the locations we'll see through the show,some looked like the slums of Cairo.Also that short shot of Dio(it's him probably) at the end was cool.I bet it's even more to the op but I can't get all the details right now.The ed is really chill,will it be changed through the episodes like roundabout did? 

The episode was good and this time the crew actually gets hurt by an enemy stand and I love when they use strategy instead of brute stand force(just a little ORAORA this time).There was a scene after the ed ,i hope you didnt miss it,reminded me of final destination a lot
>> ARTICLE
Let's see how well replying from my phone works. Sorry if this is a mess, my house lost Internet and cable for no reason and I'm pretty upset lol. 

Silver Chariot is definitely dual wielding, but the OP doesn't show the whole picture to avoid any spoilers. 

And that is DIO at the end for just a brief second. Shadowed out, though. Can't give too much away. 

I don't think the ED will be changing like Roundabout did. Roundabout could do it because of how different the song sounds at different sections, but Last Train Home is pretty much the same thing the whole way through. 

That wasn't as annoying to do as I thought it would be, but I really miss my keyboard...

* Huh? Jospeh is cursing in japanese? What happened to my beloved Engrish?

* Heh... A smart stand user. I could get behind that.

* Holy shit! Avdol is down!

* Loool...he picked up the dog

* Ah yes... Basically any flying stand would counter this one

* Damn...This guy is pretty skilled with his stand

* This guy is hands down the smartest stand user we've seen so far. He just single-handedly restore my faith in this Part

* Bahahaha... He threw Iggy at him

* This stand-off is intense as hell!!

* Hell yeah! Jotaro MVP!

* It sucks...It freaking sucks... That such a talented stand user is loyal to DIO. Fucking DIO...Making me hate him without even appearing.

* OH HELL YEAH!! MYTHOLOGY HYPE!!

* So, he's Geb, huh? Father Earth, so to speak

* Bonding moment between Iggy and Jotaro is ten times better than any PolPol comedy scene

* That end credit scene is longer than the actual credits...

* Also...What the actual fuck was that manga!?

* Oh...Wait...They can see the future? So could that be a stand that refrence Thoth's book?

Alright... Mythology is my jam and I'm freaking loving it. If I can manage to restore my schedule I'll try to do approximations/analysis for the new stand users when they come out. If I can't, well... Feel free to check the thread half a day later. :P

>> ARTICLE
I think this is the episode that made me think that the stands in the second half (or Season 2) are much more creative and interesting than in the first half. I wonder if the fact that they aren't tied to tarot cards meant that Araki had more freedom when coming up with bizarre stuff. 

But anyways, when I started watching the JoJo anime the last episodes of Stardust Crusaders were already airing, and while I loved every moment of Part 1 and 2 (mainly 2) I kinda became bored with the Stardust Crusaders S01, but S02 really stepped things up, so much that at the end it was truly an epic journey and everything was worth the rather repetitive S01.

And if you're watching for the first time, don't skip the ending on the next episode. Just saying.

>> ARTICLE
> And if you're watching for the first time, don't skip the ending on the next episode. Just saying.

I'll be posting about it next thread, don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
I actually did watch this episode on time, however I was in bed when the thread went up, hence the delay.

Anyway, the episode. What the hell are the nine Egyptian Gods? I get that the nine new Stand Bearers are named after Egyptian Gods, so there are the nine Egyptian God named Stands, but the way the blind guy phrased it made it sound like there are only nine Egyptian Gods. There are a lot more than nine Egyptian Gods, by my approximation there are about infinity of them.  
So the question is who are those nine going to be? Frankly if I'd been told beforehand that nine of them would have been referenced I wouldn't have guessed that Geb would be one.  
Seeing as Geb *is* one of them, it wouldn't surprise me to see the nine gods be Ra, Nut, Geb, Thoth, Osiris, Isis, Hathor, Seth, and Nephthys. This being because of the famial links between them: Ra created Nut and Geb who were the parents of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Seth, and Hathor, though the birth was only possible thanks to the intervention of Thoth.  
However I cannot think that with only nine Gods being referenced we wouldn't have Anubis, Horus, and Bast amongst them. So I wouldn't be surprised to see them in place of some of the ones I mentioned above. Basically the point of all of this is that I'm a tad surprised that Geb was one of the chosen Gods for this.

As of this episode it looks like [JoJoJo Brown](http://i.imgur.com/daSANPe.jpg) has finally found his Snoopy.
The fact that the dog is clearly intelligent supports my previous theory that having a Stand forces a certain minimum level of intelligence, and JoJoJo was the only one who really seems to respect that so far. Sure he was mean to the dog at many points, but he was mean in a way which treated the dog as an approximate equal, rather than just as a stupid animal.

I'm liking this recent trend of having next-episode teasers, showing us a bit of the next enemies we'll face. It really gets me looking forwards to the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
>I cannot think that with only nine Gods being referenced we wouldn't have Anubis, Horus, and Bast amongst them

Pfff... No way... It's egyptian mythology... There is *always* a Horus...

You know, I always wondered something. Of all of the possible places to send the long range water bender, why the great green globs of FUCK would you choose the middle of the Egyptian desert? Why not send him earlier, when the Crusaders were in the fucking ocean, or send him to an oasis or something. Somewhere where there's more than a single canteen's worth of water to throw at them!
>> ARTICLE
It really does feel like N'Doul and Midler would have done better if they'd known of each other and swapped places.

Because these 9 are basically DIO's elite guard. All the people earlier were just hired assassins.

They still sent him to the worst possible place for his Stand to operate.

Next episode is a favorite of mine for reasons you'll all see tomorrow.

After Jotaro did his super Iggy pitch, Iggy became an INCREDIBLY FAST DOGGO FLYING AT SUPER HIGH SPEEDS! Right at N'Goul! 

Iggy the zany doggo helped win the day once again! And facing the first enemy stando in this season, of course Jotaro is the one who should get the win, and it's good to see Avdol make a strong contribution. 

Jotaro showcases being a good boy once again, this time because he's kind to the good doggo Iggy. Fighting Dio is the right and noble thing to do, but poor Iggy should have gotten the opportunity to choose for himself, not forced by two huge men and their Blaziken. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck my schedule... I'll try to post in a few hours

And thus, the true fusion between Jotaro's hair and his hat comes to life.

Oingo&Boingo hype! Once more the scene of the guy impaled was censored even though I am watching the Blue ray. wtf. w/e not a big deal.

What kind of doctors do "just kidding" jokes...

This season of Jojo is already too gross for me...

Engrish Joseph moments are the best.

For all that talk about never leaving anyone alone they do it a lot...and when someone goes missing they're still not suspicious...

Suzie Q would be pretty upset with Joseph this episode! this stand girl seems cool but so much wasted potential, will be interesting to see what she does next ep!




>> ARTICLE
>What kind of doctors do "just kidding" jokes...  

I once tripped really funny and rammed my knee into my chest.  
I went to the 'sports accidents' doctor in town, because it hurt like hell and I feared I might have cracked something.  
When the doctor came in and read the descriptions I gave he immediately pushed his thumb right into my breastbone.  
After I was done yelping in pain he raised his thumb and quoted "My *pilum* is harder than your *sternum*" right outta Asterix, then continued to berate his confused assistants that they should get around to reading all of Asterix.  


Anyway, what I'm getting at is that some doctors are weird.
>> ARTICLE
> What kind of doctors do "just kidding" jokes...

Doctors with morbid senses of humor.

It's another complaint with Part 3 that I see sometimes. People think that the humor is too low brow. It doesn't bother me too much, but I see what they mean.

Maybe these "toilet adventures" was real life events that Araki suffered when he visited these places. Who knows. =P

Slapstick humor was *huge* in anime/manga and even Hollywood around that time though. That's probably where the influence comes from. I think this arc works really well as a buddy comedy of sorts.

Happy cake day!

This episode in a nutshell:

[](#ohmygod)

Washing your ass with sand...that does *not* sound appealing.

Interesting to see that it is still censored in the BDs with the nails. 

I loved how Abdul mentioned that shitty toilet shenanigans was Polnareff's thing.

And I agree with the guys from the previous episode, Mariah's got some *nice legs*. Definitely appreciate the leg service this episode.

[](#scrumptiouslymoe)

She also seems kind of fun too. 
>> ARTICLE
> Happy cake day!

Thanks! I didn't even realize it was today until someone else pointed it out. Part 4 date and cake day in the same weekend?
>> ARTICLE
Is Kakyoin back in the game now?? Looks like the Speedwagon Foundation saves the day again! 

They definitely should've have left him alone by himself though. 

Classic Stardust Crusaders move to *leave someone by themselves* but at least Iggy is there and he's been MVP lately. 

> OH MY GOD!

I missed that Engrish. 

Oh sweet it's that badass chick! She can control outlets? BiriBiri? 


> You always want to touch what's off-limits.

Seductive I see...

> But we cannot let our guard down.

As said, and ignored, every episode. 

Looks like everything is attracted to Joseph... as per usual.

[](#rerorero)

Is no one noticing the awkward coke bottle caps on him? 

He's gone full Biribiri minus the cool part. 

HE CAN'T GET THE BUTTON!

Yus Advol. But really you guys should've been following him in the first place. 

CLASSIC Jotaro and Pol using this opportunity to just wait for them to come back and not go looking for them. 

Well this bathroom scene is quite awk. 

> This is not in line with my image. Bathroom disaster is Polnareff's thing.

LOL SO TRUE! 

OH NO SHE GOT ADVOL TOO! 

Have they thought of you know just using their stands against her? 

Edit: ALSO HAPPY CAKE DAY!! 
>> ARTICLE
> HE CAN'T GET THE BUTTON!

To be fair, it's a weird spot to put the emergency stop. It's usually near the top above where he was putting Hermit Purple.

>Have they thought of you know just using their stands against her?

I wonder if their Stands are affected by the magnetism, too?

>ALSO HAPPY CAKE DAY!!

Thanks! Part 4 date announcement and my cake day in the same weekend? This is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
That is very true! I can't wait to see the next part!

JOJO PART 4 HYPE! 
>> ARTICLE
It's my personal favorite. I am beyond hyped.
>> ARTICLE
>Have they thought of you know just using their stands against her?

That's the most clever part, really. She's been attacking them in public areas so Avdol can't just surround her with fire, she's staying right around the edge of Hermit Purple and Magician's Red's range (Magician's Red only has C-rank range with its flames and Hermit Purple's range is even shorter) and I'm sure burning a girl would be rough on Avdol's fragile image. She's an enemy they should be able to beat up, so she fights in a way that makes it very hard to simply oraoraora her.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhhh I see I didn't think of that when I watched the episode. Great points! 
>> ARTICLE
I love when it turns into Joseph and Avdol's Bizarre Adventure.

You shouldn't touch things just because they're there, Joseph. 

OH MY GOD

>She has amazing legs.

Paying attention to the real details. Who needs a face anyway?

[If only Jotaro and the others could see you now.](http://i.imgur.com/DDJbXNd.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so THAT scene will be in the next episode, I'm guessing. Magnetism is always a decent set-up for comedy.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot that the hospital Kakyoin was staying at first wasn't connected to the Speedwagon Foundation. It was just a regular hospital.

"Oh my goooood! Oh my gooooooooood!"

I could never use a washroom like that. I need a toilet dammit!

You know, just an electrical outlet on a rock. No big deal.

Mariah is probably the most attractive Jojo gal so far personally.

Oh god the nails going through the guy's cheek.

I never caught this the first time watching. Because Joseph is magnetic now his body acted like a compass needle and pointed north.

"Oh my gooooood!"

This is **the** episode for Joseph engrish.

Awwwwkward.

The only problem I have with Part 3 is that when one or more people are dealing with a stand user the others are like, "Hmm X character isn't here yet. They're late. Could they have gotten into trouble with an enemy stand........Nah."

This is where things get really hilarious.

"She has amazing legs. Look for a pair of amazing legs." 

"W-We're going to look in?!"

Poor Avdol is too much of a gentleman for this.

Uh oh the magnetism unlocked all the stalls!

"Hory shiiiit!"

"This is not in line with my image! Bathroom disaster is Polnareff's thing!"

Avdol telling it like it is.

Haha it zooms in on Mariah's ass.
>> ARTICLE
I really like Mariah's inclusion because it's been all dude fights non stop for a while now. Her powers are so involving, it's exciting in that front as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there's only been a handful of female stand users so it's nice. Plus the way her powers work means things become a lot easier for her the longer things take. She even stopped running once she saw Avdol and Joseph were stuck together.
>> ARTICLE
There is a reason they haven't gone to help them. You will know next episode. For once they have an excuse lol

>> ARTICLE
Hmm I don't recall why. Man it's only been a little more than a year since this episode aired and I can't remember what happens. I'll probably kick myself for not remembering tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
You might want to remember it while rewatching, so just ignore the spoiler, but it's that [Later part 3](/s "IIRC they run into Alessi while Joseph and Abdul are fighting Mariah.")


>> ARTICLE
That makes sense. Something like that happens again when [Part 3 Spoilers](/s "Polnareff, Avdol and Iggy encounter Vanilla Ice while Jotaro, Joseph and Kakyoin finish up with Terence.")
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, the first time I read this and the radio was acting up along with Joseph's hand, I just assumed it was Joseph's technology-destroying aura.

Mariah's a wonderful Stand user, really capturing how a very weak/situational Stand can be amazing in the right hands. She doesn't just attack Joseph and Avdol while staying out of their Stand ranges and effortlessly using the environment to her advantage, she psychologically attacks both of them while doing so. Even if they get out of her traps, they still look like fools and wear themselves down mentally. Not to mention the boldness of fighting them in populated areas. And she certainly knows the [power of her legs](https://youtu.be/TftaA_Vrzus), to boot. 

They don't bring it up enough, but Joseph and Avdol have had adventures in the later years between Parts 2 and 3. Their bond doesn't seem as tight as Joseph's bond with Caesar, but it's still a friendship and I'm glad we get to see the two of them on a bit of a duo adventure here.
>> ARTICLE
Mariah is extremely fun to play as in the old fighting game for this reason.
>> ARTICLE
That evil chick stand user better deliver:

* Yo you stupid ass doctor... You don't joke about stuff like discharging and someone getting their eyesight back

* Why do I feel this OP would be 10 times better with SFX?

* Oho... Bastet's Mariah

* PolPol isn't the only one with bathroom trouble

* Wtf? A socket in the rock?

* either it's an illusion stand or it's a stand that looks like a socket. Since I'm watching JJBA, I'm gonna assume it's the weirder option. The stand looks like a socket

* Fun trivia fact: The name of the cafe is Cafe Al- Mahroosa, which translates to 'The protected(female)'

* Did his hand magnetize or something?

* Ok...This is actually getting dangerous

* Heh. Joseph is now a chick magnet

* So as long as she stays in range, he basically kills himself. That's a pretty interesting stand design tbh

* Oh dayum. I like Mariah already

* Hahaha... Avdol saves the day

* Haha... Sneaky breast grab by Avdol. We saw that

* Wow Mariah. You broke some kind of anime code. You simply can't hide in the women's bathroom

* Ahaha... Avdol is worried about his image

* Wow... Mariah is a genius. And now Avdol is a magnet too

* Oh shit. Avdol x Joseph is now canon?

* No matter how I try to wrap my head around it, I don't see Bastet being related to magnetism or attraction. She's the Protector goddess. Often linked to the moon, due to her son being god of the moon. Also considered goddess of cats, fire, and pregnant women. It was always said that Bast possessed two personalities or alter-egos, the cat and the lioness, so one could theorize about the attraction between her two sides. But that's just me reaching. It's probably Araki maximizing the benefits of the 'Rule of Cool'

Edit: Happy cake day, Smurf!

Joseph's and Abdul's bizarre pervert adventure! Featuring magnetism! To be honest, the magnetism isn't consistent in any way. They walk through crowds of people and through lobbies and only a select few items get pulled in. But that's just a case of "Araki does what's funny and what's awesome", so it doesn't bother me that much. And looking for that detail finally made me realize that the women on the toilet weren't all finished at the same time, no. Joseph's magnetism pulled the locks!  

Anyway, that's a buddy episode of Joseph and Abdul.

* Captain Tennile is named after the musical duo *Captain & Tennile*. In some subs he's called "Captain Dragon", because Daryl Dragon was the "Captain" in *Captain & Tennile*.

* Although *this is never stated in the anime*, Forever's full name is *Wu-Tang Forever*. So you know he ain't nothin to fuck wit.

* Devo the Cursed's name is based off of the awesome music group *DEVO*. Some subs including the Crunchyroll ones call him "Soul Sacrifice", which is a reference to a Santana song.

* Best husbando Hol Horse's name could be a reference to one of two things: The band *Full Force*, or the music duo *Hall and Oates*.

* Polnareff's sister Sherry is named for a Michel Polnareff song, *Tout, Tout Pour Ma Chrie* (Cherie = Sherry, get it?)

* Nena is named after the German singer of the same name, best known for *99 Luftballons*.

**Current Reference Counter: 51**

Also, a lot of people think Jojo is named after the song *Get Back* ("Get back, Jojo."), but this is actually not true. It comes from a restaurant called "Jonathan's". The last name 'Joestar' was picked because Araki wanted him to have the same initials (JJ). Thus, Jonathan Joestar, or Jojo.

This might be my least favourite stand fight. It isn't even really the fanservice, it's how fast it switches between humour and seriousness. Like with the elevator it goes from Joseph about to die to the old "the scary thing stopped happening and you're still freaking out" gag which I'm not too fond of. There were some good lines like Abdul's bathroom disaster bit but in the whole I don't really like the humour. I also only noticed this on the rewatch but that annoying magnet sound effect plays more or less the entire episode.

I also wish Bastet was used a bit better, however it is a really passive stand but so was Lovers and that was great. There are three great but I can think of though. 

Plus Mariah is pretty cool.

Happy cake day.

And so... best grill Mariah appears. Come at me manga boys. 

I've always felt her stand is really weak because it's pretty fucking hard to make someone go and touch a freaking socket just because. However, she knows her shit and plays it cool by putting the socket next to the stop button or in a weird place such as a rock so that curiosity kills the cat.

By the way smurf, careful...  that  cake  might  be  an  enemy  STANDO

Part 3 was officially released in English in 2005 since that part was already popular in the West. With the new rerelease of the manga in Japan and the popularity of the anime, they started to translate Parts 1 and 2 into English last year. I think they're still releasing Part 2 this year, no plans announced so far to rerelease Part 3 or start doing Part 4 at all.

Anyone who's read Jojo's in English beyond Part 3 did it through scanlations.

On this episode of "The gang split up and go off by themselves", the gang completely ignore their previous rule of always travelling in groups.

I'm not saying I'd be better suited to this than the Stardust Crusaders (I don't think I'm quite beefy enough for them), but I would not be falling for this many Stand traps. At this point I'd see a mysterious socket and say "A strange socket!? That's probably a Stand. Hey Dadvol, get over here and immolate this thing just to be on the safe side.  
Speaking of Dadvol, did he just forget about Magician's Red in this episode? At the end when they were stuck to each other, he could have solved all of their problems by just bringing out Magician's Red and setting that lady on fire. What's she going to do? Stop it with her power socket? Crossfire Hurricane seems to have pretty decent range on it, and could probably turn the lady into dust, so why not use it? The only trace of that lady should now be a reverse silhouette on the facing wall, but instead she's being smug. All she did was half heartedly run away from them after first placing her magic socket (not an innuendo) in a place where they might touch it.

I was correct in my earlier guess that Bast/Baset (the episode titles even use both, so I don't know what's happening there) would be one of the nine gods, so I'm feeling mildly smug about that. God Bastet was the god of some stuff, to be honest I'm not exactly sure what. Unfortunately she suffered a lot from the converging nature of Egyptian Mythology; whilst Thoth gained a massive resume from constantly having new roles assigned to him, Bastet instead had changing roles. I think that she was originally a Goddess of warfare (she was also a lion in this time, rather than a cat), but those aspects were largely shifted off to Sekhmet (in some versions they were different aspects of the same being in a Jekyll & Hyde type arrangement). I think she might have been a love God at some point, but don't quote me on that (if she was then that's probably what Stand Bastet's power relates to). She's largely remembered as being simply a Cat God, which speaks a lot to how stripped of actual role she was, after all we don't think of Anubis as simply a Dog God (palindrome), or Thoth as simply an Ibis God. She's a God who was shifted from position to position until she eventually ended up being in charge of the creatures whose face she shared, and that wasn't even her original face. Bastet as a God has had a hard time of it, and I've no doubt that she would be quite satisfied about the fact that she's now one of the best known/remembered of the Egyptian Gods.

Anyway, on to the next episode. Let's see if Dadvol remembers he has the power to set people on fire.

I find funny how the great majority of the newcomers in the first episode Iggy was introduced, hated his guts, and now we are all sad because he died.

I think we are all Polnareffs. In the begin, we hated Iggy, and just wanted him gone without caring if he had his reasons to be a grumpy, antisocial dog. But little by little we started to like him on his own, grumpy and prideful way, and get used with him around.

And now that he died, we get to the same realization as Polnareff got: now that he is gone, we will really miss him.

So I relate with Polnareff's pain much more due that.

In the first episode of this season I claimed that Iggy was my favorite Crusader, and some people got confused of why he was. Well, that's your answer. Aside my love for dogs, I really understand Iggy's character and how much he grown since his very first episode.

There are other deaths in this franchise that really tear me up(like Jonathan's), and Iggy is among them.

Well, rest in piece, you "shitty little mutt", you got avenged! *Salute*
>> ARTICLE
When I was watching this weekly, I honestly didn't hate Iggy that much, and his development and how he saved Polnareff made me love him more than I already did. So to see all the hate towards Iggy (on here and the site where I'm watching this) when we first meet him, while being justifiable was still a little difficult for me. Whenever someone would say, "I wish this stupid dog would die" I would be like oh just you wait bud you'll get your chance whether you like it or not.
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit of a shame Polnareff is used as a secondary and pratfall character almost exclusively at times, but he really is one of the most relatable characters in this arc by far. Jotaro is a badass and all, but he is like a rock. Sturdy, unemotional and just too much of a badass to have much failings. Kakyoin is a brilliant mind and Avdol makes for great straight man. Joseph is pretty close to Polnareff in terms of being just goofy and bewildered enough to be a great standin for the viewers. Though Polnareff has all those moments of personal failure that we see him grow out of, and it's easy to empathize with his journey. Out of all Jojo characters in Stardust Crusaders, Polnareff grew the most.
>> ARTICLE
It's like how John Milton wrote *Paradise Lost* so that we at first emphasized with Satan before realizing how evil he truly was, so that every reader mimicked the Fall of Man themselves. We *all* became Polnareffs when we watched this show.
>> ARTICLE
Looking back, it now seems incredibly obvious how Vanilla Ice was able to survive being stabbed through the brain stem. I could say that I was thrown off by the fact that there was sunlight in the room, but then Id be lying.  
It was incredibly satisfying to watch the Frenchman just beat the everloving shit out of that guy. It didnt even matter that the guy was immortal, just watching the French Prince of Bel Aire let loose with a bunch of stabbing was so nice to watch. However my favourite part of the whole fight was the really casual way that Silver Chariot pushed him into the sunlight. It was so light and nonchalant, it was utterly delightful.  

Iggys sacrifice was a pretty powerful moment, more so that Dadvols. This makes sense as Dadvols death was very sudden and short, whereas we actually got some time to digest Iggys. But theres another aspect to it as well: Dadvols died before and come back from it, his Stands a phoenix, hes a guy for whom death might turn out to be an inconvenience (Im pretty certain that this is why his arms were cut off in the attack, as a way of saying Hey guys, hes actually dead. Hes not coming back out of the Dark Dimension, and even if he does he wont have any arms); but Iggys a dog, and Dogs are not safe in JBA. The show Kills the Dog to the extent that I think its probably satire, so we know that Dogs arent safe. Then theres the fact that hed just been through a big character ark, and finally started to connect to the other Crusaders.  
It was a touching death, and the use of the soul smoke was a really nice send off to the two of them.

Now that Iggys gone, Im going to take another look at his Stand, and how it relates to the Tarot. I mentioned when he first appeared that the Symbology of The Fool card usually features a dog, and thats still the primary link between them, but the way he relates to the Fools journey goes much deeper.  
The Fools journey is the story of the Tarot, and my preferred way of thinking about them. It follows the Fool on his (rather vague) journeys through life, and the other cards are the events and people he encounters on the way. The first person the Fool (#0) meets on his journey is The Magician (#1) who presents the Fool with tools which will help him on his journey (the tools are things which the Fool was already carrying but not really aware of, and unable to use properly) and explains much of their use. The person who managed to capture Iggy from the streets of New York was Dadvol, bearer of Magicians Red, who set Iggy on a new path where he was able to use the Stand he already bore in the pursuit of a much grander and more meaningful goal (its also notable that Dadvol countered Iggy in much the same way that Iggy countered the Frenchman, and that he would have countered Pet Shop Boys who was the main villain Iggy faced).  
In the event of The Star (#17) The Fool stands (no pun intended) amongst the ruins of his past and is consumed by inner turmoil, he encounters a beautiful woman pouring water onto the floor and into a pool who offers him guidance. In his first encounter with JoJoJo, bearer of Star Platinum, Iggy finds himself at the ruins of the Helicopter which brought him to Egypt. The two then fight the enemy Stand bearer who JoJoJo kills which causes the guys Water Stand to be absorbed into the ground. JoJoJo then lays down the law to Iggy and explains the path forwards. The symbolism here is pretty direct.  
When the Fool was having a bit of a worry about how to maintain the things hed built, he encountered The Chariot (#7), and the Charioteer within. From this man the Fool learned some things about facing foes, and fighting. In his later interactions with the Frenchman, bearer of Silver Chariot, he recieved help and guidance on facing their mutual foes (e.g. when French said they would go back to back so they couldnt be snuck up on).  
He didnt have any major interactions with Fancy Guy or JoJo that I can remember (which is probably for the best seeing as the Hermit actually is the Fool in the story), so I cant really go into those. But with the ones I have gone into, we see Iggys interactions with the other Crusaders somewhat mirroring The Fools interactions with the characters from their cards.

The encounter with the Vegeta looking vampire was fun, which was just what was needed after the emotional heaviness of the rest of the episode. He was a bit shit, and got beat up. I think Crunchyrolls decision to not translate his name was a bit *bizarre* as I get the impression hes supposed to be called Idiot or Dickhead or something.  

Were heading into the final stretch now, and fighting with Dio seems imminent. I look forwards to seeing how this all turns out.

Note: Apparently the English clocks changed today. Who knew? Not me. They all changed themselves without me having to be involved. This is the second time that changing clocks have left me confused about the time this thread goes up.
>> ARTICLE
> I think Crunchyrolls decision to not translate his name was a bit bizarre as I get the impression hes supposed to be called Idiot or Dickhead or something.

Yeah, he exists mainly for that joke and there's no music reference there, so it's really odd that they went with such a literal translation. The BD subs some rewatchers are using call him Nimrod, which is pretty clever because it's a real name and an insult that someone like Jotaro might know.
>> ARTICLE
I went with Nimrod for my subs because it's also a little dated; near as I can tell, Nukesaku is also an insult not exactly in common usage these days, but both terms were in use in the 80s more than now. I think. They feel like they were, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: Nimrod is the name of a legendary hunter from the Old Testament. Its common usage today as an insult is entirely due to one episode of Looney Tunes in which Bugs Bunny uses the name to mock Elmer Fudd.
>> ARTICLE
Nimrod is also the name of the scary mega-Sentinels in the future timeline of X-Men though.

Of course Polnareff fights DIO first, he's the main character after all.

YES! The true protagonist of JoJo lives!

[](#excitedyui)

And I can accept the circumstances on how he lives. I gotta say, Polly is one of the more tragic characters in the series. He's always saved by others and the guilt from that must be heart wrenching for him. If he lives throughout the rest of this series, having to deal others saving him by sacrificing themselves is going to be hell once everything is said and done. It's really what makes him a great character and why I like Polly so much, along with his shenanigans and lovable idiot stuff. 

Him back stabbing Vanilla ice was dope as shit and his calm collected voice while doing so was great. 

Sadly we part with Iggy and Abdol for certain now. It's a shame for Abdol as his character I found to be the weakest of the SC along with Kakyoin. I think Iggy got some great development in the last couple of episodes I'll miss the little guy. Still, I would have loved some more buddy moments between Iggy and Polly. 

Overall Vanilla ice was my favourite fight so far in all of Part 3 by a long shot.

Oh boy. The episode starts with the three crusaders that didn't fight Vanilla Ice. Because everyone else is already dead. And just to rub it in, here's Polnareff's death again.

YES! IGGY! POLNAREFF! YES!

NO! IGGY! NO!

[When the entire audience](https://i.imgur.com/qoU5VDW.png) [is Polnareff for one minute.](https://i.imgur.com/G04V0EF.png)

NO! VANILLA ICE! NO!

YES! POLNAREFF! DO THE HORAHORA THING!

After immortal demigods, tarot punch ghosts, and egyptian god ~~cards~~ stands, [suddenly we're back to sunlight sensitive vampires.](https://i.imgur.com/ybM08M5.png) And it just feels so satisfying.

I'm glad Araki started showing [the souls of main characters ascending to heaven](https://i.imgur.com/VWCpEXu.png). It helps with [the closure](https://i.imgur.com/1AmqDZZ.png), and it just looks so damn beautiful. [](#poltears) [major fucking spoilers](/s "I'm so sad that we won't see the soul for the next death.")

Leave it to anime to suddenly cut from character deaths and heaven and the final battle in Egypt to Japan where almost nothing of relevance is going on. It's a great scene and everything (very fitting of JoJo's Bizarre Travel Guide to give a tourist introduction to Japan) and this is the last moment they could fit it in but it still doesn't feel right. [Part 5](/n "That's not _that_ turtle, is it?")

I just want to mention this once again. Suzie Q in Japan _is_ a great scene and this is probably the best moment to put it ("'if' he is defeated" helps set the tone for the final fight and Suzie meeting Holly reminds us what this is all about). Still a bit weird.

Ah yes, Nimrod, that one guy who competes with Kenny G for least amount of screen time ever. His stand is an interesting idea but as everyone pointed out, it's a bit shit. It's literally a worse version of Oingo's stand, and that one already was pretty useless. DIO must have turned him into a vampire out of pitty. That's right, he's so bad that even DIO feels pity.

[IsYourLeftHandARightHand.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zJtMCsa.png) Vampire guy announcing he's a vampire to the one half of the group that contains the guy with magic vampire killing karate powers. Nobody said he was a smart guy.

After-credits scene! Yay! It's Poln- No, [it was me, **DIO**](#konodioda)! Next time, DIO's World! It's time for one last marathon of hype, and boy it's not gonna disappoint.

----

It's time to feel again. We all feared it was coming, we hoped the stand would help avert his fate but alas, nobody can protect you if you're a dog in JoJo. Iggy's soul ascended to heaven, and there he can now go for one final, eternal [Iggy Walk](http://viewpure.com/dgWc4sD7zzg?start=0&end=0).

I had actually managed to completely forget about the Suzie Q in Japan scene between watching the episode and replying in this thread. I'm not really sure how that happened. I think you're right, it was a good scene, but not much of relevance seemed to happen in it.  

With Nimrod, I don't think he actually had a Stand. I think that the face on the back of his head was just a Vampire power, like how Wired Beck could turn his hair into spikes, or Jack the Ripper could summon knives.

Wait, Jack the Ripper could summon knives as a power? I thought he had just stuffed his body with a few hundred knives beforehand.

Here is why Polnareff is my favourite character, he's seen two of his friends die, both times dying to save him. Those he give in to despair?  

No he fucking kills Ice in the most badass fucking way possible and proceeds to "stair" down fucking DIO.

Polnareff is the soul of the group, and I think that's reflected well when we think he's going to die, it's dramatic, slow and powerful, and while it is really sad Iggy died saving him, in all honesty he was presumably on a very short time limit anyway, with his wounds and his lack of options against Ice.

Also strap the fuck in for the hype, that is DIO's world.

I will likely be home in time to post the thread on time tomorrow, and then everything will be completely back to normal.

This episode is designed to reestablish 2 big vampire weaknesses for those of us who may have forgotten over the past 60 or so episodes. Direct sunlight can easily annihilate even the strongest vampire, and immortality/regeneration does not stop one from getting severely beaten and wounded. It's a natural crash course for Jotaro, Polnareff and Kakyoin before we get to the final battle.

RIP Iggy, and a final farewell to Avdol. It's a shame that Vanilla Ice didn't catch on a bit quicker: his Stand is actually a perfect one for a vampire. Even sunlight can't harm him while he's within the void: the trick would just be figuring out when it's safe to peek out.

I adore the Suzie Q segment. It's the last little bit of light we're going to get before the final fight, it reestablishes just what the Crusaders are fighting for/the suffering of the Joestar line and it gives both of the women a bit of much-needed screen time.

This Time on [DIOs Motherfucking Reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTKRDZ_8Qek)

Ye have little faith in the true main character. Araki would never kill off Polnareff, and I find it crazy that so many actually thought he was dead in here considering how many new watchers totally called him living and Iggy dying in the original discussion thread.

In that light, RIP Iggy. You were a much better character than any other dog in JoJo (eat your heart out Danny, your alternate universe mouse counterpart is objectively better than you) and you were a true hero.

So to anyone who may complain about Vanilla Ice not dying from light earlier. JoJos vampire abilities require time to take over, especially if they are changed by being given blood instead of through the mask. I believe it actually requires the vampire to take a killing blow after being turned to start taking on Vampiric qualities, which Ice definitely takes from PolPol stabbing him through the head.

Nukesaku is trash. He is objectively the least effective stage hazard in ASB (less annoying than the lightning strikes on Morioh though). Nukesaku means dumbass (essentially) in Japanese, so when Jotaro calls him that, he is just calling him an idiot. Pure coincidence that he is actually called that as a name.

Suzy Q has an awesome turule. It would be really bad if it got left behind and was then left in a fountain in a suburb of ~~Sendai~~ S-City

And then we have DIOs reveal. [This meme needed to be posted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUwWMPW0gU) Please note that this specific video does show the appearance of DIOs stand, but that is a very minor spoiler comparative to DIOs appearance. Also, please understand that I will post this whenever DIO is shown in a future part. It is too relevant to leave unused at any opportunity.

Funny you mention that. I joined an ASB tournament at the con today, and I actually won my first round because my opponent got hit by Nukesaku.

One of the reports mentioned that the vampire thing was the spoiler? No idea if it actually is one, though, so if it is a tag would be appreciated. The link tags you've already done are fine :)

It most certianly is not a spoiler. That is combined knowledge from the fight that concluded in this episode and the previous two Parts of the series that revolved around vampires. It is possible that someone thought it might contain information from the final fight of this part but that is incorrect as it has nothing to do with it. Thank you for being so polite with this.

I addressed that earlier. I even posted my original with the whole disclaimer about it having DIO's stand (although I dismissed it as incredibly minor as it shows up early next episode). There are likely just people misinterpreting something I said as a spoiler in the part about vampire physiology.

Jojo MMDs are the perfect blend of terrible and fantastic. It helps that unlike most MMDs which feature cute girls, Jojo's cast is almost entirely huge muscle men and bishie husbandos. There is also a surprisingly low amount of 60s-80 rock or metal, despite that being most of what Jojo references.

You're spot-on, Ice became a vampire after his brain stem was stabbed (you can actually see the moment his eyes change, and he consistently has small fangs after a scene or two.) The room is lit via daylight through the windows, but it's ambient light rather than direct sunrays. It's pretty well done.
>> ARTICLE
> I find it crazy that so many actually thought he was dead in here

I think it's a combination of some people thinking he died (the scene was reasonably clear about that, it just immediately got ret-conned) and some of us who already knew what was coming trying a bit too hard not to spoil anything.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Iggy. A salute for the best dog in this show who went out like a true bro and by his own choice. It will probably traumatize PolPol forever, having Abdul die twice for him and Iggy who he only now accepted as a friend.

I feel so bad, but i'm laughing so much
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know what to expect anymore... I really want to binge the remaining episodes, but masochist that I am, I won't do it.

* Vanilla Ice takes the word 'fanatic' to new heights

* He's alive!! Iggy saves the day one more fucking time!! And...He dies for it. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkk this show and its dog killing fetish

* Don't hate me, but...I honestly would've preferred Iggy stayed alive and PolPol died.

* Yep. My theory was correct. He's a vamp.

* And he got rekt...hard...by his own ignorance. After taking down both Avdol and Iggy. Fuck, that's not a fair trade. DIO, come the fuck out of your rat hole and fight!!

* Why on earth would you break from all the action and go back to Suzie Q??

* I appreciate you trying to remind us of Holly and everything, but this scene looks like a time-filler. What's up with all the exposition?

* Oh come on...You don't just break immersion that hard... Rehashing old talks and showing that Suzie Q isn't as stupid as we are meant to think she is... Nothing new, basically.

* It's not a bad scene...It really isn't it. But holy hell did this just one-shot my enthusiasm.

* There's more minions in the way!? For fuck's sake...Bring DIO out already

* Finally, they're not fooled by appearances. It took 2 freaking seasons.

* Jotaro warming up for the big one

* WTF?? DIO found PolPol first!

> Don't hate me, but...I honestly would've preferred Iggy stayed alive and PolPol died.

Nah, I kind of agree with you. I'm torn on Polnareff, and a little surprised by how much people around here like him as he's my least favorite main/crusader. On one hand I think that this fight finally gave him the development that he really needed when Avdol first died. I found him obnoxious and don't particularly like him, with the Vanilla Ice fight really as the exception. I think it also helps that for once he wasn't just overpowered or out smarted, like uh.. (to varying degrees) Anubis, Alessi, Hol Horse (with Oingo, I'll give him the first time), his attraction to Nena, Enya fucking him up, Cameo the fucking Genie-stand, and probably others I'm not thinking of. 

He was just written as being so weak and helpless much of the time-a complete moron, while he was introduced as being pretty strong/competent, and shown here in this fight to be plenty capable again. If we just had more decent Polnareff insted of comic relief Polnareff inbetween, I might like him more.
>> ARTICLE
I know you are eager to get to Dio, but didn't you just loved the scene that Jotaro says "Let's see how much immortal you are!"?

Nukesaku apparence is worth it just for that scene. =P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know... The effect of that scene was totally lost after that 7 minute Suzie Q break though...
>> ARTICLE
Since I'm rewatching, I skipped the Suzie Q part this time which helped a bit. That part seemed much slower than I remember the first time (probably to make sure the fights had the right pacing they were looking for). That's also the only part I've skipped over in part 3. 
>> ARTICLE
Smurf you're back! Was it an enemy stand!?

By rights now Polnareff should have no earrings in either ear since he lost one while fighting Alessi but we all know anime characters are able to completely restore their original appearance after a fight thus he had both when this battle started.

Iggy saves the day one last time. And then dies. Rip you wonderful little shit. Best little shit ever.

Oh man he twisted Ice's head right around.

And Ice gets fucking wrecked. Polnareff and Silver Chariot too epic.

And then Avdol and Iggy's spirits depart for the afterlife. Rip Avdol and Iggy.

The saddest part of this moment is as far as Polnareff is concerned he's all alone know. As far as he knows Jotaro, Joseph and Kakyoin died fighting Terence. It's only him and Dio now.

Wtf Suzie Q owns a tortoise. What is with this show? Going from such a sad moment to a silly moment just like that. Only in Jojo.

"Hello hello. Give me smile!"

Dammit Suzie we're supposed to be grieving here!

Rosas being a badass and kicking the fool in the chest.

Suzie may not be the smartest woman as Part 2 showed but she's not an idiot. She's dealt with weird stuff before.

Jotaro smashes the woman in the face! I was so confused when this first aired. It's because it's actually Nukesaku!

Jotaro: I fight for my friends.

"Oh my goood."

"Oraoraoraoraoraora!"

Now that Dio has shown up (and shown his face for the first time during the entirety of Part 3) it's time to [show off this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTKRDZ_8Qek)

There was one that had subs and started with Dio rounding the corner but that one must have gotten removed, I'm unable to find it. This is alright though.

It was really hard acting like Polnareff was dead in the last thread. Worth it though.

Not a whole lot to say, Vanilla Ice had a good fight and an awesome death, Nukesaku was an idiot with a hilariously bad stand [PART 6](/n "Later in the manga in part 6 DIO talks about what he thought was the worst stand that he had met and I think Araki just forgot that Nukesaku existed.") and Suzie Q's adventure in Japan was fun but I think it was just filler so they had more time for the DIO fight.

Nukesaku doesn't have a stand. Like in part one, Dio was doing experiments, and stitched another face on the back of his head.

Hmm. I thought that when DIO referred to Nukesaku's "power" he meant a stand. Because vampirism is still very powerful.

Iggy once again doing things I don't like....next episode should be interesting

This time on HoHos Bizarre Adventure he is weirdly excited after being reminded that he cannot transform.

Quite frankly Thoth is a liability, but from a storytelling standpoint (no pun intended) its the best kind of liability. Using Thoth can be useful but more often than not it seems too set you up for some kind of misfortune, the thing is that its tempting. Even if you know that Thoth might lead you astray, the idea that you can see into the future still seems incredible. Its the kind of perceived power that could easily cause you to overlook the problems.  
Boingo doesnt see this because hes become reliant on the predictions, hes so introverted because hes scared to act without Thoth first telling him what to do, and hes so used to having his brother to act for him. Because he never acts on his own, he never really gets a sense of what he might be able to accomplish without waiting for the readings, so he never really understands the downsides of Thoth. Im pretty certain that HoHo would have seen through the appeal of Thoth soon enough, but unfortunately misfortune struck too soon for that. 

If HoHo had followed up on the truck, he may well have been able to wipe the Crusaders out. The only one active was JoJoJo, and it took him a while to get up. Combine this with the fact that we saw HoHo react faster than the Frenchman, and it seems reasonable that he could have taken out JoJoJo before Platinum killed him. The other three would then have been easy pickings. But hed just been impressed with the power of Thoth, so when Boingo shouted Lets run away for now and await a new prediction, he went along with it.

I cant really blame HoHo for those cock ups, as I said earlier the temptation of seeing the future is very strong. What I can blame him for is being hit by his own bullets. The bullets are as much a part of the Stand as the gun is, he should have dismissed them as soon as they missed JoJoJo, instead he forgot, and got shot the same way Dadvol did.

I liked these episodes. The episodes have been getting increasingly intense, and I suspect that trend is only going to continue as we get closer and closer to the end (and we really are quite close to the end, it hadnt really clicked until today). So it was nice to have a fun, easy going break from that.  
By the looks of that next episode preview were going to be getting right back to that intensity tomorrow. It looks like that bird of Dios is going to be the enemy. Is it a Stand bearer? If so how did it wear a robe for the meeting with Dio? Or maybe its going to be more like those freaky chimeras Dio made in Phantom Blood. Remember those? What was the deal with those? And what happened to HoHos elephant?
>> ARTICLE
It's DIOs personal pet bird.
>> ARTICLE
> If so how did it wear a robe for the meeting with Dio? 

Curse you. I was gonna bring that up tomorrow :p
>> ARTICLE
We will talk more about the Bird tomorrow, but no, the Bird wasn't present on the meeting, because he was already with Dio since Season 1.

Remember on Season 1? The Bird was on Dio's shoulder when he was talking with Kakyoin before mind controling him. It is the same bird.

A message to anime-only JoJo fans: if you liked this episode, you'll love Part 4. 

But commenting on the episode, as I said before, some of my favorite JoJo chapters/episodes when are the ones that we see things from the villain's point of view. It's fascinating to see their thought process, and changes things up (and Part 3 really needs that once in a while).

Overall, amazing episode, and as always the best ending. I like the fact that Hol doesn't sing as well as Boingo, just like his "partnership" with Oingo is forced and doesn't works out that well.
>> ARTICLE
YES, my favorite thing about JoJo is when we get to see what the bad guys are thinking the entire time instead of the heroes. I LOVE THIS 
>> ARTICLE
It's a much more interesting POV in general, since it's always fun to root for the underdog. Usually that comes down to the enemy Stand user being powerful enough to take out our heroes, but after a while it's pretty clear that either the main characters are too skilled to be constant underdogs or everyone trying to fight them is way too overpowered.

Plus with this arc, it wasn't Hol Horse and Boingo vs the Crusaders as much as it was Hol Horse vs fate as predicted by Thoth. If you consider Stand Battles to besituationscreated by Stands, all the situations Hol Horse found himself in were the result of knowing Thoth's predictions and attempting to try and follow them. The Crusaders were part of the situations, but their Stands really didn't play a part at all.
>> ARTICLE
...JJBA best sitcom

Today is the day Hol Horse retires.

Needless to say, that was his episode. Had he checked the clock tower instead of his watch, he could have made it. But now there's the question if that clock tower was accurate by the global standard, heh.

Jotaro: 15,  Polnareff: 15

I'm glad complete clydesdale only retired, didn't die (at least I hope that's what i means)

That ending is sad though, I didn't realize when I watched through for the first time that Boingo was actually depressed, I just thought he had problems with most people. I don't want him to be more depressed, I want him to stick to the inner pledge he made for himself and his brother, they could really be happy and help people. 

Also, they wouldn't be the biggest help, but if they wanted to be good guys, I'm sure the crusaders would have at least accepted them as acquaintances. 
>> ARTICLE
Weirdest signal ever. Honestly just pointing your eyes in that direction is normally good enough. The tongue probably threw them off.

Avdol, being one of the smart ones, figures it out.

I love how so far at 7 minutes into the episode the same silly music has been playing pretty much non stop.

Those guys from before! Their truck crashed into Jotaro and the others! Boingo's manga is 100% true!

Honestly at this point I can't see how disobeying the manga wouldn't caused something bad to happen. Hol Horse literally just has to walk up and shoot all four guys in the head. Using the pipe just seems like an added hassle.

Even Hol Horse's bullets have faces.

I like how Boingo doesn't get out from under the box and just crawls around.

Awwrgh he sneezed in Jotaro's face. Oh god Polnareff. He grins though. Getting sneezed on is okay in Jotaro's book.

If it wasn't for Iggy's bad attitude here Boingo might have given up being a bad guy. Him and Oingo might have lived pretty honest lives. Screw that plan though. 

This episode was hilarious. So many moments in pretty much all of Jojo so far have been funny. I can only imagine what hilarity Part 4 may bring. Only 10 days left guys!
>> ARTICLE
Goodbye, Hol Horse/Boingo. It was fun while it lasted. What made them work so well as antagonists was that even though they worked for Dio, you almost wanted to see them come out on top (and they would have too, had they not waited for Thoth to make another prediction).
>> ARTICLE
Alright, let's see how the hell that got your nose scene will play out:

* That epic music just makes everything twice as hilarious

* Ahaha... that hostage situation would've gone really differently if this was anyone but PolPol

* That sneeze, what the hell.....

* HAHAHAHAH... A freaking car hit them.. what the fk

* And just like that, Hol Horse is now a believer

* So... Why is Boing still crawling under the box?

* TIL bullets can infinitely bounce inside a pipe

* Hahahaha.. he sneezed again

* Wait...what? The bullets hit him??

* Uh...That was seriously anti-climatic

* Eh. What was up with that speech?

* Oh shit.. That's iggy!!

* HOL HORSE! BOINGO! KONBI!!

* Smurf, you jinxed it. I have no idea what stand is coming next.

Reddit done goofed tonight guys. Guess we won't be able to respond to each other.

The inside of Dio's mansion is weird. As soon as you open the front door there's a bunch of openings along the wall. The only reason I can see for this is if he has some sort of courtyard. The big open area Enya was in with the cat in season 1 perhaps?

"I am Darby Younger. Brother of Darby Elder."

Nice change there crunchyroll.

Oop no opening this episode either. We need all the time we can get.

I like how Terence's initials are on his stand as well.

"Oh my god!"

He's already made a doll of Kakyoin!

I absolutely love the music F-Mega has. It's so hype. For anyone who wants to know the ost track is called "Sprint". And after a while we transition into Noble Pope.

"Ef Mega! Serect your cur!"

Oh man this race is hype. Especially the tunnel part.

>"I am Darby Younger. Brother of Darby Elder."

The most ridiculous part of it, as /u/Cleverly_Clearly's reference tracking post might tip you off to, is that their shared musical reference is Terence Trent D'Arby. So no matter what, they're still saying the D'Arby part of it (likely because Daniel literally spells it out for us).

The current D'Arby references the name much more directly, which I suppose is the cause for the sudden insistence on Elder and Younger.

I'll be honest with you guys. Alessi didn't faze me to watch in public, but this episode must've been the weirdest shit ever for the sanitary equipment installer who sat next to me on the bus.  
First some dude floats in the air, then everyone has some ghosts appearing... then they get dragged into a hole and end up at a beach.  
THEN there's creepy fucking dolls everywhere before ridiculously muscular men play a racing game on a TV and act as if it's the most intense shit they've ever done in their life.   

But... no doubt that this is Kakyoin's episode. That dude is good at video games, I'll give him that. It's also kind of cute how he doesn't want to answer how many times he's played the game. Hiding his power level, I bet.

So I spent my usual Jojo time writing a WT! and then got a power outage right after... So...Yeah...Here I am

* I should have a count of how many times this guy says "Ani-"

* What on earth is that stand?

* Ooooooh... Atum!!

* Joseph's burn it all down plan is quite a smart one

* Oh hey, Jojo beach episode!

* Creepy dolls are creepy.... Like....SO CREEPY!!

* So DIO managed to stumble upon not one, but *two* sibling stand users? All while being stuck in Egypt...... huh?

* And he goes for Kakyoin? Interesting. Kakyoin should've challenged him to the Jojo capcom game

* They're actually gonna play a videogame for the price of soul... K

* Bam! Hierophant green with the spin moves

* Kakyoin MVP, boys!! That clutch corner

* Oh...That description of his DIO meeting was...Shocking

* Joseph is the best cheerleader a guy could ask for

* Who would've thought videogames could be this intense... I haven't been this excited for a videogame in anime since NGNL

* Now Atum is a bit of a tricky one. His name was said to be taken from the word 'term', meaning to complete. So, I was contemplating a finish line analogy to his being the 'finisher'. Atum was also associated with the cycle of day and night, as Ra's counterpart, which somewhat supports the distinction. Moreover, old egyptians in the Old Kingdom thought him to be the one who carried their king's soul to the starry heavens after his death.

D'Arby Younger had a really legit entrance floating in like that. 

He seems pretty chill for someone who lost their brother. I'm starting to think they weren't close. 

Oh shit, another gamble. Guess we're getting more gambling goodness. 

Only 10 minutes to fight? Time for talking as a free action to save the day!

Oh wow, video games. Did not expect that, but looking forward to some legit gaming action. Kinda sad this was written a long time ago, we could've seen Joseph playing Dark Souls and crying his eyes out after his 5000th death. 

EXACTLY!!!!!

Oh god, this is way worse than the coins his brother kept. These dolls freak me out. 

F-Mega, sounds like F-Zero. Looking forward to fast car stuff.

GOOD!!!

That Kakoyin doll has messed up eyes wtf. 

This fucking Engrish. Omg. 

Oh shit, D'Arby going for the boost. 

These are some advanced graphics for a game before the 2000s. 

Of course these guys would be using their stand powers to buttom mash. 

Tbh, both of these guys are terrible at racing games. Who just goes straight anymore. Snaking is where it's at.

I really don't understand this racing game. It seems so shitty. Araki, you better never become a video game designer. 

Seems like Kakoyin is in a bad spot. Hope he can pull through. I wonder how many months of playing that game would be necessary for Kakoyin to memorize so much. I can't even beat a Mario Kart level without looking.

Funny you should mention that. There's actually a bonus chapter in Part 7 that explains a bunch of stuff about Stands (as if the reader doesn't already know what Stands are by Part 7) and it actually talks about how Stands can be hereditary. Of course, one of the examples it gives is dead wrong, as the character didn't get their Stand via genetics, but I'm getting off topic here.

Joseph looks to be one of those back seat gamers.

Don't have a lot to say about the episode. I enjoy D'Arby the Gamer over D'Arby the Gambler, simply because this one relies on skill instead of cheating. Kakyoin's back and gets some action right away, though by now it's far too late to take the first place from Jotaro and Polnareff.

I actually prefer the Gambler over the Player. The Player has some extremely fun moments, [D'Arby the Player Spoilers](/s "Especially once Jotaro gets involved"), but the Gambler is so intense for the majority of it, that I can't help but love it. How many other shows can have an episode that only consists of 2 hands of poker, and make it interesting?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the D'Arby the Gambler episodes are better than the Gamer episodes. It also helps that the elder D'Arby is less weird to look at (I still don't know what those grey lines are but they look less ridiculous on the older one).

I just prefer the younger D'Arby's principles.
>> ARTICLE
My theory is that they're tattoos.

I got downvoted when I proposed the idea during D'Arby The Gambler, but it makes the most sense. They look a bit like sideburns on Daniel, but they're clearly not facial hair on Telence and, if you look at his face in slightly angled shots, you can see that the pattern is very flatly printed on the skin and it stops right before the tip of his nose. So they can't be something physically on their faces, and the stopping points are too clean for it to be some sort of natural skin effect.

Jr Darcy had one hell of an entrance. The bit where he was explaining his whole deal however took away from it a bit for me. The shots and cuts there just seemed inexplicable. I have no idea what they were trying for there, but unless it was nausea I don't think they achieved it.  

JoJo's plan of "Mr Dadvol! Burn down this Mansion." Might well be one of the best ones this season. I also like how upfront the guys were with their "We should just kill him. We can kill him" plan. If only they'd actually gone through with it and not stopped when Jr Darcy said to.

I like that we're seeing multiple enemy Stands working in tandem here, even if they're not actually attacking together. It makes it feel a bit more like the guys are actually facing a team.  

This episode was fun. i look forward to seeing how it ends tomorrow.

That move reminds me of the trick on the N64 version of Rainbow Road, where you could jump off the course and land super far ahead. Poor Kakoyin, falling for the oldest racing trick in the book. 

Tbh, I'm pretty sure Kakoyin lost after D'Arby pulled that move. Jotaro shouldn't tell him to keep fighting when he already got rekt beyond repair. 

And here I was hoping that Joseph would finally reveal himself as the ultimate video game master. RIP dreams. 

GOODO!

Just happens to pick the game he's best at.

O THATS A BASEBALL!!!! 

JAGERS!!!

Pls video game engrish. Stop being so bad. 

This is some advanced game stuff. Can't believe a famicom can handle this. 

You know, since there's 4 controllers and screens there, they should've tried playing Mario Party. The sheer frustration would cause D'Arby to kill himself.

Jotaro hasn't even played video games before. What a massive scrub. I wouldn't be friends with such a casual. I'd be pretty insulted if someone who never played video games before wins instantly. 

This baseball gambling action reminds me of One Outs. 

How hard can batting be in this game? Just press a and win. Maybe you might have to adjust where to hit, but aim assist can make things ez. 

Poor D'Arby younger, getting NTRed by his own brother. 

Looks like Jotaro is getting rekt now. He should just gg and go next. 

Holy shit, he took off his hat!

That was a lot of menacing at the end.

Well, they are in 1987, 10 years before the first Mario Party came out

I had the same reaction as Joseph when I though about the possibility that Young D'Arby can read minds as well. I thought to myself how they would beat that!

Next episode will be really fun.

Anyway, "OH, THAT'S A BASEBALL" is my favorite Engrish from the Jojo series. For realz.

I have a bad feeling saying Kakyoin's gonna lose... Hang my hopes on Jotaro?

* He... knocked him out...but it was planned. Ever since dropping power, it was always part of his plan. But it was also part of D'arby's bigger plan. Which wasn't part of Kakyoin's plan. Him not realizing that was part of D'arby's plan. And at this point, I'm fairly confident even Araki didn't know which is which.

* And now it's Jotaro's turn. *Hyyyyype!!*

* Baseball... Hey, I'm game... That seems fairly complicated

* Never thought I would get to see Star Platinum playing baseball

* Based Jotaro...playing the game for the first time yet still relying on pure self-confidence

* Nice speech, mate, but you're kinda getting rekt in-game

* BOOM! HE HIT IT!!

* Joseph's cheerleading game is on point

* Pff.. You'd think they would know by now that Jotaro is so based he learns stuff by proximity

* What a happy little family those two brothers were

* Eh...This is seriously getting intense. I don't even like baseball...

* So he reads minds.... Umm... Fuck.

* Jotaro took off the hat! Shit is about to go down, folks!!

* He declared his pitch! Holy shit, Jotaro... your swag levels are overflowing

* Well, uh...there's a reason Jotaro is my favorite character so far. He's being the hero of the most intense of the stand battles we've seen.

I didn't put my thought in the last thread because comments were broken so this is also my reaction to part one of this.

D'Arby the Gamer had a great introduction. Everything from him floating down the corridor to the puppet cabinet was such a good intro. I like the contrast between him and his brother. His brother seemed like a jerk who cheated people from the beginning whereas Danny here was calm and polite. The punch gambit was interesting and [part 3](/s "actually becomes more interesting after you learn his power.") /u/discdeath has a great little bit on the differences between Danny and Terrence so I won't bother putting more or less what he said.

Speaking of powers [part 3](/s "D'Arby the Younger has one of my favourite "learning their stand" bits in part 3, better than Hanged Man but behind ZA WARUDO.")

Other things of note, D'Arby's puppets are *far* creepier than the poker chips, primarily because they aren't made by the stand. Daniel had the puppet since before Kakyoin bet his soul. Creepy.

This episode has my second favourite engrish in anime just after [Symphogear](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5TXTpik5wf4) ^^^just  ^^^as  ^^^reparted.

A three parter? I really was not expecting that from this fight. Dont get me wrong, Im really loving this fight, but its not the kind of scale that I would expect from a three parter.

Theres something which I dont get about the Super Darby Bross soul stealing abilities. It hasnt come up during this fight yet, but I was reminded of it. Its stated that losing a gamble for your soul weakens it enough to be stolen because of the despair or something. That makes perfect sense to me, as does the fact that accepting your inevitable loss is the same as actually losing. Its all about the person accepting that their soul is forfeit.  
What doesnt make sense to me is how JoJoJo could have bet Fancy Guys soul against Mr Darby (Im going to focus on Fancy Guy rather than Holly just because Mr Darby was the one who suggested betting Fancys soul). Dadvols soul made sense because he was there to agree to bet his soul. He was a part of the bet, and aware of it. Fancy Guy wasnt, he knew nothing of what was going on at the time. If JoJoJo had lost the game then both he and Dadvol would have accepted the loss, and so their souls would have been up for grabs. Fancy Guy wouldnt have known, so wouldnt have lost any soul energy or whatever, so how would his soul have been takeable? If thats the case, then surely he and Dio could have had a match in which Dio bet the Crusaders souls, and then deliberately lost.  
Im guessing that the actual answer is probably going to be Stop thinking so much about it, and I accept that, but Id still like to know if theres some other rule which Im missing.

I really like the comparison between the two Darbys. One is obsessed with gambling and trickery, delighting in exploiting the systems of the games to give himself an unfair advantage; the other is obsessed with skill, with ensuring his victory by becoming the very best at something and getting to demonstrate his overwhelming skill to his opponents. This comes through in the styles of their collections as well. Mr Darby was a gambler who wanted to win big, and win a lot. Consequently he had a massive collection of souls, but the individual souls werent really important. Jr Darby wants each win to be personal, and by virtue of being better than his opponent. Consequently he has a much smaller collection in which every soul is prized. He relishes in each victory because he trained to earn it, so each soul represents a story. He puts them into dolls which he made himself and shows them off, wanting others to see his skill at doll making. He works to be genuinely good at things and wants recognition for it.  
This is why I disliked the Bast episodes so much, I was disappointed in it. The creator is capable of writing incredible characterisation, and frequently does. They create characters whose personalities, abilities, and desires are fantastically well linked, and I love that.  
So when Bast came along I was disappointed. Id come to expect great characterisation from the creator, and in that episode there was none to be seen. Mariahs abilities and personality didnt just not link well, they were completely at odds. Thats why I disliked those episodes so much, because I knew the creator was capable of so much better.  
(Before I get shouted at I fully realise that this is just my opinion, and that different people want different things from the show.)

Anyway, I look forwards to tomorrow: to finding out what Jr Darbys other power truly is, to seeing how JoJoJo overcomes it, and to more of JoJo being an angry old cheerleader.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't D'Arby say that he can take souls at any time, it's just that it's easier for him when he beats them in a game? He probably just does it to enable his gambling habit.
>> ARTICLE
Since was D'Arby who made the proposal to bet Kakyoin soul, I think his stand can take bets comming from other people and still take full effect on the bet when the person loses. Same for the Holly bet as well. 

Remember that the loser of the bet also lose their soul, so Dio can't bet the Crusaders souls and lose on purpose. He would lose his soul too.

I think Jotaro could've bet Avdol soul without asking, but he asked Avdol permission first just to be polite. After all, Avdol is there to hear Jotaro betting his soul, no?
>> ARTICLE
D'Arby Gambler did say that they can only bet on things that they have, either by owning (PolPol's, Josephu's, and Jotaro's souls) or by being allowed to (Avdol, Kekyoin, Holly). Permission may or may not be exactly needed, since neither MILF nor Hunter were there to get asked.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you do "HAVE" friends, no?

I think having a friend and having a mother are also "things you own" under Osiris and possible Atum powers.
>> ARTICLE
Of course I do! B-baka...

Jokes aside, it could be that having a meaningful connection, either as equals (friends, family) or superiority (more in an ownership sense, like a slave or one of DIO's minions) are valid for those Stands. Because I don't think the Gambler could bet the Gamer's soul...
>> ARTICLE
Does DIO even still have a soul? Do vampires have souls in JoJo?
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure. The stone mask works using the "10% of the brain" myth, which means that it just gives the user access to the rest of it. So, Dio is still a human, just one who has unlocked all of his potential. He's basically what The Pillar Men were to their species (Admittedly, their skulls couldn't be fully penetrated until the stone was inserted).
>> ARTICLE
Also, while not nowhere as canon(but still follow the canon pretty faithfully, like, Vampires and Pillarman smoke when hit by Hamon and can't go into the sunlight), in the PS3/PS4 game "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: All-Star Battle", both Phantom Blood Dio and Stardust Crusaders DIO can [Major Part 4 Spoilers](/n "have their souls be send to Reimi's alley if they get a Dramatic Finish in Morioh, proving that Dio still have a soul.")
>> ARTICLE
Kakyoin got defeated with some track skipping. That's got to suck, doesn't it?  
In comes Jotaro and gambles his soul while he doesn't even know how to fucking play video games. I bet Joseph knows more about playing video games than Jotaro. But thanks to Star Platinum's super-precise input Jotaro can play (why don't they play something like Smash? Platinum would wreck D'Arby's shit with some sick teching).  
Jotaro's playing the hard gambling game with the poker face again. We'll see how it turns out

I don't recall if anyone mentioned it yesterday since the weird Reddit comment thing ate a few posts, but the original F-Zero didn't have the ability to spin like we see here with F-Mega. In reference to this arc, F-Zero X on the N64 added the spin attack. I don't recall if you can do the tunnel thing too in X, but either way it's pretty cool.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/pPaKWB2.png) is a more accurate translation, but I like the [Crunchyroll interpretation](https://imgur.com/glY0dgq) because it makes it sound like Joseph's got no faith in Jotaro's gaming abilities. Love how their team letters match their names, incidentally.

I really like the colour scheme for Telence after he tells the story of his brother creeping on his presumably-underaged girlfriend. Something about it just looks great.

And with the added dimension of the declared pitches, the entire metagame changes. It's a lot like a gambling manga arc in that sense, there's a psychological choice to be made where there wasn't one previously.

Does Atum really have a power beyond the ability to facilitate the soul-stealing, or is Telence just playing mind games? It's interesting to compare Osiris and Atum. Atum is similar, but it has a rank higher in destructive power, speed and durability. Additionally, all Osiris ever did was enforce the terms of each gamble D'Arby made involving souls. We never even saw it physically fight, while Atum's acted more like a traditional humanoid Stand but with soul removal as well so far. I wonder if Osiris had any additional powers that just didn't come up in the gambling arc. Or perhaps Daniel's skill and personality meant that he never really wanted his Stand to do anything more.
>> ARTICLE
> the original F-Zero didn't have the ability to spin like we see here with F-Mega. In reference to this arc, F-Zero X on the N64 added the spin attack.

That's pretty cool but you know, F-Mega doesn't have that ability either. It's just Kakyoin being that good.
>> ARTICLE
Meh not particularly feeling this fight, especially now that it's a 3 parter. I was hoping for some great Kakoyin moments at least but it instead Jotaro has the helm yet again. 

The stand fight itself is uninteresting as of right now and the first D'arby fight was a lot better. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the final section is the best part of the fight. Although, I think it's my least favorite in the stretch from D'Arby the Gambler to DIO.
>> ARTICLE
It was too long to finish in two episodes without making the transition to the next fight awkward. Even with the Ed and opening cut out. It's still a lot better than a lot of the early part 3 fights.

I should have just not commented and wrote "same", pretty much my exact thoughts!
>> ARTICLE
It's not a three parter. And this is still better than Alessi.

Three parter or however long they stretch it out, still one of the longer fights in Part 3.

I mean, it isn't that hard to be better than Alessi since Alessi was the worst couple of episodes of JoJo.

I remember this fight being kinda meh for me as well. However next episode starts a basically nonstop intense hype train that lasts until the end of the season.

I thought the conclusion to the fight was the best part of it.

It's not stretched out at all, the next two fights are even longer. It literally ends like 7 minutes into the next episode. Trust me I didn't like these episodes too lol.

Screenshot history? That's a thing? There is a stand stat pic though. You must've simply missed it. Around 14:15.

I must be remembering it wrong but I could've swore that before Kakyoin lost he also did a huge jump like Terence did.

"Or die of a heart attack from the bang of an inflated popcorn bag being popped,"

You'd have to be pretty fragile there Terence.

"Oh! Zat's a basebowl!" Wonderful, silly engrish.

"Jaggerz!"

"Red Dragonz!"

The words "Lucky Land" are just all over this anime.

"Whatever. I know the rules for baseball."

You smug little shit. I can't help but feel that Jotaro would be a guy who'd play at least a handful of video games. Guess they're not his thing.

I love how Joseph is literally swearing at his grandson as his tries to learn how to play a video game. Jotaro actually looks worried too.

Joseph: You're a total scrub. 1v1 me scrublord.

"Go ahead. I've pretty much learned how to bat now."

Terence goes ahead and presses the pitch button before going,

"Wait what?"

You know I never noticed it at the time this first aired but that's Terence's hair, not a hat.

I believe this is the first stand user to not be defeated within 2 episodes despite the fact that [Jojo Part 3 spoiler, not taking any chances](/s "next episode is not titled Part 3 for Terence and is instead titled for Ice.

Average year this sub started watching anime; **2009**. Let that sink in for a minute. If a show came out prior to Summer Wars, r/anime could very well be unaware it even exists.

I'm a huge lurker on here, but just had to comment because this just blows my mind as someone whose be watching anime since the mid to late 90's.
>> ARTICLE
I hear that. Started with Ranma 1/2 in about 1995 or so.
>> ARTICLE
I was really confused by your comment because I thought you were talking about your age. Now I'm really disappointed because I thought we'd have a over 90 year old fart here.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to disappoint, I've just been watching for a long time :P As I grew up, early on I was watching things like Miyazaki movies, Sailor Moon, etc. Then anime started becoming more popular in the late 90's with shows like Pokmon, which started airing in '98 to put it in perspective. By the early 2000's Adult Swim was airing shows like Evangelion, Inuyasha, Case Closed, Lupin the Third, as well as the internet beginning to not suck as much, so anime became more mainstream and had increased access. So to me 2009 seems like a decade or so too late for most people to have gotten into anime xD
>> ARTICLE
This shit is unsettling... 
>> ARTICLE
I like how you used *Summer Wars* as your reference point. I think I'll go rewatch that next week. It's basically the *Digimon Movie* with an alt skin.
>> ARTICLE
16 years old here and I don't even know what Summer Wars *is*.

I feel like I missed out by only beginning to watch anime recently. I'm very new, and it kind of sucks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching it, as it was a pretty significant movie in the evolution of how anime looks, imo. Very visually pleasing and stylized in a way that not many anime were before, but several were after. The plot was interesting, if unoriginal, as it basically was a remake of the *Digimon Movie* just without actual digimon. But I guess that's ok, as it was the same director.

The fact that this poll thinks 28 counts as middle aged got under my skin a bit (I'm 36...still not fucking middle aged, by most definitions.)

I have no plans of getting older but it just keeps happening. Wtf.

The average age appears to be 19-20, so that would put those users at 13-14.  

Seems right to me.

And makes me feel old.
>> ARTICLE
Im actually fucking surprised that Danmachi was more watched than Oregairu and UBW . 

The Oregairu and Fate/stay Night episode threads are always so active with many users (like 1000+ comments for UBW alone)  never expected Danmachi to be this popular . 


Also Prison School is so underrated not even in the top 10 for summer most popular and surprise hits .So far this is my AOTS of this summer.
>> ARTICLE
I found it easier to watch Danmachi week to week.
I felt like I was forgetting subtle things while waiting each week for the next episode of Oregairu. I'm picking it back up now that it's finished.
>> ARTICLE
really easy to watch danmachi because it's story is really not that special i go to /r/anime to see what i'm missing or discuss something great to that episode, but danmachi doesn't have much to discuss and danmachi has 10%+ dropped watchers so yeah that's why oregairu and ubw is much more pack in discussions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of lurkers that's why, plus it a show that isn't a sequel unlike Oregairu and UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
true was just surprised even though I know it was one of the most popular along with UBW and Oregairu . 
>> ARTICLE
I also find it surprising that almost all of the top 10 are 50% watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I ran out of space, so I'll continue here:

I'd like to thank mostly /u/higi1024 but also /u/Jiecut for helping me out and giving me feedback, and /u/KousakaReina for translating this to Japanese.

One thing I want to address in a future survey is the *length of the survey*. This survey was/felt too long, it got only ~2500 responses, whereas previous seasonal surveys got ~3000 responses. The length could also be a reason for the little amount of responses from /r/japan_anime, so cutting down the amount of questions is something I definitely need to do.

Another thing is that I didn't include shorts. I'm definitely going to add shorts in the next survey. I didn't include them at first since there are a lot of them, of which many are *really* obscure. I thought they'd clutter up the answers. What I didn't think of is giving them their own sections/questions, so that's what I'm going to do.

I also only included anime that *started* and/or *ended* in the spring/summer season, since I didn't want to have the same anime in more than two surveys. If I include shows that have more than two cours, that'd mean also including a couple of the long running shows (One Piece, Naruto, Doraemon, etc.). I excluded these for the same reason I excluded shorts. I can add those shows, as long as I can make the survey look shorter/less intimidating.

The final thing is that all shows only had their *romanized Japanese* names, and not also their *English* names. Frankly, this survey was really something I decided to do last-minute, since no one else did it. Since I had to do both Japanese and English surveys, adding a third name for every show would've been more work than I wanted it to be, and I wanted to focus on setting up the survey. Since everything is now set up and since I don't have university stuff to do this summer, adding the English names won't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Having the questions spread out over many pages makes the survey feel longer. I don't know if this is possible with Google Forms, but maybe you could have a table of all the season's anime that combines many questions into one, e.g. a dropdown next to each with the choices "Completed/Dropped/Still Watching" and checkboxes for whether it had the best first episode, best last episode, best music, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it certainly felt long because of the multiple pages. Previous surveys usually only had one page. You also tried to fit in summer stuff also in the survey. While you got more data it also increased the length.

I haven't seen this implemented but what about a grid? That would make it look a lot shorter. I'm not exactly sure if you'll be able to output the data the same way in quick summary. I don't have experience with it. But a grid would make it a lot shorter.

Also no need to sweat getting only 2500 responses. Advenna had a summer survey with 2k responses and Hemoglobin had a big demographic one with only 2k also. 2500 is a respectable number for a survey.

Yeah you got good experience running a survey for future stuff.

How's your progress with the results?

I have some projects that I've been thinking of doing. The meta survey analysis. I also want to do some big query analysis for subreddit cliques (what other subreddits reddit /r/anime users use) and vice versa. I think I can also use the bigquery data for comment face popularity, that'd be cool.
>> ARTICLE
lol I thought this was from Free Talk Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean a grid like this?

 |Watching|Finished|Dropped|Picked up
-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
F/SN: UBW|x|||x
Danmachi||x
Denpa Kyoushi|||x|

That actually looks better than four lists of checkboxes, heh. higi1024 also came with the idea to split up the post-season (spring) and pre-season (summer) surveys, making it look like two shorter surveys, both of which are optional.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, please make a grid!

I never understood (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) what "Picked up" means.

* If you are "Watching" a show, you picked it up.
* If you have "Finished" a show, you picked it up.
* If you "Dropped" a show, you picked it up at least for one episode.

So what's the point behind "Picked up"?
>> ARTICLE
My understanding of it is picking up a show after it's started airing, rather than from the first episode. It helps with certain metrics because then you're able to see how first impressions of viewers may have affected people's decisions to pick up a show they weren't considering before.

Hmmm... Let's see here... I'll go with "anime seldom mentioned except by myself", instead. Because if there's one thing I love to do, it's talk about the uncommon anime I love. I've even been accused of being an anime hipster for some reason...

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is the only one of my top-10 that doesn't get a lot of traffic on this subreddit. Some, yes. But that's mostly me and two or three other people that just can't stop talking about it. This is not an anime for everybody, but it should be.  
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) is a criminally underwatched title. Which is kinda understanding, given the relative age of this subreddit. But it's a great choice to put your feet up, crack a beverage open, and relax for a while.  
* [Kimikiss Pure Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2927/Kimikiss_Pure_Rouge) is getting a bit more attention these days, but not enough for my taste. A seinen romance drama, this one has a Best Girl that can beat the crap out of most of the wannabe Best Girls out there.
* I think I'm the only person that puts [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) forward. And I love my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show. I find it just as relaxing as Aiura.  
* [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise) is a movie from Toei that doesn't get a lot of traffic these days, yet I enjoyed it almost as much as Summer Wars.  
* Everyone will mention Sakura Trick when talking about the Year of the Yuri celebration, but few people will dare broach the topic of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san). I actually enjoyed this a lot more than Sakura Trick.
* [Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1562/Yamato_Nadeshiko_Shichihenge%E2%99%A5) is a shoujo faux-reverse harem by the same guy that brought us Excel Saga. That's right. Nabeshin did a shoujo. And it is awesomely weird.  
* [Kiniro no Corda: Primo Passo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1579/Kiniro_no_Corda:_Primo_Passo) is another shoujo reverse harem, and it is the capstone of my Music Appreciation Through Anime series.  
* [Blue Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop:_Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku) is one of more curious shoujo-ai titles around. It's like a lot more tame version of Utena crossed with Noir, and was rather unfairly panned on by most of the critics because of it.  
* [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi) is my favorite cheesy generic harem, and has one of the best confession scenes I've ever watched.
* Speaking of favorite cheesy generic harems, [Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) very efficiently lampshades all of the little sister routes by making the MC specifically try to avoid the secret sister in the harem.  
* And finally, because I've been typing for half an hour and want to go get something to eat, [Mouse](http://myanimelist.net/anime/624/Mouse) is one of my guilty pleasure anime. It's awful, but it's the greatest *because* it is so awful.

But weirdest anime? That's something a bit more nebulous. Weird as in my brain noping straight out of my skull and fleeing to Mexico in order to drown itself in tequila? Cosprayers. Weird as in not being able to easily comprehend what's happening? [Tenshi no Tamago.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago) Weird but still really liking it? Probably when I watched FLCL and Kyousogiga on the same day. Weird as in "Why the hell did they do this to a sequel"? Kite Liberator. 

I've seen a lot of weird anime, so I kinda need to keep it categorized.
>> ARTICLE
> I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

I guess, yeah. 

Categorizing them seems good. In-between seasons when I'm bored I watch some unpopular or terribly rated animes to rate it myself. Some were okay-ish, others are a taste thing I'd say, but most of the time I just facepalm and laugh. Last time it was Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. 

Anyway, I'll add them to my list, thanks for it.

Maybe even [Wonder Momo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22377/Wonder_Momo), if you want to see a bad anime that isn't very commonly watched.

Its not that i don't believe you, but have a source?

Just so i can use a link when someone says *"Hibike! Euphonium is just a moe show of cute girls doing cute things like K-on"*.
>> ARTICLE
If think it was on the second 'Hibike Euphonium' special episode of the [sokoani](http://sokoani.com/archives/9398.html) podcast that the hosts were the most praising.


There have been regular highlights in newtype/animage etc very positive about the anime, but as it's more commercial the tone is more flat and void. 

What has been intersting is that the soundtrack is currently #49 in the global amazon ranking, #5 in the soundtrack ranking, with the BD/DVD are also around #50 globally, #16 in the anime ranking.

Looking only at the numbers K-on was huge as well, but in the reviews you hear a lot of adults watching with their kids, musicians, and overall pretty mature people. Having these numbers on such a wide base is pretty unprecedented for Kyoani I think.

I didn't select it at the time, but I probably would now. The more Sore ga Seiyuu I watch, the more I like it.

Dunno about everyone else but I simply took a chance on Overlord knowing nothing about it except that it has what looked like a best girl on it's front cover.

Knights of Sidonia guys, get on it. It's a great show and the second season was just as good as the first or even better. A really well done sci-fi 3D anime that could not have been done in any other way in my opinion after seeing the production values.

Using the 3D to display the 3D space and mechs along with the sound effects have never made it more satisfying for its intense space battles.

Okay onto the results.

Age distribution chart looks really cool. While /r/anime looks really young the average age is actually 20 and median age is around 19.5. Yeah that's still young but the majority aren't in high school, not that there's anything wrong with HS.

Interesting to note that not everyone lives in North America.

Dungeon in the lead with 75% is quite significant. That's a big lead and really significant chunk of people. I think the hype worked. For comparison 65% to 70% watched SAO II.

Slightly sad that Arslan isn't that popular but 33% is decent. Another interesting thing to note is that most of the top 10 are above 50% watched.

But while a lot of people watched Dungeon, only 33% of them rated it in their top 5.

I was going to say something about the vocal crowd of prison school but it's not actually on the list. % on summer shows are a bit lower but we'll see if people picked up more shows for week 3. Still the Top 5 plan to watch are solid. (we'll see if people are going to be disappointed by God Eater)

Combining age and year started watching anime would be interesting.

For shows watched per season, this can be quite a difficult question. It's interesting how you can see people like to guestimate at round numbers.

50-200 full length shows is cool. 

For some of these questions median might be a more suitable stat.

I started Oregairu with season 1, read all the light novels and eagerly awaited it to be adapted into an anime. Oregairu S1 wasn't very popular so it was awesome watching it grow to what it is now when S2 came out and ended. I'm glad everyone could experience one of my favorite animes and FEEL did an excellent job adapting it.

Is like SAO, but with better animation and far less pretentiousness.

DanMachi is better than SAO because it's more like Accel World.
>> ARTICLE
But not as good as Accel World. Accel World had some unique and interesting elements to it, Danmachi is still just 100% cookie-cutter. It wasn't necessarily *bad*, I still watched it and enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly new and fresh in literally any way. You're still right, though, because SAO was nauseatingly generic.

>The top 3 most beautiful and/or most visually impressing show

How does UBW not get into the top 3 of this category, let alone win it? I was really disappointed with the story but that doesn't stop me acknowledging that it's visually stunning. 
>> ARTICLE
Only the fight scenes are well done, and generally they were a step down from season 1.
>> ARTICLE
I say the background art is fantastic (not a big fan of their  character designs). Im a big jojo fan and there is no way its more visually impressive than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you could mount an argument that JoJo's is far more visually interesting than UBW: the aggressively stylised designs, the unusual colour choices, the use of text, the 3DCG OPs, the inventive EDs. Ufotable's work on UBW, meanwhile, is often about sweeping artistic flair under the rug in the interests of consistency and a polished sheen.  The storyboarding in UBW is often kind of dull too -- unlike JoJo's, or indeed Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium. In that sense, UBW's sometimes closer to the more anodyne kind of US animation.

I don't know whether I'd say JoJo's was the third most visually impressive title of the season either, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going crazy I swear it was on the top 3 last time I looked at it but now it's JoJo .

Oh fucking damnit, I accidentally switched it with Kekkai Sensen >.>

Heh it's slightly amusing that my age, the amount I've watched and the year I started watching is far more accurately represented by the approximate results from the Japs.
>> ARTICLE
So this confirms that /r/anime and /r/japan_anime both have horrible taste in anime, as expected.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I'm kind of salty that a character with almost no development is probably going to win best character. 
>> ARTICLE
Who are we actually trashing on in this case, because all the characters get the character development that fits their shows.
>> ARTICLE
I believe he's talking about License less Rider.
>> ARTICLE
That's... actually quite fair. He's a static side character whose purpose (story wise) is to present to Saitama that fame and recognition aren't what matter. I can understand why people love him anyway though.

As a fun aside, I think the funniest part is that Licenseless Rider is openly liked and Emiya Shirou (from UBW at least) is openly disliked, even though they have the same character style, just about the same ideals and intensity, and both of their ideals and intents are praised in the works. The make or break difference (when it comes to actual writing and character differences and not double standards) is that Emiya is robotic with literally no sense of self worth and Mumen Rider has fear. From this, Mumen Rider ends up a bit more relateable and human. It's an interesting comparison.

EDIT: Ah I guess I'll just add (since it might not be clear from this) that I don't think Emiya Shirou is a static character, but UBW is about something that's straight up outside the realms of OPM because OPM is about Saitama. Despite that, Shirou still remains similar to Mumen Rider throughout the entirely of UBW. That's another fun thing but also completely outside the realm of "Best Character."
>> ARTICLE
> The make or break difference is that Emiya is robotic with literally no sense of self worth and Mumen Rider has fear. From this, Mumen Rider ends up a bit more relateable and human. It's an interesting comparison.

This is, IMO, a huge, huge difference.

It's easy to be a 'hero' when you have nothing on the line.  Sure, Shirou risks his life, but to him his life is without value.  /Shrug.  He's a psycho, simple story.  Sidenote:  I don't dislike Shirou; I just don't think he's a "hero" or a role-model or anything of that sort.  He's a good character, but that's like saying Makoto from School Days or Shinji from NGE are good characters.

Mumen Rider is a dude.  He values his own life just like any person, but he still goes that mile.  So, he's like 100x the hero as Shirou (until HF, depending on your definition of hero).
>> ARTICLE
You can tell just by looking at the list that one punch man is bound to win *at least* one category.
>> ARTICLE
One Punch Man not winning best fight would be bizarre in my opinion.

I love JoJo, but both Boros and Genos had better fights than Dio.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is probably going to win most categories just because of its popularity, sadly.
>> ARTICLE
But it wouldn't be that strange if it wins the best fight award. I mean, Jotaro vs Dio is awesome and I voted for it, but Saitama vs Genos is pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, OPM is a good show and I'm not saying that it's necessarily undeserving of some awards. But unfortunately, it's going to win most if not all categories it was nominated for, not because it is the best, but because it's the most popular. 

Like I said, OPM has some strong qualities. But is it really the best anime this year? Does it really have the best character, the best character design, the best fights, the best animation, the best OP, the best finale, etc? It's been nominated for all of those and more if I remember correctly, and it will probably win most of those categories. It's good, but is it really the best at EVERYTHING? I don't think so.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say the best at everything, but it is good at what it aims for.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but I'm not contesting that it's a good show. If it's not the best in all these categories, it shouldn't win all of them, but it very well could win all or most of them.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you meant. It's just that unlike other shows of this season OPM will get shit on whether it wins or doesn't win the categories. So, I want it to win the categories that fit the nature of the show. (So not best character, romance, designs, etc.)
>> ARTICLE
I think that it is a good show and maybe one of the best in the year, but I think the hype that it is being given to it is so much that fans had made it quite overrated.

I don't think it's a bad show, but it's not definitely the best of this year without any kind of doubt.
>> ARTICLE
If there is one thing Shigatsu has earned it is best finale. Everything about that final episode was a masterpiece to behold.

I think you spelled Kumiko incorrectly. Need to get that spellchecker fixed.

Kumiko is cute and all, but have you *seen* Shirobako?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

I still assert Kumiko's status.

EDIT: I'll explain if asked, but I'm busybusy.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both and Kumiko is more nuanced and a better character to me. After all, Hibike has a smaller cast and the main focus is the relationship between Kumiko and Reina. Meanwhile, Shirobako has focuses on way more characters at once. Not that that's a bad thing though, since it is the better show overall.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I ended up choosing Kumiko for the little subtle things KyoAni does to develop her as a character. But Miyamori is really close though.

This list bothers me a lot because imo Hachiman and Gintoki are much better characters than Saitama. Gintoki because of the arc that just ended which was a lot of development and Hachiman was a well developed character. Saitama was cool, but imo he is not a better character than either of them. (I haven't finished Shirobako so I can't comment on Aoi).
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Hachiman's probably the character with the most fleshing out and character development combined in the running, with the exception of possibly Gintoki since I haven't seen much of Gintama. Really hope he wins.

[Not top 5?  Horse shit list.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhy_xw6l-ig)

And of course OPM hype carries through again despite just being a bunch of DBZ flashy lightshows.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, forget the parallels between the Boros fight and the dream fight. Forget the fact that Saitama was holding back the entire time so Boros could have his life stimulus. Forget the beautifully animated Meteoric Burst scene and the Moon scene. After all, anything that involves beams of light is a DBZ light-show  
>> ARTICLE
A lightshow is a light show, that's what it is, and that's what the Boros fight in OPM was.  It was Saitama standing there like he always does, with Boro sending flashing lights at him, and then a final blow--or in Boros case a small series of blows--and Boros loses.  There was zero choreography, zero surprise or suspense, just a lot of flashes.  It wasn't that impressive as far as fight scenes go.  UBW is known for being a pretty lightshow itself, but nearly all of the UBW fights had more complexity to them than OPMs, which isn't a very high bar necessarily.

Yeah, I don't expect the Rakudai fight to necessarily to win, but it deserves a top 5 spot a hellavu lot more than OPM does for employing even a minimal amount of choreography and strategy.  OPM is riding on its hype train and flashy lights and smooth animation though, so there's no competing.

I'm not impressed by people punching chunks out of planets anymore or landing on the moon after TTGL did it with fucking *Galaxies*.  I'm impressed by complexity and strategy and *unique* effects, which is where a lot of these other fights, especially Rakudai, shined.
>> ARTICLE
No fucking way Archer vs Lancer has only 32 votes :O
>> ARTICLE
Double checked, Archer v Lancer indeed does have 32 votes.

Similarly to the last thread with the EDs, I think there was too many Fate/stay fights and not enough fans to go around. Although this time one fight from the series still made it. 

The part from the last thread I'm referring to is the fact that there was 21 Ninja Slayer EDs and each of them had under 10 votes. 
>> ARTICLE

I didn't think the finale was that memorable. Episode 23 on the other hand was one of the best of 2015.
>> ARTICLE
the last 3 or 4 eps were all amazing. it ended perfectly
>> ARTICLE
What. The finale was another one of those brilliant blends of stupid comedic relief (much like episode 23) to close-up with a heavily emotional moment. Miyamori's speech really was a giant love letter to the entire industry, and it felt just as sweet as the episode before, just a little bit less catharthic!
>> ARTICLE
Personally, episode 23 was way more memorable to me. I barely remember episode 24 to be perfectly honest. But I do remember that it was a good ending, just not as good as 23 imo.
>> ARTICLE
It's a lot less *emotional*, that might make it a bit less memorable on a first impression? Still was a perfect way of ending the series, and was really well executed, riddled with good refferences to the show's past episodes, and really, contained what the ultimate message of the show actually was expressed into words. It's a very non-subtle ending, but still, executed greatly! :D
>> ARTICLE
Episode 23 was without a doubt, far more impactful than eps 24.  24 was a nice, clean ending that was satisfying, but episode 23, you know the scene, was just so fucking cathartic.  It felt so good.
>> ARTICLE
**Best Character** - Absolutely love Miyamori but I'm going with Kaori here. Both girls are probably in my top 10 characters all time though.

**Best Fight Scene** - Shirou v. Gilgamesh. The Boros fight was hype as fuck but I was much more emotionally invested in the Gilgamesh fight. 

**Best Finale** - Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and it isn't even close. 

On a related note, how did the Euphonium finale not even get nominated? I just finished the series a couple days ago and the finale was absolutely fantastic. As a former band geek, I felt that the episode was completely true to real life and just beautifully executed. Easily my second favorite finale after Shigatsu. 
>> ARTICLE
If there's one category that One Punch deserves to win, it's Best Fight. The rest should go to more deserving shows. It's time for the hype to just die and rest in its well-earned grave.
>> ARTICLE
If there's one category that One Punch does *not* deserve to win, it's Best Fight.  The Boros fight especially was just a lightshow and spectacle with little actual substance.  There was zero choreography, just the tired old joke of Boros unloading a bunch of pretty explosions in OPM's direction, and then eventually Saitama punching him a few times and ending it.  It was all flashing lights and smooth animation, which is cool, but not what matters when we're talking about best *fight*.

I could see valid arguments for OPM in nearly every other category, but best fight?  Nah man, nah.
>> ARTICLE
OPM would get the best action animation for sure. But the best fight as a whole should definetively go to JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
I don't even understand how Saitama and Mumen Rider could be considered for best character but I guess hype does it's work. Personally I voted for Kumiko but I wouldn't mind 8man or Miyamori winning either. As for best fight and best finale I didn't vote as I haven't seen all the shows yet (although again I don't see how OPM's last episode can be considered a good finale).
>> ARTICLE
I don't see how Mumen Rider is even there. Who the fuck voted for him over Genos?
>> ARTICLE
*Keep in mind I did not watch many shows this year, this is biased towards a few.*

#Best Character

Not voting on this one. But last week I started SNAFU and I really see the love for Hachiman. But other than that, I haven't watched Shirobako, UBW, Your Lie in April, Hibike Euphonium, or Noragami yet... and I'm not caught up on Gintama to vote. So it would be between Hachiman, Mumen Rider and Saitama. Hachiman would get my vote out of the three, but I don't want to vote with that many unwatched shows in one category.

#Best Fight Scene

This one is tough. While David Production did a great job on the Jojo v Dio fight, it's really *really* hard to vote against One Punch Man's amazing fights. I can't decide! I'll update this later if I make a decision.

#Best Finale

Ah, another Jojo vs OPM showdown. I never saw the other three. I'm gonna have to go with JJBA here though. It's my favorite series, and the ending was perfect. It's really hard to vote against that as well, and OPM's ending wasn't anything incredible in my opinion. JJBA all the way.







>> ARTICLE
Choosing between Gintoki and Hachiman was probably one of the hardest decisions I will ever make. I had to go with Gintoki though his story was much more developed since it was being built up for like 300 episodes.

The Shigatsu finale is there for a good reason. If you enjoy drama and/or great music I strongly suggest watching it.

I'm 110% going to be salty over these results. Probably with the 'Best Finale' or 'Best Character' ones the most. 
>> ARTICLE
My votes:

Best Characters: Hikigaya deserved to win that one, but probably Saitama will be the one earning it. I understand the love for this character, but for me it's an standard one. 

Best Fight: Voted for the JoJo's one, but I'm pretty sure OPM deserves to win it.

Best Finale: Shigatsu it's the best out of this bunch.
>> ARTICLE
My votes:

Best Character: Kao-chan, my second vote would be for 8man.

Best Fight Scene: I only watched OPM of the 3, so going for the battle vs Boros.

Best Finale: Going for the Shigatsu one, but Death Parade finale was awesome too.
>> ARTICLE
Can you explain why you think Kaori is the best character? I didn't think she got much character development and I didn't find her particularly interesting. The point of her character was to be someone who could push the main character forward.

I've heard of all of them, but OPM and YLiA are the only ones I knew were 2015. YLiA was the only one I watched. In fact, I think the next newest series I watched was the newest Mushishi season, and that was only because I wanted to continue it. I'm not one to keep up with current stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I can tell there's going to be a lot of salt at the end of this. In my personal opinion OPM should at least win Best Fight (If it doesn't I will be extremely salty), and the other categories should go to more developed and longer shows.

I really can't see how Gintoki won't win Best Character by a landslide. If people really vote for a character with NO DEVELOPMENT over one of the funniest and best developed characters over the course of 300 episodes of a very popular anime, y'all are stupid. I can certainly see 8man winning though, that I will accept.

Don't vote for Genos because of recency-bias, I enjoyed him but he's generic and underdeveloped (that's kinda his point, but that doesn't make him a good husbando), overcome that and vote for the best husbando anyone could ever ask for!

If Shirobako wins AOTY then I'll be happy. Don't care about the other categories.

OPM will probably win.  It shouldn't, Shirobako should easily have it, or at least Death Parade, but it will.  The OPM hype train is too strong right now.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anything deserves to win as much as Shirobako does. It wasn't my favorite 2015 show (Shokugeki was), but when I think of "Anime of the Year," nothing else feels quite right in that spot besides Shirobako.

>> ARTICLE
I'm cool with Shirobako winning too! I just don't want OPM to sweep the categories. 
>> ARTICLE
OPM winning best fight scene and best animation is expected and probably deserved, but I don't think it comes close to anime of the year (and especially not for Saitama and character of the year).

Yeah agreed. Saitama shouldn't win character of the year and OPM shouldn't win OP of the year.

*Didn't watch everything this year, am pleb, have shitty taste*

#Best Husbando

Definitely Hachiman. Second would be Joseph if he was the young Joseph and not the old one.

Megumi Tadokoro. Loved Shokugeki, and she's best girl in best show.

#Anime of the Year

Shokugeki no Souma, no contest.

Living on a prayer but I had to vote for my dark horse, Death Parade for anime of the year. I'd also be happy if Shirobako won. I just don't want OPM to sweep every award...
>> ARTICLE
So where is Onodera? I abstain!

Edit: she didn't get enough votes! D':
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Nisekoi isn't as big here as it is in most places. So when there's 2 or more characters nominated for an award, a small fanbase grows even smaller. That's the way I look at it anyways.

I just want OPM to not win every award. I will literally be content with just that
>> ARTICLE
It's probably going to.  Let's be honest.  It's probably going to beat Shirobako for AOTY even, which is a fuckin' travesty.

If OPM wins best OP over Death Parade I'm going to be *very* triggered.

Oh Cmon, OPM opening was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Here's my reasoning on this: Death Parade is know *for* it's OP whereas One Punch Man's OP is known for being a part of OPM. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I liked Death Parade's opening more than OPM's but being triggered by it losing is a tad too much. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more being triggered over OPM potentially sweeping every category, even when other shows are more deserving. 
>> ARTICLE
>even when other shows are more deserving.

What are you talking about? OPM is *the* absolute best and most deserving show to win every single award. ^^^/s

[](#crazedlaugh)

TIL: OPM was the only anime to come out in 2015.

[](#stonedzack)

Why are we even having this contest when OPM was the only anime to come out in 2015?

[](#niatilt)
>> ARTICLE
Those are the real questions we should be asking.

[](#thoughtful)
>> ARTICLE
thats because death parade's dosent fit the show, when picking "the best op" you should consider how well it goes with the show, not only that you like the music
>> ARTICLE
But they did that intentionally to contrast with the tone of the show just like Madoka Magica's OP.
>> ARTICLE
fair enough point [madoka spoilers](/s "tbh the madoka song just makes me deppressed, especially with the meaning behind, being from homuras perspective")

but in madoka's case it was more a trick, like in gakkou gurashi, but in death parade people knew what to expect already because of death billiards
>> ARTICLE
No way dude, people wigged out from the start when they saw that JAM Project was on the PVs
>> ARTICLE
That's true but it's not like people heard of the OPM OP before they actually heard of OPM. I'd say more than half the viewers of Death Parade came from hearing/seeing the OP whereas OPM's OP just complimented its show well. 
>> ARTICLE
I object 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, let me rephrase OPM's opening was very popular and well-reiceived to get multiple covers
>> ARTICLE
I feel like OPM's OP was just popular because it was OPM's OP, not because it was good on it's own. That's not to say it's not good on it's own, but I personally don't like it.
>> ARTICLE
**Best Husbando:** Tough one. With ~~my~~ everyone's man-crush Totsuka Saika out of the running it was down to second. And that second pick is none other than Saika's #1 fan--**Hachiman.** 

**Best Waifu**: God, does it even need to be said at this point? The Shirobako train is moving at full speed. **Aoi Meow-mori.**

She's best girl for sure, but not really waifu material. Better than Ougi though for sure. Whoever nominated that monster has issues.
>> ARTICLE
what is 'waifu material'? honest question.
>> ARTICLE
I... don't really know? There aren't really strict definitions for these things. It's different from just being best girl though. Like I'm sure 90% of the people on here (including myself) just use the term ironically, but the idea behind it is a character who you think would make the best romantic partner I guess. But it has connotations of infantilizing the girl too. Like Senjougahara is the kind of girl I'm most attracted to in real life, but she doesn't fit the type of personality mold that "waifu" implies.
>> ARTICLE
I just named the award 'Best Waifu' because my buddy from work /u/lordslugbuffalo complained last year when there wasn't an award called best waifu. He said that best girl didn't count :p

even if she barely appreared in owari I think that still deserves a vote for her since all her appereances had a great significance and she owned every second of it.

Nope, she wasn't nominated.

How are the two wild cards picked?

I assume the 8 normals are selected by top eight rankings?
>> ARTICLE
The wild cards were picked in each thread. If you saw the original Best Husbando thread (or any thread, for that matter), there was a comment thread below asking if there was anyone that was missing that could be husbando of the year. The top answers (determined by upvotes) won the wild card. Repeat for each thread :p

Yes, that's correct. Although the numbers vary from award to award.
>> ARTICLE
I know the majority of this sub loves 8man (I do too), but what is it about him that makes him desirable enough to even be a contender for 'best husband'? Ignoring the fact that his dream job is housemaker, I don't see anything appealing about him that would make him a good husband at all. He doesn't have good looks, personality or skills that are associated with HUSBUNDO material, while every other male character on the list has at least one of those things going for them. 
>> ARTICLE

how come Genos is a better husband than Klaus von fucking Reinherz? the man is cute, brain and brawn! he's got everything, AND HE FUCKING HAS FLESH GOD DAMNIT

There were lots of great OPs this year, but I think the one that stuck with me the most was Kachizuke diamond from Yamada and the 7 witches. I really liked the visual style of the OP too.

As for EDs, Climber from Haikyuu was by far my favourite and I loved listening to it at the end of each episode. It really 'worked' as an ending too, the music and visuals combined have a 'so the journey continues' feel to them.

Yamada's OP was a very close second for me. Kekkai Sensen just won me over.

Hero #1? ok.
>> ARTICLE
It's called One Punch Man circle jerk. I was fine with the song the first time I heard it and I'm now at the point where I think the song sucks. I'm personally upset with Identity being so low cause I think that may have been my OP of the year, not counting the Parasyte one which was not eligible for this.
>> ARTICLE
Even as good as Identity was, it was kind of a niche song for a niche show.  And I realize battle-academy shows themselves are clearly mainstream as fuck, but positive critical reception of them or any parts of them is not.  It would have been nice to rank higher, but it isn't surprising that it didn't really.
>> ARTICLE
Flyers was definitely #1 for a little while. They were neck and neck all the way to the end though.

I don't want to come across negatively to the people who voted for Hero, but I find it quite absurd to see it get so many votes. It's just my opinion, but I never would have imagined it beating Flyers or Kyoran Hey Kids!!

Watchdog man's design is genius. Even if a lot of characters in the series lack depth, literally none of their character designs are dull or boring.

I've watched a lot of the shows in the running for best character design and I'm not one of those rabid OPM fanboys. I honestly think OPM deserves to win best character design. 
>> ARTICLE
Half of Saitama's design intention *is* to be bland and mundane.... which, yeah, compliments the show, but really isn't something to win "best character design" awards.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that depends on what criteria you use for judging a character design. Personally, I think a character design that isn't flashy can still be considered to be good if it serves a greater purpose. 

For example, I love the use of wide eyes and distinct irises in the characters of Haikyuu. Haikyuu's eye design does a great job of showing where and what the characters are looking at. This is great because the show often emphasizes reading body language and aiming in the volleyball matches.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose, but I feel like all other things considered equal, minimalism is almost the laziest way to try and be "artsy".  So it bugs me to see OPM beating something like Shirobako where a *ton* of time was put into complicated designs that were consistently changing and interesting to look at.  You can tell a lot of thought and effort when into Shirobako's designs, whereas OPM it seemed like someone just chuckled and said, "why not red rubber boots and a yellow suit!?"  I mean, shit, is that literally not what happened?  Wasn't the original web comic of OPM just ghetto sketches?  OPMs minimalism wasn't the product of some higher art grand design, it was a lack of resources, and that deserves accolades now?

Yeah, it suits the tone of the show well, but... just... really?  It's like the new age abstract art movement where you can throw shit at a canvas and call it beautiful.  Such as Canada's National Art Gallery spending two *million* dollars on [this fucking thing](https://intrigueimports.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/vof2.jpg)... are you kidding me?  My taxes went to three stripes? Mother fucker.  This isn't something that should be winning awards over beautiful paintings people actually spent more than 5 minutes of effort on.

It isn't like there's zero thought put into Saitama's character design. His design is supposed to be the opposite of your standard dashing superhero and it works for that purpose. Besides, Saitama isn't the only character in One punch man. It's pretty clear that a lot of thought went into Genos's design. His customizable arms, the variety of weapons he carries, even the different ways he could use his flame propulsion are part of the character design process.

Even if we're going to compare OPM to Shirobako, I'd still give OPM the edge. Unlike Shirobako which features your standard PA works character look, OPM showcases a wide variety of characters that look vastly different from each other.

>> ARTICLE
WTF??? Hibike, Shirobako, and Shokugeki are all easily better than OPM when it comes to character design. People need to take a hands off their dick, take a step out of the circle, stop jerking it to OPM, and actually pick as  show based off of a more critical and less subjective/emotional decision. 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, OPM is a lot of things, but impressive character designs it is not.  It made a point of how bland and unchanging and simple characters could be.

Shirobako should easily have won this one.  Fuck, all the characters had a new set of clothing every other episode, *that* is impressive character design.

OPM over-hype strikes again.
>> ARTICLE
The sets of clothing also did a good job of telling stories about how they were feeling (Miyamori has her set of favorite clothes that she puts on when in a good mood or worried about an important event, sometimes characters are using the same clothes two days in a row for when they pull all-nighters on the studio, etc).
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, I didn't even notice that.  Really cool detail!
>> ARTICLE
The entire show is all about details! Best rewatch show ever :D.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pining for a proper dub of it, it's so hard to keep up with all the details while trying to read subs, especially when they sub all the Japanese text and background convos.
>> ARTICLE
well it's a close vote. They could possibly win but it also depends how the vote is split. I could vote for Hibike but I decided to vote for Shirobako.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I had a tough time choosing. But you are right, it may just be that the votes are being split between Hibike and Shirobako, which is what's keeping either one from pulling ahead of OPM. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't fucking believe Rokka no Yuusha didn't make it. Like, how???????????
>> ARTICLE
Well, it almost got in. 7th when the top 5 get in. Ehh
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as bad as I thought that show was, it had some pretty kick-ass character designs.  Certainly more so than Fate.
>> ARTICLE
I mean...I love OPM...and I even expected it to win half the categories... But I'm still disappointed. So many good shows/songs/characters have OPM beat, but they will be defeated by pure hype and recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I feel the same way. Everyone loves OPM so much that they're not even considering anything else. I think the character design in OPM is fine, but I don't think it should win the best of the year...
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, a real shame.

**Character Design: Kekkai Sensen**. Runner ups for me is Shirobako. While Shirobako gets an edge by having good character design with unique fashion outfits for each character (at least the main ones), the wide range of diversity of alien and otherworldly life form character design sends Kekkai Sensen over the edge for me. Designing non-humans well is hard. 

**OP - Too hard to choose** - For real. I have five of these on my playlist at work to get me through a tough day. (Flyers, Hello World, Hero, Kyoran Hey Kids and Raise Your Glag).  Plus shotuouts to  Dream Solister for actually sounding like it would be something a marching band could play. If anything I think I'll vote Flyers - It really was the standout of its partciular season and the subtle symbology shown in the animation (see Mothers Basement What's In an OP Series) really adds a lot to it. 

**ED - Sugar Song and Bitter Step** - On the other hand, this is a head and shoulders victory for Kekkai Sensen here. Maybe I'm biased,but I really do love funk and that catchy tune and the silly dancing animation just gets me everytime. No other anime got me to sit through the ED every single time it came on. 
>> ARTICLE
**Fuck.**

I *just* noticed that Sono Chi no Kioku is sung by all the previous singers of JoJo's openings together.

I guess this solidifies my vote then.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didn't know that. That's fucking awesome! Definitely voting that. 
>> ARTICLE
*Keep in mind these opinions aren't 100% accurate due to me not watching a lot of shows this year*

#Best Character Design

I find it hard to judge something like this. Just looking at the characters in some of the shows though, I think I have to go with Shokugeki no Souma based on the grounds that I like things to be colorful. If you just look even at the hair colors here, you'll see what I mean. I never watched Kekkai Sensen or Noragami S2 but they'd probably be my runner up. Idk how to really critique it, so I might not even vote here <_<

#Best OP

It's really tough here too, but not because I don't know how to judge it. I don't know how to pick #1! I wasn't the biggest fan of Death Parade, but Flyers is amazing. Jojo's OP is awesome, Raise Your Flag (from Iron Blooded Orphans) is really cool, and has a great song too. I guess I'm gonna go with Jojo, lots of foreshadowing and hinting at what's to come, not even mentioning the second version [Jojo Part 3 ending spoilers](/s "with The World stopping time and whatnot. Really cool how they did that.") 

#Best ED

This one is a little easier than Best OP to decide for me. I fucking loved Shokugeki no Souma, and just watching the first ED gives me chills! So, Spice all the way! No competition here imo. (Okay, maybe not *no* competition, I liked The Last Theater and Sugar Song... but Spice is superior.)






>> ARTICLE
**Best Character Design:** This was a really tough choice for me. It came down to Shirobako, Shokugeki no Soma, and Hibike! Euphonium. All of which had beautiful character designs to go with a large cast of characters. I ended up choosing Hibike because KyoAni went so far as to add detail to *every* character in the band so that they were all discernible. 


**Best OP:** When it comes to openings, I find the best to be the ones that are able to pump me up for the show and also make me watch it every single episode. FS/N UBW's won this for me with Noragami Aragato's coming a close second. I cannot remember once skipping FS/N UBW's opening, and the song for the opening is so good that I could listen to it on repeat.


**Best ED:** Goes to Shokugeki no Soma. While it may not have been the most exciting ED ever, I looked forward to it at the end of each episode. Every time I watched it I was given a blissful, happy-go-lucky feeling that no other ED this season could create. IMO, it complemented the tone of the show very well.
>> ARTICLE
Quite a few of these tracks grew on me, and ended up on a playlist I have. It's tough to pick, especially since recency bias plays a big factor (Just got done with Noragami Aragoto & Yamada-Kun).  

As far as character designs, do you vote based upon stock looks, animation, costume/clothing designs, expressions, or what? I'm truly curious what that encompasses, as it stumps me.
>> ARTICLE
> As far as character designs, do you vote based upon stock looks, animation, costume/clothing designs, expressions, or what?

All of those except animation I guess. [This](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-12-13/my-hero-academia-anime-ochako-tenya-character-designs-revealed/.96432) might give some idea about what goes into character designs.
>> ARTICLE
>character designs

I honestly have no idea. Lol

I'm just going with the ones I think look the best/most colorful if I decide to vote on that at all. I'm pretty sure it's mostly personal preference. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta hand the character designs to Shirobako, and probably Shokugeki.

Shirobako still tops it for me though. Those character designs + outfits. 10/10. Miyamori Aoi is love.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta give the character design vote to Shokugeki because BASED TOSH.

As for the ED award, "Climbers" without a doubt. Before you vote, go watch it because it's freaking brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
**Character Design:** The **Shirobako** voting block perpetuates. It's actually a tough one. Character designs across most of these series is absolutely phenomenal, in particular for OPM and Kekkai Sensen. But Shirobako took an enormous cast of *mundane* people and made it work *so well*. Not superheroes or aliens, but fucking office employees. Not only that, they were all well-rounded, distinct individuals whose names I could remember (or at least their titles) before it got annoying. 

**Best OP:** Where. the. fuck. is Harumodoki from Oregairu S2? That out of the way, this is a tough one. But my vote has to go to **Flyers** from **Death Parade.** A close second to Hibike! and Kekkai Sensen.

**Best ED:** No contest. **Kekkai Sensen, Sugar Song to Bitter Step.** This is easily one of my favorite EDs of all time. No, fuck it. This *is* my favorite ED of all time. Close second to *Aria the Natural's* "Natsumachi."
>> ARTICLE
I think best OP will be the hardest category to pick out of all of them. 3 of them (Flyers, Kuchizuke Diamond and Hey Kids) help make up my top 5 ever.
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, what are your other 2 in the top 5? No offense, but that seems like a weak 3 to have in there.

I'd have to think quite a bit for my top 5 lol.
>> ARTICLE
Arpeggio of Blue Steel's "Savior of Song" and "Tank" from Cowboy Bebop.  Yamada-kuns and Soul Eater's "Resonance" OP would jockey for the 5th slot though 
>> ARTICLE
Kekkai Sensen across the board.
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako and JoJo are the best in their respective categories (Character Design, OP) by a landslide. For ED, I've gotta vote for the ED I nominated, Climber, even if it is going to get trashed by Kekkai Sensen's ED. I wouldn't feel too bad if Sugar Song won, because that ED is pretty incredible.

I think it has the best combo of the year, but neither of them are the best. Flyers is definitely closer to being the best OP than Last Theater is to being the best ED, but as a combo they're fantastic. I think I already mentioned this to you, but I think the best combo ever is Barakamon.

Yeah that's a fantastic combo. And I agree that Flyers is closer to being Best OP since I think it's hands down the best OP of the year. :)

Girl with growth vs girl with no growth?

Yona>Shirayuki

[](#etotamadunno)
>> ARTICLE
I voted him since he entertained me the most out all the choices here.

That said, if we removed all sequels and restricts it for new anime only, I would hugely chip in for Miyamori Aoi simply from seeing the great growth of her character. She handled so much bullshit plus had her own share of downtime as an adult in the working world. Seeing her able to grow from all that is quite something. Oregairu 2 almost clinched it as well but not yet there (especially with that kind of ending).
>> ARTICLE
I voted for [best girl](https://45.media.tumblr.com/da3d8a571d5ac75291271e384e008caa/tumblr_njb4tzXmE61qjsn9po1_500.gif) of course.

My votes probably out of pure bias out of how much I love the series, but out of the series I've watched from the list (which isn't much) Hikigaya's character was definitely the best, and was really moving for me to watch in the second season.

Of the group, Caster has the most proven and demonstrated waifu points.  Several others may lean in that direction ... actually Yumiko is pretty much there too, but that includes VN material, not the anime.  Humm, hard to tell whether I should include that content.

The hype around OPM will probably top all, but Shirobako was so, so good.
>> ARTICLE
why was it so good ? i think its overrated its just watching girls working xd
>> ARTICLE
It's one of very few shows that managed to deftly handle an ensemble cast and flesh out most if not all of the characters.  It had above-average art with genuinely unique character designs for said giant ensemble, even going so far as to provide new outfits to characters on a regular basis.  It had very relatable experiences to anyone that is working on their career and that likely resonated with a lot of people.  It showcased the creation of anime in a fun, albeit heavily exaggerated, way which is at least mildly interesting to most anime fans.

I mean, I could keep going, but the skinny is that Shirobako had a loooot of attention to detail in it.  It was a project born of love, and it showed. It was cathartic for a lot of working people and it was just damn enjoyable with very few flaws to speak of.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, every likes different things.  
  
It was a well animated, well written anime with a fantastic cast of well designed characters, that gave us a real, albeit slightly exaggerated look at some points into the medium we love with lots of emotion. We laughed, we cried, we hated characters, we felt the frustration and the happiness. It was nearly perfect.

If Shirobako doesn't win this i'm going to be slightly sad though its is kinda understandable since it's not too well known. But from what I've seen, many redditors here likes it so i have hope.

If Shirobako doesn't win then I officially lose all faith in this sub.

Definitely Shokugeki no Souma for me. I enjoyed UBW, OPM, and Shigatsu a lot, but I loved every minute of Shokugeki.

I didn't watch many shows this year but i still had 2 10/10s in Yuri Kuma Arashi and Shokugeki no Souma. It's really tough to say which is best

Anything important missing? Best Anime of 2015 not in the main thread? Don't worry, just submit a reply to this comment with your anime title and it will be nominated for the wild card!

[Assassination Classroom](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_(TV), which is easily one of Lerche's strongest works this year with both in terms of popularity and reception.
>> ARTICLE
[Plastic Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27775/Plastic_Memories) was mine as it had everything I want. SoL, drama, romance. Many says that it "lacks an identity" but for me it's put together wonderful. It doesn't need to go full throttle on the drama, show me the fun parts here and there so I can try and laugh a little before my tearducts finds another host that won't abuse them.
>> ARTICLE
But it was awful. It failed at everything. 
>> ARTICLE
[Well...](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/files/2015/08/Thats_just_your_opinion.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Not an opinion that it failed in its writing. But of course you rely on the typical excuse people use to defend shitty shows.
>> ARTICLE
If the purpose of its writing is to touch someone emotionally and it actually does touch someone emotionally, it's kind of silly to say that it failed for that person.

The whole point of polls like this is that there is no objective answer. What works for one will crash and burn for another. The closest we can get is finding out which shows appealed to the most people.
>> ARTICLE
> which shows appealed to the most people

Popularity =\= quality. I am talking about the actual writing of the series, which has objective standards. If PM touched you emotionally, the problem is with you and your lack of critical thinking. 
>> ARTICLE
Would you mind laying out the objective, quantitative way to assess the qualitative relative merits of a piece of visual media, in such a way that anyone reading your analysis would be unable to dispute it? I have a Master's in the field, so feel free to get technical.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not doing that. Did you really expect me to write out an essay on reddit just for you? No. I will however leave it at this. For example, plot holes and manipulative writing are objective detriments. I am not talking about the overall opinion or quality being objective. I am talking the script. Don't bullshit me with "well it's all subjective so therefore don't criticize shitty shows!" And a Master's in what, exactly? You not specifying leads me to believe you don't have one.
>> ARTICLE
> manipulative writing

isn't this a dumb criticism for a show trying to be dramatic? I mean come on, if it makes you feel, isn't drama working?
>> ARTICLE
> manipulative writing

That's far from an "objective" detriment. Every author worth their salt uses principles of emotional manipulation. From Haruki Murakami to Stephen King, from J.K. Rowling to Shakespeare, it's a standard part of the toolset. Sorrow, rage, terror, justice, comfort, intellectual satisfaction: they are all part and parcel of the art of writing, and the ability to invoke those in the audience is what writers of every flavor work hard to achieve.

You can find it in the entire range of anime. From Legend of the Galactic Heroes to Naruto, from Hunter x Hunter to Clannad, from Monster to Nisekoi, from Another to Aria, the pattern is in clear evidence all over the place. So unless you're saying that *all* anime (much less all fiction regardless of medium) has these "objective detriments", then half of your argument fails at its face.

The plot holes, on the other hand, I'll still accept as a given.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm sorry for being a pleb then, would you explain why it failed its writing?

[Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28621/Subete_ga_F_ni_Naru__The_Perfect_Insider) was my clear AOTY 2015.

I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I'm 100% serious about it.

It wasn't my AOTY, as that went straight to Shirobako and never moved an inch, but Subete ga F was the clear winner for Fall AOTS.

Shirobako wins this pretty easily for me.

Yona of the Dawn did it for me. I know it doesn't have a chance but I'll throw my vote in for it :P
>> ARTICLE
So many good shows, but Shokugeki no Souma comes out slightly on top for me. 
>> ARTICLE
So many high scoring shows on my list. Death Parade, Shigatsu, OPM, Noragami, etc. all were fantastic. Hard to pick one, but if I REALLY had to, it would be Death Parade probably. It made highest up on my all time favorites list out of all the other shows I watched in 2015, it was THAT good in my opinion. Yeah it had its flaws, as did most of the shows on here, but it just did it really well. I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
Death Parade is it for me too. It's solidified in my top 10 and I can't see that changing.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually sitting at #11 for me, since I've watched enough anime to require a top 25 XD but I just really like plots that explore the human psyche (Mushishi, Monster, etc.), and this did it really well.
>> ARTICLE
Haha that's fair, I'm trying to make a tier list for all of my favorite shows. I love psychological shows too! I'm a huge fan of them!

Also your top 25 list is really good! I approve of your taste immensely!

I hope people vote quality over hype for once.

You know that's not going to happen. There's people here voting for Shokugeki.

There's no way OPM does not win. Maybe, possibly, SnS will win cause everyone will assume everyone else is voting for OPM/theyre trying to be countercultural.

eath Parade with Sound! Euphonium a close second.

I'm sure One Punch is going to be the eventual winner. I don't even think that'd make my top 20 for 2015 though.

Edit: Yea! It's fixed. And I just counted. One Punch Man would come in somewhere around 17th for 2015, so it's not quite as bad as I thought.
>> ARTICLE
>eath Parade 

Sorry >_<
>> ARTICLE
Shigatsu, Saekano, Rakudai, Oregairu, MonMusu, it's been a good year.

Shigatsu is love, Shigatsu is life, but OPM will win it.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is going to lose because everyone will think it's going to win/vote for it, so people will try to be different and vote for something like SnS.
>> ARTICLE
I voted for Hibike! Euphonium because it's my favorite series of all time, but I wouldn't be upset if Shokugeki no Souma or Shirobako won because they are also in my top 5 favorites of all time.

Saekano.

I voted for Gakkou Gurashi. Cuz I know most people here would vote for OPM.

Besides, I honestly love Gakkou Gurashi. I was so MINDBLOWN at the very first episode. Lol. I didnt expect that this anime would have some zombies (I mean, the animation, and art is basically for slice of life, comedy.. Like Yuri yuri, lucky star, Is the order rabbit, etc). So dont judge me xD.

Jesus this is a hard choice, so many great contenders like Death Parade, Shirobako, Your lie in april and Kekkai Sensen. But i obviously have to go for the best anime of the year (imo) Shirobako, as much as i want to give it to the other ones.

My man. OPM and Working!!! also had good endings, but hard to top out best anime. :D

I thought the last episode was REALLY good for what it was supposed to do. Good action sequences, good comedy, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it had a really good fight but it didn't feel like a final episode, at least to me. The whole Amai Mask situation left a sour taste in my mouth.
>> ARTICLE
I can see that, alright! But as a season finale it did feel alright, left some plot points for a next season to leave you curious, and had good closure in an arc. I dunno, for a show that's almost guaranteed to have a follow-up season, I felt it was really good! :)
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it did feel more like a season finale. I hope they do a better ending in season 2.

EDIT: i think all other entries of OPM except for Boros vs Saitama should be removed. Let's face it, the other OPM entries had their moments. But it will not match the sheer epicness, hype and labor of love that the production crew gave in OPM's penultimate battle.

Lancer vs Archer was so epic but I had to vote for Boros vs Saitama. The hype levels in that fight were just on a whole other level for me.
>> ARTICLE
Hah, UBW with three entries.  One of them is taking top spot, guaranteed :P

[Shizuku Kurogane vs. Touka Toudou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhy_xw6l-ig) (Spoilers!) was easily one of the best of the year, if not the best, but is probably going to be underrepresented due to the type of anime it was in, damn shame.

Saitama vs Boros for me. That fight was too hype!

The similarities between Boros and Saitama's dream made it better.

While I admit the Boros fight was spectacular, I personally think that the fight with the subterraneans deserves more credit. Saitama being thrilled by a fight is a hard thing to come by, and its now one of my favorite first episodes.

Saitama vs. Boros would be my favorite in any other year, but Dio vs. Jotaro is probably my favorite anime fight ever.

Damn, this was difficult. In the end I voted for Gilgamesh vs. Shirou only because of the drama behind it and because Gilgamesh was OP.

I love Saitama, but I know how every battle will end.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure OPM will win due to popularity, but... As flashy and good as it was... god damnit, I'm JoJo obsessed... (And I'm still catching up with Gintama so I cannot judge Kamui V Okita.)
>> ARTICLE
Disappointed a TRUE HERO standing up for what is right like Mumen Rider vs the Sea King didnt make the cut.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama vs Boros hands down. Watching it in half speed just made me appreciate the animators work more.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama vs Boros is the shoe-in for this poll.

That said, I think the Archer vs. Shirou fight will land squarely in second.  Lots of hype, high quality, divergence from source in a good way (rare), epic music^2.

I think we may see some surprisingly good numbers for the GATE helicopter massacre with Ride of the Valkyries though.  I sure was tempted to vote for that when I saw it -- what it's lacking in raw quality, it makes up for with an insane setup, execution concept, and modern styles and attractions that we can connect with far more than swords and sorcery.  It even gets bonus points for how unique it is in terms of not being a 1-on-1 fight, like basically all the others listed.  The only "group / squad" fight scene on the poll.

I don't watch Jojo though; apparently that contingent may contribute a lot to the Dio fight.

Boros vs saitama was a blast

Oh fuck. Soooo many good OPs it's almost cruel.

Jojo has to be it. The amount of effort to make the cgi look good and the foreshadowing and symbolism subtle enough makes it a instant classic. The song also grows on you along with DIO messing around with it.

Sorry, that premiered in 2014 so it's not eligible.

The poster deleted it, but if the suggestion was Yona, then I think there might a problem here: the OP2 for Yona did not air until 2015, so it was never a candidate for the 2014 poll (or was it, after just a few weeks?).  I thought Yona's OP2 was fantastic and should be top ~4.  If it was available for the 2014 poll then w/e.  Otherwise I think the rules need to be tweaked.

I don't think it was Yona, because I have no idea when that aired and I would only say something like that if I was confident about it.

Maybe Parasyte's OP.

No, it was Parasyte. I remember for sure now. That only had the one OP from beginning to end, and since it started in 2014, it's not eligible even if airing episodes used it in 2015.

>> ARTICLE
"OP" is music + video as part of the show, so:

1. Kekkai Sensen.  This OP is fantastic in every way, IMO.  One of the few OPs I've ever watched more than a handful of times.  The music matches the mood of the show perfectly, spins up hype, and the visuals are fantastic and set up the show so well.
2. FSN UBW2.  Great music, great visuals.  It really sets the bar for top tier.
3. There are many other good OPs I thought were just about as good as each other for different reasons.  I didn't see a clear winner out of any of them, so I'll throw them all in here: Death Parade (overall), Noragami Aragoto (overall), Gundam IBO (music), Gangsta (unique styles and composition), Monmusu (uncommonly unique integration with the show / VAs).  Oh, also OPM for its pure hype.
>> ARTICLE
> spins up hype

Looking at the OP I can confirm that this is literally true

Bump of Chicken for the win

JoJo quite literally has the best OP of all time for me. The ammount of details put into it are insane.  And the song itself is hype incarnate.

Kuchizuke Diamond for me, Yamada-kun's OP
>> ARTICLE
Although there were a lot of fantastic OPs this years have to give it to Gakkou Gurashi. That OP was not only catchy, but it exemplified the use of foreshadowing and changed along with the show.
>> ARTICLE
One of my vote has to go to Decent Black, I had this song on repeat and we only got to hear it in one episode. I still think it was epic and helped a lot in establishing Ougi as an important character.
>> ARTICLE
i think ougi was stablished as an important character since her introduction in shinobu time even if she did nothing on that arc.

its one of the most powerful character introductions i have seen and she only talked a little about something trivial
>> ARTICLE
Are there no Gintama OPs or am I missing something? :(

besides the current one (which is 2016 so out of question), only DAYxDAY was good enough to be OP of the year material imo
>> ARTICLE
[Kuchizuke Diamond](https://d.maxfile.ro/ifsjfqqzon.webm) from [Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/28677) is my choice but hell there were a **TON** of good OPs. 

It isn't as flashy as most of these OPs but I feel like Yamada-kun's OP does it's job of emulating the tone of the anime while being simple yet managing to tell the viewers the personality of every single character shown.

Speed to Masatsu is probably the actual answer to best OP last year, but Subete ga F ni Naru or JoJo winning wouldn't be a travesty either.

Death Parade.

No question, it was glorious. Many shows like Euphonium and UBW had beautiful deisgns, but Death Parade had the most unique and powerful designs. Characters with little screen time still stick in my mind.

Character design ...

After watching Shirobako, I'm going to narrow my definition of "character design" to primarily *visual design*, with a minor tilt of actual characterization / animation / behavior.

Based on that:

1.  OPM wins for having an unreal level of detail and variety of, primarily, bad guys.  All the other random heroes are pretty cool too.  Add Genos upgrades on top of that and this show is great for interesting visual characters.  Of note, the MC doesn't really contribute to "character design" value of the show, except as a stark contrast by showing how bland he is 99% of the time (except for the "big fist" scene).  Each bad guy and hero gets full investment of character design, and Saitama goes through the bad guys almost one per episode.  That a large quantity of very cool designs, period.  It's the only show on the list where I actually *wanted to see the next bad guy* or I *wanted to see more heroes* because they would be cool.  Given that this show relies on execution in order to succeed, this is no surprise.

2.  Rokka no Yuusha straight up had a lot of unique character designs that are both memorable and interesting.  Every character in the show has some significant design quirks that, for the most part, are also plot-relevant and such.

3.  Hibike! gets points for making "normal" looking characters *look really really good*.  I'd basically say this ties for #2.  Conceptually this show does not go for uniqueness in terms of creativity and imagination -- instead it beefs up the raw quality and subtlety.  I'd say it generally ties for #2.

4.  FSN:UBW ... well not much to say here.  FSN is FSN and has great character designs.  The difference between this and the above is that the other shows generally had more characters, or that they were more unique.  My perception here is slightly skewed since I've seen all these characters dozens of times before in other works.  The ufotable versions of them weren't much different, obviously, so they were less impressive.  If I were new to FSN, I may rate it higher on this.

5.  Monster Musume.  Unique and interesting character designs, mostly from an anatomical perspective that also become plot relevant in general.  The character designs are fairly core to this show, so not surprising.


Many other shows had really good character designs, but these stood out.

saekano aired in 2015?

if shirobako doesn't win this i give up

subete ga f ni naru, shokugeki and rokka also had really nice designs
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako was a damn good show, most if not all of us agree on that.

But, ya know... it had a quite generic character design.
>> ARTICLE
wut

probably had the most varied cast I've ever seen in a show (and probably one of the few shows with a ton of great outfits)
>> ARTICLE
Dude, I loved the cast! Imma just saying, they looked quite generic. Not that they needed to look special!
>> ARTICLE
but 'Generic' does not necessarily equate to 'bad character design'. Character design encompasses way more than that, and even generic character designs can be done with precision making each specific character real to the viewer. You can't respond to a statement about quality of character design with 'it's generic' and not have it looked as negative.
>> ARTICLE
My point is this, I love Shirobako and the characters, and the character design is good enough to live up to the quality of the show. However, there were other shows this season that had FANTASTIC character designs, and maybe, they were good solely for that reason. so even if I agree that Shirobako is one of the best shows of the year, it doesn't automatically mean that it has the best character designs of the year.
>> ARTICLE
It followed the style set for most PA Works anime, sure. But what's notable are the amount of characters that they had to work with (both the staff and their creations). The first cut of OP1 starts by showing off that aspect of that anime.
>> ARTICLE
I know. But that's the same for many other shows too!
>> ARTICLE
I'm always on the fence judging charadesign.  
Isn't it strange to judge charadesign from adaptations and not original only ?  
I mean, I know charadesign can change in adaptation (Gate is a perfect example) but most of the time, adaptations and especially from manga sources are very faithful.  
I don't want to minimize the amount of work done by these people but I find it hard to compare an original creation to an adaptation.  
I'd say half of this poll is "unworthy" in my eyes to be the best anime charadesign of 2015.  
What do you think about this ? I'd like to hear others point of view before entering my vote. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, even if it is the exact same thing as the manga, that doesn't change the fact that it is a great (or bad) character design. At most, it changes the one responsible for it (the manga artist rather than the anime Character Designer)
>> ARTICLE
I think Shirobako depicted that the best, it's probably more difficult to balance both artistic vision and author wishes.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say more difficult, just different. Even more, when I saw that segment in the anime, I was not convinced. Why should an adaptation differ from its source material when the author clearly depicted them in his work (not always the case in medium like novels but Shirobako's segment was focused on a manga adaptation)  
I know it is not particularly gratifying for charadesigners to just copy their source but it should not be the main focus of an anime adaptation in my opinion.  
This thing is a hard debate, I know, but that's why I wanted to talk a little about it.
>> ARTICLE
Then why do you argue that half of the poll is unworthy because it's 'different'? You've made a false equivalency that because the character exists, the design has been half-done for them.
>> ARTICLE
I apologize in advance if I misunderstood or wrongly explained my thoughts, english is not my native language.  

In shirobako's case, I remember the debate in the segment, but I'm not very sure if there is real difference shown in charadesign.  
And even if there was for this case, I would say that most of what I watched and is listed in this poll this year saw no changes in charadesign between source and anime (except Gate, like I replied in another post)  
Things like Shokugeki no Souma, Monster Musume or One Punch Man (even though it's not from the real original source) are clearly copies from the source and not that much was added or I'm willing to admit I'm not observant enough and that is another problem of mine.  
Am I more clear in my explanation ? Feel free to tell me if not.
>> ARTICLE
It changes everything for me. Best anime charadesign implies that the studio should be responsible for its creation and not riding on the skill of a mangaka. Those charadesign should be judged in a "best manga charadesign", even more when there is frequently several years between the source and the adaptation.  
An award like that should be attributed to someone who took more risks and did it the year in question.  
Just imagine if something like Parasyte or Ushio to Tora, even though they were good/great anime were to be awarded best charadesign in a poll 20 years after their original release, wouldn't it be sad for projects like, say, Death Parade ?  
I'm maybe too harsh but there is more than enough aspects other than charadesign where adaptations can shine (OST, BG, Realisation, Animation,...) and this one should be reserved to studios and projects more invested in their releases.
>> ARTICLE
I see, yeah think I agree with you, but even then, if we take that into consideration how would we divide which shows enter the poll? Only originals? GATE apparently is pretty different from the source material so how different is different enough to get into the poll?

I think "what deserves to be in the poll" would change too much from person to person.
>> ARTICLE
I was not willing to express in details in my first post why Gate seemed different because I'm actually not very fond of the changes. I find Gate anime charadesign to be subpar in comparison to LN illustrations or even manga's art. But having watched the anime, I now put in on the general bad art of the entire work. (Sorry if it sounds rude to people who liked it, just a personal disapointment)  

But at least, it changed in the sense that some characters are very different in how they are viewed depending on the adaptation from the original Novel source. Most of them are more "friendly like" than for example manga's versions of them. (Not that spoilery, Yanagida Akira, MC's superior in the army : http://i.imgur.com/68ZztrI.jpg // https://mahoutofu.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gate_4-4.png)  

If I were to choose what nominees in this poll would be, I'd say :  
Anime original, Adaptations from works published in 2015 (Manga/LN)* and Adaptations from sources without clear depictions (that would include Novels or Films with real actors).

*Edit : Only if too few of the other categories to make the poll substantial enough.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.

Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...

The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.

Ah, okay.

Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed

They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.

What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

Hey, would it be helpful to mark sequels as such or put them under another heading? People who've watched previous installments generally know what genres to expect, and newbies would be best off with a link to the first part.

Another great show that came out this year was Overlord.  It has an 8.1 on MAL and was pretty interesting.  It has the whole "stuck in a video game" (sort of) premise, but takes it in a completely new direction.  The MC is essentially a god in this new world and is basically worshipped by extremely powerful NPCs, who are, for lack of a better world, evil.

*b-baka*

Why are you listing bunch of sequels? This is not where newcomers should start.

Nisekoi: under drama and feels? I disagree, the first season 1 maybe. Food Wars is a battle shounen with food and echii, not a SoL.

Charlotte is great? It's fine at best. 

Overall a shitty list. The category action is way to random and useless.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. Noted. Now you make a better list from scratch, then come back to me.

Also, this list isn't just for beginners. If it was, I would've used completely different criteria. It's for people who specifically missed anime in 2015.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online/stats
>> ARTICLE
I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Redline scraping by in photo finish.
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.

If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 5, after removing all shows watched by under 23 people (5% of the voters). 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Ace of Diamond	|14|
|Mushishi Zoku Shou|	12|
|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders|	10|
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	8|
|Fairy Tail (2014)|	8|


Note Mushishi's +12, that means that its relative position on how many watch it should be 12 higher, to catch up with how much people appreciate it. tl;dr? Everyone should watch Mushishi.

This chart is dominated *very* heavily by continuations/returning shows. People who pick up a returning show or stuck with it for quite some time are more likely to be ones that like it, so here is the top 5 "underwatched shows" without accounting for returning/continuing shows:

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	8|
|Ping Pong The Animation|	5|
|Baby Steps|	5|
|Isshuukan Friends.|	4|
|Haikyuu!!|	4|
|Kamigami no Asobi |	4|

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3 material):

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Seikoku no Dragonar|	-14|
|Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara|	-12|
|Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of Dusk|	-10|
|M3 ~Sono Kuroki Tetsu~|	-9|
|Hitsugi no Chaika	|-8|
|Selector Infected WIXOSS|-8|
|Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to|-8|
|Mahou Shoujo Taisen|-8|

These shows are interesting. We don't have Pupa, but I guess M3 is the equivalent, of people wanting to see just how bad it is. The other shows, it's not that they're bad, but people watch them as filler, I guess, without thinking or desiring them to be anything special?

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

The average number of shows a respondent watched this survey was 10.6 shows. Down from  12.35 shows per respondent at week 6. Guess people are getting behind and then dropping shows/waiting for them to conclude.

Dragonar Academy isnt as well written as familiar of zero but it's still a fun watch for those who like tsunderagons 
>> ARTICLE
> Dragonar Academy isnt as well written as familiar of zero

That's saying something ;-)
>> ARTICLE
I gave the Familiar of Zero a 9/10 though. It's pretty easy to see that Dragonar Academy is a notch down in quality but still hard not to enjoy when you like those types of shows. 

I think I tried to promote it in /r/trueanime monday minithread but apparently they don't like this kind of show to begin with >.>

> Note Mushishi's +12, that means that its relative position on how many watch it should be 12 higher, to catch up with how much people appreciate it. tl;dr? Everyone should watch Mushishi.

Oh you, ignoring Ace of Diamond on purpose in order to push up Mushishi more. Favoritism!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I actually chuckled to myself (or should I say "Cackled"?) as I ignored Ace of Diamond for Mushishi! More to the point, Ace of Diamond just barely made it into the charts, with only 31 watchers. Had I gone with a cut-off of 10% of the watchers, which I was tempted to, it wouldn't be there at all.

Knights of Sidonia not winning every category as it rightfully should is disappointing. I'll forgive /r/anime for Mushishi ranking #1 in top 10 favorites though.
>> ARTICLE
> Knights of Sidonia not winning every category as it rightfully should is disappointing.

I'm enjoying Knights of Sidonia, but so far it has been very action orientated while the scenes themselves don't look impressive, mainly due to the CGI. The Gauna really looks poorly done. The animation on the other hand is fantastic, I'll certainly give the show that.

But even so, it looked like they want to make the clash of classes a big deal with all the discrimination towards Nagate but it hasn't really come through yet, and neither has the world building even though there is a whole lot to talk about the infrastructure, science and architecture of Sidonia.

It has more or less the same problems Black Bullet has without being as ridiculous. It can do better than just action, but so far it hasn't acted on the possibilities.
>> ARTICLE
I'm quite the opposite. I think the action scenes look phenomenal. I really like how they've used the CGI, something I wouldn't normally say. The only issue I've had with the CGi so far is the character CGi. They're a bit lacking in detail and their movement could be a bit better, but even then it isn't even much of a big deal. I still really like the character designs and all the other implementations of the CGI that they've done so far. I don't think it would work as well with other shows, but for Sidonia I'm loving it.
>> ARTICLE
Sidonia is full CGI, everything. And that's what I meant by animation being fantastic. The movements are fluid and solid, but both the characters and Gauna look like crap.
>> ARTICLE
The characters aren't the greatest looking, but I think the guana look pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
The lighting on the tentacles make them look like pastries
>> ARTICLE
It's alright,Sidonia is highest rating show in niconico currently(episode 4,96% give it 5 out of 5)
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting on the blurays in the hopes that they fix the framerates.
>> ARTICLE
The framerate in episode 4 is a lot better then the first but it is still noticeable.
>> ARTICLE
If only I had your patience.
>> ARTICLE
I've got another 18 shows each week, so it's not too bad.  Sidonia seems like it'll be better when marathoned anyway.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember correctly, I don't think I chose KoS/SnK for one of my top picks at the time of the survey since I think there were only two episodes out then.  Those two episodes weren't bad by any means, but they were kind of a slow burn.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but if the next week or two is on par with the latest episode I very well may have Knights of Sidonia in my top picks for Week 6.
>> ARTICLE
Man, more people need to watch Nanana's Buried Treasure :c 

It's a really really fun action/popcorn-y show, the characters are ALL very likeable [especially the detective loli], the visuals are quite pretty, particularly the shots of the island, and it's seemingly getting more serious/an actual plot if you look at the recent episodes. 

The OP is kinda bland, but ehhh... the rest is highly enjoyable imo.

>> ARTICLE
I get my loli fix from Chaika, Black Bullet, and Fairy Tail in that order.
>> ARTICLE
Heck yeah! I know there were some complaints about too much going on last episode, but the plot twists! *The plot twists!* Plus the Indiana Jones sections. Some people don't like the CGI, but it's not featured everywhere, all the time, so I don't consider it as much of a problem.
>> ARTICLE
The plot twists are *crazy.* Especially last episode, jeez. I will admit last ep was a bit confusing but it was still awesome.

And yeah, the Indiana Jones sections are SO much fun. You sorta don't notice the CGI after a while, imo.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm not mistaken, it seems to be 13th in the most watched category, at 40.7%, which is fairly high, I think.

Even so, I agree that more people need to watch it! It's one of my favourite shows this season (albeit, I feel like there are a few of them) but it's one that I've actually gone back and watched episodes of, because of how much I enjoyed it (which I pretty much never do). 
>> ARTICLE
People are already watching most of the shows I'm impressed by (**Ping Pong**, **Mushishi**, **One Week Friends**, **JoJo**), so I guess I should just rep the outlier - **Knights of Sidonia**. I know, the CG's terrible. But you kind of get used to it, and if you can look past it, Knights of Sidonia is a gritty, thrilling action-drama in a very rich scifi world.

Ping Pong is easily my personal top pick, but I think Knights of Sidonia is the show that the most people *aren't* watching who really *would* enjoy it - if you liked Attack on Titan, you should like Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
I generally like experimental art styles, but I can't bear to watch three minutes of Ping Pong. I'll try again a bit later because apparently it's a good show and it makes me mad I keep turning it off.
>> ARTICLE
The lack of a simulcast is probably hurting Sidonia.  It's definitely a great anime.
>> ARTICLE
But I like SnK for the MMA
>> ARTICLE
JoJo and Mushishi at the top of Top 10 Favourites are right where they should be...

Dear /r/anime, go watch them.

What happened to Akuma no Riddle "pre season" chart bar?
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are sequels. Some people might not have seen the originals.

Also, another way to look at it: people who won't like JoJo and Mushishi already dropped them in the first season, meaning that the people who really enjoyed JoJo and Mushishi will increase the favorite show transference percentage.

Not that JoJo and Mushishi are bad by any stretch of the word. I'm in the middle of watching season 1 of JoJo and liking it pretty well, but it helps to keep the above paragraph in mind. Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.
>> ARTICLE
>Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.

Yeah, but sometimes you get something like Chu2 which comes along and although being a sequel to a popular show, drops quite dramatically.
>> ARTICLE
I watched like the first and second episode of Chu2 and decided I wasn't really interested. From what I heard in /r/anime, there were like legitimate reasons to dislike the sequel. Partly on the basis that it wasn't anything as meaningful as the first season.

Not to say that you're wrong, because you're completely right, but as more of a specific discussion on it, Chu2's case is a bit different in my opinion because it seemed like it was written for the sole sake of a sequel. Mushishi and JoJo are both manga series which had continuations after the anime ended, meaning they maintained much of the same feel as the first series through following the source material. If that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was the lack of coherent progression and unfulfilling conclusion that I feel let it down.

In Chu's case, it was based on a book, the first season covered the first book pretty loosely and the 2nd season was based on the 2nd book which KyoAni completely butchered. 

So like JoJo and Mushi there was also a pre existing source for Chu2.

But you have a point, since Mushi and JoJo are based on Manga which is more accessibly rather than LNs so a larger portion of the fan base knows what to expect.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but sometimes you get something like Chu2 which comes along and although being a sequel to a popular show, drops quite dramatically.

That took quite a few weeks to happen, though.
>> ARTICLE
True, didn't really happen till Week 9, but I guess it goes to show whether people who are highly interested in the sequels stay highly interested in it all the way throughout.

>> ARTICLE
> Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.

Yes, which is why I've provided numbers without them in the above chart, and in my comment for "underwatched" as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I figured that was why those numbers existed in the first place!

However, he stated that JoJo and Mushishi were topping the Top 10 Favorites, and I was like "Well, yeah, kinda. They're already really good, so it just takes a bit of a push from the sequel bias for them to reach the very top," implying that the numbers for Top 10 Favorites Including Sequels are accurate, but slightly over-representative for sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as /u/tundranocaps said it wasn't in that poll, I was shocked when I couldn't find it, seem it may have just been confirmed after the survey was held. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't in that poll. Not sure if it was a late announcement or what.
>> ARTICLE
Damn right no game no life is at the top. Black bullet not doing half bad either. 

Brynhildr in the darkness barely made it on the last list too, but it's my personal favorite. 
>> ARTICLE
Well this survey was done when most series where at episodes 2-3, and Brynhildr saw it's spike in episode 4 so it may do better in Week 6.
>> ARTICLE
Brynhildr's 3rd episode was the best one though, people complained about the pacing in episode 4. 
>> ARTICLE
We got Kazumi in episode 4 though.
>> ARTICLE
true, kazumi and booby fees
>> ARTICLE
There are 57.4% too few people watching *Hitsugi no Chaika*.
>> ARTICLE
You have good taste my friend.
>> ARTICLE
The first 2 episodes of Chaika weren't great, imo. The characters were really flat - they didn't come into their own until episode 3. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm very behind on the show. Worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
Best per capita entertainment I am getting this season, but it lands in basically the perfect genre/attitude/vibe quadrant for me.

I've seen people say that episode 3 is where things got good for them, so as someone who has loved every minute of every episode thus far, I guess I'd recommend doing that, since it came from people who aren't quite as in love with the series as I am.
>> ARTICLE
It did a good jump though, from pre season at only ~11%.
>> ARTICLE
Biggest surprise for me is how little Captain Earth I see on here. I thought a lot of people were watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Well it makes sense to me. If I was busier I probably would have dropped it by now. It's not that great. The writing is pretty shoddy, the characters are very flat and it's really fucking awkward (Libido charge? orgone energy? belly button forte?). Like I said, I am still watching it, but I am not really enjoying it, I just watch it because I have nothing particularly better do
>> ARTICLE
It's 12th most watched show on /r/anime according to the survey, only about 1% below Hitsugi no Chaika.  41.4% of respondents isn't bad!
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting until it ends to marathon it. I'm fairly certain there are a few others doing that as well.
>> ARTICLE
I am. Just seems like a show to marathon rather than watch weekly, to me. Gave it 3 episodes weekly.
>> ARTICLE
I thought so too, but after a few of the discussion threads, it felt like there were less people discussing it.

Actually, I just looked it up and it does seem like there are quite a few comments in them. I think I was just showing up fairly early to the threads, which is what gave me the false impression.

I don't think I've seen much talk of it in general on this sub, though. But again, this is just my feeling, which probably means the opposite is true.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it felt like there was way more comments, perhaps people were more likely to discuss it, theres lots to talk about.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is doing work, and I love it! I sincerely hope that it keeps up to this fantastic level all the way through.
>> ARTICLE
So I suppose HxH and the like weren't included.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little surprised at how much No Game No Life is kicking Mahouka around in terms of popularity here, both in number of viewers and favorite picks.  The disparity between how many are watching each isn't *that* great, but considering how much talk there was about Mahouka being the hot shit of the season, it's interesting to see three other shows solidly above it on the viewers chart.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the entertainment in Mahouka is seeing just how horribly bad it is.  Gary Stu MC, transparent right-wing propagandizing, the writer obviously being super bitter about having gotten bad grades in high school, and most importantly, a complete and utter lack of WRYYYYYYs.

No Game No Life, in the meantime, is basically in it for shits and giggles most of the time, with occasional truly fantastic moments shining through.  That speech last week was fabulous.  You don't get nearly as much of the feeling that the author thinks he's the elite of the elite.
>> ARTICLE
At the same time I feel like NGNL dropped the ball when it tries to act smart. The "chess game" was a "I make the up rules as I please" shamble, and the speech is so laughably bad and selfjerk on the level of Mahouka. 

This show is so much better when it doesn't treat itself like it's a smart show and do more self deprecating jokes, because face it, there's very little wit in the games themselves so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm looking forward to better games.  But that speech was nowhere near Mahouka levels.  Yeah, I'll agree that it was sort of a selfjerk, but it was a *hilarious* selfjerk.  [](/s "We're awesome because we suck") is an idea I can get behind, and it's far less common than dry libertarian talking points.
>> ARTICLE
it's wet and sappy, and just boring in general. I'll agree it's not as dry as Mahouka. Looking at the comments in that episode thread I laugh at those who actually bought into the idea in that speech.
>> ARTICLE
Same, I did not expect NGNL to blow up like it did seeing as it had no pre season hype like Mahouka did. But after a few episodes of NGNL you see why as it's just a more fun series to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It's simple:

    Underdogs > Ubermensch
    Shiro > Miyuki
    Sorasplanations > Tatsuyasplanations
    Steph > Mahouka's entire harem
>> ARTICLE
Really though, this anime has 3 really amazing characters, and the way they use Steph as a method to explain all the game stuff is fantastic and feels just right. 

Even if there are more or less only 3 characters so far.
>> ARTICLE
Why is it surprising that the show about an overpowered shut-in geek kicking ass in a different world is the most popular? Looking at previous trends, this show was definitely going to be very popular.
>> ARTICLE
Based on discussion since the season started, I'm not surprised at all.  People have been raving about No Game No Life almost non-stop since the first episode aired.  Prior to that, though, I don't really remember hearing much about it, especially compared to chatter centered around Mahouka.  Maybe I just skimmed past the NGNL hype or something since the synopsis kind of repulsed me, much less failed to interest me.  In any case, it was shocking when it exploded on the sub.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for doing these. Really interesting to look at and I am curious as to how things will progress over time. Judging by the "favourite show transference" list, I really should get around to finishing the first season of Mushishi and also get started on JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is great. Was a contender for AotY before it even began airing, and then 2 other shows this season are giving it a run for its money, which shows how strong this season is :)

JoJo is very enjoyable, once you hit episode 9-10.
>> ARTICLE
Up to episode 18 of the first season, and I love it. Although, for some reason I don't think I've watched an episode for a while :(

Well, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

I think I might wait until I've got a bit more free time (after exams) to watch JoJo. I just personally don't really want to start it until then. After hearing amazing things, I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best part about Mushishi for me is I've been watching it over a span of time, throwing it in-between work, other shows, and games (Child of Light is incredible I recommend playing it). The episodic nature makes it easy to dive right back into all it's glory.
>> ARTICLE
So much for international pre-orders, my copy of Child of Light still didn't arrive :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm personally watching JoJo, Mekaku City Actors, Ping Pong, Kenzen Robo Daimidaler, and waiting to marathon Mushishi. Good season.
>> ARTICLE
Marathon Mushishi? That's a show I always recommend people to *not* marathon :<
>> ARTICLE
To me, Mushishi is more enjoyable if I can watch it in large quantities. I watched S1 in about a week, and am looking forward to doing the same with S2. It's an absolutely amazing anime, but that's how I prefer to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
B-but where is DAL 2??? Shocking Truth!!!

If I may ask a request, or at least, bring up the possibility: if possible for the next survey, could it be possible for the English names to be given as well as the ones currently given? [I feel like my wording here isn't quite as clear as to what I'm trying to say; but I can't think of a way to improve it, my apologies]

I'm mainly saying this because I think I remember someone bringing that up previously, and it seems like it might be helpful in avoiding confusion. 

However, to me personally, it doesn't seem much of a problem, as it doesn't seem too hard for people to figure out the name if people are having confusion. I'm merely bringing this up so as to try and bring attention to the possibility of confusion in the survey.
>> ARTICLE
I think it depends on the show, for some, such as JoJo, I'd present only the English name, for instance. Brynhildr and Chaika are split. Akuma no Riddle isn't really at all mentioned by its English name.

Personally? I'd rather whatever is added to be added *after* the current name, so it'd be [current name] / [alternate name].

Last season orders had been changed between polls and until I realized what messed up all my data, it cost me about 2 hours of work.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I wasn't clear in my post, I agree with your view on the [current name] / [alternate name] format. It seems like the most efficient /clear way to me, personally.
>> ARTICLE
Sure that would be possible to add the English name besides the original for a few of them as I don't think it's necessary for all of them.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, I agree that it's not needed for all. Thanks agains for these surveys! 
>> ARTICLE
My favorites so far have been NGNL (who doesn't love this show at this point?), Brynhildr, and KoS so I am decently pleased with the results.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone give [Knights of Sidonia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19775/Sidonia_no_Kishi) a try. 

I was hesitant at first because of the CG, but I decided to might as well give it the 3 episode rule. After 3 however, I couldn't stop and caught up to episode 7. 

I still find the animation to be pretty brutal, but it has it's moments in the action scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Shocked not to see Sidonia in the top 5

Its easily the leading candidate for anime of the season
>> ARTICLE
> easily

I would not put it above Mushishi or Ping Pong, hell maybe in between if the plot continues to be so kick ass. Looks like a lot of other people seem to value NGNL/Isshukan  above it as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Listen to this guy, Knights of Sidonia is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, show has a smaller viewer ship percentage compared to Week 3, but has had a nice increase in the favourites showing that those who kept up with it are enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
Not surprising to see NGNL's numbers mostly go up since everyone had episode 6 fresh in their minds. Nothing is really too different than the previous surveys overall, though.
>> ARTICLE
True no really big changes yet, that normally happens in Week 9. The 4 most noticeable changes are that Chiaka, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou and Nanana are rising and Captain Earth is falling quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't surprise me one bit that Captain Earth is falling, it's becoming a more and more generic mecha show.
>> ARTICLE
True, I mean as of the first 6 episode the Mecha fights have kind of sub par.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life will keep its popularity so long as it keeps it's sleazy trashy nature of fanservice, comedy and references to modern works.

True that, if it keeps doing as it has been then it'll surely remain at #1.

Well ive watched it twice already (re watched it when the rebellion film came out) and it is still my equal favorite for that year of anime (tied with Steins Gate).
>> ARTICLE
You are not actually serious, are you?
>> ARTICLE
I am absolutely 1000% serious. I loved Madoka last year, but now that I've seen better and acknowledge its flaws(fast pacing, not character development), I can say WIXOSS does a much better job of fleshing out it's characters in the *1st episode* and doesn't rely on shock factor, it's honest about its intentions as well, not holding back for *the shocking dark twists oh my*.
>> ARTICLE
**WIXOSS Spoilers of course**

> I can say WIXOSS does a much better job of fleshing out it's characters in the 1st episode

I could and was about to write a 4000 character response with why I disagree with that, but it would only be bashing the show. I'll just go over the few points in a nutshell.

I disagree, I can't be asked to care for any characters in WIXOSS. I think they're stale and lack any form of depth and development past what is necessary for progressing the story.  
Everyone knew there had to be a catch to everything after we've seen Madoka so the 3 losses rule wasn't a surprise either.  
The only genuine surprise came at the end of episode 8, but even then I can only wonder why they didn't ask their LRIG's more questions. The characters lack reasoning and emotional depth in order to keep the plot from becoming stale and hard to progress without cheap ploys.

Madoka, in my opinion, did everything better. The build up was more solid, the main character reacted in a more reasonable way and the side characters weren't just there to distract you from how self-pitying the main character is, as is the case with WIXOSS.

If you like WIXOSS, all the better for you and by all means enjoy it. But I can't agree that WIXOSS trumps Madoka on any aspect. I'm not saying Madoka is without faults, it's just that WIXOSS shares the same mistakes as Madoka for some part (and are worse offenders than Madoka's) on top of other problems Madoka didn't have.
>> ARTICLE
It comes down to preference then.

> I think they're stale and lack any form of depth and development past what is necessary for progressing the story.

Yes, you're right, they are plot devices really and I actually like that, it keeps things *simple*, because otherwise the show would have too much a of burden to cram in development in its 12 episodes(why isn't there a 2nd season?!). I see them as archetypes of ideals, not as much as characters, which can also work. It's the themes and subject matter(no, not the card game, even if it's appealing to me) that carry it for me. So was completely wrong about the characters.

> The characters lack reasoning

When it comes to desire, I don't think your mind would be working properly at that age as well.

> side characters weren't just there to distract you from how self-pitying the main character is, as is the case with WIXOSS.

And that's actually something good IMO because that allows that 1 character to have *some* depth. Ruko self-pities herself for not having any dreams, yet she *wants*, she **needs** to fight. And its handled with *some* subtlety, just enough for even kids to grasp.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't a second season announced already?
>> ARTICLE
I think that the last episode (8) has really picked up the show. Before this I always felt it was a bit melodramatic.
>> ARTICLE
Do the characters ever become more than tropes? I watched the first 3 episodes but I thought the characters were insufferable. I can't handle that shit.
>> ARTICLE
WIXOSS has been my surprise pick of the season. Did NOT expect it to be anywhere near as good as it has been, def worth picking up

Nanana's Buried Treasure was one that I only started watching last week and I definitely found it to be better than expected.

Check out Ping Pong and Mushishi, you guys! Ping Pong's actually far more of a character drama than a sports show, and it is a *really good* character drama. And if you like the creepy/beautiful nature parts of stuff like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, you will definitely like Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, not a whole lot of people watch either of them, but they do stand high in the favourites.


I've seen some people on here hesitant to start Ping Pong due to it's peculiar art style, as for Mushi it suffers a bit for being a sequel.
>> ARTICLE
The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 5, after removing all shows watched by under 31 people (5% of the voters). 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|----|-------:|
|Mushishi Zoku Shou|	14|+2
|Ace of Diamond|	12| -2
|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders|	12|+2
|Kenzen Robo Daimidaler|	10|+7
|Ping Pong The Animation|	7|+2
|Soul Eater Not!|	7|+6
|Yowamushi Pedal|	7|+5


Note Mushishi's +14, that means that its relative position on how many watch it should be 14 higher, to catch up with how much people appreciate it. tl;dr? Everyone should watch Mushishi. The +2 from week 3 means it's even less watched, or more appreciated, than it'd been back then.

This chart is dominated *very* heavily by continuations/returning shows. People who pick up a returning show or stuck with it for quite some time are more likely to be ones that like it, so here is the top 5 "underwatched shows" without accounting for returning/continuing shows:

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|-----|------:|
|Kenzen Robo Daimidaler|	10|+7
|Ping Pong The Animation|	7|+2
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	7|-1
|Soul Eater Not!|	7|+6
|Haikyuu!!|	5|+1

Sidonia getting -1 change from week 3 *could* mean it's less appreciated than it's been at week 3, but it's not, it's actually jumped 4 positions higher in how much it's watched, meaning it's closer to the aimed position, by a bit - that it's appreciated in a manner close to how much it's watched. Whereas Soul Eater Not is getting farther away from being as appreciated as it is watched.

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3 material):

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|-----|------:|
|Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to|	-18|-10
|Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara / If Her Flag Breaks|	-17|-5
|Seikoku no Dragonar|	-12|+2
|Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san|	-11|New
|Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? / Is The Order A Rabbit?|	-6|-7
|M3 ~Sono Kuroki Tetsu~|	-6|+3


These shows are interesting. We don't have Pupa, but I guess M3 is the equivalent, of people wanting to see just how bad it is. The other shows, it's not that they're bad, but people watch them as filler, I guess, without thinking or desiring them to be anything special?

The drops from week 3 as well - people stuck with them, but are even less fond of them? Or that they are fonder of other things more, with other shows stepping up to the plate *more*.

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

* Average number of shows watched: 9.48 shows. Down from  10.6 shows per respondent at week 3. As weeks pass, people drop shows, unsurprisingly.

* Average number of shows voted for top 5: 4.2
>> ARTICLE
Quite worried about the dip in IF's numbers
>> ARTICLE
I abandoned IF because I realised it was a slice of life show with all of what that entails. That at the end of the day nothing is actually going to happen. The problem being that I *want* "things" to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Upupupupu
>> ARTICLE
To all of those who picked up **Haikyuu!!** and noticed that they might enjoy sport shows: **Yowamushi Pedal** has the same feeling to it. It's not purely action orientated and focusses on the characters just as much as the sport itself. Sure, there still is the occasional typical sport-moment in which they do 20min over a sprint of 400m, but it's filled with characters instead of endless shots of them creeping forward 1m at top speed.

I'm glad to see **Sidonia** rise. It's a natural reaction it looks to me, as it isn't a show that has an immediate pay off right off the bat. Its most distinguished feat is world building, and by God have they nailed that so far. Characters alternating action scenes in a splendid fashion give the show the development and pacing it needs to keep you interested. I'm not a fan of the art by a long shot, but it's far from unbearable and the story is more than worth the it. 

Not surprised to see **Ping Pong** go up. Everyone is praising it on both /r/anime and the same goes for some of the more popular bloggers. What does surprise me is **Black Bullet** going up, as it is turning a pandering loli-harem. I guess I should've expected it with how popular loli things are on the subreddit though.  
What I also noticed is that **Nisekoi** keeps getting more popular. Didn't everyone *already* jump on the SHAFT hype train?

Overall I'm happy. No Game No Life is still on top, something I'm okay with as I don't especially hate it, and Ping Pong, Isshuukan Friends, Sidonia and Haikyuu!! are still doing well. Add in Yowamushi Pedal and you have my top 5 of airing shows.

Wow, what's with the lack of Captain Earth love?

When I was watching the first few episodes, it didn't seem to be doing anything particularly new or interesting, just really pretty.
>> ARTICLE
It boggles my mind that so few people are watching Mushishi / Ping Pong while NGNL dominates the chart. I'd love to see the age distribution with the votes.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi suffers because it is a sequel. I hear good things, but I didnt' watch the first season, so I'm not about to hop on the train now. I LOVE Ping Pong, but it's strange art style coupled with the fact that it IS a sports anime means a lot of people won't pick it up. NGNL is the new TWGOK, so it is no surprise it is so high on the charts.

> 1 No Game No Life -- 61.14% | Up 6.65% (Same Place as Week 3)

man im still flabbergasted shaft actually decided to adapt nisekoi

It's actually the opposite, Shounen Jump *paid* Shaft to adapt Nisekoi.
>> ARTICLE
So, I have about a week on Thursday to marathon Golden Time, Nagi no Asukura, Strike the Blood, Samurai Flamenco and Log Horizon before next season starts? Great.
>> ARTICLE
My humble opinion, you can safely drop strike the blood. After a strong start it becomes more boring and vanilla with each episode. You should check out Noragami instead if you aren't already watching. It's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah definitely need to watch Noragami.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you're talking about.  Strike the Blood is a hilarious self-aware stupid harem show.  It's constantly making fun of itself, and my weeks are going to be a lot more sad and empty when it's over.

You're *really* not supposed to take Strike the Blood seriously.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying it's a terrible show by any means. I just don't think it's worth investing 24 episodes in IMO. I loved the beginning but half way through I found myself not caring about any of the characters or the story.
>> ARTICLE
*Challenge accepted*
>> ARTICLE
I just started to marathon Log Horizon, Noragami, Samurai Flamenco, Nagi no Asukara, Kill la Kill Strike the Blood, Nobunagun and Tokyo Ravens so I can be caught up in time for the finales. Good thing my spring break starts tomorrow otherwise I probably wouldn't be able to find the time

Yeah I started watching Tokyo ravens weekly but with the rapid addition of new characters and being slightly confused when remembering exactly what happened the week before. I put it on hold and will marathon it when its finished!

I do not even know why I am keen for Date A Live 2.

That aside, spring 2014 looks great!

Right? Date A Live isn't great at all. But... there is something with it that makes you want to watch it.

Tohka best girl.

Origami doesn't get enough love! Watch the OVA!

> there is something with it that makes you want to watch it.

Come on, that [Date-A-Live](/s "date sim at the end of episode 1. With the blatant Kotori insert and Shidou giving the biggest "are you serious?" face is proof enough the whole thing was a parody.")
>> ARTICLE
I was about to roll my eyes at yet another "upcoming season thread" (there are tons more to come), but a list of airdates is actually pretty useful, so I appreciate the effort!

Winter season has been kinda lackluster.  There's a lot of solid humor, but nothing particularly meaty like the Kyousougigas and Uchouten Kazokus of seasons past.  Spring looks like it's going to have more in that regard, while still having some good comedies.  So I'm excited.

- **Ping Pong** is a definite frontrunner, in my opinion as a raving Yuasa fan.  A lot of people are immediately writing it off as yet another sports shounen but with weird art... those people must not be familiar with Yuasa or Matsumoto.  This ain't gonna be your average sports anime.  My most anticipated of Spring 2014.

- **Mushishi** is another big one.  I've yet to finish the first season, but it's a really special show.  And before anyone asks, I've never seen Jojo.  I know, I'm sorry.  A big ORAORA MUDAMUDA for me.

- **Mekakucity Actors** is getting a lot of buzz, mostly because it's SHAFT and the source material is a little unconventional.  Apart from that I know nothing about it, so I'm tentatively excited.  **Isshuukan Friends** is another that I've heard good things about, but am otherwise unfamiliar with.

- I'm not *huge* on action, space, or mecha, but I also won't write them off on principle - so **Captain Earth** will get a look for its studio pedigree, and **Knights of Sidonia** for the novelty of CG.

- As far as comedies go, **Kawaisou** is from the mangaka who did Love Lab, which I totally loved.  Heard good things about **Mangaka-san**.  Will probably check out **Gaworare** and **No Game No Life**.

Others that I'll probably give 1-3 eps: Akuma no Riddle, Black Bullet, Gochuumon, Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Hitsugi no Chaika, and probably a few more.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is looking to be my top pick as well. Great piece that could certainly stand to benefit from an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, you might be one of the first I've heard *not* checking out *Mahouka.* It seems like, for better or worse, it's probably the big new property being adapted and I suspect a sales leader.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'll probably end up peeping the first episode, but it really doesn't seem like my thing at all.  This isn't based on *too* much evidence, but I'm imagining a relatively by-the-numbers fantasy tale with some teen melodrama and romance, and the occasional action scene and comedic relief peppered in.  Just a gut feeling.  I guess we'll see.

edit: [PVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmVmadbrfI) more or less uphold my suspicions, but I'll probably watch the first episode just because of the hype.
>> ARTICLE
I think Mahouka is a bit different from most anime fantasy, in that its fantasy system is described in a very "scientific" (in-universe, of course) manner. I'd compare it to something like Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, actually, in that it feels a bit more sci-fi than fantasy, despite the fact that magic is involved. So yeah, not the most original thing, but I've enjoyed the LNs.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your sentiments cus I've read the source material and it's alright, but not really anything to write home about. I feel this way because I feel the in the source material the characters aren't really making decisions, they only react to what's happening to them and not really dealing with the consequences of those actions. Also, I feel that the characters are too good in that when ever they need to solve a problem, they can do it immediately and so I can't really get a good sense of the character's flaws and their strengths.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of sales, Mekaku City Actors actually could easily sweep the season if Aniplex plays their cards right. A concert ticket bundled with a BD volume would easily net 60k sales. Hell it doesn't even have to be on the scale of a concert. Even some goodies like posters, art, nendroids, etc,  would make vocaloid fans go nuts.

I'm trying out thirty shows and will probably drop 15-20 of them.  I'm looking forward to a lot of the ones with buzz, but no one seems to be talking about Locodol.  I'm really looking forward to that one, because low-budget idols on a crappy town salary dealing with town drama and bad stages?  That has all the makings of something great.  I don't usually watch idol shows, but this seems like a sufficiently decent break from the trends.  There are lots of interesting things they can do with the whole local bit, since they're actually representing the town, and some people might take issue with the ways they do things, or with the idea of having town idols to begin with.  They'll probably be pulled into doing lots of crappy advertisements for local business, show up for school and senior center events, and get none of the really big popularity or glamor that a regular successful idol might (though they have it rough too, in different ways).  Basically, I think it's a super interesting concept to see explored, and I hope they do it right.
>> ARTICLE
I'm wary because of 4-koma source material, plus a studio + director combination most well known for ecchi shows like kiss x sis. I'll definitely check it out, but I don't have my hopes up at all.
>> ARTICLE
I like lots of 4-koma adaptations, and I enjoyed Yuushibu and Imocho for their stories, so there shouldn't be anything that puts me off the show.  Ecchi can't support a series by itself, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.  We'll have to see.  My numbers for dropping includes several of the shows I have high expectations for, since I expect a certain percentage of those will unfortunately end up being lackluster.  For all I know, Locodol will be one of them.  Gotta do the buildup first to get the soul-crushing disappointment later, though!

Mekaku City Actors, Black Bullet, Gokukoku no Brynhildr.

Oh man, Atelier Escha & Logy is going to have to work extra overtime to heal all that SUFFERING.

Definitely gonna have to balance out those shows with some JoJo's and Captain Earth in between. This season is probably my most favorite in a while though. I know the source material of pretty much all the shows I'm watching so no broken dreams and false hopes this spring. :D
>> ARTICLE
Some of the ones that really draw my attention:

**Seikoku no Dragonar** seems interesting...a dead ringer compared to the Familiar of Zero, which I loved. 

Plot of **No Game No Life** is interesting, sounds like Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They. 

**Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san** will be this season's Sakura Trick?

**Mekaku City Actors** sounds like it'll get really intense, and it's animated by Shaft. The plot description is comparable to that of Welcome to the NHK. 

**Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin** yet another NEET anime. Wow, NEET/Hikikomori related stuff is really popular this season.

**Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara** a dating sim/visual novel anime like the World God Only Knows? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really looking forward to **Fairy Tail** and **Date A Live 2nd Season**.

Added to the list will be **Ping Pong The Animation**, **Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** and **No Game No Life**. I've never read their source material but people seem excited for them so I may as well give them a shot.

**Black Bullet** also looks interesting.

I'll also be watching any Slice of Life and Ecchi series coming out since I really enjoy those genres and I'll probably add more shows to the list if they grab my attention.
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to Black Bullet. It's gonna be like Zetsuen and Guilty Crown '.'.

Thanks for the links. Better to add them now than look for them separately later.

Soul Eater Not is a spin off, not a sequel
>> ARTICLE
Really excited for Jojo and Love Live. A lot of NEET anime this season...
>> ARTICLE
For me I'll be watching:

Mahouka: Its by Madhouse and backed up by Aniplex which generally means good animation, not to mention that magic system sounds interesting. Just hope there won't be too much info dump.

Black Bullet: Many have been saying this is like Shingeki no Kyojin in the future so I feel I must give this one a good (considering that I thoroughly enjoyed SnK). Main character looks like a badass, there is a villain that reminds me of the Joker in a way and its looks like a gritty sci-fi anime (which my enjoyment of Psycho Pass is starting to make me crave more of). 

Captain Earth: I hope this is more Eureka 7 than Star Driver. Plus Bones always means amazing animation (one of the reasons I watch anime for). Just hope they can deliver on the story because unlike FMA, ZnT or Noragami this is an anime original. 

Haikyuu: Production IG nuff said. Might give it the 3 episode rule but the animation looks appealing to me.

Jojo: Once I finish the first season that is.

Mekaku City Actors: Shaft visuals sometimes annoy me (ala Nisekoi) but their work on Madoka Magica was amazing in my opinion (probably because it didn't have blank screens with text every few minutes). Anyways I heard the source material is pretty good, I like the character designs... 
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who is more into Slice of Life and comedy type of stuff, anybody have any good recommendations on this list? I was going through a few:

Selector Infected WIXOSS: looks good, even though it's not normally what I watch. 

Isshuukan Friends: Also caught my eye.

Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka: Wanted to ask about this one. The genres match up to what I normally like, but the anime seems a little weird just based off the summary. 

Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yatte Mita: Last one I wanted to ask about, seemed good up until that last sentence. What.

Been waiting for a Kagerou Project adaptation for ages, I'm so excited for this, and its also going to be from SHAFT so if I don't see atleast 3 head tilts in the 1st episode I'll be pretty upset.
>> ARTICLE
This was so helpful. Thank you! So many good shows are ending next week now I will be able to find some good replacements.
>> ARTICLE
Seikoku no Dragonar sounds like a copy of Zero no Tsukaima.
>> ARTICLE
For the first time there's not a damn thing that interests me in a season. Neat.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have time to look at all the genres and story lines of these shows, but does anyone have any idea which shows I like based on:
Favourite genres - Horror, psychological, thriller, mystery (still like everything though)
Shows: Railgun/Index, Shinsekai Yori, Higurashi

Just a general idea of shows I may like this season based on those things (if possible, if not just tell me what is hyped)
thanks.

>> ARTICLE
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei definitely has similarities with Railgun and Index, especially Railgun.

Just look through [this chart](http://anichart.net/spring) instead.  Easier to sift through, and includes genres and synopses.

Thanks for the chart friend.

**JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!**

Unbelievably excited for JoJo. I cannot wait. April 5th GET HYPED

**Mushishi: Zoku Shou**

Mushishi S2. Not much to say, other than it will be amazing. I think its adapting the rest of the manga, which is very exciting. I have no worries that it will be just as good as the first season.

**Mekaku City Actors**

No clue what this ones about, but it looks cool and its SHAFT so I'll give it a try. I had a couple friends tell me it'll be something to look out for, so why not?
>> ARTICLE
Alright, let's go down the list of shows that catch my eye/interest;

- **[Break Blade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22433/Break_Blade_%28TV%29)**: Doing some digging reveals that this is a story about a person who, initially, can't pilot a mech while everybody else and their grandparents can. Alright, you've got a small amount of my interest *Break Blade*, let's see what you can do in your first few episodes.

- **[Captain Earth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21677/)**: Man, I don't even remember what happened in *Star Driver*, but I'm super-pumped for the creator of that series coming back to do more mechs. *Star Driver* was an explosion of color and enthusiasm, something I hope to see continued in *Captain Earth*.

- **[Brynhildr in the Darkness](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21431/Gokukoku_no_Brynhildr)**: A nice premise, but I'm not expecting much. The director's only noteworthy credit is *Hitman Reborn* and Studio Arms is responsible for *Ikki Tousen*, a series I've heard nothing good about.

- **[Hitsugi no Chaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika)**: Based solely on the show's description I *maybe* would have picked this up, but after looking around I found that the director of this series also directed *Scrapped Princess*. In comparison to *Ikki Tousen*, I've heard a fair few good things said *Scrapped Princess*. I guess I'll give this series a shot.

- **[Isshuukan Friends](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21327/Isshuukan_Friends.)**: Man, the premise of this series is downright *tragic*. And for some reason this show is listed as a comedy. I would prefer if this series didn't take that route.

- **[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - Stardust Crusaders](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20899/JoJos_Bizarre_Adventure_Part_3:_Stardust_Crusaders)**: ...Dammit, I still need to watch *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* from last year.

- **[M3 - Sono Kuroki Hagane](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23133/)**: From the director of *Sailor Moon* and *Princess Tutu* comes...DARK AND ^(maybe) GRITTY MECHS!!! Other than that, I have literally nothing to say about this. It seems like there's literally no other information about the show other than the facts that it has to do with mechs and that Satelight is handling the production. What's up with that?!

- **[The Irregular at Magic High School](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei)**: Seems like this will be the "Big Hit" of the Spring 2014 season. The premise sounds interesting with the whole magic-is-like-technology thing and I've heard people say good things about the manga, so I don't see myself actively avoiding this series.

- **[Mekaku City Actors](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors)**: Having watched the entirety of *Bakemonogatari* and having found it to *not* be one of the best series ever, I find myself not caring about whatever projects Shaft is involved in. However, I will give this show a shot because the premise of the original music-video-series-thing actually seems to fit the style of Shaft's works better than...well, all of Shaft's other works.

- **[Mushishi Zoku Shou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21939/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou)**: ...Dammit, I still need to finish the original *Mushishi* series...

- **[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)**: Being a video game player, this immediately grabs my attention. Unfortunately, everything I've seen of this series has been alarming. The art style unnecessarily utilizes bloom lighting, the rather strange lack of other male characters doesn't sit right with me, and I've heard that the source material is not worth much time or thought.

- **[Ping Pong The Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation)**: Considering the sheer talent that's behind this project, I wouldn't be surprised if it became the first "Critical Success" of 2014. I'm definitely planning to watch this. Also, I kind-of want to see this series get popular if only to see a parody of "Are You Ready For Some Football?" with ping pong.

- **[Nanana's Buried Treasure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21561/Ryuugajou_Nanana_no_Maizoukin)**: I don't know why, but for some reason I *really* want to see this series. I mean, I know nothing about it other than the synopsis, but the promise of a group of friends/wacky characters going on small-time treasure hunting has grabbed my mind and won't let me go.

- **[Selector Infected WIXOSS](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22273/Selector_Infected_WIXOSS)**: The director of the *Steins;Gate* adaptation gives us girls in a dangerous game. Considering that I have yet to watch *Steins;Gate*, I honestly don't have any thoughts or opinions about this series other than the title seems somewhat stupid.

- **[Knights of Sidonia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19775/Sidonia_no_Kishi)**: I was expecting a show about an antihero cowboy in the futuristic mid-West, but this will have to do. If memory serves me, this show is going to be a majority CGI, so it'll be interesting to see how the production company handles that.

>...seems to fit the style of Shaft's works better than...well, all of Shaft's other works.

What's 'other works' i wonder ? You said that you don't care much about Shaft after Bakemonogatari, but you sounded like you know them well.
>> ARTICLE
I probably should have said "Shaft's more popular works". I've watched a bit of both *Madoka Magica* and *Nisekoi*  while having seen snippets of all of Shaft's other Monogatari series. In all of those shows the Shaft style of direction has, in my opinion, been ill-equipped in portraying the subject matter or overused for only the sake of style. And while I'm no Shaft expert, I will say that at the very least those directorial styles have heavily dissuaded me from continuing those series.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame then, i recommend you to continue Madoka (assume that you have only watched 1 or 2 episodes), in term of direction, art, character, hell everything about that show is awesome imo. If you look around some Madoka thread, you'll see lots of people praising Madoka's direction and story with coherent reasons or discussing in-depth its story which always results in long posts, something you don't usually see with a typical anime.

As i said in my other posts, Shaft's direction differ with each anime, they do have some similarity but that's all. So even if you dislike Monogatari, you might enjoy Madoka, it was somehow the case for me at least, i don't like Monogatari *that* much (i still think the direction is suitable for it though) but Madoka is my most favorite anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
2nd post due to character limit. Also, the title should have said "most of the shows."

Such enthusiasm in these descriptions. Haha, anyways I'm looking forward to this. I've read the manga and seen a few of the videos, it seems good.
>> ARTICLE
I just hope they will give Ayano some screen time.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting a bit impatient here, its airing day is getting close and we have yet to see a proper PV with actual animation, i just hope Shaft won't blow up their schedule doing 3 shows in a row.
>> ARTICLE
Their schedule is usually messed up even with just one show. It's certainly not going to be pretty with three.
>> ARTICLE
Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii

The preview for that one sorta has me convinced to watch it. I didnt realize the King was so much younger than the Rain princess. Big age gap it appears. It might be shit but I am going to have faith that they do something interesting. It also does NOT appear to be stupid ecchi or a love triangle.
>> ARTICLE
Yay! Someone finally notices this! The shoujo mangas I love are finally  being picked up one by one hahaha


[Kind of but not really a spoiler, just to be safe..](/s "What I love about this is that the male MC or Livi has a Lelouch/Keima kind of personality :D And the female MC is not a typical crybaby shoujo btch haha")
>> ARTICLE
Man I am a sucker for shows where the female love interest is an older woman. Not MILF status but maybe a girl that is 2-4 years older than the main character.
>> ARTICLE
You should read Ane Doki manga. You might like it.

I have read it and it was great. Sadly it didn't run for very long before the manga was ended.

... Are you sure this is from Japan? The guys are speaking Chinese... 
>> ARTICLE
Only one of them is in Chinese (#2), and that's because the character is Chinese.
>> ARTICLE
One of the characters in the manga is Chinese, and as I understand it, they brought in a VA who spoke both (I can't remember if he was a Chinese immigrant to Japan, or he just knew the language) to play him.
>> ARTICLE
what's up with all the hype for ping pong?
>> ARTICLE
Yuasa Masaki is the director, same person who directed Kaiba, Kemonozume, and The Tatami Galaxy.
>> ARTICLE
ohhhh man, i'm in
>> ARTICLE
Watch those PVs and you can feel the hype emanating from them. The great voice acting and the tone just sets the mood for the entire series. Ping Pong will be the dark horse that a few certain individual are expecting to rampage this coming season. I expect that it will either do very well or sort of fizzle out into a cult hit like Aku no Hana.

>Ping Pong The Animation^[82] Apr 11, 2014

>* AKA the AotY.

That's a funny way to spell Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. ^Ping ^Pong ^does ^look ^fucking ^awesome ^though

Other Jojo PVs:

* [J.P. Polnareff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER_SrymjhHQ)

* [Muhammad Avdol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHwx4Hpz7jo)

* [Joseph "Oldseph" Joestar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVXhs_rxB9E)

* [Jotaro Kujo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4OT_zxvcLc)

That song they used in the Oldseph and Jotaro PVs is fucking banging.

I hope there's a DIO PV.
>> ARTICLE
Can Ping Pong and Jojo's BOTH be AOTY? ^(I'd really like for that to happen..)
>> ARTICLE
I don't suppose anyone knows anything about the song used in the Captain Earth PV. The voice of the singer sounded really familiar, but I can't place her.

Edit: As an aside does anyone know what this season's Kana Hanazawa count is? I have only watched a few of these PVs but so far I've only seen her in Mekaku City Actors. She will almost definitely be in Break Blade as well since she was in the movies and they seem to be keeping the actors the same. So at least 2, probably a bunch more.
>> ARTICLE
According to her [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa), looks like she's going to be in at least five - Bokura wa, Mekakucity, Gaworare, Nanana, and Mahouka.  Add to that Break Blade and the two-cour Nisekoi, and that's seven.  Eight if Adelie makes a comeback in Space Dandy.
>> ARTICLE
And Seikoku no Dragonar (a.k.a. Dragonar Academy) as Jessica Valentine.
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy's not coming back till summer so lets call that 6-7 depending if leftovers count. There are still several shows that have not disclosed their cast at all, so the number may still rise.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, any meek-looking female character is suspect.  And I wouldn't be surprised if she was in Locodol, since it's an idol show.

It looks like Nana's gonna will us a 4th season :)
>> ARTICLE
The last pre order estimates for Senki was actually 50.4k funnily enough.
>> ARTICLE
The anithing guy (who originally posts all these sales things on his site) actually commented on that [on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ShadowZael/status/635884270813319173) Basically, a very distorted result because of the way those estimates are calculated. Symphogear isn't quite at those kind of numbers yet, even if the sales have gone up like crazy for every season (S1 had a 5k average, S2 8,7k).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll add this info to next weeks. :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh G Reco's final volume is finally releasing. I'm really curious what Tomino did with the re-drawn finale. Not that it could salvage the series in any way, but should be interesting to see.

Also Kekkai sensen still going strong is nice to see, even despite the screwed up airing.
