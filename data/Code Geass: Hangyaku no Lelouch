Seems kind of cruel of Schneizel to have set Nunnally up in a room with stairs being the only way out
>> ARTICLE
If anything this show has been a rather long PSA about the benefits of excerise.

Todoh, Guilford, Jeramiah, Sayoko and Cornelia. All in shape people between them survived like 15 explosions (Shit Orange was jumping through them), a nuke, machine gunning to the back and jumping out of airships

Lelouch, the nonathletic, can't run a hundred bloody feet guy that he is gets taken out by a fucking sword.

So remember kids exercise, cardio is key.

Cardio is key but wheelchairs are literally magic.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the Code Geass rewatch for season 1 and 2. It's been over a month since we first started this, but now we are near at the end of our ride, but there is still more to come. There were many bumps along the way, but we finally reach one of the best endings in anime for many people, including me. This show is really special and one of the most diverse and creative alternate history shows, even if it was a little wacky and silly. But that's how anime sometimes is, so we just ignore that part.

Tomorrow will be the season 2/general discussion of Code Geass, so if you don't want everyone jizzing in their panties because of the "amazing" ending, then you are better off coming in tomorrow for actually reflection of the whole series.

After that, we have the first two episodes of Akito the Exiled to look forward to, which is actually one of my favorite spin-offs from the CG world. Then...

#***WE DONE!***

Also, tomorrow will also have the **Gurren Lagann** rewatch schedule put up alongside the general discussion thread tomorrow, so if you are waiting for new information on that front, you don't have to wait any futher. Remember:

#**May 18, 2015 @ 4 PM EST**

Save the d8, m8.

What are you still doing here reading this?

#***Keep on scrolling down to see the first-timers' delicious reactions!***
>> ARTICLE
Will the Gurren Lagan rewatch go into June, or will you start doing the 2 episodes a day latter in the series?
>> ARTICLE
Well, you'll have to wait and see tomorrow.

But if you are really interested, we will do two episodes at some point.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really looking forward to the Gurren Lagann Rewatch. Having already seen Code Geass, I wasn't able to participate to the same level as other first time watchers. I will however try my best to participate to my full ability in the next rewatch as a first time viewer! :D
>> ARTICLE
Okay, don't have the slightest idea of Gurren Lagann~~. IIRC there's quite a few Gurren's out there.~~ Oops, mistook it with Gundam. So, umm...how is the dub of Gurren? 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good, but I only saw the dub. This will be my first time watching the show subbed.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann's dub is pretty good, but infinitely inferior to the original Japanese. 

[TTGL Ep. 25 MAJOR SPOILER](/s "Kittan's dub VA just can't pull off the level of crazy-awesome-intensity that his JP seiyuu does for his last stand. It's my favorite scene in the series and the dub just falls flat.")
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually watched Akito despite me being a ~~Refrain~~Geass addict. Looking forward to it, although we won't have the luxury of a) an already finished series and b) hand drawn mechs.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, my finals are going on. Will have to watch Akito later I guess, preferably when its completed if I can resist giving in.
>> ARTICLE
Since I'm currently in the middle watching Kill la Kill, and loving the hell out of it (It's not too early for a rewatch, right? It's already been like four months.), and seeing how TTGL was made by the same guys, I'll probably participate in that rewatch, too. I most likely won't be as in-depth as this series, but I'll chime in.

No, thank you. And all the first time watchers and people that kept writing.

As a consistent lurker to the Code Geass Discussion threads, I want to give a big thank you to /u/angel10701 for consistently creating the threads for the subreddit. I want to thank /u/Atario , /u/EditorialComplex , /u/Durinthal , /u/Neawia, /u/rascorpia , /u/The-Sublimer-One , and everyone else who has taken part in analyzing and creating very funny comments on the first rewatch I have taken part in. I watched Code Geass back when I was 14ish, back when it was airing, and it has always had a small place in my heart, so this rewatch and the feedback on the thread brought up a lot of feelings of nostalgia for me. I always made sure to upvote the thread and comments, and I hope to see many of you in future rewatches. Again thanks for all the entertainment everybody, and seriously /u/Durinthal , [how the fuck do you make the greatest and worst speculations on such a consistent basis?](http://truegif.com/6974)

Holy shit! I need to rewatch this show now

I hate to tell you this man, but you just missed a rewatch for this entire series.....

I knew about the rewatch, but my 3rd time watching the show was in mid march, so I didn't participate in this one. After all, this is the rewatch thread, so I know what's going on

haha, I meant it sarcastically.  I assumed you were one of the first time watchers in this series that's been populating the rewatch threads, and I meant it as a joke to how you need to rewatch the series, but you just missed the rewatch. 

You know what. nevermind. 
>> ARTICLE
Although I didn't make a post on any of the previous discussions, I kept up with the rewatch schedule and read all the interesting theories and comments you all had. 

Code Geass is many things, but one thing it isn't, is boring. This was my 5th time watching this series, and I was entertained through and through, also partly due to these discussion threads. Shout outs to /u/Durinthal, /u/rascorpia, /u/Neawia, /u/EditorialComplex and /u/The-Sublimer-One. You all put a lot of time and effort into your posts and I had way too much fun reading your reactions and horrible (but a few on-point) predictions. 

And lastly, thank you /u/angel10701 for putting this all together, and (almost) always posting right on time!

I just wanted to recommend one [fan-fiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5304658/1/Knight-of-Zero) based off of this series. AND WAIT, before you write off this suggestion, just know: This is a very short story and is solely based on the events that went into planning the Zero Requiem through Suzaku and Lelouch's POVs. Nothing about love or relationships, just a peek into the thoughts of our two main characters as they decided how their stories would come to an end. Very well-written and very in-character.

Well, here it is. As I said in a previous thread, the only bad thing imo about the last episode is that the ED did not suit the mood at all. So as I also promised in said thread, [here's the last scene+credits with the ED replaced by JIBUUUUN WOOOOOOO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzOP4KlkIsxTWElqYW9WNFBpamc/view?usp=sharing). Hope you guys enjoy it, and have enjoyed the show as much as I did.

I fucking hate that ED with a burning passion, similar to the first ED in R1.

Me being not an ALI Project fan, I was actually okay with their EDs. Mosaic Kakera and Shiawase Neiro were clearly much better though.

Yep, dunno what they were trying to go for with them.

I really liked the ALI PROJECT EDs, but fuck me if that credit scene with Colors isn't just a glorious celebration of the series coming to an end. Thanks for post that.
>> ARTICLE
For all those who are confused as to how is that ending good in geopolitical sense (shouldn't there be a power vacuum now?). 

There isn't one. 
Nunally becomes 100th emperor of the British Empire by direct succession and she has Suzaku eg. Zero who also has Schneizel serving him as his slave since in the last episode Lelouches Geass order to Schneizel was "Obey Zero". Note that Schenizel is allowed to use his full intellect and not be just a mindless drone and we know how smart he is.

Basically the world is split into Britannia ruled by Nunally + Suzaku with benevolent Schneizel to help and UFN who were the good guys to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
> Basically the world is split into Britannia ruled by Nunally + Suzaku with benevolent Schneizel to help and UFN who were the good guys to begin with.

Japan's still not free. They're now ruled by the younger sister of a madman (Emperor Lelouch) who essentially tore the country apart and blew up Mt. Fuji, and her enforcer (Zero) is the man whose actions led to Tokyo getting nuked and turned on them to support Britannia.

And you're saying the country's just going to accept that?

Edit: because multiple people are replying with the same thing...

Okay, we might reasonably assume that Japan was liberated by Nunnally. After that I'm sure other areas conquered by them would also want independence. Was there then a Balkanization of other areas formerly controlled by Britannia? That would only lead to conflicts between them in the future over resources and the like.
>> ARTICLE
Is it better or worse than being "Area 11"?
>> ARTICLE
Plain old Ohgi is the prime minister of japan. I think it's safe to assume they got their independence. 
>> ARTICLE
> her enforcer (Zero) is the man whose actions led to Tokyo getting nuked and turned on them to support Britannia.

The Japanese don't know this. Everybody except Nunnally, Schneizel and the Black Knights' inner circle think that Suzaku died in the final battle, and they don't know that Zero was originally Lelouch. To them, Zero is just a masked hero who was reportedly killed several times in battle, but returned each time to perform "miracles" again.
>> ARTICLE
> Japan's still not free

I think that is a very questionable conclusion. 

Japan was already legally freed when Emperor Lelouch visited the place for a peace conference.  

Then he conquered the entire world, yes, but I do not think there is anything in the final episode suggesting that the nation would continue to be under Britannian rule after the fact.

During the epilogue, Ohgi and Nunnally seem to be meeting as heads of state or at least of government.

The only problem I have with Code Geass is the fact that I watched it at a time in my life in which watching this show was perfect for me, I was also not a huge anime fan and had not known anything about the hype or how amazing the ending was. So I was able to fully unbiasedly enjoy this show, and as a result.. it ruined anime for me. 
What small amounts of anime I was watching at the time, I stopped entirely for about half a year. I knew I would never enjoy watching anything as much as my first watch of this show. I peaked so early :(
>> ARTICLE
Yes but at the same time, if Code Geass is your first peak in anime experience, then that just means that Code Geass was an amazing anime experience. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I've also only watched Naruto and the likes before I discovered Code Geass. 
After I was done with it I just couldn't stop looking for people to talk about how fucking amazing this anime is. I couldn't watch any other anime for months. The void was intense as shit.

I've watched many masterpieces since: 

- Both FMAs which I enjoyed the hell out of

- read F/SN and then watched Fate/Zero and was absolutely blown away by that experience

- Ping Pong made my jaw drop because it was so fucking well written

- TTGL was just an incredible experience full of manliness

- Steins;Gate completely blew my mind

- So did Kara no Kyoukai, especially parts 5 and 7

- and last but not least the newest 10/10 entry for my MAL: Shirobako for being an absolutely beautiful inspirational work of meta-reflection of the artistic industry dressed as an amazing anime full of people working towards their dreams.

But Code Geass will always hold the number 1 place in my heart and to this day, I do not regret that Code Geass was my first peak experience in anime, and neither should you!

One of the best endings ever. Not just in anime, but in general.

***HES ALIVE, YOU FUCKERS!***

Turn 25  Long Live Lelouch vi Britannia

* I'm actually writing this immediately after having woken up on Sunday morning because I just need to get it out of my system as soon as possible. Not to mention, I graduate tomorrow, so I wont have time to do anything pre-three oclock.

* Before I actually begin this, I want to say both [Congratulations!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDajqW561KM) and that Im sorry a few of you (namely, /u/rascorpia and /u/Neawia) were able to predict the ending almost entirely to the letter, which, since this is obviously a public discussion forum, the other first-timers could read and be half-spoiled as well. But I dont blame you. I feel like if those of us who have seen the series before hadnt hyped it up so much as the greatest ending in all of anime history (though it is), you wouldnt have been quite as disappointed when discovering that the ending was nothing more than something you could predict four episodes back. What makes the ending so good is how out-of-nowhere and jaw-droppingly brilliant it is. Here, the show has led us to think Lelouch has just completely abandoned trying to be good or decent, and has gone full dictator mode, only to find out his plan all along was to redirect the worlds hatred onto him so as to refocus itself toward peace and reconstruction with his death. What we should have done is either not show our Lelouch love at all (which, seriously, how can you possibly do that?), or make it seem like we just adored him as an evil tyrant, so they wouldnt have been so suspicious that he does something at the end to redeem himself. Im especially sorry to /u/rascorpia that this show you started out loving so much just became this giant clusterfuck that, while I still love it to death, grew tiresome for you. Especially since you were able to predict the ending. Anyway, on to the **real** episode review.

* Nunnally: The face of a brother and a murderer.

* Lelouch: Do you really have any idea how many people you turned to dust with that thing?

* Clearly Nunnally didnt hear how fucking useless willpower is against Lelouchs Geass. Unless maybe you have another decades worth of time to fight it. Maybe.

* Seriously, dude, Im not one to ever look down on a crippled person, but shes crippled. Just walk up to her and wrestle it out of her hands, Geass or not.

* Kallen is really starting to get on my nerves. Like, even when I first watched this and didnt know the ending, she still came off as preachy.

* Kids: YAY! Its ashing! No school, right?!

* What the fuck is wrong with Jeremiah having Lelouch to depend on? Theres no rule that says being alone makes you stronger. In fact, thats what a lot of people believe to be the opposite of the truth.

* Tohdoh needs some Ibuprofen.

* Blah, blah, blah, philosophical ideals and finishing each others sentences. Just get to the good shit.

* Nunnally: The Damocles will become a symbol of hatred.

* Lelouch *thinking*: Fucking bitch, stole my idea. Okay, thats it. Youre getting Geassed.

* Take [THAT](http://webm.land/media/VY33.webm) you rolling plot device!

* [Jeremiah:](http://webm.land/media/cvzJ.webm) You fuck with loyalty, you get it bitch-slapped right back in your face!

* [Look!](http://i.imgur.com/2nDF0ze.jpg) He was even bro enough to give her her memories back!

* He *is* doing the right thing, Kallen. More than you could ever know.

* Im just gonna say he ejected while it cut away to Kallen falling.

* Lelouch: [Hmm? Oh, this?](http://i.imgur.com/NpTqqI9.jpg) Oh, you passed out from the force of your own preachiness; I just decided to take the opportunity.

* [Curses!](http://i.imgur.com/sMh5yoJ.jpg) Stairs! My one weakness!

* [Im smiling so wide right now.](http://webm.land/media/RsBp.webm) Someone call /u/blue_tidal. I think we found his culprit.

* [ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL LELOUCH!](http://webm.land/media/sXBM.webm)

* [Again with the fucking time-skips.](http://i.imgur.com/6sc8GjG.png)

* [This cat](http://i.imgur.com/pQ1q1zm.jpg) always seemed like he had some larger role to play, what with his constant interfering with Lelouch and Suzaku. But, no. He was just a cat. Its like the most bizarre red herring ever.

* Okay, man, [thats](http://i.imgur.com/XncSqTA.jpg) just gross.

* Would you all just stop your whining and let the man work?

* Cecile: It was just a starting point.

* Nina: So, youre saying they banged?

* Cecile: Hard. Thats why theyre both so callous; they used up their emotions fucking each others brains out. (Thats right; I just put that image in your head.)

* [There. It. Is.](http://webm.land/media/rPTN.webm)

* Im literally sitting over here giggling to myself because of [how fucking amazing this is.](http://i.imgur.com/dSdZYcu.gif) Who gives a damn if you could predict the ending or not? The message, the choreography, the music (THE MUSIC), all come together to tell you that this ending is one for the ages, predictability be damned.

* Absolutely brilliant of Lelouch to order Schneizel to obey Zero and not just him, so now Suzaku has control over him as well. It's gonna be kind of awkward for all the people like Lelouch's other sisters (RIP), who will continually be yelling at Nunnally, "Boo! Your brother was so much better as emperor! You suck!" I assume that Jeremiah won't waste time De-Geassing them.

* Im going to take a moment to list out the people who knew about the Zero Requiem, and those who eventually figured it out, in case any of you missed it: Lelouch, Suzaku, C.C., Jeremiah, Lloyd, Cecile, Sayoko, and Nina all knew about it ahead of time. Nunnally, Kallen, the other main Black Knights, and Cornelia realized it afterwards.

* Blah, blah, Kallens speech about world peace or whatever. Just get to C.C.

* [Ah, its cool how Jeremiah went on to live with Anya.](http://i.imgur.com/Hh3eR8y.jpg) How many times have I told you guys how awesome he is? (Inb4 Orange picking oranges.)

* [Yes.](http://webm.land/media/fEYX.webm) I suppose for that one time, you did turn out to be wrong, Cecaniah Corabelle.

EDIT: Huge thank you to /u/Googleflax for gilding me!

What *led us to think*? That's exactly what happened. He planned to kill himself afterward sure but the show neatly glosses over the months he spent killing anyone that spoke out against him.

Errr, we don't know that he actually did that.  The implied threat (and precedent under his father) should have been more than enough.  But even if he did, a dictator that plans his own sacrificial death in a few months is definitely not the same as a dictator that just sticks with it as long as he can.

So he only ever spread rumors? Not as bad, but a reign of fear is still... eh. Makes me think that more radical factions would be more inclined to rebel after his demise since he *didn't* wipe them out.

Those clips are the first time I have heard the dub, although the other characters voices sound fine I'm not too sure about Lelouch, it just sounds so different.

I actually have no problems with JYB but with almost the entire rest of the English dub cast. Especially C.C. and Kallen (who have a lot of screentime) have much better voices in Japanese in my opinion.

The worst voice in the dub is Nunnally. She sounds so bored 90% of the time.

Awww, everybody hates Nunnally's dub voice. I didn't think it was amazing, but I liked it. It could see how it was annoying or boring, but I thought it was cute.

She was passable for most of the series, but the scene with Lelouch's death needed to be better than merely passable and this is coming from someone who almost exclusively watches dubs.  The Japanese VA's performance in that scene was haunting and just ripped me apart emotionally.  Her wails just cut right to the core and sound so authentic to how I would expect Nunnally to be in that scene.

I liked it.  It sounds a little like she was straining to keep her pitch up that high, but that gives the voice its own charm.

> Cecaniah Corabelle

There is zero mention of a real name for her in any official material anime or manga.  It's more than likely that the creators didn't even bother to come up with a real name for her.  I'm fairly certain that name is just fanon.

Unpredictability is not the sole measure of a great ending, however.  There's plenty to recommend this one aside from "you'll never see it coming!'.

I agree.

Thanks so much for writing these reviews/reactions, it was good to see some more people who love Lelouch.

High school, and thanks!

Also congrats on graduating. It makes me wonder how much age plays a role in what we got out of the series, as I'm significantly older.

**Why Lelouch Is Alive**

* To understand this, you have to go back to the Ragnarok Connection. Remember [this](http://webm.land/media/5IZ1.webm) scene? Charles Code insignia is on his right hand, which he is currently using to strangle Lelouch. Now, we know that only a person with Geass in both eyes can absorb anothers Code, which Lelouch has just achieved. During the time he was being choked, he stole his fathers Code from him, which then lied dormant inside him until the moment he got impaled through the heart, where it activated. And before anyone says Oh, it was too unplanned. Theres no way he could have thought to steal his fathers Code and formulate the Zero Requiem that fast! Bitch, have you *met* Lelouch? They spent a few minutes last episode showing how he was able to continually direct his army to combat Schneizels move-to-move without batting an eye. This is Emperor Lelouch vi Britannia, the Man of Miracles. Had Charles not grabbed him, he would have likely thought up a different plan. But he did, so he didnt.

* During the flashbacks in this episode, Lelouch says he intends on spreading the wish of Geass across the world, which only a Code-bearer can do. How could he do it if he were dead?

* When Nunnally touches Lelouch, she receives [a vision of his memories.](http://webm.land/media/p5Yk.webm) Again, only a Code-bearer has the ability to share and bring to light memories. And dont go saying it was just some realization thing; they didnt give one for Kallen when she figured it out (and if weve learned anything from the constantly recycled Geass animation, its that this show *loves* reusing animation when it has meaning), and it specially cut to Ragnarok, something she could have never known about.

* The most powerful piece of evidence is, of course, when C.C. addressed Lelouch by name at the end, while being pulled in the wagon. (Some people may say that original Japanese ending showed the cart driver to be Lelouch, but thats pretty much been confirmed as a hoax, not that we really needed the evidence.) You might attempt to explain it as, she was just talking to his spirit or something of the like, similar to what she did with Marianne. First, obviously, Marianne was locked in Anyas body, completely different than what Lelouch went through. Also, C.C. is not the type of person to just be talking to the dead out of loneliness or pity, even if Lelouch restored her sense of hope. She was talking to Lelouch directly, and no one else.

* Lelouch also never had to lose his Geass despite obtaining Code, because it was V.V.s and subsequently Charles Code he stole, not C.C.s. Since the person he made a contract with still retained her Code, he retained his Geass. Once Suzaku finally pierced his heart and activated it, Lelouch finally achieved both, or as some may call it, Code Geass.

* Oh, and you think that's all the show has going for it in terms of title-clues? How about this? Lelouch Lamperouge's name, translated directly from Japanese, does not start with Ls, but Rs (Rurshu Ranperji). What does every Code-bearer have in common? They all have matching initials. And how is R.R. pronounced? R2. And what is the official name of this season? Oh, yeah.

* A few people may point out how one of the shows writers said that he died. Well, of course he did. You have to die to activate your Code. The shows director has specifically said that its like the Cowboy Bebop ending, where its open to your interpretation, and with so much evidence stacked toward him being alive, Id say its pretty obvious which interpretation holds the most water.

* Finally, for anyone who says that him living would cause his sacrifice to lose nobility or purpose, thats just stupid. He died in the eyes of the world, and that was all that needed to happen. In fact, him permanently dying would have been the *least* noble thing to do, as he would have left C.C. alone again, with the one purpose and person she cared about gone, only having her endless trek of attempting to die to drive her. But he didnt. He stayed with her, finally fulfilling her true wish: Not to die, but to be able to stay with someone she loves who truly loves her back.

* P.S. [Miraculous Birthday Spoilers](/s "If anyone tries starting up the argument that at the end of the OVA, Lelouchs friends assumed that it was all just a miracle Lelouch performed from the afterlife, I say this. This is not Charles world. In Code Geass, dead is dead, and no amount of Geass or Code can bring you back. More likely, I believe that the events that they thought occurred were somewhat true, with them being attacked by the Neo Chinese Federation, and Lelouch and C.C. coming to help, but the whole thing with Rolo and Shirley were just Geass-induced false memories, implanted either by Lelouch, C.C., or some third party that Lelouch or C.C. has contracted, in Lelouchs wish of giving his friends one last memory of them all together before he has to leave for good. Not to mention, this all hinges on how much this story even fits into the main series canon, which is confusing to say the least.")

If anyone has any legitimate retorts to this (that doesnt just mean, Oh, I disliked Lelouch, so I want him to be dead. Though I guess you could believe that if you *really* wanted to.) I, and Im sure many others who share my mindset, will be happy to discuss this further.

This has been an amazing ride, everyone, and Im glad I got to be a part of it. So, until next time, LONG LIVE LELOUCH! LONG LIVE ~~BRITANNIA~~ THE WORLD!

Also, since Lelouch got the Code from his father and not CC, he has both his Geass Power as well as an Immortality Code.

Both a Code and Geass....Code Geass

Your Lelouch Is Alive stuff is great. Thanks for posting it. It's the sort of stuff I would've went looking for on my own, but here it is in this thread. Yay!

After rewatching the ending a few times it seemed rather clear that Lelouch may still be alive or at the very least that it's open to the viewers interpretation. Your post was more evidence for me to think that he is alive. In no way do I think him being alive destroys his character or makes his actions worthless. Everyone thinks he's dead. Plain and simple. They saw him die. It's been shown that when those with Code die it can take a minute to fully get back up. Even if he did come back to life, he could still lay there motionless. That would give Jeremiah and co. more than enough time to retreat and take his body to safety.

Now if that is him driving CC's cart then the two of them are going to isolate themselves from society. Two immortals who will live out the rest of their days together. It's actually kind of sweet. Lelouch wanted to stay alive for her. He cursed himself with immortality so that she wouldn't have to be alone once the Zero Requiem was through. Gotta keep her smiling.

We have CC, who always hated her curse, and probably still does a bit even if she found a reason to live in Lelouch. Then there's Lelouch, who will have to live forever with all of the terrible things he's done. He won't be able to see Nunnally again. In a way, him dying would've been too kind. That would've been the easy way out. Instead he's now cursed with immortality. He and CC, together forever. They know Geass is evil, and so they won't give it out to anyone again. There's no chance of them ever dying. Unless of course Lelouch kills CC, but whatever, that's not going to happen.

To those saying someone might find Lelouch alive and then the Zero Requiem plan would fall apart, c'mon. This is a work of fiction. So many unrealistic things have occurred so far, you really think someone is going to venture deep out into the middle of nowhere, find Lelouch, and then world will fall back into chaos? Relax. No one's finding him. He still has Geass anyway. "Oh hey, you look just like the evil Emperor Lelouch." "Lelouch vi Britannia commands you... DIE!"

I am certainly not against Lelouch actually being dead. If I had to pick, I do like the fact that he is alive better, but both endings would suffice. It's just a ton of fun to think about it from both sides.

> The most powerful piece of evidence is, of course, when C.C. addressed Lelouch by name at the end, while being pulled in the wagon. (Some people may say that original Japanese ending showed the cart driver to be Lelouch, but thats pretty much been confirmed as a hoax, not that we really needed the evidence.) You might attempt to explain it as, she was just talking to his spirit or something of the like, similar to what she did with Marianne. First, obviously, Marianne was locked in Anyas body, completely different than what Lelouch went through. Also, C.C. is not the type of person to just be talking to the dead out of loneliness or pity, even if Lelouch restored her sense of hope. She was talking to Lelouch directly, and no one else.

This REALLY should not be your best piece of evidence for this as it is completely left to your interpretation. I personally interpreted this scene as more of CC reflecting on how the world turned out. She wondering to herself if this was the sort of world Lelouche seeked. I don't consider this sort of action from her as being out of character. 

Also please don't mention that hoax. It's not pretty much proven as a hoax, it IS a hoax. It's just plain silly, especially given the number of people that saw this episode when it was first aired in Japan (myself included). If they tossed that in the end it would have utterly destroyed the ending for many people, including myself.

> with so much evidence stacked toward him being alive

You know what evidence there is that he died?  They showed him dead.

Dead in front of a vast crowd of people, on TV, with no way out.  The body to be handled by untold numbers of forensics technicians, coroners, royal hangers-on, etc.  And at the end, to be disposed of as most hated dictators' bodies are, in a way that leaves no doubt.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, but the idea that Lelouch is alive is a terrible, terrible one. 

If you like him as a character so much, you're essentially saying that he gets a get-out-of-jail-free card. The whole *point* is that he would do these evil things and then explicitly accept death to redeem himself.  If his sacrifice is fake, then so too must his redemption be fake; in other words, Lelouch is an unrepentant asshole who never atones for his crimes after all. 

For someone who claims to like Lelouch and the ending as much as you do, it's a little surprising that you'd opt in favor of the interpretation that literally makes it meaningless.

> For someone who claims to like Lelouch and the ending as much as you do, it's a little surprising that you'd opt in favor of the interpretation that literally makes it meaningless.

I never understood why people said this interpretation made it meaningless. I don't hear Christians saying that Jesus' resurrection made his sacrifice meaningless. He dies as far as the world is concerned, and can never again see his friends or family without exposing himself, forcing him to watch them grow old and die, happily, from afar. How is that not a fitting punishment?

It's been a while since I've read the Bible so I could be wrong, but I'm fairly certain that the Gospels don't end with Jesus becoming a feared dictatorial tyrant to focus the world's hatred on himself.

I guess the biggest rift between us is that I just don't see Lelouch's actions as worthy of punishment as you and several others do.
>> ARTICLE
He.. he did a lot of bad stuff. Killing people starting with a relative AND respected political figure, and killing many innocent people and even his parents, for one thing. Becoming a dictator after a huge amount of vigilantism and terrorism isn't very nice either.

Also, even if not every viewer thinks of it this way, Lelouch blames himself for that whole "kill all Japanese" thing. He also regrets causing the death of many innocent people, like Shirley's dad. Even if you as a viewer don't think he has much to atone for, Lelouch thinks he has to atone for a LOT.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sure lelouch was too hung up on repenting on his actions. sure he did have regrets for euphy and shirley, but those seem to be special cases since they were both people who he cared about. furthermore, he kills for the sake of leaving a peaceful life for his sister, nunally. Once this has been achieved, he would likely be satisfied. somewhere around 18-20 he freaks out because he was told that nunally was caught in the explosion. I think he has trouble coping there because he had to deal with the fact that he killed so many for nothing.

>Finally, for anyone who says that him living would cause his sacrifice to lose nobility or purpose, thats just stupid. He died in the eyes of the world, and that was all that needed to happen. In fact, him permanently dying would have been the least noble thing to do, as he would have left C.C. alone again, with the one purpose and person she cared about gone, only having her endless trek of attempting to die to drive her. But he didnt. He stayed with her, finally fulfilling her true wish: Not to die, but to be able to stay with someone she loves who truly loves her back.

> for one it shits all over his previous characterization leading up to the Zero Requiem

Does it though? Really? Yeah, Lelouch went a little mad there at the end and probably feels quite a bit regretful for a lot of the shit he's done, but there was nothing in the show to me that screamed 'suicidal'. And why plan your own death when you can just fake it and achieve the same results? It'd seem like a waste of a perfectly good life to do otherwise.

>it'd be a cheap copout that ruins the emotional impact of the finale.

That's literally entirely subjective. The emotional impact for me was right there. After that scene was over I honestly didn't care anymore about the emotional impact. That was an in-the-moment thing. When I looked up the ending online and saw the case for him surviving, I went 'huh, neat, guess that's my new headcanon'. I guess if you want to rewatch the series and elicit the same emotional response again then yeah, just believe that Lelouch died. The ending was ambiguous enough to reasonably believe that. But I like the idea that Lelouch isn't going to give up on life just because of all the (mostly self inflicted) tragedy he's been through. I like the fact that it gives him a second chance at life, a normal life. A chance to find actual happiness. I like that CC has someone to be with for the forseeable future and isn't going to be trying to kill herself by cursing someone else with the Geass. 

If you disagree, then that's fine. The world wouldn't be any fun without dissenting opinions. But in my opinion, the fact that what happened was basically a 'get out of jail free card' did literally nothing to deter from the awesomeness that was the ending.
>> ARTICLE
>Does it though? Really? Yeah, Lelouch went a little mad there at the end and probably feels quite a bit regretful for a lot of the shit he's done, but there was nothing in the show to me that screamed 'suicidal'.

You mean besides him falling into despair and initially planning to let the Black Knights kill him? Or how he was okay with dying if it meant taking Charles with him? Or all the other indications that he was wracked with guilt and regret, to the point he planned out his own assassination?

 >And why plan your own death when you can just fake it and achieve the same results? It'd seem like a waste of a perfectly good life to do otherwise.

Because Lulu's entire philosophy has been that one must be prepared to die if they wish to wage war, and he very clearly believes he needs to in order to atone for his sins. 

>That's literally entirely subjective.

This is a weak as hell counterargument. it essentially boils down to saying 'Well its *okay* if I like to eat broken glass, my taste is just different!' You've neither defended or meaningfully commented on how the headcanon that Lelouch is alive alters the finale, just said that a person's reaction to it is subjective.

The entirety of the show is building up to the end of Lelouch's character arc, which is tied deeply to the ZR as the ultimate expression of his ideals and willingness to do anything to achieve his goals. To play it all out and then completely destroy the core, fundamental concept of it - that Lelouch chooses to give his life - retroactively invalidates the buildup and payoff by revealing it as false. It changes the entirety of his characterization and the point of his plan, and I believe that it does so in an extremely negative manner.

>The ending was ambiguous enough to reasonably believe that

It really wasn't. There's no solid evidence he is alive whatsoever, besides a single scene at the end where C.C. - who is repeatedly shown to be religious - talks aloud to Lelouch's spirit, which people love trying to interpret in different ways despite the most simple explanation being right in front of them. The cart driver doesn't even resemble him from what little we see.

This is without getting into the word of the creators, because death of the author etc.

Lelouch found his happiness, it was dying after resolving his final earthly issues in order to accomplish his lifelong goals while knowing his remaining loved ones would survive. There's a reason he's smiling for so much of his death scene.

(I'm sorry if this comes across as overly ranty or aggressive, I'm more used to shitposting about this than not so I fear my tone may be inappropriate)

Well, at least two of those points could be explained away without turning to the whole 'regretfully suicidal' theory. He was okay with him dying alongside Charles because at the time, his #1 priority was to ensure that Charles didn't win no matter the cost. And the whole 'to the point where he planned out his own assassination point' only works if he was actually assassinated. And if that's the case, then obviously my entire argument would be pointless regardless.

>Because Lulu's entire philosophy has been that one must be prepared to die if they wish to wage war, and he very clearly believes he needs to in order to atone for his sins.

His philosophy is to be *prepared* to be killed, not to actively count on it happening. And I think him uniting the world qualifies as atoning for his sins quite well.

>This is a weak as hell counterargument. it essentially boils down to saying 'Well its okay if I like to eat broken glass, my taste is just different!' You've neither defended or meaningfully commented on how the headcanon that Lelouch is alive alters the finale, just said that a person's reaction to it is subjective.

Apples and oranges. There are actual physical detriments to eating glass. Not so much to believing that Lelouch survived. If eating glass didn't cut your mouth open and break your teeth (or whatever happens when one eats glass), then I'd say go for it if that's your thing. It's the same with opinions on entertainment. If you like one thing, go for it. As long as you're not literally harming yourself by believing that one thing, I'm not gonna try to stop you.

That's only true if you believe he was planning to actually kill himself the entire time! It's the definition of circumstantial evidence- things that only become evident once you have the conclusion to connect it to. But if the conclusion is wrong, then that circumstantial evidence now means something entirely different.

>It really wasn't.

The cart driver doesn't even resemble him from what little we see.

Honestly, the biggest piece of evidence for me was when he touched Nunnally and she saw Lelouch's past like he did when he touched CC. That's the 'smoking gun' so to speak, almost an assurance that he has the code. All the other evidence is honestly kind of secondary.

CC talking to nobody is a bit weird and out of character IMO, barely cutting off the final scene right before showing the face of the driver, him killing his father, someone who had the code, and of course the fact that the name of the show is 'Code Geass' and his name if he was immortal would be 'R2' (in Japanese apparently his name is pronounced with an R instead of L, Rerouch Ramperouge). This is all circumstantial evidence that only really fits if Lelouch actually survived, but him showing his memories to Nunnally isn't. That has no other explanation than 'he has the code'. And if he has the code, obviously he didn't die in that scene.

>Lelouch found his happiness, it was dying after resolving his final earthly issues in order to accomplish his lifelong goals while knowing his remaining loved ones would survive. There's a reason he's smiling for so much of his death scene.

Or he found *actual* happiness by living a far less stressful life with CC. The reason he's smiling could be because, you know, he accomplished all his goals and this was his brilliant scheme coming to its climax. Not necessarily a 'yah I'm about to die' smile.

>(I'm sorry if this comes across as overly ranty or aggressive, I'm more used to shitposting about this than not so I fear my tone may be inappropriate)

>His philosophy is to be prepared to be killed, not to actively count on it happening. And I think him uniting the world qualifies as atoning for his sins quite well.

Yeah, and my argument is that the ultimate point of his character arc - as expressed through the zero requiem - is that he finally displays his utter conviction in this belief when he actually gives his life. Its the culmination of everything he's said regarding it.

>Apples and oranges. There are actual physical detriments to eating glass. Not so much to believing that Lelouch survived.

Yeah, but the conclusion is fully supported by canon [and the shows creators](http://animeotaku.animeblogger.net/2008/10/code-geass-r2-another-nail-in-lelouchs-coffin/)

>Honestly, the biggest piece of evidence for me was when he touched Nunnally and she saw Lelouch's past like he did when he touched CC. That's the 'smoking gun' so to speak, almost an assurance that he has the code. All the other evidence is honestly kind of secondary.

She has superpowers that let her see into people's hearts by touching their hands. I wish I was making this shit up, but...ugh, its really dumb. My link above has info on this.

>Or he found actual happiness by living a far less stressful life with CC. 

I don't see why him dying somehow makes his happiness invalid. He accomplished what he set out to do in the end, and is finally atoning and receiving his final rest - its a pretty satisfying conclusion, more than most people ever get. (damn that last part felt kind of depressing to say for a debate about chinese girl cartoons)

>Honestly I feel the same about my writing sometimes. You brought up some really good points that were honestly tough to argue against, so props to you for that. But hey, you didn't go for outright name calling. That puts you above at least quite a few people I've argued against on here.

I think if Lelouch is alive then he didn't know he had Charles Code. His death scene really didn't look like it was an act, he was prepared to die for the world and to repent.

I'm mostly averse to the concept of Lelouch being alive simply because of how it introduces a number of flaws in his plan and really doesn't match with the death-wish/self-loathing image I pulled from him throughout most of the series, but the last leg especially so:

- If he's alive and walking about he throws his own plan into jeopardy. His intention was to take on the world's hatred and be the symbol of the worst of humanity. What happens when said symbol's still out there? I can understand his consciousness remaining within the World of C, but being alive and out there in the world adds a little thread at the end of his plan that when pulled could very well unravel it. It's not something Lelouch would really allow in a plan of this scale.

- Did he say he wished to spread Geass itself or the wish that it represented? He wished for a kinder world/a better place for Nunnally, does he not get to spread that wish with the result of Zero Requiem?

- He developed a death wish at least as big as Suzaku's own and almost definitely believes he's not good enough to live in the more peaceful world he wishes to bring about with the his death. He doesn't make the best or most rational decisions -- it takes someone with a great amount of self-loathing to go "Yeah I'll become the most hated person in the world" even with a grand scheme to back him up. When he confronted Charles and Marianne a few episodes ago he expected to go out in a blaze of glory then and there. He's pulled things that I'm pretty sure he has justified to himself but also has not forgiven himself for: Killing Euphy, Erasing Shirley's memories, Leaving Shirley in a position where she was eventually killed by Rolo, providing the situation where his geass on Suzaku would kick in and have him drop the FLEIJA, geassing Nunnally, etc... I really don't think he saw himself as worthy of the world after a certain point


In a way I just feel like believing that he's dead adds the weight of the people of world being able to move on their own two legs and work together with the world he's left for them instead of him being a force left out there that will still try to move the world in his own way. Lelouch isn't perfect and he's done some reprehensible things -- I more liked the idea that he and the mistakes/sins he embodied had to bow out for the world to move on.
>> ARTICLE
> death-wish/self-loathing image I pulled from him throughout most of the series

I don't know how you pulled this death-wise image from the series. I guess it could be justified towards the end of R2 but even then I don't see much of a death wish held by Lelouch.

> If he's alive and walking about he throws his own plan into jeopardy.

Well he's under disguise haha.

> What happens when said symbol's still out there?

Geass it away.

> He wished for a kinder world/a better place for Nunnally, does he not get to spread that wish with the result of Zero Requiem?

Yes, he does. I don't see how that's really relevant here.

> great amount of self-loathing to go "Yeah I'll become the most hated person in the world" 

I think that requires mostly a great amount of intellect and integrity. Lelouch placed peace for the world above himself, I don't think that necessarily requires self-loathing.

> He's pulled things that I'm pretty sure he has justified to himself but also has not forgiven himself for: Killing Euphy, Erasing Shirley's memories, Leaving Shirley in a position where she was eventually killed by Rolo, providing the situation where his geass on Suzaku would kick in and have him drop the FLEIJA, geassing Nunnally, etc... I really don't think he saw himself as worthy of the world after a certain point

You're correct. Up until this point Lelouch has blamed himself for every tragedy that happened within the series (wrongfully so of course). And I completely agree that he believed he was undeserving to live in this new world, which is why he doesn't. He travels around with CC hiding from humanity because that's his own punishment.

> dead adds the weight of the people of world being able to move on their own two legs and work together with the world he's left for them instead of him being a force left out there that will still try to move the world in his own way.

I didn't even think that was a theme in the series. The entire series is pretty much how a teenage boy saved the world for his little sister, I don't know if saving yourself was much of a theme within the show.

This is it. This is the end. Its been a pleasure, everyone. Lets do it.

**Episode 25**

I wish Nunnally wouldve wanted to talk to Lelouch about his actions. I know hes done terrible things, but hes her brother. If you heard a loved one was someone different than what you thought they were, wouldnt you want to at least ask them why yourself?

Goodbye World End, best OP. ^Fight ^me.

Todo actually going to go fight and die?

Ok. Of course I point this out *now* when I couldve done so a long time ago. Nunnally and Lelouch are talking it out.

Suzaku materializes a new sword. Cool.

[Villetta looking at an ultrasound picture?](http://i.imgur.com/zQ2AReU.jpg)

Awww, at least one lady likes Tamaki.

He did it. Lelouch Geassed his sister because they have the same goal. She resisted it pretty well. Im glad it was such a simple order, and nothing worse.

[MEMORIZE JEREMIAH GOTTWALD!!!!!](http://www.gfycat.com/PastelThriftyKitfox) Poor Anya. Jeremiah might save you. I guess maybe Lelouch told him what Charles Geass did so he thinks that happened to Anya?

Gino saves Kallen. Yes. Im not one to ship, but Ill set sail on this one.

Stairs! Noooooo! Youve become a *demon,* Lelouch. Love it.

Really need to look at Lelouch from the perspective of anybody but me, a viewer. Normal citizens have no freaking clue about Geass or any of that. They just think some maniacal son took the throne after killing his father and is out to conquer the world. Scary stuff.

Hes Geassing the entire world? How? Oh wait. His eyes arent wings. Hes just straight up commanding everyone. [ALL HAIL LELOUCH!!!](http://i.imgur.com/PqUkPdM.jpg) No one will ever be more loyal than Jeremiah Gottwald.

Holy shit, hes going to execute everyone. Yeah right. Surprised Jeremiah is on all of this. Poor Nunnally all tied up. Even Lloyd and Nina are captured. Wonder what happened between Lloyd and Rakshata.

CC praying.

Suzaku Zero!

Jeremiah is on in it too. Thats why he let it all happen. Shouldve known. Im an idiot. Guys as loyal as an orange is colored orange. Of course Lelouch would trust him to be in on the secret Zero Requiem plan.

And it was fairly obvious Lelouch wanted everyone to hate him. Fantastic music in this scene where hes handing Suzaku the Zero helmet. And were assuming Schneizel (and the others) will stay Geassed after Lelouch dies?

That quote. Shouldve realized he would end up dying after spatting a quote like that.

OMG he rolls right next to Nunnally. Fuck thats gruesome.

NO ITS NOT! She found out! YES!!! She found out! Thank fucking god. Im so satisfied.

Tears.

This soundtrack.

Nunnally NO! Too many tears. Stop it, Nunnally. Dont do this to me.

Awww man. Suzaku is cursed or something now? Whats going on here?

Anime toast Kallen. -_- Tamaki a barkeeper. Perfect. Jeremiah and oranges. More perfect. And hes with Anya. CC traveling across the countryside talking to Lelouch?

Its done.

**POST EPISODE THOUGHTS**

I very much enjoyed the ending. Watching it a few times to help make sense of it all helped. I just wish the rest of R2 was as quality as this episode was. It made sense that it happened this way after Lelouchs confrontation with his parents. It was clear neither his way or Suzakus way would help make the world a better place. Im glad they were able to finally work together to achieve their shared goal.

Unfortunately, it turned out to be true that [Suzaku kills Lelouch.](http://www.gfycat.com/DampMaleJay) That was something that I was spoiled on, but wasnt sure if it would actually happen. I think I may have been a tad more surprised when it happened, but it ultimately wasnt too bad a spoiler. Knowing this may have affected my thoughts on the future for the past few days, but I tried not to let it.

That scene with Nunnally was too much. All she wanted was to live with her brother and be happy. She finally learned the truth. Im so happy she did. It was gut wrenching to watch her cry over her dead brother, but in the end its better that she knew the truth. It was luck that Lelouch got Geass and tried overthrowing Britannia. If he didnt, there wouldve been no one to stop Charles. There was never a chance for Nunnally and Lelouch to live long happy lives together, and thats what saddens me the most.

They went all out on the soundtrack for this episode. Beautiful work.

I went back to watch a few things. So Suzaku is believed to be dead by everyone. [^poor ^Arthur](http://i.imgur.com/MQPNlG4.jpg) So now he must always wear the Zero mask in order to continue to do good things for the world. Thats his burden? I guess just Kallen, Todo, Nunnally, and Jeremiah know about it.

And in the scene where Lelouch gave Suzaku Zeros helmet, Lelouch talked about granting Geass to people everywhere, and CC said the consequences of that would be huge. Then she cried. What was this all about?

What did Jeremiah do to Anya? De-Geass her so she could have her memories back? Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

And were to believe that Lelouch is still alive somewhere, Cs World maybe? Yes? The way it ended with CC made it seem like that since she said him living a life of solitude isnt quite correct. The two of them can still communicate so theyll never be alone.

**CONCLUSION**

So no book from me today. Maybe tomorrow? Im not sure. Ill do my best to put out something worthwhile.

> What did Jeremiah do to Anya? De-Geass her so she could have her memories back? Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

I'm assuming that everytime Marianne and Charles talked, Charles would have to Geass Anya into forgetting that happened.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow. Thank you for your comment. Just now realizing that since Marianne was on Charles' side she was likely talking to him all the time while inside Anya's mind.

That's also an interesting way to look at it. Everyone else seemed to think that Anya blacked out when Marianne took over which makes a little more sense since at the end she didn't seem to know what happened after Marianne left her. I wouldn't put it past Charles to always be re-Geassing her though just to be safe.
>> ARTICLE
> If you heard a loved one was someone different than what you thought they were, wouldnt you want to at least ask them why yourself?

Well he did put her on full blast completely ripping her a new one a couple episodes ago so it's understandable why she's not interested in talking it out.

> Goodbye World End, best OP. Fight me.

**YES!!!!!**

> Awww, at least one lady likes Tamaki.

They at least threw him a bone at the end.

> Poor Anya. Jeremiah might save you.

Jeremiah was a guard at the Aries Villa before Marianne was killed so he would've known Anya from that and could put two and two together about Geass related memory loss.

> Gino saves Kallen. Yes. Im not one to ship, but Ill set sail on this one.

It's kind of sad really that Gino is pretty much perpetually in the friend zone (in my opinion at least).  Let's not pretend even for a sec that Kallen isn't all sorts of hung up on Lelouch I mean he's the reason she went back to Ashford (as per his request) and she keeps a blown up close up of him central on the picture board in her room.  Plus there's the fact that she's talking to him...poor poor Gino.  He deserves better.

> Nunnally NO! Too many tears. Stop it, Nunnally. Dont do this to me.

[] (#not-raining)

> Suzaku is cursed or something now? Whats going on here?

Suzaku's "curse" is that he has to live as Zero full time.  Suzaku Kururugi dead and there's only Zero left.  He's basically forfeited his identity and former life as well as any personal hopes or aspirations for the future.

> That was something that I was spoiled on, but wasnt sure if it would actually happen.

Was it the troll who was flaming one of these threads a few days ago with that very specific spoiler that got you?

> They went all out on the soundtrack for this ~~episode~~ series. Beautiful work.

Fixed.

> I guess just Kallen, Todo, Nunnally, and Jeremiah know about it.

I don't think Todo knows.  Kallen definitely does and I think is definitely heartbroken and would probably be confused by the fact that she was left out of the plan.  I think Lloyd, Nina, and Cecile all know about it too since they were in his camp after the Zero Requiem plan was hatched.

> And in the scene where Lelouch gave Suzaku Zeros helmet, Lelouch talked about granting Geass to people everywhere, and CC said the consequences of that would be huge. Then she cried. What was this all about?

Lelouch was speaking metaphorically.  He was saying that he was going to grant a wish for everyone by having himself killed.  CC was sad that he was about to get a sword through his gut.  She wasn't crying when they came up with the plan she was crying at the implementation.  Lelouch paid for using Geass on people with his life.  That's pretty costly no?

> What did Jeremiah do to Anya? De-Geass her so she could have her memories back? Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

It was implied that when Marianne took over Anya before going into the Sword of Akasha that it wasn't the first time that had happened.  Anytime Marianne took control of Anya's body it was the equivalent of Anya blacking out.

> And were to believe that Lelouch is still alive somewhere, Cs World maybe? Yes? The way it ended with CC made it seem like that since she said him living a life of solitude isnt quite correct. 

He's definitely dead, that's pretty much an objective fact.  C's world is just Code Geass' heaven.  Remember CC said that she'd see Mao there right before she killed him.  The way I interpreted what she said was that his actions had proved that theory wrong as he had actually relieved her from her own life of solitude.

I think he is the carriage driver, whose face is purposely covered due to his visage being rather well known (to put it mildly). He not only live, but is immortal. He granted CC's wish when he rejected his father. He replaced CC and assumed her power and possibly VV's as well.

He did all of this knowing what Suzaku would require of him. Thus he "won" in the end by both *creating* a better world for Nunnaly and *destroying* the previous world order(s).
>> ARTICLE

That's true. I'd still want to talk it out though, you know? "I've known you my entire life. What the hell is going on? Explain this all to me."

> Jeremiah was a guard at the Aries Villa before Marianne was killed so he would've known Anya from that and could put two and two together about Geass related memory loss.

Nice. Good catch. Hadn't thought of that.

> poor poor Gino. He deserves better.

I'm glad Gino was a good guy throughout the series. I remember a few of us worrying he might end up being a bit crazy, but he was such an awesome guy. Hopefully he can move on from Kallen.

> They went all out on the soundtrack for this episode series. Beautiful work.

I thought it was good overall, but this final episode was just marvelous.

> I don't think Todo knows. Kallen definitely does and I think is definitely heartbroken and would probably be confused by the fact that she was left out of the plan. I think Lloyd, Nina, and Cecile all know about it too since they were in his camp after the Zero Requiem plan was hatched.

Ok so yeah, those others in Lelouch's camp know. That's cool. I just thought maybe Todo had an idea because right before Kallen started screaming, "It's Zero" he seemed like he thought it was probably Suzaku.

> It was implied that when Marianne took over Anya before going into the Sword of Akasha that it wasn't the first time that had happened. Anytime Marianne took control of Anya's body it was the equivalent of Anya blacking out.

Aggghhh. I should've been able to figure that out. Thanks for explaining it.

I don't agree that he's *objectively* dead. I think it's highly likely that he is, but it's somewhat possible he's alive somehow. There were some interesting theories in this thread as to how he's alive, and I made a post on it too. I think it's good that it's possible to see it different ways. Both endings are equally satisfying to me in different ways.

I took that to mean he figured out what was happening, rather than him being clued into the specifics. He realizes "Zero" is the symbol and that's all he needs

I was having a quiet laugh when you guys came up with the "Gino is a psycho" line of thought just for one single sentence uttered in episode 8
>> ARTICLE

That's definitely a good point, I guess if she did confront him he would deflect with lies again.

> I thought it was good overall, but this final episode was just marvelous.

Oh for sure I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2tGEiYU9KU) may be my favorite track from this show or any anime in general.  Just fit that scene so well.

Fair enough I just feel like, in my opinion, that him not being dead cheapens the Zero Requiem.  I think giving his life was Lelouch's way of trying to atone for all of the sins he had committed throughout the series and him being alive would just make that a non-sacrifice.  He ultimately realized that the best contribution he could make to the world would be to give them a common enemy and then once that was achieved all that was left was for him to die so that all the evil he had built would collapse.  I feel like narratively that's the only way it could've gone, but I acknowledge that there are others that feel differently such as yourself which is of course fine since ultimately fiction is meant to be interpreted in different ways.

Anywho it's been a lot of fun reading your posts throughout this rewatch.  It was really fun to read your insights into different stuff in the series and see your reactions as the series went along especially since you said you're new to anime in general definitely a unique perspective.  I actually only watched the series for the first time in October so it's cool to re-visit it a short time later and get this sort of in depth look at it with this community.  Thanks for making this fun!
>> ARTICLE

So good. That's definitely going to end up being one of my favorites. It just portrays everything coming to a head so well. Brilliant.

> Fair enough I just feel like, in my opinion, that him not being dead cheapens the Zero Requiem. I think giving his life was Lelouch's way of trying to atone for all of the sins he had committed throughout the series and him being alive would just make that a non-sacrifice...

I do think that he is dead. That seems to be the logical conclusion. To me though there's still a chance that he is alive, and if nothing else, it's just incredibly fun to think about it from the other side. I think he's still sacrificing a lot, even more than if he died, because then he'd be immortal and cursed just like CC was. He'd have to live for an eternity knowing he messed up so many people's lives. That's rough.

But I do enjoy all of your points on why him being dead is better. It's fun agreeing to disagree. We get to civilly discuss both sides. It's been great. Thanks for always responding to my posts! And I'm glad you remembered I'm still new to anime. I always hoped I wasn't mentioning to often, but I felt it was important for others to know.
>> ARTICLE
> It's fun agreeing to disagree. We get to civilly discuss both sides. It's been great.

For sure you get to see whole new perspectives and ideas on how to view certain things in the show.  Now the next time I watch through I'll look at it differently because of the points brought up in these rewatch threads, which is ultimately kind of the point.

> And I'm glad you remembered I'm still new to anime. I always hoped I wasn't mentioning to often, but I felt it was important for others to know.

I think it's definitely important for others to know that because it's always important to offer context for your viewing experience because that will of course color your views on the show.  I'm hardly an anime veteran (I honestly only got into it in August), so it's kind of cool to see your thoughts on different stuff with the show since they somewhat reflect how I thought about it at the time I was watching it.

> They went all out on the soundtrack for this episode. Beautiful work.


The song that plays when the plan of the Zero Requiem was revealed is called Madder Sky and it was the first song on the second OST album for Code Geass. Ironically, this song is only used one single time throughout the entire series, which is at this scene.

As such, it is immensely memorable because we as viewers will always associate this song with this scene.

> And in the scene where Lelouch gave Suzaku Zeros helmet, Lelouch talked about granting Geass to people everywhere, and CC said the consequences of that would be huge. Then she cried. What was this all about?

Lelouch compares the power of Geass to a wish, because in essense, geass do grant wishes in a way.
C.C. can do nothing but pray for Lelouch's redemption through his death, as the price that he must pay for using the power of kings is his life. She cries because Lelouch will be gone, and she obviously likes him.

> What did Jeremiah do to Anya? De-Geass her so she could have her memories back? Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

Charles geassed Anya because she was a witness to Marianne's murder. That's why she kept making diary entries because she is confused about her own past. Jeremiah realized that she had fucked up memories so he de-geassed her and in turn I guess Anya became so happy that she decided living together with Jeremiah on an orange farm would be the best life ever. :3

> And were to believe that Lelouch is still alive somewhere, Cs World maybe? Yes? The way it ended with CC made it seem like that since she said him living a life of solitude isnt quite correct. The two of them can still communicate so theyll never be alone.

I'm pretty sure Lelouch is dead. And I'm pretty sure that C.C. was talking to herself this time. The power of kings has but 2 possible endings: Either die in solitude or live forever in solitude. Lelouch did not die in solitude, as he died fulfilled. He did love and he was loved by at least his closest people at the end. At least that is my interpretation of this whole thing.

I'd like to imagine Lelouch is somehow magically in C's World after death and just chilling there with other deceased Geass users (although Mao would be an annoying ass cunt)

Edit:

I liked WORLD END more than COLORS.

I wish that could be my life. So simple, so wonderful.

> The power of kings has but 2 possible endings: Either die in solitude or live forever in solitude.

That's why I thought maybe he could be alive, because she said that maybe she was wrong. There was the option of them being together. They're still alone, but have each other.

> I liked WORLD END more than COLORS.

Join the club! I thought both were great, but World End just fit the mood a tiny bit more near the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE

I won't accept any official **"Btw guys he was totally alive!!! Now give us more of your money"** ending. For me he's dead and that makes the ending so great!

That doesn't mean I won't accept any delicious non-canonical LelouchxC.C. vanilla doujins though. :3

I'll point out some great fan art for LelouchxC.C. in tomorrows overall discussion too so look forward to that.

I love that interpretation :3

> What did Jeremiah do to Anya? De-Geass her so she could have her memories back? Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

Charles said he Geassed her at the same time as Nunnally to remove her memories of seeing Marianne's death and getting Geassed by Marianne. After that, whenever Marianne came out and took control, she blanked out and lost her memories of what happened. She also mentioned the memories she does have not lining up with her diary, suggesting that Charles Geassed her again subsequently (possibly every time she had a pretty rainbow lights incident and nearly found out about Marianne).

So Jeremiah's Geass canceller removed both Charles's Geass and the aftereffects of Marianne's Geass from her, and restored her true memories.
>> ARTICLE
> It was luck that Lelouch got Geass and tried overthrowing Britannia. If he didnt, there wouldve been no one to stop Charles.

Maybe this is just because it's wandering into weird mysticism territory, but how do we know that Charles would have succeeded? Maybe God just would have been like "heh, that tickles" or changed their mind about the whole consciousness meld thing.

> There was never a chance for Nunnally and Lelouch to live long happy lives together, and thats what saddens me the most.

You mean keep what they had at the beginning of the series? And if Charles succeeded they would have been together forever! /s

Really though, I would have much rather enjoyed a slice of life at Ashford Academy.

> Still a little confused as to how she lost her memories just because Marianne was lying dormant in her mind.

She probably wouldn't remember anything from when Marianne's consciousness took over.

> And were to believe that Lelouch is still alive somewhere, Cs World maybe? Yes? The way it ended with CC made it seem like that since she said him living a life of solitude isnt quite correct. The two of them can still communicate so theyll never be alone.

That's what I got from it, though obviously others disagree.
>> ARTICLE
> "heh, that tickles"

LOL I don't know that they would've changed their minds about the mind melding thing. They were pretty gung ho about that. I suppose it wouldn't have worked, but it's not like anyone would rather have let them try than attempt to stop them.

> Really though, I would have much rather enjoyed a slice of life at Ashford Academy.

Would love to see it as well. Lelouch still has Geass, and he uses it on teachers to get good grades. Suzaku doesn't like his way of doing things. He thinks Lelouch should just study like everyone else. Suzaku invites Lelouch over his house under false pretenses. He's going to make him study. Lelouch realizes this and gives Suzaku the order "cheat!" How will Suzaku deal with being a cheater?

> That's what I got from it, though obviously others disagree.

The ending was a little confusing, but reading everything in this thread has helped. It's been interesting to see everyone's views on it, and I'm glad everyone has been rather civil about disagreeing.

Greatest protagonist of all time has the greatest ending of all time in anime. What a great series guys. 

I'd like to say that this series is always a fun ride and I think Lelouch is an amazing character. People often like to say that Lelouch is a villainous, selfish teenage boy with a messiah complex, but I disagree. I believe that by the end of the show it's obvious that Lelouch's intentions were completely pure and selfless, and actually, they almost always were. As the show transitioned, Lelouch's battle extended from one of Nunnally/vengeance, to the Black Knights, to Ashford Academy, and finally to the world. And that's what makes him the hero he is at the end of the series.

There's a reason Lelouch is the best guy of r/anime, #1 at MAL. His intellect is insane and he's willing to stain his hands with blood, take the blame, and take all the hatred from the entire world, to save it in the end. 

Long live Lelouch. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, The directing in this show was excellent. Not writing, but mostly directing. It was pretty cool rewatching this with you great peeps.

I wonder if people here who didnt really liked the show will like Akito OVAs. From my experience a lot of people that didnt liked the originals seems to like Akito the Exiled.
>> ARTICLE
Goro Taniguchi is an awesome director. Check out Planetes if you haven't already done that.

It is a good question. I might be weird for liking the original show and also appreciating Akito as a very different yet nevertheless related product.

The third episode is only out in Japanese theaters right now, but it should be available for viewing on June 26th (BD/DVD release date). Not that long of a wait for those who are new to the series.

>> ARTICLE
Debates on whether or not he's alive at the end... My view on the matter is that Lelouche is dead. That is not to say necessarily physically/biologically dead, but as who he is, his identity. Regardless of if he is biologically alive or not, to those left behind he is dead. The world sees him as dead. But more importantly, all those that he holds dear and all those that held him believe he is dead. Regardless of whether or not he is physically alive does not matter.

The effect this has on everyone, especially those that loved him, is there and permanent. The student council will always be down another member. Rivalz will never be able to drive around his gambling buddy again. The prez will never be able to tease him again. Kalen will never be tsun tsun with him again. Nunnaly will never have a brother again. The drama of his death is real and will never change, regardless of if he is biologically alive or not. In fact, it would be devastating if that is ever undone and result in a tragedy. It would completely undo his life and the sacrifices made along the way.

Lelouche lived his life to its fullest, accomplishing all of his goals, content with the world, and dying with those that he cared about the most by his side. He died about as peacefully as someone stabbed through the chest with a giant sword in front of a screaming crowd can be. Lets be honest here, he's never going to top being the emperor of the world, ruling with fear and absolute obedience. Wouldn't we all want to go when we're ready, with our loved ones next to us, and having accomplished all we want in life? We all gotta go sometime, that is as good as any.

The concept of reincarnation exists in Japanese cultural history (I have no idea where more modern views on it lie). If he biologically survived that then he was effectively reincarnated as a nobody that happens to look like and have the same personality as the most hated person in humanity's history. He would travel the world for all eternity content with CC. Personally I prefer he was actually dead so that he would reincarnate as a cat and follow Suzaku around and give some happiness to Nunnaly's now brotherless life.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched this show I think 4 times now, and I gotta say, how everyone felt about the stuff leading up the end was very different than my first time. Granted, Code Geass was one of the first 20(?) anime that I'd seen and I was therefore a bit more casual in watching it, but I was kinda oblivious to his plan. 

I actually started hating Lelouch (sorry) around episode 22 on until my mind was fucking blown by the Zero Requiem. Seems like every single person here called it, and in hind sight, I wonder why I didn't at least a little. I mean, Lelouch even said, "So we had the same plan huh?" when Nunally said the Damocles will become a symbol of hatred. 

Either way, I'm so glad everyone here seemed to enjoy one of my favorite animes of all time :D

Lelouch's plan was not supposed to be world peace / everyone lives happily after ever. He simply created a more fair world, where anyone would be able to strive for happiness and a future of their own making. Compare to the history of the world during the 20th Century - all the world came together against Hitler, and when he was defeated there was no world peace, but after 50 million dead, people and nations did realize that there were better ways to do things and the United Nations thrived. 

In the Code Geass world, at the end, an even stronger system for generalized peace was born as a result of Zero's and Lelouch's actions. Britannia is ruled by Nunally in a monarchy that is probably much more tame than what it was before, with Schneizel taking care of daily affairs, and with the aristocracy severely restricted and the colonies free ; the country is now part of the UFN which allows no national armies and uses the Black Knights under Zero (Suzaku) as its standing military. Oh, and pretty much every country in the world is now part of the UFN. The situation is much more stable than either our own world or the CG world as it was before.

Our main character is about to take over the world, and I don't really care. Like I said, Nunnally is tired of Lelouch's shit and wants to put an end to all this.

Kallen and Suzaku giving us our ninth-generation Knightmare fight. How many times have the two of them fought with different upgrades on their mechs?

Oh Rivalz, just tell Milly you love her and get it over with. Anya and Jeremiah, eh? Not a fight I expected.

Didn't Nunnally say way back toward the beginning of the series that she was just happy living with Lelouch? Like, his entire conquest was never something she wanted.

Ah yeah, Xingke has to now either interfere and cause an upset right before dying or die right before he gets to some essential goal. Let's see which one it is.

> I expect it to be a proper Sunrise final mecha duel, with plenty of philosophical arguing alongside the battle to the death.

/u/EditorialComplex and /u/The-Sublimer-One nailed it. I don't watch enough mecha to know it's a thing.

Hah, Nunnally has the same idea as Lelouch about becoming a single target. Lelouch uses his Geass to forcefully take the key instead of just walking up and grabbing it from her; I'm pretty sure that's the most superfluous use of it in the series. And unfortunately my prediction about Lelouch giving a shit about his little sister's fate appears to be off as well.

Jeremiah's such a badass that his first mech got destroyed, he detonated the second stage, and he's still alive. Oooh, he might have known about Marianne's Geass, but what will the canceler do in this case? Marianne's consciousness left her to go into the Sword of Akasha, right?

Suzaku's not dead, Kaguya, I don't know what you're talking about.

Aaaand now Lelouch has taken over the world. That's it, time to close up shop.

After another two months to clean up... I'm not going to try to pick out the named characters he has tied up there. I don't like this new newscaster, I miss either Diethard or Milly.

I guess Lloyd, Ccile, and Nina counted as loose ends for Lelouch. Wouldn't want them coming up with some new technology to usurp his rule, right? The pudding incident remains undefined, alas.

Damn, I was afraid that was gi strung up there. Poor Villetta.

...Zero? I'm guessing that's Suzaku, just a hunch. CC's... praying, interesting. Ooooh, here's a thought. CC gave Suzaku Geass and it evolved to the point her took her Code as well. Now he truly must live. Or not.

Yep, with him running impossibly fast it's probably Suzaku... or maybe Sayoko after that leap? Funny how Jeremiah just encourages him onward. Wait, it's definitely Suzaku and this is the Zero Requiem reaching its peak with Lelouch's assassination.

[Yep, there's the reveal.](http://i.imgur.com/3sGtCLD.jpg) Conveniently phrased Geass on Schneizel then, making him explicitly obey *Zero*. It was apparent that Lelouch set himself up to die the moment he took the throne and became public enemy number one, I don't know why this is that much of a surprise to anyone.

Hah, the shot of Arthur at Suzaku's grave. Surprised he wasn't nibbling on the gravestone.

I guess Suzaku *kind of* got his wish to die? Kururugi is no more but he can keep being a champion of justice as Zero... who's now part of the system.

I don't get why Nunnally is suddenly forgiving of him. Having a better world now doesn't excuse everything he's done, and he was stupidly lucky that his plan actually *worked*.

Now he's left his sister all alone, denying her the only thing she wanted to begin with. And so, for that, one final time: fuck Lelouch.

At least everyone else gets their happy ending for now. [Nice wedding photo.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/codegeass/images/e/ee/Wedding_Group_Photo.JPG) A few things I noticed there:

* Kallen and Gino appear to be dating, or at least they're awfully close.
* Td does seem to be with I-can't-remember-her-name.
* Guilford's still sporting those sunglasses.
* Anya has Arthur on her head?

But... as CC said, human history is one of struggle. How long will this better world supposedly last? Until one nation decides they want to take a different direction and another war breaks out? Actually, why *won't* a war break out immediately after Lelouch dies? This is within a few months of the last massive bloody conflict and suddenly there's a vacuum after the evil dictator kicks the bucket, I fully expect that *some* country is going to make a power grab there.

This is getting worse the more I think about it. For as much as Lelouch liked to anticipate emotional reactions, his plan for the future seems to rely on them acting logically (i.e. working together) when he should know well that won't be the case. I'm not even happy that he's dead as he's just screwing the world over even more now. Forget this being a great ending, it makes no damn sense as even the main character didn't act like himself.

As you may expect by now I'm not really a fan, but I'll get into why (aside from the ending as I mentioned above) with my full thoughts on the season and series tomorrow. Also, my [prediction of doom](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34z86r/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqzi9w4?context=1) wasn't even remotely close: 

> Somehow (probably some ritual with the Sword of Akasha) Lelouch gains godlike powers and hits the reset button on the world, possibly retroactively erasing Geass from existence. Shirley's back alive, Nunnally isn't crippled, and everyone's happy.

I'll say I'm really glad that none of that happened, because if Lelouch managed to get a happy ending for himself I would have been mad. I dislike reset button endings in general because they usually undo a lot of character development and, in Lelouch's case, would have basically been his get out of jail free card.

Edit: my phone really does not like formatting things properly when posting.

You have to understand that when this show was first airing, people had no clue what the hell the Zero Requiem was, and everybody was against Lelouch, the same way you were, so no one thought he actually had a redemption in the works. They just thought he'd gone full evil. Similarly, when people watch it now, they speedrun it, because this show is just too absorbing to watch in increments unless you have a reason to (like we did). Even then, if you could predict him getting killed, anyway, hardly anyone realized the genius of the lie surrounding his death until later (as explained in my posts).

Also, thank God your bad ending didn't happen. That would have ruined this show forever and all time.
>> ARTICLE
That, and the fact that the ending had been set up since episode 1 of the first season.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I knew ahead of time, but even if I hadn't? I would have thought it would have been incredibly obvious from a purely narrative standpoint.

No way Lelouch was getting a good ending. Pretty much from Euphy's accidental Geassing and his murder of her, he'd crossed a line where having him get a happy ending would have felt *wrong*. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't disagree. I didn't find the ending all that unpredictable, but for me personally, the ending was set up very well and the message was very convincingly delivered.

I won't talk more about the ending because I'll address a lot of stuff in tomorrow's overall discussion.
>> ARTICLE
> Jeremiah's such a badass that his first mech got destroyed, he detonated the second stage, and he's still alive.

His loyalty came out of nowhere, and I just dgaf anymore. He's awesome. I'll have to read those bonus audio things to get his full story, and hopefully that will just reassure his awesomeness.

> The pudding incident remains undefined, alas.

Something kinky, perhaps? I do wish we got an answer on this though. I remember back in R1, it was either Lloyd or Cecile who said something like, "you're just using Suzaku as a replacement." I honestly can't remember if that was addressed or if this Lloyd/Rakshata thing at the end here has something to do with that.

> But... as CC said, human history is one of struggle. How long will this better world supposedly last? Until one nation decides they want to take a different direction and another war breaks out?

What would've worked better? The world has been a shit show for so long, and now in just a few months there's peace. It may not last forever, but it's things are looking up for everyone. It's not like Lelouch could've let Charles succeed in his crazy goal or let Schneizel blowup half of the planet. People may hate Lelouch, and he may have done some stupid things, but he won. His way ended up working.

Lloyd said that to Ccile, so I don't think it would be related to the pudding incident.

Off the top of my head: when he became emperor, he could have liberated Japan (give the core of the Black Knights what they wanted) and gone for an immediate ceasefire with the UFN. Try to turn the rest of the world against Schneizel who really only had their backing because Lelouch kidnapped all those world leaders. Granted, any goodwill he had with the Black Knights probably would have been lost by then and no one would trust him to actually do what he claimed.

I'm definitely intrigued to see your reasoning tomorrow.  It's always fun (maybe in a masochistic way) to see the reasoning why people dislike shows that I greatly enjoy.  I always find it nice to be able to look into contrasting opinions in order to get a window into how other people experience stuff especially when their experience greatly differs from mine.  

Thanks for all your contributions in these rewatch threads it's really cool to see first timers reactions like yours and experience the show with other people.

> This is within a few months of the last massive bloody conflict and suddenly there's a vacuum after the evil dictator kicks the bucket 

not strictly speaking while lelouch is dead, Britannia itself is far from gone the only colony it actually lost was area 11 aside from that its pretty much whole.

The succession should go down without to much of a problem, concidering Nunally is still alive and kicking along side with Cornelia who will support her claim to the Throne.

And most importand of all Schneizel is still alive and under absolut controll of Zero so thers no chance in hell he'l cause problems 

To add to that with Suzaku as head of the black kinghts (the only fighting force the UN has) thers no danger that the military will usurp the power. Cosidering that almost all countrys are part of the UN or part of Britannia, that will be reformed by  Nunally and will eventually also join the UN, I dont really see how a country could cause to be a major threat to the peace that Lelouch created.

I'd really aprechiate if youd give me your thoughts on my Point of View

It's very consistent with his resolution following Nunnally's rejection of him though. It was very clear he was fighting for humanity, progress, change. Charles wanted to force the world in on itself so  no thing could be recognized distinct from anything else. Many philosophies would argue this is already the case. Schneizel would keep the status quo and solve the worlds' issues with the Destiny Plan so humans had bigger issues than petty quarrels. Lelouch recognized humanity's flaws allowed them to also have strengths, so he would destroy the world and rebuild it as best he could before atoning for his sins. Some progress is hopefully made in humanity's evolution and the progression towards a better people.

He's blind after the explosion. In the scene with his princess in bed there is a cane leaned against the table next to them

>How long will this better world supposedly last?

Does it need a fixed end date? The fact that the world is better than before does not mean it is a planet without any room for problems or conflicts. 

For example, I can say that today's world is better than the World War II era, despite the fact there is still plenty of trouble to go around.

>Until one nation decides they want to take a different direction and another war breaks out?

Will that war be as large-scale as what we have just seen? Probably not. 

Will the new Zero and the UFN sit around doing nothing? Probably not.

>Actually, why won't a war break out immediately after Lelouch dies? 

Because most of the world, especially all the major powers, is already exhausted from the recent global conflict and it is in everyone's best interests to collaborate during the reconstruction phase. That will not last forever, indeed, but I think measurable progress can still persist.

>This is within a few months of the last massive bloody conflict and suddenly there's a vacuum after the evil dictator kicks the bucket, I fully expect that some country is going to make a power grab 

First, you would need a very strong and intact country with the ability to do such a thing. Power vacuums do need to be filled in the long run, that is a valid structural and historical concern, but the idea that any of the former superpowers would be in any position to start another war within months is not even realistic under real world conditions, let alone those of Code Geass Land.

Second, I will say that there is more than one potential future for this world. Any of us can certainly come up with both pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, by following the three great paradigms of international relations: Realism, Idealism and Constructivism. 

These schools of thought exist and are used to interpret real world politics in very different ways, as seen in many thousands of different articles and books, so it would only be appropriate to allow the Code Geass world more than one hypothetical outcome in our respective speculations. 

We should avoid the idea that there is only one "objective" crystal ball prediction and that those who do not agree with it are being illogical, because it does not remotely match the kind of serious discussions used to deal with far more pressing international affairs than the contents of this Japanese cartoon.  

>I'm not even happy that he's dead as he's just screwing the world over even more now. Forget this being a great ending, it makes no damn sense as even the main character didn't act like himself.

Both of those statements can be heavily debated. For better or for worse, I think Lelouch absolutely did act like himself.
>> ARTICLE
Let's be honest, if you didn't figure out it was Suzaku in the Zero costume after he dodged bullets for the umpteenth time, you haven't been watching this show properly.

Anywho, I'm going to say this. It's a cliche as hell ending. But by god, they stuck with it, they made it artistic as fuck, and the music makes it one of the most impressively done sequences in a long, long time.
>> ARTICLE

Warning! It is rather long. And also very gay. 

Now, I can't take any credit for it. Absolutely not. I merely thought some folks around here might appreciate this. 

My own personal thoughts on the matter are not entirely identical to those, mind you, but I recognize that this person put serious effort into the subject and gathered a lot of proof along the way. I think there is some degree of truth to several of the observations contained therein. 

>> ARTICLE
* Rivalz should've confessed to Milly when they were alone in that room. Man I was rooting for him but it's his fault

* lmao at Jeremiah and Anya being orange farmers

* I kinda wanted to know Rakshata and Lloyd's past even for just one panel

* I've said it on a past episode thread but Lelouch is my favorite MCs currently due to him playing as the bad guy for the greater good of humanity and he fulfilled his mission

* Kinda knew Suzaku was the new Zero once he started running and dodging bullet shots from the Knightmares

* I think Lelouch is alive in CC's consciousness. He's not the driver of the carriage but he's in the same position Marianne was once 

Overall, I enjoyed this series. TBH before this whole rewatch, I recently finished Code Geass. About 2 weeks after, I saw a rewatch being planned. I thought about it and gave it a shot and I still enjoyed it
>> ARTICLE
As someone who's watched this series 14 times (I kid you not, this is my favorite show. Period) all I'm gonna say is:

Lelouch is alive.
>> ARTICLE
Good man.
>> ARTICLE
Welp. Here it is. 

[No going back now.](http://i.imgur.com/hvb6C4f.png)

**Episode 25**

* This is the first time I've laid eyes on you in eight years...you're ugly as fuck
* They don't really look alike for brother and sister to be honest
* This is the part where Lelouch finds out they are not related and his entire world comes crumbling down
* Nunnally talks like someone who has *seen* some shit
* That's right, every true Siscon will tell you that you have to beat the VN without using cheats
* Who needs mech battles when you have ships to captain
* Those are either really big butterflies or they are close to the camera. I'm gonna go with big butterflies since that is more exciting.
* Everyone's got a death wish today
* "Perhaps war has been robbed of its dignity and morality" A couple dozen bullets into the back and Cornelia turns into Uncle Iroh
* Cute how they finish each other scentences from half the world away. *They're just so connected*
* We've yet to see Arthur join the battle, so it hasn't even begun yet
* [Insert 20 page rant about willpower]
* R.I.P Suzaku you would not be missed
* No ramp for disabled access? HR is on going to slam down on you for that
* Well the ending is pretty obvious now
* Well maybe not to those people who still don't know who Archer is
* ALL HAIL ~~LELOUCH!~~ CORNELIA! 
* Lelouch. Never mix your BDSM fetish with your Siscon side. Shit's fucked up.
* WHAT
* HAHAHAHAHAHA
* Ok, so welcome back Suzaku, you're the only person I know who can dodge bullets like that
* Anime confirmed
* Awful lot of people going "No don't kill the evil dictator who was about to execute me!"
* LELOUCHES ASSAINATION WAS AN INSIDE JOB
* HE WAS SMILING WHEN ZERO STABBED HIM
* STEEL SWORDS CAN'T CUT BRITANNIAN CLOTHES
* Well my predicition was spot on. Although felt confirmed episodes ago.
* My prediction/Joke right at the start was also kinda true as well
* Of course following the tradition of this show Lelouch isn't actually dead and will come back alive in season 3
* Turns out 'Zero' just punctured a stachet of tomato ketchup that Lelouch had in his pocket
* Nah just kidding, that wasn't Lelouch it was just someone wearing a Lelouch facemask
* Nah, I tell a lie. Actually Lelouch just geassed all the witnesses in to thinking the person Zero stabbed was Lelouch when instead it was some random joe
* No that's not true. What actually happened is RoboJere cancelled any geass currently on Lelouch. Lelouch then used a complicated system of mirrors to geass himself and command himself to "Live" making him immortal
* He could also be dead
* Everyone so happy. Babies being made, peeps being educated, Black Knights being alive ~~WHEN THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED~~, I mean yeah happy people woo!
* World peace is overrated
* C.C talking to nobody again. At least you had an excuse with Marianne, now you're just being 100% weird.
* The end.

Well that is it folks. The ending everyone was waiting for. 

I'm not sure I feel it was that amazing. It wasn't too poorly executed granted, I've just seen that particular writing trick done before, so I don't really get the first time 'shock' that I can imagine many other users got. 

I think most of you know my opinions on the show as a whole. I'll be talking about Lelouch a bit in tomorrows thread and also give a short response to the people who have taken the time to reply to me in regards to my criticisms. Turns out I was just ranting about this show so you could forget your differences and come together against a common enemy. 

You can also expect a few more words on the ending once I've had time to think it out overnight, though don't expect an essay. I expect to see more than a few people talking in that thread so If I find anything that interests me I might chip a word in.

I want to give a shoutout to peeps but that is going to be a fair amount of people so I'll make that a seperate comment. And lastly for those wondering, no I don't regret watching Code Geass, it was a trip to say the least!

**Episode 25: Re;**

- What a bizarre episode title. I had to make sure that this wasn't a corrupted file or a typo. That really is its name.      
- So Lelouch says he wanted to use Geass on Nunnally to cure her blindness. Could he have just... held her eyes open? Wouldn't that have worked? Nunnally on the other hand is rejecting him pretty hard.      
- If Lelouch wants to win, he needs to Geass Nunnally. The one line, after crossing ALL of the lines, I don't know if he can cross.      
- Gino's Tristan is busted, as the two aces face off. Now they've essentially switched sides; Suzaku with Lelouch and Kallen against him. And they're off!      
- Nunnally points out what we've been saying all along: She never asked for Lelouch to do any of this. Meanwhile, Suzaku and Kallen share in the traditional Sunrise mecha anime pasttime of arguing philosophy and motivations during the final battle.      
- Not just Kallen and Suzaku; everyone gets their chance to philosophize on the nature of war! Good old predictable Sunrise.      
- I don't like the music in this scene, it's way too low-key and odd for what should be a climactic moment. On the other hand, the mecha duel is pretty entertaining. Kallen and Suzaku are really taking each other's Knightmare apart.      
- Lelouch all but confirms in his thoughts that he's going for the Celestial Being route: Become a symbol of hatred and unite the world against him.      
- And with that motivation, he crosses that final line. Nunnally resists as Euphy did, but in the end Geass is absolute.      
- Man I'd forgotten (or maybe I just hadn't realized earlier) how absurdly skimpy Anya's pilot uniform was. That must give her a *bitch* of a wedgie. Jeremiah, on the other hand, is ready to undo Marianne's Geass! Go you, Orange.      
- Kallen and Suzaku are out of their superweapons and defenses, which means it's back to good ol' mecha fisticuffs. Some pretty nice choreography, too.     
- And in the end, the victor is... Kallen Kouzuki! Not going to question why her passing out means the Guren collapses. Suzaku, meanwhile, is trapped in an ejector-less Lancelot, and blows up. Guess not even his Geass could save him from that.      
- (Oh, like I really believe he's dead in this show.)      
- Lelouch has one final moment of honesty with Nunnally which she won't remember, and then puts his mask back on. Can't will away paralysis, Nunnally. The JP voice actress does a really good job of selling her desperation and despair in that scene, I thought. Nunnally's dub voice is a really weak point in an otherwise good dub, IMO.     
- And Lelouch wins. He really does make a good villain.       
- Literally everyone who was on his side of any note being transported for execution. *Dick move*, dude.      
- Aw, Arthur at Suzaku's grave. But why is it "Knight the Zero"? They even in Japanese say "of."      
- Slave girl Nunnally? Dude, that's fucked up. Siscon Lelouch confirmed.       
- Nina, Cecile, Sayoko, Rakshata, Lloyd and some other random guys are being held, not executed. Wonder why he's sparing them.       
- Now Cornelia, Villetta and the rest are the new *la resistance*! Go you, guys.      
- And there's... Zero! But Lelouch is over there! Who could it be.     
- I repeat, who could it be? It's not like there's a character he'd trust implicitly who just had an offscreen death, right?          
- A character who can, say, move fast enough to dodge machine gun fire?      
- And Lelouch is disarmed. Hey, Zero has Lelouch's fabulously hideous sword.      
- As expected, the new Zero is... Suzaku! And this was all part of the plan. Celestial Being gambit, indeed.      
- I have to say, the music in this scene is *stellar.*      
- In general, that was a really well-put together scene. Cutting back and forth from Suzaku and Lelouch's conversation with all of the various peoples' reactions. And that soundtrack choice was fantastic. And the Euphy candles plus Arthur at Suzaku's grave at the end. Aw. :(     
- Did Nunnally literally just see Lelouch's memories somehow? Or was that just a representation of her understanding?     
- Nunnally's JP actor again does a really great job with her grief here. Oh, Lelouch. All Nunnally wanted was a happy life with you.       
- Kallen (with hair up, not needing to pretend anymore) does her best slice-of-life opening with the slice of toast in her mouth! Aw, her mom's out of prison. ...for some reason.       
- Nunnally is the equivalent of Empress now? (Ending on \#100, naturally). And Ohgi is... some important dude.      
- Aw, that wedding picture is kind of cute. Wow, everyone's invited. Literally everyone left in the cast, it looks like.      
- Xing-Ke is missing, though. I'm assuming he keeled over after the end of the series?      
- hahaha seriously? Anya and Jeremiah are orange farmers? That's fucking hilarious.      
- And Damocles is literally shot into the sun.        
- CC, meanwhile, lives on. With Cheese-kun as her only companion.        
- ...so now the question is, is she talking to Lelouch metaphorically, or like she was Marianne?          

Overall, it's a really entertaining series. R1 is definitely a more solid season across the board, with R2 suffering from a few too many new characters and plotlines as well as not really having the time to flesh any of the new characters out. As likable as Jeremiah is by the end, that Heel-Face Turn comes out of *nowhere*. 

It's a really good ending. Not the orgasmic BEST ENDING EVER that some people say, and I certainly don't think that his death redeems Lelouch of all his sins, nor does it make him a good person. It also feels a little bit silly, kind of like the "AND THEN PEOPLE NEVER FOUGHT AGAIN EVER" end of Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz.  

I did, unfortunately, know going in that Lelouch dies at the end. I was in Livejournal fandom circles when this was airing, do you think there's any way I could *avoid* hearing about that? I'm not sure I wouldn't have been able to figure it out if I were unspoiled going in, though; I thought it was pretty obvious that with all the terrible shit Lelouch was doing, it wouldn't make any lick of narrative sense not to have him punished at the very end. There was no way Lelouch was surviving the series, period. 

I do however, remember very pointed heated debates that Lelouch could have lived and been the guy driving the cart, that's who CC is talking to at the end!!!! That's really dumb. Guy died, on screen, with a huge crowd around him and no chance to pull a gambit. Furthermore, the idea of Lelouch surviving would completely ruin that ending.     

Anyway, it was an enjoyable series. I still see why people say R2 is a bit of a trainwreck, you need to not think about things too closely, but it's fun even so, for the most part.

> In general, that was a really well-put together scene. Cutting back and forth from Suzaku and Lelouch's conversation with all of the various peoples' reactions.

I enjoyed Jeremiah's acting in that. "Oh no, Zero bested me and the emperor's dead! Everyone retreat!"

> Did Nunnally literally just see Lelouch's memories somehow? Or was that just a representation of her understanding?

According to the "Lelouch is alive" theory, it's implying that he has a Code now and did the memory-touchy thing like he did with CC at Narita.

> Xing-Ke is missing, though. I'm assuming he keeled over after the end of the series?

Complete red herring on whatever his illness was.

> It also feels a little bit silly, kind of like the "AND THEN PEOPLE NEVER FOUGHT AGAIN EVER" end of Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. 

Makes no sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
> So Lelouch says he wanted to use Geass on Nunnally to cure her blindness. Could he have just... held her eyes open? Wouldn't that have worked?

Theoretically yes, but practically that'd be kind of awkward.  "Here sit still while I pry your eyes open for the first time in 8 years all so I can use my magic on you!"

> If Lelouch wants to win, he needs to Geass Nunnally.

Let's be realistic while Lelouch isn't that strong I'm fairly certain he could physically overpower Nunnally to take the key from her without geass.  It'd be just as much of a dick move, but at least she'd still have her free will!

> Not just Kallen and Suzaku; everyone gets their chance to philosophize on the nature of war!

Hooray for everyone in the cast simultaneously finishing each others sentences and thinking grand ideas on war instead of thinking about the here and now!

> Man I'd forgotten (or maybe I just hadn't realized earlier) how absurdly skimpy Anya's pilot uniform was.

Kind of creepy when you consider that she's only 15...yikes get your heads out of the gutter CLAMP!

> Not going to question why her passing out means the Guren collapses.

Because the plot wanted (poor poor permanently in the friendzone) Gino to catch her!  Also, I'm more questioning why she passed out in the first place?  Is piloting a Knightmare really *that* strenuous an activity?  We've never seen anyone pass out from a tough Knightmare battle at any other point in the series.

> Nunnally's dub voice is a really weak point in an otherwise good dub, IMO.

Today was actually the first time I watched the final scene in English since the first time I watched the show and I just can't with Nunnally's VA.  This is such a critical scene for the show that they needed to nail 100% and her performance is just so flat and unconvincing.  When I listen to the Japanese version you can really hear the utter despair in her voice and her wails are just devastating.  It's such a shame because as you said it's a great dub, but it blew it in arguably the most important scene because Nunnally's VA couldn't pull her weight.

> Aw, her mom's out of prison. ...for some reason

Yeah I'm not sure why this is a thing either.  Lelouch dying doesn't change why she was sent to prison.  Using or owning refrain was illegal and she knew it so she got what she deserved.  But hey let's ignore drug laws because HAPPY ENDINGS!

> Aw, that wedding picture is kind of cute. Wow, everyone's invited. Literally everyone left in the cast, it looks like.

Zero and Nunnally got stiffed on the invite, which is kind of a dick move.  Schneizel too, but that's more understandable.  I guess Jeremiah's invite got lost in the mail...  I found it odd though that Gino and Anya were there despite I'm pretty sure never interacting on screen with either Ohgi or Viletta.

> Xing-Ke is missing, though. I'm assuming he keeled over after the end of the series?

One would hope, but even if he did that's really freaking dumb to kill him off screen.  I always look at him as an annoyingly unfired Chekov's Gun.

> ..so now the question is, is she talking to Lelouch metaphorically, or like she was Marianne?

Metaphorically.  Only reason she could talk to Marianne was because Marianne's particular brand of Geass.  There's nothing about Lelouch's power of absolute submission that would allow him to telepathically talk to CC.

> I certainly don't think that his death redeems Lelouch of all his sins, nor does it make him a good person.

Yeah I think hard core Lelouch fans want to deify him as some sort of messiah who died for our sins.  I think that shortchanges the character.  Lelouch is a really complicated guy who had a lot of conflicting goals and intentions (much like real people!) whether it be destroying Britannia or bringing about a more peaceful world for Nunnally (sort of mutually exclusive).  I think his final plan to basically steer into the skid and become the villain that he had halfway been all along in order to unite people in hatred was his best plan.  Also, in my opinion I think he truly meant what he said to Schneizel about true world peace being a myth and that really the best thing he could do was give people the best chance to succeed or fail on their own terms.  Lelouch had a lot of blood on his hands and knew that his continued existence in this world would only cause more bloodshed and sadness so he had himself offed, which at the end of the day at least he did the right thing even if he got there in the entirely wrong way.

> There was no way Lelouch was surviving the series, period.

Yes.  A million times yes.

> I still see why people say R2 is a bit of a trainwreck, you need to not think about things too closely, but it's fun even so, for the most part.

I think enjoyment of Code Geass (especially R2) is really predicated upon how much you're willing to suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride.

One thing people often forget is that he made this plan thinking that Nunnally had just past away. With the person who he had based his life around for the past 8 years dead we know he was suicidal and only seemed to snap out of it to stop the emperor. I think the whole world peace thing was just a hope, a desired side effect of his plot to commit suicide as well as his justification.

The scene simply tells us she has recovered to a degree. But we  should not be assuming that an independent Japan would always keep the same drug laws on the books, especially when a sizable portion of its population has suffered from Refrain.  It's not like Kallen's mom wasn't still bed-ridden either. 

>I think enjoyment of Code Geass (especially R2) is really predicated upon how much you're willing to suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride.

Absolutely, it requires a large suspension of disbelief. Quite huge in fact. But I think you can still get some extra mileage out of the ride without necessarily refusing to think about anything at all. Just not the same sort of things that are the concerns of people who want more pragmatic, down-to-earth and realistic shows or who will scream at the screen whenever some very implausible events happen to occur.

>> ARTICLE
> There's nothing that says she didn't simply finish her sentence. Also, the world's geopolitics being overturned often has far-ranging effects on law and whatnot.

I imagine the reason she's out is because the new prime minister: Ohgi, pardoned her.  I will say that she definitely didn't finish her original sentence which was 20 years.  It's an incredibly minor detail, but I felt like nitpicking even though I love the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough
>> ARTICLE
>It also feels a little bit silly, kind of like the "AND THEN PEOPLE NEVER FOUGHT AGAIN EVER" end of Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. 

I never had such an impression at all, considering they make it clear that Suzaku will need to remain a Knight for Justice as Zero. There will be future conflicts and problems in the world of Code Geass sooner or later. Just within a more progressive and stable framework where peaceful negotiations are an option. It's a step forward, but not an everlasting paradise. 

>> ARTICLE
>Furthermore, the idea of Lelouch surviving would completely ruin that ending.

Think of it another way, who is Lelouch? Is it his body? Or is it his mind/spirit? Or both? Are they distinct? Are there even both? The problem of other minds strikes again!

I think it's clear that Emperor Lelouch the Tyrant died at the hands of Zero. He is dead, gone, no more, never to return. If the theories presented are to be believed however and the "code" was activated to turn him into R2, that being is distinct from Lelouch. He may or may not have his memories, but regardless of that, he can still travel the world having no former self, doing what good he can through code/geass. 

In a way, that theory provides more atonement than simple death. If R2 exists as an immortal warlock cursed to serve the world as Suzaku is cursed to champion human rights as Zero, I think they both get a fitting punishment.
>> ARTICLE
> I think it's clear that Emperor Lelouch the Tyrant died at the hands of Zero.

And Lelouch Lamperouge died when he became emperor. A man wears many masks and sheds them as necessary. If he survives, he's merely escaping any retribution at the hands of either humans or gods.

> He may or may not have his memories,

Why wouldn't he? CC very clearly retained her memories from before she had her Code.
>> ARTICLE
> I certainly don't think that his death redeems Lelouch of all his sins, nor does it make him a good person.

No?  Would you forfeit your life and have your name cursed for the rest of time, all for the sake of world peace?  And you're not even in charge of a worldwide empire.

Doesn't make sense if he is dead. CC solitude 'monologue...?' and whole Charles wanting to steal CC's Code i mean seems like the breadcrumbs are perfectly leading to Lelouch's being alive.  Or if he's dead he's dead and all that stuff was superfluous nonsense. I can see both sides to be honest. I just prefer the ending where CC doesn't have to live alone forever.

There were way too many ass pulls in this show.

Too many deus ex's and either inconsistent or nonsensical use of both characters and the powers they had. As well, basically no main characters died in random combat which removes all the tension from the scenes. 

I don't really mind Lelouch being alive, though I had simply assumed that he had traded for C.C's code at the end they could have made it way more clear that he took his father's code if that is what happened. And I don't like any of this nonsense about the code only triggering when you die and shit like that.

Also sucks to be Nunnanly, since she learned his entire plan and therefore if he is alive she knows it.

So this is my first time watching Code Geass, I have next to no expectations for this since I've kept myself out the loop. The one thing I do expect is pizza hut however. I've also heard this is pizza butt? God knows... 

I'll be sticking with the same format that I had for the FMA:B rewatch so if you're familiar with that then you know what to expect. If you aren't, basically it's a combination of bad jokes and tinfoil theories when appropriate

**Episode 1**

* Nice to see that Britain has since concurred the world in this timeline, as is its right!
* Huh, this is a mech anime. Did not realize that. 
* Why is it that these types of anime like to give themselves really ominous names for the mechs. "Nightmare frame" is not something I would want to stumble upon in the middle of the street.
* Uh oh, the main character is saying he will obliterate Britannia, that doesn't sound good for my nationalism. 
* This OP seems so upbeat for a series where I can expect a lot of deaths. 
* So many characters in the OP. There seemed to be a lot of focus on green haired girl so she must be important to the plot. 
* LeLouch for longest neck of the century.
* Not a massive fan of the dub so far. Think I will be switching to sub after this episode.
* People have some pretty wild looking hair in the alternate future. I dig it. 
* That truck swerving off the road was quite comical. Maybe it's just the way the english VAs delivered their lines but it came out of nowhere and I love it.  
* OOOOOOOH I SAW THAT PIZZA HUT LOGO ON THE BRIDGE. YOU AIN'T GETTING PAST ME!
* The funny thing is there is practically no Pizza huts left where I live so the fact that they still exist here makes me chuckle. 
* Filthy pests, surrender to the glorious might of the Britannian empire!
* [That's no poison gas!](https://wiseguyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/its-a-trap.jpg)
* Green haired girl happens to be part of some super secret project. Guess that my prediction in the OP was right.
* I get the feeling that this is actually how *some* Japanese people view Britain. Just randomly gunning down old people and children for no reason is rather cartoonishly evil.
* **She ded**
* **Jk lol**
* **She ded again**
* LeLouch must have been spending some serious time with the Dark Flame Master to talk like that
* **They all ded**
* ED is also quite upbeat, disregarding all the dead bodies we saw right before it.

So that was fun. It was mostly set up for the main plotline so I can't really give any strong impressions yet. The premise seems alright, mind control is quite a nice power to have and the mech aspects look like they could be amazing later on. Bit of a shame that Britain happens to be the bad guys, being British myself. Hopefully Lelouch dies in the second episode and the rest of the two seasons is just endless Britannia propaganda...

I wish...

What! The dub for Geass is probably the best anime dub outside of Cowboy Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo has a bone to pick with that one. 

Code Geass is hit or miss for me. The main characters are about even, but the supporting characters I have strong opinions about. Lloyd's japanese voice is awful, for example. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally just think it overshadows the Japanese version because you aren't subjected to Engrish all the time.

In CG or in Samurai Champloo?

CG. Hell, they have enough trouble saying Lelouch. Okay, maybe "all the time" is a bit much, but every foreign word and name. For example, Charles Di Britannia comes out as (and this is generous) Shararu Ji Buritania.

It isn't Charles Zi Britannia?

Only because Johnny Yong Bosch is the man.

I personally loved Yuri Lowenthal's Suzaku voice (aka his regular voice) more but maybe that's from playing so much Persona 4.

His Sasuke voice, yea no complaints from me either.

You mean you aren't in love with Johnny Yong Bosch's creepy raper Adachi voice in Persona 4?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even know he was Adachi. Christ, was every anime voice actor in that game?!
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much, the Japanese version too given that it features the Elric brothers as Rise and Naoto I am pretty sure. Also Johnny Yong Bosch is the voice of the protagonist in P4 that grunts all the persona names, which is really super weird because in the anime adaptation he voices both the protagonist and Adachi...

Haha I rewatched Code Geass a couple of weeks ago and the first thing that struck me watching the first episode was [the dark flame master pose](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/075/8/1/dark_flame_master__togashi_yuuta__by_redrumratscap-d7agx29.png) must have come from [Lelouch](http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/full/public/lelouch_handmask_2.jpg?itok=dcM8u6wO&mtime=1423025175)

That was my first thought when I started to watch Chuunibyou. They also happen to have the [same voice actor](http://myanimelist.net/people/86/Jun_Fukuyama) in the japanese dub.

I watched Code Geass before Chuunibyou

lol'd and cringed when Dark Flame Master introduced himself to the class

Saw code Geass first too. First time they showed the Dark flame master I figured they were going for a parody of lelouch. After a few episodes I started to realized the voices were familiar. Looked up the Va for both of them and fucking died.


>> ARTICLE
> LeLouch must have been spending some serious time with the Dark Flame Master to talk like that

Haha, they have the same voice actor in Japanese, actually.
>> ARTICLE
> Nice to see that Britain has since concurred the world in this timeline, as is its right!

The anime never really goes in depth about the alternate history, keeping it mostly as background fluff, but it is all very interesting. Spoilering it anyway just in case.

[Major differences in this timeline: ](/s "Julius Caesar's invasion of Britannia is met with strong resistance. The Celts elect a supreme leader, King Eowyn, who succesfully drives the Romans out. All later attempts by the Roman Empire to conquer the British Isles are thwarted by Eowyn's line.")  
[](/s "Fast forward a bit - the Tudor line does not end with Elizabeth  I, instead she has a son, who follows her unto the throne, his father is unknown. Benjamin Franklin betrays the revolutionaries and the Continental Army is dealt a decisive defeat at Yorktown. Most European monarchies are overthrown - with the exception of Britain, which remains an absolute monarchy - and form the European Union. French revolutionary Napoleon Bonaparte succesfully wins the Battle of Trafalgar and conquers the British Isles for the EU. The Royal Family flees to the Colonies.")  
[](/s "The Tudor line ends with Elizabeth III, who names her lover Sir Ricardo von Britannia as her successor in her will. Ricardo retools the American Colonies as the new Holy Britannian Empire, establishing a new calender "Ascension Throne Britannia" [a.t.b.], using King Eowyn's ascension as the base. Napoleon is assassinated and dies through poison. The Holy Britannian Empire goes on to conquer the entirety of the Americas, becoming the foremost World Power in the process.")  
[](/s "Some time later, the Indochinese Peninsula is conquered by Britannia and named Area 10, a move which causes the previously neutral Japan to closer align itself with the Chinese Federation and the EU - which, as the producer of 70% of the world's natural superconducter Sakuradite put strong economic and political pressure on the Empire. 2010 a.t.b, the Holy Britannian Empire invades Japan, and that's where our story starts.")

To sum it all up, the Holy Britannian Empire is neither Holy, nor British, but it is an Empire.

...Also, I know *far too much* about the world of Code Geass.

>I've also heard this is pizza butt?

[Pizza hut makes pizza butt.](http://i.imgur.com/0FXxMxq.jpg)

The new OVAs retcon the EUs back story. Now Napoleon was arrested and executed in 1799 and it were the French Republic that conquered Europe and established the EU.

Also itbis likely the bit about King Eowyn is Britannian propaganda. After all, there is still a bunch of Arthurian symbolism that Britannia uses, and the name Britannia is the Roman one.

Eh, there was only one year between both shows, Code Geass ended up being the better show because even though the second half is rushed it's still very high quality and fun.

I'm concerned, you guys. As I watched this episode I became very gradually aware of an unusually profound and instinctual craving for pizza. Specifically, Pizza Hut^ 

Does anyone know what could have brought about the uncanny specificity of my bodily functions? It felt induced, yet natural. I've never had a physiological urge prefer a certain brand over another before and I was a little scared. Thanks to their "30 minutes or less" policy, I didn't have to wait long before I could seek refuge in the culinary bliss that is their New Primo Meat Pizza, topped with tons of premium salami, pepperoni, italian sausage, and seasoned pork all on their premium crushed tomato sauce. It was an experience, to say the least. If you guys want some, you'd better get in on it, because it's only available for a limited time. Here's a link just in case you're interested, https://order.pizzahut.com/site/menu/pizza

^(Tongue firmlyin cheek for this post.)

I haven't seen Code Geass before but have heard great things about it. Looking forward to adding it to my list of quality romcoms.Side note: I've already heard that [MAJOR END OF SERIES SPOILER... I THINK](/s "spoiler removed but it's probably the big one") so I'm expecting a lighthearted slice of life to entertain me here.

That said, let's get toit! Britannia is obviously the tsundere here, declaring war on Japan even though she clearly likes him.Even into a bit of roleplaying, calling him "Area 11" and all that.

JIBUN WO-- \*cough\* excuse me, had to clear my throat. Those are some neat school uniforms in the OP, they must go to a nice academy. I wonder if this'll turn out to be a harem? The purple-eyed guylooks like he'll be the winner if so.

LeLe, eh? Cute nickname. And he's into chess too! Clearly best girl already. And then some boring stuff happens with a Governor-General or something, I wasn't paying much attention tohim. I did like the other guy's cloak though, very fancy. He must go to the prep school on the other side of the city.

Aww, LeLe goes to help the truck! Maybe he'll meet a nice girl this way, I hope they're okay. Dunno why he climbed in the back, maybe he wanted to surprise them? Oh hey, it's a *mecha* romcom, don't think I've seen one of those since Evangelion.Good to see the genre expand.

Blue-haired guy is her abusive ex, I'm guessing. No wonder she wanted to get away from him. Suzaku, eh? There's the childhood friend that never wins in the end. And the green-haired girl from the OP! Looks like she's into BDSMtoo.

See what I mean? Not even five minutes later and childhood friend loses. Whoops, caused a genocide with the flip of a switch. And there goes BDSM girl!That's a funky contact lens he got from all that, very trippy. Should make it easy for LeLe to win over whoever he wants to at least.

Good start, lots of funny moments. Looking forward to meeting the other girls!

[Code Geass is a show about terrorism.](http://i.imgur.com/Co0jHak.jpg) It of course takes itself serious when it needs to, but it is a very self-aware show that isn't above making fun of itself or its characters. If you're not having fun when you're watching Code Geass, you're doing it wrong.

I'm glad the fanbase has a sense of humor, then. Expect it to get weirder tomorrow.

Exactly.

 I liked Code Geass a lot more on my second watch (which was years after the first and I'd somehow forgotten most of the plot twists), because I embraced the over-the-top campiness of it all and enjoyed it for what it *was* rather than what I *wanted* it to be and just let myself enjoy the wild ride.
>> ARTICLE
The 2nd time you watch Code Geass is SO much better than the first time...because you can just sit back and enjoy...and you can pick up the stuff you missed on your first watch.

I decided to join in, but like some others, this will be my first time watching *Code Geass*. The first episode was pretty intense, oh my! Some of the characters seem a bit over-the-top, though. Hopefully, not every episode will include some form of, "YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME, YOU AREA 11 MONKEY SAVAGE?!?!?!" complete with maniacal laughing, etc. 

Then again, it is only the first episode. As a premise, I think the show will be pretty good. I can't wait to see what happens next.

Be careful, this show is highly addictive, so watch carefully.

I'm definitely going to try to maintain the one episode per day "rule". I've binged on 6 series {granted, they were each 1 season with a few OVA's} since last week when I got into watching anime.

Well, we are going to go by 2 episodes per day after episode 10, with the last 3 episodes for both seasons being watched in one day.

Yeeeeeeah, about that... It's not that bad most of the time, but Code Geass is a hammy, fabulous and campy show. It'd be better if you learnt to embrace it, otherwise the only thing to do is close your eyes and think of ~~England~~ Britannia.

First time watcher here! Have no idea what the show is about, but since it has some hype might as well watch along with you guys!

So, the episode started with Britannia as a major world power conquering over the peaceful nation of Japan. Who would guess that the British Empire is alive and well... the whole of Europe must be under their command (unless Germany is a peaceful world power fighting against the British! that would be interesting!). Kinda wanted to see this plot further developed, but so far its only backdrop to define the MC drive after seeing his life wrecked as a kid with his best buddy, who vowels to fight for Japan.

The story jumps to the future, where for an instant it turns into a SOL of sorts. The MC (sorry I suck recalling names) is clearly a deviant genius, with his goofy sidekick along to put him back on track. 

Now things start to get interesting! Some rebellion movement pro Japan steals something from the empire and the MC gets involved in this mess - yeah there was some political plotting going on before, but so far it's kinda boring. Our MC decides to help (mostly to fuel his ego it seems), and lo and behold, now he is along for the ride with the "terrorists"!

Did I see that right? This is also a mecha show?! Me likes it!!! Both the terrorists and the empire fight using mechas, but the empire has the upper hand and manages to thwart their plot... 

Meanwhile the MC manages to escape unharmed, and almost gets killed... by no one other than his childhood friend, who did a 180 and pledge to serve the empire! But who would know, the thing that the terrorists stole (supposedly poison) opens up and reveals a green haired girl with contact lenses that resemble something from Naruto! 

Sure enough the rest of the empire showed up and killed the MC's former best friend after he refused to kill the MC... I would be devastated to see a long lost friend dying to save me, but the MC is not a weak dude. The empire wants to finish the job and fires at the MC, who is saved (again!) by the green haired girl. She, on her death bed, makes a deal with the MC giving him special powers - some whacky shit shows up that looks like aliens (humanoid through) transferring power to the MC.

Now he's not only a genius, he also has mind bending powers and orders the empire soldiers to kill themselves. The episode ends with blood. lots of blood.

So far it looks promising. It has mechas (NGE says hi), a decent plot building up, some SOL going on, a world conflict of some epic proportions, and an MC that likes blood. Will try to stick with the schedule for sure!

Brittannia is not Great Britain btw, is mre like USA than anything else tbh
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if that makes sense. One of the premises of the show is that the American Revolution failed, and what was left of Britain fled to their colonies after a disastrous war in the EU.

Sure, geographically it's the USA, but the USA never even existed in this timeline. It's basically Great Britain, just operating out of a different location. And, you know, evil.

The Conflict between Europe and the Britannian Empire is further explained in the Akito the Exiled- OVAs which you can watch after Season 1 (but it would be better to watch it after you watched both Seasons) :)

I did a write up of the alternate history of Code Geass [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/31ny7p/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion/cq3f2z6) Most of it is never really relevant for the series - the important parts are that the American Revolution failed and that Napoleon drove the British Royal Family out of Europe. The Holy Britannian Empire at the start of the series is the Americas plus additional colonies.
>> ARTICLE
Essentially Code Geass is the the result of an alternate history in which the USA lost the american revolution.

[mmmm](/s "less the US losing the revolution and more Britain losing the Napolionic wars, but if you want to be technical the real turning point was the Romans failing to conquer England")

i started rewatching this a couple of days ago, and im at chapter 12 or so, so i'll stop and wait for y'all to catch up.
>> ARTICLE
or you could just re-rewatch along with them. let's consider for a moment

Cons:

* ~~You'd still be watching code geass~~

Pros:

* You'd still be watching code geass
>> ARTICLE
characters are built like Jack Skellington; why did I not remember this?
>> ARTICLE
Because clamp isnt relevant/doesnt exist anymore
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna go over some character analysis of the first episode because I find it fun. As an aside, I have seen this series once before like a year ago, but then again, this is a "REWATCH" thing so I guess that's normal. I watched the show dubbed last time, but will be watching the sub this time around so I get to see the differences between the two which is cool.


I will start with looking at what we saw of the MC, Lelouch. We saw some of his brilliance in the way he takes down what is assumed to be a formidable opponent in a game that resembles chess. As chess is often considered a very strategic mind game and Lelouch wins in "record time", we now understand that Lelouch is probably brilliant and strategically minded. This is also backed up by the school girls banter of "Lelou" saying he could do so well if only he applied himself. We also saw how Lelouch reacted to knowledge that a terrorist attack had killed many. Lelouch remarks how it is pointless to mourn for the dead. This may put him as a cold, calculating human at this point. However, this contrasts directly with the incident which occurs right after. After the escape truck crashes, he is the only person in a crowd of onlookers with enough compassion to go check on the drivers/passengers of the crashed vehicle. These two events cumulatively show that Lelouch understands that the past cannot be altered, but he is willing to step up and help people in need in the present. One final thing I would like to point out that Lelouch is a survivor. The entire second half of the episode when he is in danger he remains relatively calm given the circumstances and thinks with a clear head.


Another character that I think got a lot of insight this episode is Clovis. In our first encounter with Clovis, we see him giving a serious address concerning a terrorist attack that has occurred. It is revealed that he is doing so in the immediate vicinity of a party at which he is participating in. His ability to change his guise in a whim is actually pretty impressive and shows his adeptness at fooling his subjects. The other time that we see Clovis is when he orders the extermination of the Shinjuku Ghetto. He does this to cover up his own hide from the potential fallout of the rest of the Britannian Empire realizing what cargo had been stolen. Such a massacre of many innocent lives in such a brutal fashion is indicative of his malicious character.


I could do more, but I feel that this is the jist of what a first time watcher might come to. I don't want to get into any spoiler type stuff so I will leave it at that for today.
>> ARTICLE
Bro, unbe-fucking-lievable. I love reading these on these discussion threads. Pretty awesome job, hope to see more today on the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
You don't know how much you just made my day! I love doing these and will be sure to post more on the ensuing episodes!
>> ARTICLE
The second episode thread is up already! I'll be waiting, no matter how long it takes!
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher, I've heard a lot of different things about this anime from my friend saying it's one of her all-time favourites to others saying that the MC is basically the only thing that carries it to fame. Because of that I'm coming into this with zero idea what to expect!

* JIIIIBUN W-sorry. Couldn't help myself. I quite like the OP, it's more upbeat than I expected it to be. Same goes for the ED although tbh it seems a little meh. Prediction is the upbeaty-ness goes with future arcs.

* It's cool how the whole thing is set up with Britain as the superpower and Japan/Area 11 as the repressed nation. Admittedly Britain is a tad too comically nastily evil for me, but I can live with it. I like the scenario as well, near-future sci-fi is neat. Mechs seem cool as well, I'm curious to see just how OP they are in the future. Can't comment on the high-school theme yet, I'm guessing it'll stick around for future episodes. Hopefully it's not entirely used just for scenes for Lelouch to slowly grow a harem and nothing else... Riiiiight?

* The character seem interesting so far, but this episode was just for building up so I can't comment too much on anybody just yet. It seems to have a solid supporting cast ala FMA: B [Spoiler maybe](/s "and I'm guessing Suzaku somehow doesn't die/comes back... he seems to be too important to just die like that"), and Lelouch definitely seems like the kind of character I'm going to like. The ending [Spoiler](/s "with him using mind control to kill the soldiers") reminded me a LOT of Light, and that can only be a good thing.

Ultimately I'm not entirely sold on Code Geass yet, but I'm definitely intrigued to see where it goes from here.

First time watcher here.

I'm interested to see how this show pans out. We have an unique world that appears to be some sort of alternate history that was introduced without bogging the show down in exposition. Political intrigue seems to be a large part of the show with nationalism as a major theme. Lelouch gained "the power of the king" and the series seems to imply it will be used to rebel against the oppressive monarchy. I'm a big fan of this sort of irony so hopefully that motif will continue in a meaningful way.

The directing has been solid so far, with excellent use of tension that keeps the audience engaged but not frustrated. We got adequate information from the perspective switches to keep us interested and got just enough time on each character to get a basic understanding of the major players.

That being said, I'm a little worried about where this series is going thematically. The show seems to be trying to paint itself as "morally grey" which doesn't really work with mustache-twirlingly evil villains. Furthermore, Lelouch's only characterization so far has been about how "smart" he is. This wouldn't be a problem but the only reason we really know that at this point is from other characters saying it. Being good at chess does not make one smart and certainly is not enough for a compelling character.

I'm looking forward to watching with you guys and can't wait to see where this goes.

Stumbled upon this while I was at work so I thought I would give it a go. Didn't realize mecha would be in this anime so I'm excited about that
>> ARTICLE
I'm asking for a friend... Is there going to be any romance?
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no. There is romance, but the show is more about the world it's building and how Lelouch takes control of the whole country rather than doing it for the love of his life.
>> ARTICLE
I get the main focus arn't romance, but there must be a little. Lelouch, seems to be cought up in some harem. Or am i mistaken?
>> ARTICLE
Again, yes and no. There is romance, as I said, as well as his own harem, but like I said, at the end of the day the show isn't about that.

The reason why I'm being vague is because there is spoilers if I talk anymore about it. So to summarize:

***Yes.***

Man, it has been a *long* time since I watched this, the one and only time I did.  And I have to say, it takes me a little by surprise.  Specifically:

* Holy shit the production values.  I forgot how good this looked.  This could hold up as a new production today, and this is 9 years on.
* Britannia is a lot more cartoonishly evil than I remembered.  Just straight up hammy Nazis!
* Agghhh Kyon is evil too!

Tried something different for my 24th?, I think, re watch. Watching the sub. After being in love with CG and watching the dub so many times I really prefer the dub. I think the sub is good.

I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for this but I honestly feel like rewatching it is making it worse in my mind. I watched it subbed originally and so I decided to watch it dubbed this time and my god is the voice acting awful. I also feel like LeLouch is just a dunce now with his wish and all, but he did seem alright in the chess game scene. Pizza hut seems to be the only good character in the show though in my mind now. I will rewatch all of this but time has done this series no favors in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey, you're not alone in that respect. I watched the show dubbed when I firsted watched it because back then I only watched shows that were dubbed. Then I watched the subbed. After that, I tried to rewatched the show again in dubbed, but it's just hard to get through to it. You don't have to force yourself into watching it dubbed, just go how you feel like it.

[Here Goes.](/s "I've been meaning to share this with r/anime for a while. Last month I binge-watched Code Geass because how well this sub spoke of it and also due to the fact that Lelouche even won that best guy contest a few months ago. He even beat Light Yagami - the character most people seem to compare him with - easily, which was impressive, since Light is a cold hearted master strategist. I dive in with great expectations, wondering how clever this Lelouche guy might be. But to my surprise that wasn't the case. We are simply expected to assume he is clever because in the first episode we're shown how good he is at playing chess. Despite that, soon after obtaining the Geass, he should have died, if not for a convenient character showing up unexpectedly and saving the day. This happens a few more times throughout the show, which completely ruins his image of being a master of strategy - which he isn't, he is just a master of luck. If that wasn't enough to ruin the show it doesn't help how terrible the plot and remaining characters are. The dialogues are cringe worthy, the story and scenes fees all over the place at times and it doesn't seem relevant where it is heading (and the reason for that is very obvious in the end of the season). The only few characters that, for me, weren't downright laughable were Cornelia and that red-haired girl. Lelouche has mostly no idea of what the fuck he is doing. He is an arrogant conceited fool. the mere fact that there are several instances the guy faced certain death, but never died, killed the show for me. Midway through the season I was already calling him Lelouche, le Douche due to how much of a fuck-up the guy is. It's seriously pitiable. And then that plot twist near the end kicks in and we see the princess pick up a machine gun and start killing Japanese people! I immediately burst out laughing. Mostly because how fucking annoying her character is and seeing her become unwillingly incredibly relevant for the season finale was just hilarious. This was certainly the most disappointing recommendation I've ever gotten from /r/anime, and I just needed to let it all out. Now just try not to kill me, please!")

For any first time watchers who didn't catch it immediately:

Lelouch aptly named the terrorists he took under his wings after chess pieces, with Kallen being (of course) Q-1 and pretty much everyone else a P.

And immediately in this episode we have our two contrasting male characters pitted against each other, albeit unbeknownst to the fact that it's the long lost best friend sitting in the opposing Knightmare.

I must say, after having watched quite a bit of anime for the past 10+ years (with most of them being adaptations for obvious reasons), this rewatch (which is probably my 6th or so) just made me realize how bloody good the pacing of this series is. There is just so little run time wasted, so much stuff is happening in just 20'ish minutes, it would take the One Piece anime at least 10 episodes to cover this much plot progression.

As always, I'm looking forward to the first-timers' comments and reactions.

Ain't that the truth. Considering everything that happens in all 50 episodes, it would have taken (to continue your example, One Piece) somewhere around 500-600 episodes. Just one reason Geass is my favorite of all time.

**Episode 2**

* Nice to see the Knightmare frames running on USB 3.0
* And I guess if he can't use his mind control shiz when the enemy is inside the mechs then he will need to get really good at using one himself in order to win
* Is there any sort of established 'rules' for his ability? Like he stopped using his ability right after he gave the command to the woman but she didn't snap back to reality until after he was gone, so is there like a time frame or something? 
* Does it vary based on the mental state of the person being targeted? Kind of like how magicians doing live performances will pick out people they think will be more susceptible to suggestion and trickery
* Hmm, looks like the main characters childhood friend is being given his own mech to use for the glory of Britannia. I wonder what directions this is going in... ^they ^surely ^won't ^fight ^later ^on ^^^**right?**
* People have the longest legs I've ever seen in this show
* MC has started playing chess in his mind, [yer kidding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mli5B9hkFwc)...
* So the mechs have a time limited usage? I remember that is something that was used in break blade, although it didn't really play a major role like I expected it to. 
* I can imagine that if Lelouch runs out of mech battery and he can't use his mind control power then he will be a regular old helpless student again...plot point spotted!
* Well it's not quite multi track drifitng but I can settle for train jumping
* With the star on that guys jacket I though Space Dandy was making a cameo
* Wait how did he know the contents of the train? How did he time all that as well? Did I miss something...
* He suspects the comm of being intercepted but doesn't mind giving a detailed battle plan over it. He's either insane or does not give a fuck about whether he is leading these people into a death trap
* Lelouch looks fucking scary when he is playing chess
* Reinhard really does not like losing to ~~Yang  Wenli~~ Lelouch
* Lelouch has an even scarier laugh. Reminds me of Izaya honestly, replacing a phone with human lives of course, 'cause that is how psycho Lelouch rolls
* [F/Z Spoilers](/s "Looks like they are sending in Berserker")
* I like how the characters said "Zero" fifty times in one scentence immeaditately after I made that reference. 
* So there is now seven generations of these Knightmare frames. Why do I get the feeling that we will be seeing a first generation version at some point.
* It's mech's...**but on wheels!**
* Seems like the terrorists forgot their absolute terror fields
* "Sometimes You Can't Live with Dying, Baby" R.I.P 
* Oh look. They're fighting. Not like ^I ^predicted ^^that ^^^or ^^^^anything...
* Don't worry Lelouch -[F/Z Spoilers](/s "You just have to wait for Lancelots master to die") and you'll win
* I don't care about the mind control, I just want those purple eyes, they're killer
* Wait Space Dandy is alive? "There's Always Tomorrow, Baby"
* ['MURICA, FUCK YEAH!](http://i.imgur.com/q9ywCRG.jpg) COMING TO SAVE THE MOTHERFUCKING DAY YEAH!
* Too much Onii-san in one cliffhanger

Well that episode was really fun. Enjoy the fountain of bad jokes I was able to pull from it. You're welcome /r/anime

Yes, but these are explained pretty well a little later in this season, so it's not worth spoiling.

> It's mech's...but on wheels!

I actually really like this design choice because whenever I watch a Mecha series and gigantic robots running around in cities, I imagine how much of a fucking bitch it must be to keep the paving in good health. Granted, even when sliding around, giant robots will probably damage a good portion of the paving but at least not as fast as stomping.

> Wait how did he know the contents of the train? How did he time all that as well? Did I miss something...

It was never explained. It is assumed that he stole a bunch of Knightmares by hypnotizing a bunch of soldiers and then have those load the mechs into the train.

> He suspects the comm of being intercepted but doesn't mind giving a detailed battle plan over it. He's either insane or does not give a fuck about whether he is leading these people into a death trap

The whole intercepted thing is just an excuse to not reveal that he is a Britannian i believe.

> So there is now seven generations of these Knightmare frames. Why do I get the feeling that we will be seeing a first generation version at some point.

We did see some older ones already. The Glasgow (the one Kallen was riding) is a 4th gen Knightmare while the Sutherland (the blue ones) is its 5th gen successor.
IIRC there will be a few instances where we'll see a 3rd gen Knightmare Frame, but nothing older than that.

Yeah. Initially, Code Geass' Mecha designs are actually pretty realistic. They're about four meters tall, have wheels for speed and agility, and actually can be justified as tank killers.
>> ARTICLE
and then [] (/s "as the series went on, technology advanced at lightspeed, and we have mechs so powerful and have so much utility you wonder how the pilots can possible pilot them so well")
>> ARTICLE
CG had the most ridiculous power creep, although I guess that's par for the course in mecha shows.

It's bad enough in the first season, I guess we have the Lancelot/Guren rekt'ing everything, then they start to fly after which we have flying everything, aircraft carriers and beam spam that kills entire air forces.

It really goes up to 11 in Season 2 though. I swear we get like 3 Mecha in a row (maybe even in straight episodes) that get the whole 'This robot is so crazy no human could ever pilot it!' schtick, each more OP than the last. It gets to the point where you really have to wonder why they even bother keeping anything except the 5 most OP mecha since Guren/Lancelot/Shinkiro/Etc basically destroy entire armies in a heartbeat.
>> ARTICLE
> It was never explained. It is assumed that he stole a bunch of Knightmares by hypnotizing a bunch of soldiers and then have those load the mechs into the train.

I always assumed that they were just a bunch of mechs being transported to their owners on the front line which he discovered when he gained access to their coms.
>> ARTICLE
I get that the dub isn't for everyone, but I personally enjoy the English dub for Code Geass. I admit I'm not the biggest fan of Kallen's voice, but my god do I love Johnny Yong Bosch, plus I also really love Lloyd and C2's voice (green haired girl). Code Geass is actually one of the 4 shows I watched dubbed over subbed (FMAB, Code Geass, Trigun, and Fate/Zero). I get that Code Geass' dub is debatable, but I guess I just love those three voices too much to care about any of the less than stellar voices (Mainly JYB, dat guy rocks).

Regardless, to each his own though, at least you were willing to try to dub instead of jumping straight into it subbed.
>> ARTICLE
Kallen's the reason I've never gotten beyond episode 3 of the dub. She's easily my favorite character besides Lelouch, and her VA being so poor just kills it for me.
>> ARTICLE
Lloyd has the best acting in English. Love that guy. Actor plays Dr. Tenma in *Monster* as well, which couldn't be more different from Lloyd - the actor has talent!
>> ARTICLE
I agree that the dub is better, Suzaku sounded much better in the dub and Lelouch's voice is magnificent, the only voice that really bugged me was Nunally's voice.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Nunally wasn't all that great, but I've found that young girls in general don't have the best dubs. It seems that many times they intentionally try to sound really young and that gives them a high pitched voice that just kinda sounds forced.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the dubs for younger characters are problematic, I may just not been used to it since the Evangelion dub did a good job with Rei and Asuka's voices.  Nunally's voice may have also just stood out for me in R2 when half the time it seemed like she was far too naive considering everything that had happened so far in the series.

You gotta add Bebop, Baccano, DBZ, and Golden Boy to the "must watch dubbed" list.

- The entire time, I thought the scientist guy was going to randomly butt in with, "GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!" 

- Oh, it's *knight*mare. Like chess. And everyone is just a pawn in Lelouch's scheme. Check him out.

- For a second there, I thought I was seeing Gundam Wing. Then again, I haven't seen much mecha anime.

- Both sides had a pretty nice balance of easy victories. I'm fully expecting some sort of battle of friendship to go down in a later episode between Lelouch and Suzaku.

[](/s "and I watched the series twice")

Damn, classic Lelouch. That groundmove was so typical of him, what a god.
>> ARTICLE
This was a Lelouch episode through and through with a dash of Suzaku mixed in.


As the episode starts ramping up, all we see is reference after reference to chess and holy balls is it annoying after a while. What with the random chess set on the ground in the middle of a mech battle, the pieces Lelouch is fondling like breasts the entire time, the chess speak Lelouch gave to each rebel (P-1, Q-1 etc.), to the way Lelouch orders everyone around like chess pieces and wins so easily like he did against the aristocrat in episode 1. Yeah. There was A LOT more instances of this chess motif going around (particularly with phrases used like "outmaneuvering") but I will spare you all the plethora of examples.


It is interesting to note however that at one point, Lelouch realizes how he needs to consider the "human factor" in real battles. This is something that he has not learned in his mastery of chess and explains how he was defeated so easily after the Lancelot showed up. As if to make up for the lost battle, he then goes and saves the area 11 citizens and the rebels by using his special power. He's a quick learner.


Although the episode was the Lelouch show, Suzaku did show up a little bit and there is some analysis to be made from his few appearances. For one, he is super durable and courageous. I mean the guy got shot and is then running a around and performing acrobatic stunts in a mech suit like ?hours? after. He's doing this with no safety escape mechanism either which is quite ballsy. This situation is all done to try and save Lelouch (ironic) as well as the green haired girl, indicating that he is a great friend who will do most anything for those he cares about. The final thing from this episode to take away is that the guy is really compassionate for human life. I mean, he goes out of his way to save one lady and her baby when he could have captured the leader of the rebels and ended the series right there. Fortunately for us, he didn't and now we have a crap ton of more episode to enjoy. FIN.

Awesome as ever, man. I quite like the chess motif that was implemented into the story, as I know many of said pieces so I would know how they work and everything. Suzaku is more like the knight in shining armor (kind of like his mech) so it's understandable as to how and why he acts that way. Anyways, see you tomorrow for you next analysis of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks again man. I do agree that Suzaku is like a knight in shining armor and it makes sense with the mech he uses. I never thought of that. Hey your pretty good at this!

Holy shit, Suzaku is a badass. Nigga blew up like forty mechs, then saved a baby falling out of a building. People on this sub seem to hate him though... Maybe he turns into a bastard later?

People hate Suzaku because of how ridiculously stubborn and idealistic he is. He's infuriating because eventually he's the main thing standing in Lelouch's way, yet Lelouch is still buddies with him and I'm gonna stop before I get into massive spoilers.

Just a quick tid-bit for anyone who didn't like how the dub sounded the first episode. It's moments like this, where Lelouch is totally taking charge and shouting orders to his crew, where I believe the English version totally shines over the Japanese version. The sheer intensity in JYB's voice and laugh is just so much more powerful to me than Lelouch's Japanese counterpart. (Or maybe that's just my Bosch fanboy showing through.)

Now, if only we didn't have to deal with Nunnally's English VA.

Nunnally is easily the worst part of the english dub.

Alright, last time we got introduced to our alternate history, some essential characters, and had some well-directed action. Let's see where the show takes us this week.

The general impression I got from this episode was "style over substance." This isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact it worked really well as a hook for the series. I already find myself engaged and wanting more even though very little was actually revealed.

The meat of this episode was in the direction. You often hear that in visual media it's important to "show and not tell." This episode is a fantastic example of that. Lelouch doesn't need to monologue for 5 minutes about every minute detail of his orders and how clever they are because we can see the implementation. We don't need to know how his plans work beforehand because the tactics are simple enough to be obvious visually. The terrorist group acts as an audience surrogate who only knows slightly less about Lelouch than we do. The simple quote from the Brittannian underling that "they may be tapping our communications," is enough to let all of us know where Lelouch is getting his information. Quick cuts and brief lines of dialogue keep the intensity even when things aren't exploding onscreen.

We have an extra layer of dramatic irony with Suzaku trying to save Lelouch (by fighting Lelouch). We also see that Brittanians can't be all bad if they have someone like Mr. Saving Crying Women from Falling Buildings on their side. The civilians are rightfully angry at the terrorist group and our villains seem a little less cartoonishly evil. I like the way this is going and hope we can continue to distance ourselves from some of the sadistic insanity of the first episode.

The chess motif is kind of interesting but I can see it getting a little old unless the writers get creative with it. That being said, I do find it pretty entertaining that in this case the enemy king was actually a prince. It was also a nice touch to see Lelouch realizing that not everything in his perfect little chess world always applies to real battle. Hopefully we'll see some fallibility eventually to keep the tension high.

Just when I was about to complain about a lack of motivation for Lelouch, we got a pretty juicy revelation. I'll hold out on talking about it until tomorrow when we know more. Overall it was a very solid episode. Having a high-tension eipsode right at the beginning of the series really helps draw the audience into the world but I'm not sure if they can keep up the momentum unless we start learning some actual plot points. Consider me invested. I'll be back with popcorn next time.

Man. This day. Stagecoach buses can go burn in hell.

Also half my kit has arrived, so I'm pretty happy about that. 

**Expectations:** Everyone has directed their hype for these episodes at me so this has got to be good. I'm hoping that hype translates to Britannia winning at last!

**Episode 21**

* JIBUN WOOOOO-
* Oh wait it's not Jibun Wo
* Thought you guys said these episodes were good
* Hooked on Refrain? Where can I get this 'Refrain'
* 10 x bonus points if I can't die from it
* Yes..that's it Space Dandy...let her remember her loyalty to Britannia
* Where the fuck is that disgraced captain person anyway? Thought he was rambling on about revenge but he has yet to go get it
* Good thing Nunnally is blind otherwise her innocence would have been ruined by how short that skirt is when miss.fiance is leaning over
* WHAT!?! SHE HAS THREE CHEESE-KUNS!?!
* Where does all the fat from those Pizzas go anyway
* With a mustache like that I would definitely go to Cafe Ashford
* And who runs a maid cafe with just a shitty yellow stand. Put the effort in at least
* A 12 meter Pizza? Is Pizza Hut sponsoring it?
* Come on already. I want Space Dandy to fully realize the difference between thinking with his head and thinking with his dick
* Chef Suzaku Ramsey
* That maid cafe should learn from the haunted house. That is how you spend money like a Britannian.
* There is a few people I wouldn't mind sticking in that Wac-a-mole game
* Fucking school festivals, always getting in the way of world domination!
* ANNNNNNNNNNNNND Crowd Control wants in on the Pizza. Is this disloyalty? Does she get negative Cheese-kuns?
* Your comments are getting a bit incestuous there mr.prince
* Nothing wrong with good Britannians keeping their perfect genes within the family (   )
* Oh there he is 
* RoboBartley by the looks of it
* Euphy looks like she is in the lamest street gang out there
* Kallen: Tells people to not just stand there while standing there
* WOOPs. There's another boob/grap fall. Yuri this time as well.
* Lelouch couldn't look more pissed off in the background. He's just like "Bitch this slate of metal weighs 2 tons, can you like, save the yuri until later!?!"
* Here's an idea. Drop the metal of that fucking piece of shit cat so we can finally be rid of him
* "She's my...my...sidechick"
* Oh now I get it. Lelouch is saving his Geass for Euphy to marry him- fulfilling this child self's dream
* "A fabulous waste of money!"
* [Loving the pose that Euphy is rockin'](http://i.imgur.com/K3iwI5U.png)
* I now have a new found respect for her showing up in shades with a no fucks given face basically saying "I CAN HURT YOUR FAMILY ANYTIME I WANT. DON'T FUCK WITH ME."
* "No attraction to the opposite sex" - OOOOOOH so the entire reason he has Suzaku piloting Lancelot is for *[dat ass](http://i.imgur.com/CdalLbF.png)*
* Gusts of wind. Mankind's greatest enemy.
* OH SHIT

* BLEACH MY EYES NOW!
* SCREW THAT! JUST GIVE ME A QUICK DEATH!
* ANTI-CHRIST KUN HAS SPAWNED DEMON WINGS, THE END OF TIMES IS UPON US, REPENT YOUR SINS TODAY BEFORE YOUR SOUL IS SOLD TO LUCIFER
* Crowd Control is up to something in the background
* Death by Pizza dough
* Damn her heart just broke into two
* No idea why she has a plate that small though
* Oh it just dawned on me that Lelouch would be stealing Suzaku's girl. This show isn't about a rebellion, it's about a man violating the bro code
* BITCH
* YOU BETTER NOT BE ANNOUNCING THAT YOU WILL MARRY AN ELEVEN
* YOU WANT TO STAIN THE ROYAL BLOOD WITH HIS FILTH?
* I DISOWN YOU
* ...
* I...
* It's...
* It's even worse...
* She wants to recognize Japan...
* To treat them as equals...
* Pack it up guys, this rewatch is over. I can't handle it anymore. This show is the worst piece of shit I've ever seen. I mean in what universe should the Japanese have human rights? In what universe should Britannia not own every living soul on the planet?
* I want the creators of this show to burn in a purging fire to cleanse them of their crime
* [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/323r5DI.png) Elevens get to call themselves equal to Britannians
* Viceroy gets me at least
* That is why she will always be best girl
* OH SHIT
* IS LELOUCH GOING TO USE HIS GEASS TO MAKE EUPHY DOUBLE BACK ON HER WORDS?!?
* YES FUCKING PLEASE. HAVE HER KILL ALL THE ELEVENS INSTEAD! TEACH HER THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS EQUALITY WHILE NON-BRITANNIANS STILL EXIST IN THIS WORLD

**Episode 22**

* Damn that episode made me write a lot
* Episode title: "Bloodstained Euphy" am I actually going to get what I want?!?
* Oh man they are all getting rounded up into one small area. The perfect place for a massacre.
* I couldn't want this episode to hurry up any more
* Yes, that's it Space Dandy, lead the Black Knights into the trap...join the dark side of the force
* And that folks, is what happens when you think with your dick

* 'Mr.Nobleman'. Perfect.
* AND THAT FACIAL HAIR!!!
* We found the new Basque Grand guys. This is it. I've waited 22 episodes for this moment.
* Good guy Leouch giving people work leave
* Apologize? Britannians aren't even taught the meaning of that word. Kneeling at anothers feet is a responsibility best left to eleven dogs
* PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BOMB THAT STADIUM
* (Once all Britannians have been evacuated of course)
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
* He wants to talk to her alone so he can use the Geass!!!!
* "You'll be doing the shooting" HHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNGGGGGG
* Awwww she's just going to turn her gun on Lelouch? boring.
* OOOOOOOOOOOH YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH

Phew, needed to take a moment to calm down there. That episode. It was a masterpiece on so many levels. Words can't describe the **euph**oria I am feeling right now. 

I hope that you can now all see the futility of supporting the black knights. Bow to your Britannian masters and Euphy will be sure to give you a quick death.

 *And now the rains weep o'er the stadium,*

---
You people are as bad as the Game of Thrones crowd about avoiding hyping upcoming episodes for newcomers. That said, let's do this.

Suzaku and Lelouch might be the two of the foremost fighters in the current conflict, but teacher don't care.

And the Japanese are understandably split about the whole thing with Zero supporting Britannia. Oh huh, I guess Refrain might actually work for Villetta in this case.

CC now has *three* Cheese-kuns that I can count. And someone's cosplaying as Lancelot. They're also making a 12-meter pizza.

Heh, Ogi can't get rid of Villetta. And Ogi was a teacher? Hm.. he talking about Lelouch or his brother for a dream?

Suzaku... dammit, why do you have to be so nice? Lelouch almost let something slip there, he shouldn't know that much about Kallen's current status. And of course neither of them know that Lelouch knows anything. You'd think that *someone* would have noticed that whenever the Black Knights and Suzaku are going at it Lelouch is nowhere to be found.

And most of the cast is at a school festival. Again, I'd be perfectly happy watching this instead of the whole war mecha thing, but I guess it's good to change things up. And of course Lelouch is trying to run both simultaneously.

Oh hey, soldiers with anti-Geass facemasks. Upgrades! And who's that in the ~~bacta~~ tank of unknown fluids?

Euphemia's at the festival too! I wonder what plans she submitted to Schneizel... could it be something about her and Suzaku getting married? Here comes an assassination attempt I bet. By ~~plot contrivance~~ sheer coincidence she runs into Nunnally too.

Here comes the giant pileup of people that shouldn't run into each other! I kinda want to make a diagram of the relations between everyone in that warehouse at that moment. Ogi's the only one Lelouch *hasn't* Geassed yet.

Aww Villetta! I didn't think I'd like her.

Milly has a point about festivals being essential for the people. [Shinsekai Yori major spoiler](/s "Except when that backfires horribly, leading to a large chunk of your town being wiped out.")

"Marianne the Flash" eh? I guess she was a fighter back in the day. Thanks Lloyd. He's a robosexual!

Cute moment with the royal siblings.. well crap I forgot Shirley knows Lelouch is Zero again. And now that Euphemia's cover is blown the entire festival's about to fall apart. [Including CC and her record-setting pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/vp6WmVg.png)

[Whaaaaaat?](http://i.imgur.com/uFhl78O.png) Diethard's building his own network, including *Nunnally's maid*. I guess he's behind the assassination attempt on Suzaku again, thus the potential need for an exit route for Kallen.

Euphemia's going big. A Specially Administered Zone? Nice, beating Zero to his own (stated) goal. [Nina is horrified, naturally.](http://i.imgur.com/ubImoQz.png) Aaaand I think we just lost Lelouch. I mean, I already didn't like him but I'm betting a moral event horizon moment's coming up soon.

Oooh oooh. End-of-episode prediction. Schneizel approved Euphemia's plan without telling Cornelia yet because the two of them are plotting to kill Euphemia and use that to turn the people against Zero. Like in my previous speculation but with less cheese (sorry CC).

---
...well maybe not. They might just gather up all the people that want to have self-rule and wipe them out. Still leaning toward the first option though.

Jeremiah's been out of the picture for a while, I'm kind of expecting him to come in as a pawn of Britannia again, albeit in more of a black ops position.

Yep, Nina's in shock. Kirihara seems to be benefiting from this of course. Oh, Villetta's unknowingly splitting up the Black Knights. Thanks, Ogi.

Shirley's understandably very, very confused by the whole Zero/Lelouch thing.

The rest of the world's watching! And there's Zero, making as much of a grand entrance as he can. Well shit, he's going to make Euphy shoot someone?

Suzaku can see CC now? Can she normally not be seen by people? I mean I theorized that a long while back but Nunnally was able to interact with her just fine... unless something related to Geass happened with Nunnally too. No, CC's interacted with a lot of people before, can't be something like that... I think.

Oh hell, does Suzaku have some form of Geass now too?

Yep, Lelouch is going to make Euphemia shoot him. Except there's *something* going on with CC. [The Geass sign,](http://i.imgur.com/MCQeAai.png) another flash of those Geass-bearing people, [Jupiter?](http://i.imgur.com/sf2Q8iN.png) [Queen](http://i.imgur.com/qov5nsf.png) [Marianne?](http://i.imgur.com/zzktlJC.png)

Oooh Euphemia's giving up everything just to ~~be with Suzaku~~ help Nunnally. They're both looking after her but quite different paths, the two of them.

Aaand just as Lelouch accepts Euphemia's solution, [fuck](http://i.imgur.com/ixRcboC.png) [everything.](http://i.imgur.com/b2Z2ayR.png) Just as CC warned a while ago... (Side note: I laterrealized that Euphemia resisted the Geass at first. Hm...)

Well, there goes Area 11. I didn't want to be right about that my guess at the beginning of the episode. [I really didn't.](http://i.imgur.com/KaVTXsG.png) Euphemia's now a pariah and will try to kill Suzaku on sight. Diethard got more than he wanted. Lelouch can't control his Geass. Somehow the [Emperor knows about Lelouch's power,](http://i.imgur.com/FCQO3d2.png) or at least that's what I'm guessing he's cackling about. And there's a genocide happening until Euphemia gets stopped.

---
In yesterday's thread someone said I'll have a difficult time *not* watching the next three episodes after this. I... no, just no.

#**MAN DOWN!** ***MAN DOWN!!!***

Yup, this episode was pretty traumatizing when I first watched it. What I love the show even more is that it's gonna go downhill from here for Lelouch, so since you hate Lelouch, things are about to get worse for him.

See ya at tomorrow's finale discussion, if you're man enough.
>> ARTICLE
One thing about this episode that I tend to notice a lot more on rewatch is that Lelouch's falling for Euphemia's offer is really sudden and hard to believe, acting against his own beliefs and interests, when the entire sequence has been hinting that he has little or no reason to give up and that the outcome of the meeting won't be a peaceful one for either of them. I'd almost call it a bait-and-switch in effect.
>> ARTICLE
Happy Cakeday!

>> ARTICLE
The reason he just deflated all his ambitions was because he saw Euphemia as the true savior of the people, and not his Zero who pretended to be that man. He wanted to believe in his first love, and he honestly wanted to help her achieve that goal even if it meant throwing away his revenge (because it achieves the same goal - A Kind World for Nunnally).
>> ARTICLE
Was waiting for your reaction. I feel for you, I really do. This is one of the few episodes that I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to rewatch. I mean, its sort of a yearly hobby, to rewatch Code at least once. But I've never had the heart to endure this torture again.

Book reader here who only began watching GoT from the middle of season 4 when the story began to deviate more and more from the books. It would be amusing to see how Lelouch would fare in Westeros, if he's born reasonably high in the nobility.

CC was surprised that Suzaku could see her because she was inside the Knightmare and shouldn't have been visible to anyone.  

She appeared to him like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ISNuE14.png) which is pretty much the same way Lelouch saw her when she was inside the truck and capsule in the first episode.

> Somehow the Emperor knows about Lelouch's power

That got my eyebrow raised too. Perhaps the entire reason Britannia rose to power was because of the Geass? either he or his ancestors used it and passed on the knowledge. 

Either way the final confrontation between the two is going to be huge.

> You people are as bad as the Game of Thrones crowd about avoiding hyping upcoming episodes for newcomers.

Yeah, the hinting/hype was pretty bad for this episode pair.  For what it's worth, even with all the comments yesterday, I didn't expect events to unfold *this* badly.

One of the only things I knew about Code Geass before this rewatch was that Lelouch would accidentally use his Geass to convince his sister to kill a large number (millions?) of Japanese, but I didn't think it would happen until Season 2.  Also, for some reason, I assumed it would be Nunnally doing the killing.  Whoops.

I'll take your word for it that the book-reading crowd for Game of Thrones is just as bad with the hints.  I can only call myself a "fellow crow" starting this season, since I read all the books after season 4.
>> ARTICLE
I'd consider that a bigger spoiler than the one I do know about the very end (won't even put it in spoiler tags to avoid tempting people).

If you're curious about the Game of Thrones crowd, I don't think anything will top the big happening in season 3. But keep an eye out for people hinting at [A Dance with Dragons](/s "events at the Wall at the end of the book") since that's one of the major things left.
>> ARTICLE
> Suzaku can see CC now? Can she normally not be seen by people? 

C.C. can be seen by normal people, she's not a phantom or something. Remember she was at the beginning of the series, and she paid the pizza delivery guy. She can be shadowy, but not more than anyone else who wants to blend into the background.

>> ARTICLE
Frankly I find the whole "trainwreck" thing to be an overstated and ultimately incorrect label, born out of some very vocal people throwing the term around during the airing, long before it was even over, because of their knee-jerk reactions to events without having nearly enough perspective in mind. 

Once the series ended, however, a certain amount of viewers started to look back and realized it wasn't quite like that. Of course, I will acknowledge the show is a rollercoaster and certainly has crazy parts. That much I think is absolutely true.

But even after rewatching the series multiple times, I think the train actually reached the station safely and in one piece. For me a "wreck" would be far less satisfactory, whereas I can easily defend -both personally and intellectually speaking- how things end up.

Ergo, the term "train wreck" means nothing to me other than a bunch of snap judgments based on little information and personal whims.

For the first season, at least, it was a constantly surprising and enjoyable train wreck, though.

Haven't actually watched those but CG is, among all the really highly rated anime that stood the test of time, certainly a pretty big trainwreck.

From my understanding, isn't it the second season where the trainwreck starts? I've watched all the way to the end of the season and it's intense but not bad at all. 
>> ARTICLE
Having watched episode 23 by now and going WTF a couple of times, I concur.
>> ARTICLE
The show quite transparently wants you to got "WTF" and that is no different...the question is whether or not you let immediate reactions determine and limit your opinions in a negative sense, even to the point of missing valid interpretations that help to straighten everything out, sooner or later.

Of course, I can't force you to think differently. And it's still possible to understand the show and yet not like the outcome. Just indicating that another way is possible and far more rewarding if it does work out for you.
>> ARTICLE
They can have a valid explanation for everything but that doesn't make the situations themselves any less ludicrous.
>> ARTICLE
Well, could you honestly argue the show doesn't know it's silly? I think everything indicates it knows and wants to be a spectacle. It is a production where being reasonable, much less realistic, is not the objective at all.

GOD DAMMIT ~~SUZAKU~~ LELOUCH
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 21**

I'm assuming [this](http://www.gfycat.com/ThankfulPitifulKoodoo) is literally the worst thing to happen in the series.

It looks like Jeremiah might play a part in these next few episodes. No idea what will happen when he comes face to face with Villetta. Unless he too has amnesia.

Seeing Lelouch and Suzaku hold up that giant panel is such a simple act of teamwork. I really wish they couldve been fighting on the same side because they make such a damn good duo.

I really hope Nunally lives through the entire series.

Euphemia for Nunally and me, your very existence has become a crime. Harsh. HARSH. Good lord was he pissed at the end of this episode. Just when I thought he found another family member he likes, Lelouch snaps.

**Episode 22**

Suzakus side is finally producing results. Hes beginning to change things from within with Euphemias help. Still, I dont think the two of them can actually accomplish anything permanent. Zeros side is still the way to go.

Hes reached that point. Is the Emperor controlling those two with Geass? Yesterdays episodes had that girl (at least it looked like a girl) who appeared to be manipulating Lelouchs Geass when they collapsed into the cave. Someone (maybe more than one person) can control other peoples Geass.

What the fudge. Why would you even say that, Lelouch? Oh man, poor Euphemia. Ugh. She was so sweet and innocent, but her way was possibly going to work out. Now this mess. Lelouch is getting angrier and angrier.

The slaughter scene showed enough (and we can use our imagination for the rest), and I wasnt expecting it at all. I know /u/danielrval told me back in the episode 8 thread that they censor a lot of the dark aspects, but I was still worried something horrible was going to happen to that lone kid. This show is too dark for its cartoony, colorful art style.

Just humor me. I think I took a few steps over to the crazy side with some big picture predictions.

[crazy predictions](/s "Lelouchs mother was of the same race as CC, and she was more powerful than CC. She and CC have been stranded on Earth for a long time. Enter the Emperor. No twists here. Hes a madman who finds out one of his wives holds immense power, and he wants it for himself. Marianne denies him Geass. At some point CC goes to the Emperor and offers her help in obtaining Mariannes power. She and the Emperor betray Marianne, somehow transferring her power and killing her. The Emperor now has the means to expand his nation and find the artifacts. CC has been helping the Emperor because she needed access to Mariannes power in order return to her home planet. Shes been trying for a long time, but she always fails. So she tricks the Emperor by promising him even more power, but somewhere along the way, he stops listening to her. He decides to follow CCs plan on his own. He has her locked up and experimented on in the meantime.")

That's what makes Lulu's Geass so horrible. It would have been better if it brainwashes you into being someone else, but no. It doesn't change what you are at all. Instead it keeps you exactly as you are, except making you truly wanting to do what the Geass order demands of you. You would see nothing wrong with what you were doing and otherwise acted like nothing changed. Eup is STILL the sweet and gentle girl she always were, she just now have an uncontrolled urge to kill Japanese people on top of it all.

The single most upsetting moment for me was next episode. [Geass R1 Ep. 23](/s "When Lelouch confronts her and she immediately reverts to cheerfulness.

Not quite -- due to the grammar structure of Japanese, it doesn't match up in the order of terms to the translation. Jibun () can be translated as "myself" in the context of the lyrics and "wo" () is a particle that iirc marks the preceding noun as the direct object of the sentence.

Behold, new friends: The Red Wedding of Code Geass!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the episode that almost made me drop it. There must have been a lot of ways for the plot to continue but they had to use an accidental JOKE from Lelouch. I mean, cmon, why? It felt so convenient for the writer that it made me lose my interest.

Even though I eventually did drop it when [](/s "at the first episode of R2 everything was different and Lelouch had a brother and didn't remember anything"), that was years back. I am now more invested in the story and even though I still don't like how the story continued because of that joke, I now understand that it was known that Lelouch might lose control of his Geass so I guess that makes it a bit more believable...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I always go back and forth on whether or not I like this episode.  The idea of losing control was foreshadowed by Mao... but it's still an asspull of asspulls.  I mean, maybe the sub feels more natural but "hey, wouldn't it be funny if I told you to murder all the Japanese" isn't really a funny joke (at least not the sort I could see Lelouch saying, normally), even ignoring the rest.  

But, then, one of the rules of writing that I've often heard is that you can't use contrivances to get characters out of trouble, but you can use it to get them into trouble... but I think that mostly applies at the beginning of a story... not near a climax.  
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know about this rule of writing. Seems valid. But yeah, your point is right, it's weird and feels like an asspull if its used near a climax...
>> ARTICLE
So you haven't watch more after that? I too was pissed during the first episode of R2 but that got cleared out at the end of that episode didn't it?

I didn't even finish the episode so I wouldn't know. Not the best choice, I know...

Why do people keep saying it was a joke?  He was giving an example of a thing Euphemia would never do, but that she would not be able to resist doing if he ordered her to.  Honestly, it was a pretty on-point example.

The real issue is that the Geass chose that exact sound-bite to act up during.

**Episode 3**

* *Ha!* The lower class! Am I right or am I right fellow Britannians? 
* The one thing you never do in a fictional story is kill the main characters parents. Come on Britannia, it's like you're not even trying
* Guess that makes Lelouch batman now
* If that is actually a bat that flies out his eyes that would be perfect
* **Damn**, Lelouch is about as cold as Light. Right off the **bat** as well.
* Look at you Lelouch, pretending to be just another student
* I think I need to decide which I'm going with soon. Batman or Light...
* Oh I get it now. Code Geass is a fun, light-hearted slice of life comedy about a student council that uses their mind control ability to get away with all sorts of wild antics
* Insert obligatory breast size gag
* That makes me wonder, can Lelouch control people through a TV screen? Like facetime or something? 
* [There isn't a hive, just Oprah](http://beesbeesbees.com/)
* So wait, does his mind control only work once? So what you are saying is that he is Kanye-sama? 
* Lelouch is a different character each scene
* Looks as though green haired girl has been hooked up to an experiment/life support machine. Ready for round two of being shot in the face.
* *I promise I'll make the world a gentle place...* **by killing everyone on it**
* Got to have that severely disabled family member to make the main character more relatable
* Aww they finish each others sentences
* And Lelouch's high school romantic comedy begins!
* Lelouch doesn't play by your rules showergirl
* And he just implicated his friend in the murder of the prince. Well *he* didn't do the implicating but whatever. What are you going to do now Lelouch? Ay? Prison break? Spark a nationwide rebellion? Take over the Britannian government? Where does it stop? 

Well this episode didn't have a single 'Hail Lelouch' so overall I would give it a solid *1/10* . As for Lelouch's real identity, I currently have him pegged as; *Batlight West* (Subject to change). 

Just **who** is *Lelouch* really?

I'll let you guess that one.

The most bizarre thing about Lelouch's mind control only working once, is that he has the power to make people obey him indefinitely, or at least whenever he utters a certain codeword. I know he doesn't do this all the time because then we would have no show, but it is really annoying from a fridge logic standpoint.
>> ARTICLE
The usual handwave/explanation is that Lelouch hates infringing on someone else's free will and thus at least *tries* to not take them over indefinitely. Of course he still does it if he "needs" to, since being a hypocrite is one of Lelouch's favourite pastimes.
>> ARTICLE
The interesting thing about Lulu is that he is hypocritical about wanting to be evil. His brain knows he needs to be an evil bastard, but his heart often lets him down.

Basically, we are watching someone trying to be a villain. Much like Suzaku is trying to be a hero.

Yes, people forget Lelouch still has a moral compass.

Yes, however by his own admission he can and will easily ignore it

Lelouch is probably wondering this as well.

>*I promise I'll make the world a gentle place...* **by killing everyone on it**

Once they're all dead they'll have no choice but to stop killing each other! An ingenious plan!

>Just who is Lelouch really?

Well, you're in luck my friend, you're currently watching the 50 episode attempt at answering this question.

Though my personal answer at this point would be: [The most fabulous Not-Batman in existance.](http://i.imgur.com/goNAQsC.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Except Lelouch's goal is not to kill everyone... In the episode he specifically said he wants to destroy Britannia, NOT Britannians.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I am aware. It's called a joke.
>> ARTICLE
Fabulous Not-Batman is my favorite way of describing this show now.
>> ARTICLE
What can I say. The third episode of Code Geass doesn't really drive the plot forward by alot, but instead we are introduced to a group of side characters. On the one side we have Lelouch's wacky high school friends, while on the other side we are introduced to Nunnally, Lelouch's crippled little sister who he apparently shares a rather traumatic past with, so traumatic in fact that the girl cannot open her eyes anymore. 

Her introduction also serves to show that Lelouch has a legitimate reason to destroy Britannia: Someone in the upper echelons of the Britannian aristocracy wanted her mother dead and the two siblings somehow end up far away from the homeland in exile, believed to be dead. How that happened we don't quite know yet, but nonetheless it becomes a bit more understandable why he would want to go up against the empire.

Another thing that is shown in today's episode is how Lelouch actually committed murder against his half brother. Not that we'd expect him to never tarnish his own hands, but he seems to be so compulsed by his goal that he doesn't mind doing the dirty job himself. In fact he had to, because he has no direct subjects, not just yet.

Hmm, so what else was shown in this episode? Oh right, Kallen ... in all her glory. Tbh, despite how much I love this anime, I cannot help but wonder (even on my 6th or so rewatch): How did Lelouch plan to take care of the Kallen problem before the student council showed up and conveniently sprayed ~~intoxicating sticky liquid~~ champagne all over her body? He clearly couldn't hypnotize her so his only choices would be to either 

- make up something on the spot about not going around and speaking about Shinjuku

or

- tell her that he is a sacrifical pawn of the mysterious voice who is holding his sister at gunpoint and that he has a message to relay to her

Because ordering his maid Sayoko to make that phone call to the bathroom (I wish my bathroom had a telephone, heck I wish it had a bath tub in the first place) couldn't have been done prior to Kallen getting into the shower, because that would have made no sense. 

Well either way, for now his identity is safe and he can proceed to plan ahead ... or so he wished because it turns out that murdering Clovis in his first step towards vengeance unintentionally brought his *long lost best friend who he thought was dead but wasn't* a step closer towards the gallows.
By none other than the haphazardly established viceroy replacement Jeremiah Gottwald and his military subgroup called the Purist Faction (my subtitles said Pureblood but whatever), who apparently don't like the ideas of a) the *Honorary Britannian* system to integrate non-Britannians into Britannian society and b) their local monarch being murdered.

Also noteworthy was the brief showcase of the secret research institution that apparently belonged to Clovis and run by General Bartley. And it had connections to the mysterious green haired girl who was killed in the first episode. Not only that but there is a photo where that girl apparently can be seen in a WWI kind of setting.

Wow, so even in an relatively uneventful episode we get so much information. Again, something like One Piece wouldn't have done it this quickly.

As always I appreciate this rewatch a lot for the first timers's thoughts and reactions.

He did bring her to the building, and he was the one holding the bottle when it splooged her.  Probably not an accident.  He may even have been genuinely unaware the others were going to be there, and just improvised a way to besmirch her  heaven knows how he would have done it if it had been just the two of them

The bottle seemed more like an accident. Rivalz brought the bottle and shook it, then threw it to Lelouch,. While avoiding Shirley, the cap popped off and sprayed Kallen.

Going back to a less crazy style of writing for the majority of the time. ^(Also being funny is hard.)

Brovis wasn't responsible for the death of Lelouch's mother, but at least he had an idea of who was. New target acquired. Was wondering if he would pull the trigger, good editing to hide the reveal until later.

All these kids have impossibly long legs. I know it's a French surname but Rivalz is really odd-looking as a given name. I'm split between Shirley and Nina for best girl at the moment.

Jeremiah and what's-her-face are of the "Purist Faction" which doesn't at all sound like Nazis, got it. And they're probably going to get worse soon by the sound of things, pushing them firmly into "for the evulz" category of dumb villain.

By sheer coincidence Kallen is also in Lelouch's class and I have no idea why she decided to assume a frail disguise. [She's gonna have to kill someone.](http://i.imgur.com/FGSEK13.png)Being half-Japanese explains it in her case. That was a horrible coverup, Lelouch. Fortunately he comes up with a better alibi at the end of the episode.

So the geas either doesn't work on a person more than once or there's some kind of cooldown to it. Would be fun if it was the latter but I doubt it. That also means that the woman with Jeremiah is immune to him now, as is Kallen herself. Wonder if he'll forget about the former to have it come back and bite him later. I don't imagine any persistent commands would work, e.g. "serve me and answer any questions accurately for the rest of your life" so he'll have to be a bit more conscious of how he uses it.

Nunnally was the little girl in the assassination, I'm guessing. With the "by the time you can see" I'm not sure if Lelouch meant she's only temporarily blind or he's just optimistic about finding something to help her see. Or pessimistic and implying that there will never be world peace because she's permanently blind, but he doesn't seem that cruel.

The other girls freaking out over Lelouch asking to talk with Kallen was cute. Now I wonder if he really did know that she was going to be added to the student council or if it was coincidence. Given his random knowledge of a train containing mechs in the last episode, I doubt it's the latter.

Kallen tried to get the upper hand on him, for sure. Of course he's one step ahead though, as I'm guessing he will be for everything in the series. He probably didn't anticipate Suzaku being used as a scapegoat for the assassination of Clovis, though.

I honestly have no idea how this is going to go so I'm going to theorize what happens next.

[Wild speculation round 1](/s "Lelouch takes Kallen on a mission to rescue Suzaku, but it was a trap! All three of them perish in a firefight and the rest of the series is about the daily life of the student council. Rivalz is mildly depressed by that until Nina comforts him and they start dating.")

This just reminds me that this early in the show we're still at the "shit, I have no clear idea of what I'm doing" stage with Lelouch. I'm not saying that to diminish the character, but rather to point out that for the first half of the show any thing that could go wrong, especially in his arrogance or overestimation of his power, could result (and does result) in disaster later on. 
>> ARTICLE
And here is the episode where everyone begins asking the question, "Why doesn't Lelouch just command people to obey him only when he utters a code word? It protects their free will for the most part, and doesn't limit his Geass to just one use."

Keep wondering that, because the anime sure doesn't bother to answer it.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's Code Geass? A dumb show which takes itself way too seriously.
>> ARTICLE
My best explanation is because that'd be too easy for him. He's brilliant and he knows it, and because of that he's arrogant as fuck. Where's the fun in turning everyone into mindless slaves with the same command when you can risk messing up by giving everyone different specific commands that can only be used once?
>> ARTICLE
It might just be that [spoilers]( /s "he doesn't have the ability to do it initially. If I remember correctly his power increases the more he uses it, so maybe that's just a technique he can't pull off until later?")

He does that with one of the knights, except a gesture, not a code word.

Because he doesn't know its limitations. For all he knows Geass can have a 10 people per month quota.

I'd love to keep doing mini-analysis of these episodes, but school is bearing down hard in my last semester so these may be more infrequent/shorter.


In this episode, I think the show really develops many different motives that Lelouch has for acting as Zero. Right off the bat we see that his mother was killed in a way that was staged as terrorists doing, but really Britannian higher ups just wanted her dead. Despite her staged death, Lelouch has no idea who was responsible, and so one of his missions is to figure out who exactly that is.


Despite what other people in this comment section have said, LELOUCH'S GOAL IS NOT TO KILL EVERYONE SO THAT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE SAFE. His ultimate goal, as he says with Nunnally, is to create a world where she and people like her are safe. On the train, when he reveals himself as Zero, he says that the enemy is Britannia, NOT Britannian civilians. I cannot stress this enough. Additionally, the crane origami that kept showing up is a sign of good fortune and longevity in Japanese culture. This is not just thrown in there. It reinforces the idea that Lelouch is looking to create a future where Nunnally is safe and sound.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to see the reaction first-timers will get when they find out who killed Lelouch's mother. Also, that's fine. I've got school as well but at least I have time for this rewatch. Keep up the good work, man, and good luck at school!

Nice summary before the OP. Poor Nunnally.

Britannian officials giving Suzaku the "bad cop, crooked cop" routine, I see. Can't see this turning out well for him.

Something about a butler erasing evidence? I missed the context for that. *For Science!* guy (still don't know his name) isn't too bad so far. I like the purple-haired woman with him too.

Was that a shocked face from Shirley when Lelouch says he found something more exciting to do? Also more stringing along Kallen and the other rebels.

Oh hey, the TV guy is Jouji Nakata. Love the voice. Yay propaganda broadcasts, controlled media makes for an easily controlled populace.

What's with the random [mind-controlled civilians?](http://i.imgur.com/i2igNc8.png) Did he do that just to move them out of the train car?

Wow, that mask. Lelouch has such a sense of theatricality about him. I get concealing his face, but his whole outfit by no means needs to be that ridiculous. It will definitely present a different image from the terrorists that the government has been fighting for a while, however.

They're going hard on the nation in tears angle with the broadcast, but as TV guy said it's what the masses want.

[Zero, you say?](http://i.imgur.com/vXKWS0n.png) Can't ask for a better stage to announce himself to the world. Nice bluff on the capsule. The civilians have no idea what it is so they don't immediately panic but the military *thinks* it's the poison gas they failed to retrieve.

The window in the mask is silly but necessary, I suppose. Could just be a slit in theory? Also confirmed that sunglasses will render his entire operation useless.

Oh, Suzaku, hopeless idealist. I'm starting to understand why the fandom hates him, but he's not bothering me yet. I wonder...

Also green-haired girl's back! Knew she couldn't stay out of the picture given how prominent she is in the OP.

[Wild speculation round 2](/s "Lelouch reveals himself to Suzaku and confesses that he's always loved him and the whole thing was just to save him. They elope and Zero is never seen again, with Lelouch also disappearing from school. Shirley is mildly depressed by that until Milly comforts her and they start dating.")

Code Lyoko had me rolling. well done sir.
>> ARTICLE
> What's with the random mind-controlled civilians? Did he do that just to move them out of the train car?

Lelouch doesn't take second chances when it comes to stuff like this. Especially when he spent about three hours rehearsing his speech.

>Wow, that mask. Lelouch has such a sense of theatricality about him. I get concealing his face, but his whole outfit by no means needs to be that ridiculous.

When you have the choice between fighting the man and fighting the man *whilst dressed fabulously*, I know which one I'm going for. But yes, it's theatrics - Lelouch knows what kind of effect he wants to have on people. He doesn't want to be Terrorist Leader #72, he wants to be Zero, the weirdly dressed vigilante that everyone talks about.

And a fun fact: the reason Lelouch wears a mask is because Ichiro Okouchi, the writer of the show, was of the opinion that you can't have a Sunrise show without someone wearing a mask.
>> ARTICLE
But Cross Ange didn't have masks o_O

What was set up in yesterday's (comparatively) rather uneventful episode comes in fruition right now.

Lelouch has an important short term goal: to save his friend who he and his sister apparently have spend their childhood years with.
The information he has right now are:

- He has an appointment with Kallen at the Tokyo Tower at 4PM

- The TV broadcast program aka the transport schedule for the execution

- As Suzaku mentioned during their encounter, the military (assumingly including the Purist Faction) was told by the higher ups around Clovis that the capsule that was stolen the other day contains poison gas

- Area 11 is temporarily run by the Purist Faction led by Jeremiah Gottwald. Since Lelouch made all the higher ups around Clovis abandon their prince shortly before he was murded, one can assume that nobody running the military right now knows about the specifics of the capsule

With these pieces at hand he formulates a winning strategy. 
It might not have been made clear enough during the episode, but the old man he used his Geass on organized his costume: suit, cape and mask.
He makes Ougi's little resistance cell realize that terrorism is but child's play when it comes to fighting Brittania. After all, who they need to fight is the empire itself, not its citizens.
And after that he orchestrates his grand scheme of saving Suzaku.

The way Lelouch dramatically enters the scene and announces his name to the world "I am Zero" and how he theatrically turns his head towards TV producer Diethard's camera to declare that it was him who murdered prince Clovis is nothing short of a ham-fisted display of his charisma. He knows exactly how to play his cards.

Good god I love this series. Lelouch never takes the direct way to solve a problem. Why bother? If they fought the Britannian army head-on, they would die. No, in order to pull off something like this, one must use deception, layers upon layers of deception.
There is nobody but himself who knows how all pieces of his scheme are supposed to fall into place and he is very selective about the information he gives out. 

"Build this car by tomorrow", "just the two of you are enough", **"Orange"**. He speaks in riddles not only to his enemies but to his supposed allies as well. After all he has a second life to manage and he cannot risk getting exposed, not with Nunnally's safety on the line.

If the first two episodes didn't sell this anime to anyone, at the very latest by this forth episode, there shouldn't remain a single person unhooked by this show. It is that amazing.

On a side note, I absolutely *loved* the use of music in this episode (this whole series in general). This show's OST composed by Koutarou Nakagawa is a major key element in driving the dramatic tension of Zero's performance through the roof and trust me when I say that there are some scenes that are made so powerful by his music, that whenever you listen to the OST you cannot help but replay those scenes in your head.

As always, I look forward to the first-timer's comments.

Just finished watching Berserk and the 3 films that go along with it. As such, I now rename Batlight West to Griffbat Westlight. Don't look up Griffith/Femto if you intend to watch/read berserk, spoilers all over.

Back on topic: Given the new direction this show is going in, I will be disappointed if Lelouch doesn't fall onto a girl with added boob grab. This is his teen romantic comedy after all. 

**Episode 4**

* Filthy 11 scum
* #Policebrutality
* His power level! It's over...90%...
* "Hey Lelouch, got anything planned later?" Oh, you know, just taking over the world 'n' stuff
* A museum dedicated to the glory of Britannia? Where do I buy tickets?
* Griffbat Westlight appears! That name is a pain to type...
* Don't forget your daily Pizza hut
* I'm waiting for the inevitable "MWUAHAHAHA, IT IS ME! NOT-LELOUCH!" as whats-his-name gets paraded through the streets
* Lelouch has a full on Darth Vader mask there
* Appearing out of flames...***Metal!***
* Zero? Did he mean to say Zorro?
* Griffbat Zorlight West
* Or you can just call him Lelouch...*it's not like I care or anything*
* So he has another 'gas weapon'. Are green haired girls mass produced for cheap these days?
* For real though: You must have the shittiest security detail ever if a person can just drive a truck up to your convoy like it's nothing
* Wouldn't it be cool if instead of commanding people to die, Lelouch just defamed them by making them sing off key in the middle of a tense situation like this
* Think of the mad youtube money you could make too
* Oh hey it's the old "I'll change the system from the inside rather than dismantle it" standpoint
* One thing that got me thinking is can Lelouch use his eye thingy on blind people? I mean if they can't see it then theoretically it won't work right? That makes his sister the ultimate weapon against him
* ***Blind Hard*** starring Nunnally Willis coming to a cinema near you
* Green haired being creepy, thought she was tied up to a chair or was that a flashback of sorts? [Thanks]

This show is absolutely ridiculous and I love that. From an entertainment standpoint it has me hooked. Hopefully it doesn't pull a Fullmetal on me (Hughes anyone?), not sure I'm ready for those sorts of feels just yet. 

Woops, forgot about the lack of boob grab fall. Actually this show is terrible. 1/10

> For real though: You must have the shittiest security detail ever if a person can just drive a truck up to your convoy like it's nothing

The security guard mentions "as ordered" on the walkman(or whatever). Assuming here that Jeremiah ordered them to let anything through because as Lelouch said to the terrorists "Jemeriah loves to be in the middle of the splotlight". Paraphrasing, too lazy to go back and quote correctly.

I'm with you here. Jeremiah wanted any challengers to step before him while all the camera are rolling so he can take them out himself and get the credit.

Next episode the real Pizza Butt love beings.

Seriously, though, the girl likes pizza.

Please tell me she shamelessly mentions it was from Pizza hut like:

"I sure do **love** the taste of this pepperoni pizza available from **PIZZA HUT** for only **$8.99**"
>> ARTICLE
The Pizza Hut representative was shocked. Look at it that way.

Sunrise decided to turn the tables. Instead of putting a company's logo in the background just because they get paid for it, they took it as an excuse to plaster the trademark where ever they felt like it for amusement.

"You want us to put in pizza hut? You are going to GET Pizza Hut! And you can't stop us!"
>> ARTICLE
Boy, I wish. But she does risk exposure twice just to get a taste of twenty-meter large pizza.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that the most interesting part of the episode is Suzaku and Lelouch's conversation at the end of the episode. Everything about this scene shows the different ways that both of these characters are attacking the same problem. Lelouch, conveniently placed amongst a bunch of jagged rocks, argues that to take down the Britannian Empire, a war must be initiated and won. Suzaku, dressed in a all white, also detests the Britannian Empire but decides to attempt to change the Empire from within. The dichotomy of how both are portrayed and dressed in this scene enhances this idea that both are just so very different when it comes to how to attack the problem at hand.


I also love the rewatch value on this series so far. I'm noticing so much more that I missed the first time around.

Have you not been a train commuter?  This kind of thing happens a lot.

This is one of my favorite episodes.  The entire scene on the train, Zero crashing the Brittanians' party in fabulous fasion, and the final conversation between Lelouch and Suzaku at the end are all great!
>> ARTICLE
I liked this episode. I've been watching the English dub, and some of the scenes were a little overdramatic, though. The scene with Lelouch/Zero and Suzaku near the end was overdramatic imo. It certainly didn't hinder the episode at all.

I nearly forgot about watching this today for some reason. D=

It's quite intentional.

This is Overdramatic: The TV Series. I love it.

My favorite character is the mad scientist because he makes everything sound so over-the-top. It's great!

The Zero/Suzaku scene you're referring to kind of has to sound that way.  Zero doesn't dare let down that stentorian delivery of his for fear of sounding like Lelouch and giving away his identity.

>> ARTICLE
It's the mark of someone outwardly strong, yet a coward within. Makes him human. An annoying little shit, but still human.
>> ARTICLE
Ok now I am confused.
>> ARTICLE
Essentially, he is saying that if Suzaku were to decide to let go of his morals and inhibitions then Suzaku could easily win everything, but because of his insistence on trying to save everyone and everything he will continue to be subpar.
>> ARTICLE
Oh so he was saying Lelouch is in the right. 

I think the interesting dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku is what makes Code Geass great. Lelouch is like the textbook definition of Utilitarian ethics; only the end result matters, and he will do anything to achieve that end. Suzaku is more like Kantian ethics; it's not that he doesn't want the same end result as Lelouch he just refuses to violate the categorical imperative. For him, the means and ends are ethically inseparable. The debate over which of them is *right* is the backbone of the show.

A cool thought experiment would be to switch the weapons each of them is given. Geass itself is an immoral weapon; Suzaku would be loath to use it, even to save his own life, while Lelouch uses his without concern. Lancelot, on the other hand, is simply powerful. Much like it's namesake, it's capable of either acts of great heroism or great betrayal, depending on the morals driving it. This makes Suzaku an almost perfect pilot, while Lelouch would simply consider it a resource.

I think it's incredibly naive to say Suzaku is dumb because of his morality, [because](/s "he very nearly achieves his goal. Euphemia and he bring about change from within Britannia, change Lelouch agrees to be a part of... until Lelouch's Geass, the embodiment of his immoral actions, backfires and destroys everything Suzaku worked for.")

>> ARTICLE
It would have one season, that's for sure. Without Suzaku the Britannians were hopelessly outmatched. [Spoiler](/s "Narita, for instance. Without Suzaku, Cornelia and Euphemia would have been out of the game pronto.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think there's anything "retarded" about Suzaku's actions here.  You don't have to agree with them, sure, a lot of people don't, but they do make sense from the right perspective.

Most people just seem incapable of separating their perception of a character from the main characters perception.  "Suzaku's actions are inconvenient to the main character!  What a retard!"
>> ARTICLE
This particular episode may be excusable, but the shit he does later on most certainly is not
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile since I saw the whole show, but I remember mostly disagreeing with that sentiment.  I'm not saying I love every action that Suzaku takes... but then Lelouch does some pretty abhorrent stuff throughout the show as well, too, if I remember correctly.  
>> ARTICLE
**Massive spoiler**  
[Basically this](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs31/f/2008/227/7/a/Code_Geass___Passing_the_Bomb_by_FoxxFireArt.png)
>> ARTICLE
Wait, you mean that thing that [spoilers](/s "he was literally forced to do by the Geass command Lelouch laid on him earlier in the series?  Suzaku would have sacrificed himself, until Lelouch's Geas kicked in.  If *anyone* is to blame for that, it's Lelouch.  It's kind of crazy to blame Suzaku for that.")  
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I mainly used that particular image as a joke but it does represent his attitude problem. In this particular example he knew full well about the Geass command and what it could make him do but he demanded to go out there with it. Repeatedly throughout the series he is incredibly arrogant and so sure of his strange sense moral superiority. Basically he irritates me at least because he's an arrogant hypocrite without much to back it up.")
>> ARTICLE
So, again, in what way is Suzaku "hypocritical"?  In what way does he fail to live up to his moral beliefs, [except](/s "when compelled to by Lelouch's Geass")? 

Hypocritical seems to be one of those words that gets thrown around when you don't like someone's beliefs, but don't actually have grounds to criticize them... which again, seems to by the common perception of Suzaku.  

And "arrogant"?  At what point does Suzaku tell someone that he is morally superior to them?  And any criticisms of arrogance, coming from someone who presumably supports Lelouch Vi "I think I could take on the entire world, even if I didn't have superpowers" Brittania seems a little bit rich.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the scene where Jeremiah and Diethard Reid had a casual conspiracy meeting to discuss how best to go about the propaganda. It reminds us that Brittanians are extremely competent not just at military hardware development and armed forces organisation, but they run an effective, if hugely inequitable peacetime regime too.
>> ARTICLE
I really wish there was a directors cut of this show that cut out all of the high school students council BS. 
>> ARTICLE
Can I get all the parts that you'd cut and watch that alone?
>> ARTICLE
It shows a nice contrast between light-hearted britanians and the harsh world that The Elevens live in
>> ARTICLE
B-but then we couldn't watch them dress up like cats!
>> ARTICLE
That wouldn't work. The point is Britannia as a society works only because the privileged is sheltered from the dark side of their own country. The highschool itself is part of the problem of the world. It is all connected.
>> ARTICLE
i really disagree. the high school parts are just pandering and take away from the plot. an entire episode about kids chasing a cat around doesn't really add anything to the show at all imo.
>> ARTICLE
Then you missed the little hints that show Lulu as a mortal. One of the most dramatic elements about Lulu is how despite his skills, he is cripplingly weak physically. In fact the whole point is to switch around what was usually the hero and the anti-hero. Lulu as Zero appear to be mysterious and invincible, but we know he is not because we see what he is like without the mask. The "plot" is important, but the characters even more so.
>> ARTICLE
No, I didn't miss that lol. There are better ways to do it. I understand why these parts of the show are there but I still think it takes away from the legitimacy of the story. It's a problem in a lot of anime; first few shows I watched I could tolerate it but it's getting old.
>> ARTICLE
"Legitimacy"?
I am sorry, but this isn't a war documentary, nor is it suppose to be high brow art. Code Geass only makes sense at all because it doesn't take itself too seriously, or the whole thing wouldn't have worked. If you want to watch something that makes you appear more mature, you are watching the wrong show. What's next, you want the pizza jokes removed too?
>> ARTICLE
I just think it takes away from the show man it's out of place with everything and you can skip all those scenes and literally miss nothing.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch's identity struggle between Nunnally's Lelouch at school and his alter ego Zero and Lelouch trying to fit into that mask is a huge part of who Lelouch is.  His school life and interactions humanize Lelouch, and that allows the internal struggles he has trying to be Zero.  Without the two sides, he'd have no internal struggles at all.  He'd just be a tool or an insert protagonist instead of an actual character.
>> ARTICLE
Yea and I think they could have done it much better in a much less infantile way. 
>> ARTICLE
Then you missed everything. Because what he does when he isn't fighting, explains why he fights at all. Remove that, and you are left with a crazy psychopath who had no reason to do what he does.
>> ARTICLE
No the mention Nanallys plight enough times that I'd have to be blind deaf and dumb to miss that lol
>> ARTICLE
That, but I also feel like it adds depth to Lelouch. Him having that double life adds a layer of stress to his life, and it also gives him something else minor he wants to protect. 

[Spoiler](/s "That, and it also really hurts Lelouch when Shirley died, a plot point which wouldn't exist without the school. Also, I feel like it's one more thing he gave up at the end in order to become a martyr, he lost the few friends he had. ") 

I know a lot of times it seems like the school stuff it just there to add humor/give a break from the action, but it does have some important purposes.

Why do people like this show? I'm serious, it's crazy popular and I have no idea why. It just looks like generic garbage with a godawful art style.

Sorry for being so blunt, but the popularity this show has is just mind boggling.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you've grasped the core of this show. The mechas, the magic, the school setting, they're all *supposed* to be generic and familiar, because they're the side show to the main attraction - a great character doing awesome stuff. Preferably with keikaku doori. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, got it now. It's a generic, simplistic Gundam series with a hammy Light Yagami. Now I get why people like it.
>> ARTICLE
More accurately, it's a more likeable Light Yagami with mechs on the side.

Lelouch gets a lot more in his character than Light really does. Through the course of Code Geass, yes you see the brilliant tactician Lelouch, but you see the Lelouch who cares about people, the Lelouch who becomes heartbroken, the Lelouch who learns about the human aspect of things, and the Lelouch who puts himself on the line to change the world. 

Then you finish the show, be slightly confused, shake your head...and then some time later you rewatch it. Then as you watch, you start putting together all the stuff you didn't fully get the first time...and then you realize just how brilliant the show is.

That's how it was for me and several other people I know, at least. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm more concerned with the idea that one can't just like setting that someone else doesnt; or that everyone has to like everything. I mean you ask why people like the show because you can't stand it. Okay. The show isn't for you, sorry but that's all there is too it. People like it for differnt reasons that you apparently don't agree with or can't see. I like the art style and you dont. *shrug* i don't see how you could say the art style is 'bad.' HOWEVER Personal opinion and subjectivity exist.  End of discussion, end of argument. 
>> ARTICLE
It's just that I've asked this question before, several times before, and the only answer I get is "maybe it just isn't for you."

For example, nobody ever tells me that the plot is deep and meaningful, or the characters are all three-dimensional and well-rounded, or that even the music is great or it has good action. I just get the "not for you" brush off.

Again, I'm really not trying to be mean. If this is your favorite show, good for you, don't take this as me being insulting. I'm just frustrated that this show gets unreal praise while mecha shows that I like are basically looked down on. There was a recent Zeta Gundam re-watch here and almost nobody participated! And that's one of the best Gundam series of all time!
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't like a majority of the UC timeline. I like the original,  stardust memory, char's counter attack and unicorn gundam. The rest of them I either haven't or personally didn't like such as Zeta.  I mean G Gundam gets trashed and I honestly adore that series more than even the original gundam. It's all just taste and subjectivity as far as how much a show means or Is for you. I like the characters of code geass, I like the music of code geass, I like the fights and the hammyness of the main cast. It's just that this show got more popular than Gundam and this show doesn't start off as slow in my opinion as Zeta 'kamills a man's name' gundam.
>> ARTICLE
So that people can [](/s "Jibun Wo")

But in all seriousness, you are judging a book by its cover. It's a rather smart show (a little less in season 2) with one of the coolest characters in anime, if not a bit overpowered.

The artstyle is done by CLAMP, so that would explain why it doesn't appeal to you, because they are an all-girls team. But all of story, characters, animation, music and more are NOT done by them. It is actually very high-profile production with very action-packed and intense moments. I'm going to say this one time.

#***DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER***
>> ARTICLE
Let me go point-by-point here:

* I like Clamp, in general. I like Cardcaptor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, hell even Chobits isn't that bad. I have an older sister, so I grew up watching really girly shows like Sailor Moon (which I love) right alongside stupidly masculine shit like DBZ (which I also love). The art in Code Geass just reminds me of Gundam SEED but somehow worse/more generic.

* I watched eight episodes. Maybe it gets better after that point, but god *damn* was it hard to get through eight episodes.

* Lelouch strikes me as a douche. I don't have any concrete reason why, but I just think he's a douche.

So yeah, I didn't judge it by its cover. I judged it by the (disappointing) content of eight episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, ok. You gave me proof, now I'm happy. I understand what you mean, honestly. Oh, btw, do you know what happens in the end of the series?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Only watched 8 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay, that explains it.
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't like Code Geass even 8 episodes in then this show is probably just not for you. Nothing wrong with that, just stop watching if it can't hold your interest or attention, you don't have to force yourself to watch it just because it is so high profile.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just honestly curious if it gets a hell of a lot better right after I quit watching. Or maybe it just really isn't for me. Either way, I can live with it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not for you
>> ARTICLE
Probably just isn't your thing. I completed the series aftet I had dropped it in 12 episodes the first time around and while it had some really good parts, it fell flat for me. Especially R2.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad I watched this a year or two after it was finished.  That cliffhanger would have driven me mad.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I was okay with it back then because it as creating so many hilarious what-if scenarios and speculation.

Yeah, while watching Aldnoah, I felt that they were trying to pull the same thing but ultimately didn't accomplish anything.
>> ARTICLE
Well with Aldnoah- very little changed

Here- everything changed
>> ARTICLE
To me, right now, both shows end their first season around a similar point. You have the knowledge of R2 that I definitely don't; for all I know Lelouch goes back to school after this and the Black Knights fall back to regroup for a while. Maybe Cornelia lives and becomes a cyborg, I dunno. Already happened to Jeremiah. 
>> ARTICLE
>Maybe Cornelia lives and becomes a cyborg, I dunno. Already happened to Jeremiah. 

The whole caste becomes cyborgs really. You know how Inaho got that robot eye? Know where that comes from? That's right. Except here they shoot lasers. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/IJb7ou7.gif) is a gif of the next upcoming battle. You know Rivalz? That's him, becomes a major character. The shift is very odd an unexpected but grows on you.

[/s](/s "just kidding")
>> ARTICLE
This could have been said last episode, but one of the reasons why I love Lelouch so much and am glad he won the best guy contest is because how he handled the massacre. 

He truly loved Euphie and would *never* intentionally make her do what she did, but the second he knew what was going to happen and that he couldn't stop it, he knew he had to take advantage of it. He didn't sit there crying for 20 minutes and wasting this "opportunity". 

He knew this was a tragedy, but if he could make *any* good come from this, he would make damn sure it would happen.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you... up until he ditches everything to run off after Nunnally.
>> ARTICLE
Why wouldn't he? He did all that for Nunnally. Without her, what's the point? You can overthrow Britannia any time, but you only have one little sister.
>> ARTICLE
At this point it's not just about Lelouch and his sister. He's ruining many, many other people's lives by abandoning the rebellion if it fails.
>> ARTICLE
> At this point it's not just about Lelouch and his sister. He's ruining many, many other people's lives by abandoning the rebellion if it fails.

Which is absolutely correct but Lelouch fails to realize that. Hopefully it will dawn to him during the second season.
>> ARTICLE
I don't necessarily agree. Zero isn't actually Japanese, he's got no horse in the race so to speak. These people are placing all their hopes on him, but it's silly to expect him to abandon his goal for some burden everyone is placing on him.

In fact they already understood that zero has some potentially nefarious motive, and were wary to follow him for that reason until he proved himself a capable leader.
>> ARTICLE
It's his "fatal flaw" if you will. 
>> ARTICLE
The base purpose Lelouch has for launching the rebellion is to ensure a "kinder world" for his sister. He places an unhealthy amount of significance on her and she's his reason to continue fighting against Britannia and his father's rule. Thus, it makes sense that he would ensure her safety above all else because without her he'd pretty much feel like he has nothing and he'd check out of the rebellion anyways.

It's not entirely logic at this point -- it's him acting on protective impulse because he'd be a mess with no direction without Nunnally.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is a good point and I agree with you. Lelouch's ability to keep his composure and make the best out of any situation is incredible.

It's really heart wrenching though, especially when he admits that Euphie was his first love.. =(

RIP Euphemia Li Brittania

It was hard to come back and finish out the season, but I did.

When will the bloodshed stop? Everything's going to pieces now. Zero's taking full advantage of the "betrayal" to turn public opinion in his favor and Lelouch has no soul. I know his original plan was to have Euphemia "assassinate" him only for him to rise again, but this is so much worse. [This is the face of a monster.](http://i.imgur.com/uB3H7hw.png)

Poor Euphemia, she doesn't even know what's really going on now. [I'm not even angry now.](http://i.imgur.com/rJ2RQyG.png) Just despairing. [If only this could end differently.](http://i.imgur.com/P12zU1V.png) Who wants to do a "Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan" style spinoff where it's just everyone's antics at Ashford Academy without Geass or the Black Knights?

Yep, Suzaku's gone. Never going to turn him now, Zero. About time for Cornelia to lose it, I'm guessing. Meanwhile Diethard and Rakshata are in this for their own reasons, not because they really believe in Zero's cause on its own.

Hm.. the girl's Suzaku's relative, not necessarily sister? Doesn't matter, Zero's taking over.

[Well that's horrible.](http://i.imgur.com/dxCk79f.png) She's doing a good job of ignoring it though, I was half expecting her to just keep asking Suzaku to die until she passed on. It was a good scene for her in the end.

[No Lelouch, she's a good example](http://i.imgur.com/nPj2jLo.png) [of *your* hypocrisy.](http://i.imgur.com/5YKFqpp.png) [Dat face.](http://i.imgur.com/R2ddLCX.png)

Nunnally needs to interject there to remind Lelouch of how terrible of a human he is. [This is... kinda scary.](http://i.imgur.com/onXSnk8.png) I'm not sure how to interpret that. Is CC implying she'll get rid of everyone around him? Or that she'll still be with him after everyone else leaves him? Or just that since she's immune to the Geass he doesn't have to worry about her? It's the *only* that concerns me. Now I have to wonder if the uncontrollable Geass was intentionally triggered at that moment, albeit maybe not by her...

[Cornelia always looked out for her little sister,](http://i.imgur.com/uWfRKUW.png) just like Lelouch is doing with Nunnally. I'm expecting not-good things from her soon. [And Nina...](http://i.imgur.com/jHlobyv.png) [poor Nina.](http://i.imgur.com/XDwxsQn.png) I've seen that image before without context and now I just sympathize with her.

CC's... talking to Marianne? Well damn. Everything else is coming to a head with riots and Zero's army approaching Tokyo.

[Damn it, show.](http://i.imgur.com/83n44WW.png) Seriously? And then I don't even know what's going on with Jeremiah.

Suzaku's pissed, we might see him do more than just interfere in Zero's plans for once.

Destruction and carnage. The fall of Britannia comes?

---
Code-R... so now Jeremiah's like CC? This show is getting more convoluted for no good reason.

[](#kyon-facepalm)

And everything's falling to pieces. Literally.

Diethard's suspicious of Zero's powers given the information Jeremiah and Villetta gave him, but still loves Zero all the same.

OP3! Seems like a sudden change for the last two episodes, but apparently these two aired months after the previous one.

Guilford vs. Todo, I like the two of them. And of course they're fighting in giant mechs with swords.

Heh, Villetta took care of the thugs for sure. And Suzaku's done with Lloyd's shit, understandably.

Odysseus, is he the first prince? Euphinator event? And Charles is probably at his thought elevator again.

And Diethard finally shows his true colors to Britannia, but at this point it's worth it to take over the broadcasting station.

Lelouch is still looking out for Nunnally at least. And really kids, the hair wasn't a dead giveaway that it was Kallen? I'm expecting Rivalz to try something stupid like remove Zero's helmet.

VV just *looks so ridiculous* that I can't take him seriously in the least. Villetta came back around it seems, that's too bad. Hopefully she'll get some character development out of it.

I wonder what Darlton's gonna do. He keeps getting brief flashes of screen time so... And Villetta's probably going to screw up something there.

Ooh, nice trap to catch Suzaku. I wonder why Shirley hasn't spilled the beans yet.

Hm, CC knows about the villa. Yep, there goes Villetta. [And Nina, heh.](http://i.imgur.com/zXj2yjY.png) Ooooh Darlton was Geassed! Well done, Zero.

[Seriously, look at this.](http://i.imgur.com/hZq63PM.png) He looks like a teen trying his goth vampire phase. And why is he coming to get Nunnally?

---
Cornelia down! And even she doesn't know who killed Marianne, but the queen knew something was up that day. Marianne's corpse was moved? Mysterious.

...CC's connected to either VV or the royal family. [Well then.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33e4da/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion/cqk6zw6?context=1)

Okay, I burst out laughing at Jeremiah's **ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!** Orange! What the hell happened to him?

I like the new OP, both music and visuals.

Aww, poor Lloyd. Cecile's there for him though, and they got Lancelot back! That damn cat.

The battle's turning against the Black Knights and Zero's nowhere to be found. All for his little sister.

And the psycho lesbian brought a WMD to the battlefield. Finished that between the time Euphemia was assassinated to now? Couldn't have been that long.

[This reminds me of that Thought Elevator thing.](http://i.imgur.com/eJYmSxJ.png) And a [fuller version of the symbol?](http://i.imgur.com/s0vdZZI.png) Ooh acid trip time again! CC in World War I, earlier being burned at the stake. Jupiter, that castle from the last ED. So out of basically every character in the show, CC and Nunnally are the only ones that aren't a chess piece to him?

I... guess this is probably the first time anyone's treated CC nicely ^(that didn't turn out to be crazy) ^^yet Still not sure what to think of [that kiss.](http://i.imgur.com/C7u1j8T.png) Oh CC...

There goes the rebellion. Sorry Diethard, you showed your hand a little too soon.

Question of the moment: will the Geass work on a blind girl? Because I'm going to assume Lelouch will try it on VV and it'll fail, but what about Nunnally?

Never mind, Suzaku first. And now him and Kallen know! Understandably she's very confused, while Suzaku seems more disappointed. Will Kallen turn now that she knows it's Lelouch? Will she continue to follow him anyway? Hm...

Lelouch's dead man's switch is probably going to keep Suzaku from doing anything since it'll mean he'll die too and that "Live!" command is going to persist for a while. Thinking about it more that's a perverse thing to order for Suzaku considering he was originally looking for a way to die and now Euphemia's also gone after giving him hope.

And the season ends with a gunshot. I'm going to say it was Kallen just disabling Suzaku.

Post-ED scene! I was just wondering about CC, poor girl.

Some of the following speculation is based on reactions to the first-time viewer guesses in previous threads. Of course I could be heading the wrong direction, but I have no clue at this point.

[Wild speculation round 14](/s "After CC and VV comes BB, another mysterious stranger who knows about the Geass powers. Why BB? [C]harles [V]i [B]ritannia. All three of them are either aliens or humans infused with some mystic power that Charles somehow has control over. They're out creating Geass contracts with Britannian royals, including Mao at a young age because he had such potential. As they use their Geass and it grows stronger in them, eventually taking over, the energy is channeled back to Charles and enhances him as well. Eventually this gets to the point where he becomes God-Emperor via a strange ascension process using the Thought Elevator. CC feels personally responsible for Marianne's death as the queen was Geassed at the time, so she reveals some secret to Lelouch that can overthrow Charles. Even after everyone teams up, Lelouch is forced to sacrifice himself to bring Charles down and provide a safe world for Nunnally. Kallen is mildly depressed by that until Suzaku comforts her and they start dating, the end.")
>> ARTICLE
That last sentence in the speculation is pure heresy.
>> ARTICLE
>And really kids, the hair wasn't a dead giveaway that it was Kallen?

The only thing it had it common was the color, she has a different style for school. 
>> ARTICLE
I know, but how many pink haired girls have we seen that aren't princesses? 

Wait... 

Kallen's a *princess*?

I'm already on board for the actual _Yuki-Chan_.  I'm definitely on board for your idea.

>[Well that's horrible.](http://i.imgur.com/dxCk79f.png) She's doing a good job of ignoring it though, I was half expecting her to just keep asking Suzaku to die until she passed on. It was a good scene for her in the end.

I had (originally) expected her to struggle to reach for his throat with her weak hands, and not be able to exert any force toward choking him as she expired.

>[This is... kinda scary.](http://i.imgur.com/onXSnk8.png) I'm not sure how to interpret that. Is CC implying she'll get rid of everyone around him? Or that she'll still be with him after everyone else leaves him? Or just that since she's immune to the Geass he doesn't have to worry about her? It's the *only* that concerns me.

I think it's a fansub translation thing.  The dub has that as "I promise to stay with you to the very end.", and the retail subs have "At the very least, I'll stay with you to the end.".

>[poor Nina.](http://i.imgur.com/XDwxsQn.png) I've seen that image before without context and now I just sympathize with her.

Yeah, I've never understood why everyone seems to hate her either.

>Heh, Villetta took care of the thugs for sure.

That caught me by surprise.  How she got her memories back right at the instant she needed to be able to kick ass to save her hide.

>And the psycho lesbian brought a WMD to the battlefield. Finished that between the time Euphemia was assassinated to now? Couldn't have been that long.

I think she'd been working on it all along.  This was just her plugging it in and taking it live.

>I... guess this is probably the first time anyone's treated CC nicely ^(that didn't turn out to be crazy) ^^yet Still not sure what to think of [that kiss.](http://i.imgur.com/C7u1j8T.png) Oh CC...

*I'll* tell you what!  If Lelouch weren't so busy running around being Chessmaster I Hate My Dad Zero Thousand, he'd have a harem!  CC, Kallen, Shirley, that Lady Kaguya demi-loli, even some ambiguous Nunally-Imouto intrigue.
>> ARTICLE

That actually makes real medical sense, a shock of adrenaline in a life or death situation can trigger weird stuff in the brain.

Tbh, the character I felt most sorry for in these episodes was Cornelia. That 2 minute talk with Lelouch really speaks volumes about her character. She even understood why Lelouch actually became Zero.

I wouldn't feel too sorry for her, she did order civilians murdered just to lure out Zero early on.

Not only that, she keeps going on about "avenging Euphemia", when for all she knows, Euphemia was a psycho mass-murderer whose final massacre/genocide order Cornelia had to belay herself.

Yeah, I get the nutjob Nina refusing to believe Euphie could do no wrong, but Cornelia's pretty level-headed, and part of that includes not immediately assuming brainwashing.

When she gave him the Geass she told him it would force him to live a life of solitude, she basically means even if he drives everyone else away from him she will stay by his side


>> ARTICLE
And she told Mao the same thing, I imagine.
>> ARTICLE
"If I gave you power, could you go on? I propose a deal-in exchange for this power you must agree to make my one wish come true. Accept this contact and you accept its' conditions. While living in a world of humans, you will live unlike any other: a different providence, a different time, a different life. The power of the kind will condemn you to a life of solitude. Are you prepared for this?"

Is the quote from episode 1. It's defiantly foreshadowing the events to here. Lelouch is alone in his desire to make a world for Nunnally, alone in the black knights, alone in waking his path of blood. The final scene epitomizes that; his friend realized what he didn't want to accept, his follower realizing she knew nothing about who she was following. He stands there in opposition to everyone else. CC stands by him as an immortal witch, has her own game in which they are partners.

**Episode 23**

- Why are they actually carrying out Euphemias bizarre order? A higher up should have belayed it.
- Euphemia has always been a kind person, and now shell simply be remembered as the princess who snapped and ordered the slaughter of all Japanese people. All because of Lelouchs joke. Terribly sad.
- If Lelouch is going to be cold blooded enough to shoot a sister he loves, why would he not make sure to put the bullet in her head and make sure shes dead? Why, Lelouch are you giving her the chance to survive? Whats the point?
- CC as Suzaku flies in, Why now of all times. LOL
- How the hell is Euphemia resisting?
- [Lelouchs mother?](http://i.imgur.com/ktwDk4z.jpg)
- [Nina is devastated.](http://www.gfycat.com/OrnatePoliticalBarasingha)
- Son of a bitch, CCs been talking to Marianne. She is alive. Im still convinced the Emperor was shown doing the same thing, so its possible CC could be talking to him as well. Or the Emperor was talking with Marianne but that would mean they might be working together. The murder was staged, maybe? Oh man, if Lelouchs mother ends up being a bad guy Im gonna be disappointed.
- VV. The ground collapse person was a boy. Cant blame me for thinking he was a girl with that [fabulous hair.](http://i.imgur.com/wzl4MEt.jpg) Anyway, first real evidence of someone very similar to CC, if only because of his name.
- Wonderful maniacal laughter courtesy of Johnny Yong Bosch.

**Episode 24**

- Jeremiah says CC has an affliction. Is this something new that we dont know about her or is it just referencing her strange powers?
- They tricked me. I thought Lelouchs Geass was changing, and his voice was starting to affect people; no line of sight required. Turns out he set it up ahead of time so those people would activate when he gave the midnight  warning. Clever.
- A new OP with just two episodes left? Or will it carry over to R2? Again, Im kind of new to this so I dont really know how seasons work in anime. Whatever. Not that important. Good song.
- Im surprised Lelouch has yet to question if his father could have Geass.
- Its always seemed odd how mechs move exactly like humans, yet it seems incredibly complicated to control. It looks 1000x tougher than say, flying a fighter jet today, but everyone seems to pick it up easily enough.
- Amnesia gone or does Villetta still have her skills? Probably amnesia gone.
- Lord Odysseus. Quite a name.
- Command center at the and Lelouch finishes my thought before I can finish writing it. Simple enough thought process. Protect Nunally. Its still a war, but its probably the safest place.
- Suzaku has come a long way. Now he can just [slice through](http://www.gfycat.com/TenseCheerfulArmyworm) the bullet from the super electro magnetic shrapnel cannon.
- VV looks like he could be a son of the Emperor. I guess its possible he could be whatever CC is and a prince. Then again he [doesnt have any markings](http://i.imgur.com/VvF3VCO.jpg) on him. I dont know. Well see.
- Poor Nina. What is she working on?
- The maid is helping CC too? What the hell is her angle?
- Aires? Couple of fancy new names this episode. And CC knows who Aires is. Probably another sibling.
- Fantastic. Was wondering what Darltons order would be, exactly. Didnt see that coming. [Great scene.](http://www.gfycat.com/FoolhardyTidyAuklet)
- And Nunallys not safe. Damn it.

**Episode 25**

- After the past few episodes Ive been wondering what everything would be like if Lelouch just let his hate go. Cornelia understands. You killed them all for the sake of that madness? Surely the war wouldnt have progress as fast or even at all. ^hail ^britannia All Nunally wanted was to live a happy life with Lelouch. If he couldve just moved on, everything would likely be rather peaceful.
- Wow. Lelouch has been waiting ~20 episodes for this conversation, and Cornelia knows nothing.
- Im begging you, please die. Thats not how it works for you, Jeremiah. You have to do the work.
- For what special reason did they choose Jeremiah to experiment on? He was a disgraced soldier, and rather crazy about killing Zero. Surely they couldve used anyone else that would have been a little easier to control.
- Be crushed to dust, you relic. Great line.
- Ninas really freaking out. I didnt realize she was that damn smart to make a bomb capable of blowing up the entire Tokyo settlement. I guess Lloyd helped her out a bit and provided her with materials.
- Who activated the trap? VV?
- CC is a witch? What? She doesnt even know what she is. Always existing with the endless flow of eternity, I am utterly alone. Is she being reborn or something. Because if she just heals herself after each time she dies, wouldnt the people just immediately kill her again. Oh snap, well thats probably why they thought she was a witch. Still though, the images of her burning that would just be endless pain. Wtf is going on here?
- And Lelouch wants to be a demon. Sounds promising.
- Whaaaaaat? [A kiss.](http://www.gfycat.com/NeedyCheeryAidi) Is CC falling for him because he is standing by her side? And why, WHY does she keep saying she wants *Lelouch* to succeed?
- Bigger things are happening than Japan vs Britannia. Im surprised the rebels are so disorganized without Zero though. Stop complaining and step it up, Black Knights.
- Fucking Suzaku.
- Show yourself to him, Lelouch.
- Way too tense.
- Nope. No no. [Cant end there.](http://www.gfycat.com/UnitedJoyfulAsianelephant) Nuh, uh. I want more.

This could still go so many ways I have no speculation right now. Have some more gifs.

You'd think Cornelia would have been watching her little sister and could override her right away.

I... don't remember that. Think I might need to rewatch a view scenes and revise my speculation.

> CCs been talking to Marianne. She is alive.

I was thinking she was just kind of talking to Marianne in the afterlife, like how people talk to others that simply aren't present for one reason or another without expecting a response. Or their pets.

> VV looks like he could be a son of the Emperor. I guess its possible he could be whatever CC is and prince.

[Crazy speculation time](/s "The Emperor's and CC's son? She's immortal and doesn't seem to age, so it's not outright impossible.")

She was helping Diethard earlier too. No clue why either.

That's my reasoning, and see my post's speculation for why. I might have to change that though.

> Crazy speculation time

Oh, that'd be messed up and awesome.

And the picture of what I thought might be Lelouch's mother came by so quick.

**edit to add a little more**

You made me think about Marianne a bit more. You said maybe CC was talking to her in the after life. Remember world of C? Hmmm, so maybe we're both right. She's "dead" but "alive" wherever (and whatever) World of C is.

Out of curiosity, have you been able to not give in and watch more than the scheduled episodes at all?

I have only watched these first 25 episodes. I've enjoyed participating in these threads so I don't want to go binge the rest of the series in the next few days while everyone else watches it over the next two weeks.

God, watching three episodes was too easy. I'll hold out though.

> Aires? Couple of fancy new names this episode. And CC knows who Aires is. Probably another sibling.

By Aries she's referring to the Aries Palace which is where Lelouch and Nunnally grew up when they were still living in the Brittanian homeland.  Clovis designed the top of the government building to look like the Aries Palace.  Cornelia commented on this to Euphie a couple episodes ago because she thought it was odd that he would do it since he considered Lelouch to be a rival.
>> ARTICLE
I  forgot Cornelia mentioned that to Euphemia. I knew CC and Lelouch said it was a palace, but I thought it could have been named after someone important. Just a name I guess? The importance is that it's where Lelouch and Nunnally grew up and that CC knows about it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah exactly.  Lelouch never actually told CC about it and add to that the fact that the person she's been having these one sided conversations with this whole time has been Marianne, Lelouch's mom, she knows a lot more about him than she's letting on.  I mean if you remember the very first scene of the series shows her watching Lelouch and Suzaku as kids so...
>> ARTICLE
Episode 23:

Euphy :( 

Seriously, the part where Lelouch confronts her and she goes back to being perky-cheerful, "I want you to help govern Japan with me!" is absolutely heartbreaking. The Geass has a hold of her, but she's still such a gentle kind soul.

Euphy resisting the command when it comes to Suzaku. Ow my feels.

[This music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPIottDSPl4) I hate what happens to Euphy, but the soundtrack is so good for it.

The phone call between Lelouch and Suzaku at the end is really, really intense. It makes everything feel like it's really reached the Point of No Return. No going back anymore. No going back to how things were. Euphy's death marks the point where nobody can back down.

Episode 24:

Damn, Lelouch plans ahead. How many innocent people did he kill with the collapse, I wonder?

I fucking love this new OP. I wish it were used for more than just two episodes.

Fuck yeah, Guilford. On the other hand, nerf the Gawain. 

Odysseus is kind of a wimp but Schneizel is awesome as hell. I wonder if Charles would prefer the younger son inherit the throne. 

I love the scene where Kallen reveals herself to the student council. It's another one of those "no going back now" moments. 

VV is a creepy little shit. 

Not being able to fly really, really hurts Kallen in this fight. 

Darlton :( He was such a decent guy. Being made to attack Cornelia is probably literally the last thing he would want.

Episode 25:

Can we talk about how adorable teenage Cornelia was in the flashback? A big revelation that Marianne was the one who called off her own security, though. 

Jeremiah's entrance here is one of the best in the series. His dub actor absolutely nails the "I'm begging you, please die" line. 

Lelouch's obsession with Nunnally really does fuck over everyone else, doesn't it? 

I like that Suzaku and Arthur have a meaningful glance when he's taking off. The cat and the Knight mutually respect each other.

Nina's gone off the deep end. Interesting that Rakshata respects Lloyd so much that she instantly agrees to his ceasefire when seeing how freaked out he is.

Lelouch fucks everything up, seriously.

The confrontation between Lelouch, Suzaku and Kallen at the end of this episode is one of the best ending scenes to a season (hell, to a series) I've ever seen. It's crazy intense from start to finish. 

I really enjoyed Geass R1! This is the second time I've watched it, but I've never been able to stick with R2 more than an episode or two. I'm hoping I'll be able to change that watching it with you guys.
>> ARTICLE
Be sure to stick with us during R2!! Always fun with more people commenting how they reacts to my favorite anime.

I'll try! I know some pretty major spoilers, notably regarding the end, but I'm excited to see how they play out.

This is a message to all the people who dropped R2. As well as new comers alike as someone who has watched the series in total about 5-6 times switching between dub/sub not including this one. Trust me when I say you will want to stick with R2. Its just such a crazy and amazing ride and the ending to this series is my favorite of all the anime I have watched. And trust me when I say its a lot more than 250 since I last I updated the list which was like 3 years ago now.

also a shutout to /u/Durinthal /u/Neawia /u/rascorpia 

Cant wait to see you guys in R2 because damn did you people make me laugh and smile so much more during this re-watch it has been my favorite one yet.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently Ive watched R2 when it was on television but I dont remember doing so. I was waiting for R2 ending to happen in season 1 but then when it got to it it was the standoff.

Its obvious I got hit with a Geass and wiped my memory only to regain them from the trigger (*yes I did*) of season 1 ending
>> ARTICLE
I think R2 was pretty bad but I have to say that the ending is by far the best ending I've seen in anime.

It feels like the writing really scrambles to deal with the timeslot change that screwed over a number of their plans for R2, but they managed to right the ship in time at least to get across the ending I feel like they wanted and that was pretty perfect for the series.

Uggggghhhhhhhhhhhh do I have to? 

Can't wait to get back to the one episode format. Being employed is a bitch. Back when I was doing the FMA:B I was still job hunting so dedicating 3 hours of my free time a day to do write ups was not too bad. Now for this even 1-2 hours is a huge chunk of my free time. It pretty much goes work -> eat -> housekeeping -> shower -> geass -> comments -> bed -> work

Don't get me wrong, I love interacting with you guys and I'm not about to stop, I just feel like bitching today so sit there, listen and nod your head.

Coincidentally, as I am writing this post will be late, so sorry about that.

**Episode 23**

* Sometimes I feel like the Britannian soldiers are like storm troopers. The Black Knights seem to be able to win these battles just by charging with zero effort so it makes me wonder why they even bother fighting from the shadows in the first place.
* She ded.
* Lelouch is fighting this civil war in part because of his sister, so it seems mildly ironic that he ends up killing his sister
* Speaking of which, he really needs to discover some kind of fail-safe where he can override or cancel an order he has given
* Wonder how the Viceroy will act from now on
* Nothing more dangerous than a pissed off sister
* On top of all the death, it is especially brutal how someone can have their self control taken away from them, forcing them to do things that they would otherwise rather die than do. 
* Lelouch needs to die
* He goes on my most hated main characters list
* It's interesting how Euphy is able to take back control, even if only temporarily. Does a person gain more control back the closer they are to death? or could it be that a close personal connection can to a person or object can snap them back to reality?
* Convenient timing on that phone call Nunnally
* Lelouch seems to be asking the same questions
* Crowd Control needs to die too
* Outside of Cheese-kun there is little to like about her
* Yuri girl is going insane as to be expected
* Wonder who she will take that grief out on
* Zero hopefully
* CC keeps talking to herself. Does she have [FMA Spoilers](/s "A Philosophers stone inside of her?")
* Lelouch may have his army now but woah, he just made A LOT of very pissed off enemies
* Oh hey it's caster from before
* He's not an idol little girl
* Counteraction rising                                  
                 Yeah we are ready for the punch line                
                   Theres no use with all your Geass             
                SO CHECK JEREMIAH OUT!               
* RoboJERE to the rescue

**Episode 24**

* Now he doesn't even need to be looking at them in the eye to use the Geass? 
* So what if he orders a Pizza hut delivery and indirectly orders the entire world population to give him Pizza hut?
* Wait in this a new OP? Just for the last two episodes? 
* K.O
* Don't know what he expected. You don't stand between a man and his revenge if you do not want to get hurt
* I don't even understand why no one was fazed when Lelouch stole his mech. It single highhandedly takes on half the Britannian army like it's sweeping dust off the floor
* Asshole cat seems poised to take on the Black Knights
* There is hope for him yet
* COME ON SHIRLEY YOU ARE SO CLOSE TO EXPOSING HIS IDENTITY
* Suzaku is dual wielding again. This makes me very happy.
* FYI Viceroy better not die. Too many good Britanians have died already. Best girl must not become one of those people.
* This just got me thinking. How the hell did Space Dandy's sidechick get her memories back? Seems a bit contrived that she just so happens to get them back at a crucial turning point in the story
* Not that I can complain about Britannian double agent action
* [Gendo...is that you?](http://i.imgur.com/it0DX9G.png)
* Dayum. That Bureau is packing some heat.
* Wait where exactly is the school? Lelouch seems to be able to get from the battlefield to the school and back to the battlefield again really quick
* Without that Mech the Black Knights would be nothing I swear
* R.I.P Space Dandy
* YES NUNNALLY
* RALLY THE TEAM
* HELP SUZAKU KILL THESE BASTARDS
* AND YURI GIRL TOO!!!
* It's all coming together
* Oooooooh Caster has business with Nunnally 
* I'm starting to like him. Seems like he has a plan to counteract Lelouch

**Episode 25**

* Best girl is going to live?
* Right?
* Right???
* ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!
* ROBOJERE!!!!!
* Kill Lelouch but make sure to call a medic for best girl too
* ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!
* He is channeling my patriotism right now
* Not R.I.P Space Dandy
* YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
* ASSHOLE CAT YOU ARE SOMETIMES OKAY I GUESS
* The tides of battle are turning in our favour
* I hope Viceroy is just resting
* But Knight of honour is going to kill Lelouch at last
* There you have it folks. Yuri love creates nukes.
* I don't want Crowd Controls tripy backstory I just want her taken out
* So the ass pull cannon has ammo now?
* Random kiss is random
* AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
* I've waited all season for the Black Knights to finally fall
* Caster is a god damn genius
* Suzaku you beautiful human being
* Maybe a small part of my black heart is open to accepting a loyal eleven dog such as yourself
* These characters must be trained Ninja's. RoboJere, Kallen, Suzaku they all managed to sneak up on people without making a sound
* "Your very existence is a mistake" Preach it.
* DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNN
* Great, now we have to wait for the sequel, anyone know when it is airing?

[Insert some thought provoking comment about those episodes here]

For real, I would write my thoughts on it all but I hear we are having an overall discussing thread so I might as well save it for then. 

3 episodes done. You're welcome /r/anime. 

Quick question: I have heard that season 2 is not as good as season 1. What do you guys personally think? I'm going to watch it anyway but do you think I will enjoy it as much?
>> ARTICLE
it's still good, just has  few issues, like pacing
>> ARTICLE
Honestly after just seeing season 1 again it does nothing more than confirm for me that i like season 2 better. Season 2 for me is a lot like season 1. But with better exciting moments and all around craziness.
>> ARTICLE
I see you've rated the series a 5 to a 6 to 10 yesterday back to 5 today. You seem to be enjoying the series so I'm surprised you'd give it the average mark. Are your ratings from a critical perspective or enjoyment based?

I try to be at least reasonably critical so my scores do lean that way. I joke around sometimes though, which is why the new Yuki Nagato series is rated a 10/10 at the moment and it's also why Code Geass shot up to a 10 after episode 22. 

Of course the higher rated shows on my completed list will be ones I enjoyed in addition to being critical so I'm not *that* uptight.

I really enjoyed the first season of Code Geass but there was no shortage of contrivances, plot holes, weak side characters and a culmination of some smaller issues that brought it down to a five. 

Granted, some fans have filled in a lot of the blanks and given their own explanation for some of these problems but that doesn't cut it for me. I feel that if a show relies on the fans to interpret a character or event because they did not clearly convey the point across then it needs to be called out for it. 

It's like letting a spoiled dog shit all over the living room carpet, cleaning up after it then patting it on the head saying "Good doggie". I appreciate the effort people put into their explanations but for me there is a difference between leaving something intentionally open to interpretation and leaving things open to interpretation because they don't want to/can't dedicate the time to do it themselves.

Turned into a bit of a rant/crazed ramble but I hope I got the point across (the irony).
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is like a media empire, a lot of information and backstory is in other forms of media. Depending on what the situation is, something could easily be explained based on other knowledge gained within the franchise.

>> ARTICLE
I would say that if something is clear to certain viewers but not to others, then it becomes a question of comparing and analyzing the amount of evidence involved for each side of the argument.

When the largest portion of the supporting proof for a particular opinion is directly provided by the show itself, not just the ramblings of an individual or collective which does not consider all the information available, then the matter isn't simply one of fans making stuff up because the show is lazy.

In other words, I think interpretations should ideally go beyond the positive subjectivity of the fans of a series and the negative subjectivity of its critics (because, as a matter of fact, that sort of bias cuts both ways).

I won't argue over all the reasons behind different ranking philosophies, because they are literally infinite, but for the record my score for the first season is an 8/10. I've debated over lowering the score or not, but rewatching the series has served to reinforce it in my own case.

I think Code Geass is a very unrealistic and theatrical soap opera or even just a grand stage performance, which is supported by the stylistic elements and events of the show as well as external background materials, where the contrivances are basically a natural part of how it wants to present itself. Without those, then the operatic and larger-than-life nature of the whole thing would be lost. It doesn't want to be a subtle, down-to-earth tale.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I understand your point. I always rate series based purely on enjoyment so sometimes I have lower ratings for some of the highest critically acclaimed shows of all time.

Code Geass is pretty much a trainwreck. But it's a glorious, majestic trainwreck with tons of problems but no shortage of entertainment. Critically It really shouldn't be rated as highly as it is on MAL, but I think many people just love how ridiculous it is.

A 10 for me is if I pretty much binge watch it as fast as possible and still constantly think about how great it was and how much I enjoyed it, which is why I have Geass in my top 3 anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is a certain tendency to popularly overrate the show yet also to critically underrate it, by assuming that the series being so entertaining was some sort of mistake. Nothing could be more incorrect. 

Conversely, I honestly prefer to consider Code Geass the Anti-Trainwreck because its huge success is the result of multiple factors working in its favor, which cannot be properly explained by a purely negative approach that loses sight of the forest in the rush to nitpick the trees to death.

A comprehensive evaluation of Code Geass should consider more than its real or perceived flaws alone. There are virtues too. It has an openly acknowledged method to the madness that, as the creators intended, allows the audience to find both raw entertainment and a fairly high interest value throughout the series. 

The showrunners knew it was ridiculously over-the-top, as seen by their putting in numerous in-jokes you wouldn't find in a truly super-serious production and their willingness to happily throw realism out the window from early on, while also taking care to make right decisions with respect to some fundamentals beneath the grandiose insanity.

Plenty of other shows have similar or worse flaws. Plenty of other shows have similar or greater degrees of craziness. But not all of those are necessarily entertaining nor interesting enough, which is something that the term "trainwreck" absolutely obscures. It's precisely that way of thinking which leads to the failures of its superficial copycats.

Oh I stopped taking the 'top anime' on MAL seriously a long time ago, so it no longer bothers me. 

Ultimately there is nothing wrong with just enjoying a show for what it is and Code Geass **does not fail** to entertain.

>> ARTICLE
> but differ so much on, say, Baccano and Nodame Cantabile.

Those scores are pretty malformed since they are still in my currently watching. In the case of the former I've only watched the first episode so far so that is why it might seem odd to see it rated a 3 when you use the 'shared anime' feature.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice that, makes sense. And yeah, the first episode of Baccano is probably the worst and I didn't particularly enjoy it the first time I saw it.
>> ARTICLE
> I feel that if a show relies on the fans to interpret a character or event because they did not clearly convey the point across then it needs to be called out for it.

Most of the answers the fanbase comes up with are derived from just rewatching and analyzing the whole thing. So, in essence, all the info is still there, you just have to dig though a pile of rubble (not to be mistaken for poo poo) to get to those.

I've said it back during episode 2 or so but Code Geass has next to no wasted runtime. Even during the lighthearted SoL scenes, something is always brought up to flesh out the world and its characters a bit more little by little, even though those instances only last very very briefly at times.

To be frank, most (or one, skipping all the vagueness) fan theories also rely on complex hoop jumping based on reasoning about an element no one understands...

The worst ones, in my experiences, are the theories that rely too much on the unexplained magical or mystical elements, which probably includes the specific one you are thinking of. The ones I consider more valid don't tend to focus on that subject.

> Can't wait to get back to the one episode format. Being employed is a bitch. Back when I was doing the FMA:B I was still job hunting so dedicating 3 hours of my free time a day to do write ups was not too bad. Now for this even 1-2 hours is a huge chunk of my free time. It pretty much goes work -> eat -> housekeeping -> shower -> geass -> comments -> bed -> work

I can totally understand you. It's the same for me... usually I leave home at 8:00 and come back around 19:00, busy project... that's why I cannot do such nice write-ups...

Season 2 has some problems with pacing and dues ex machina solutions to win battles.  Additionally there are issues with the way some of the characters act if you really break down their personalities and motivations.  However, that being said I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time I watched it and didn't even notice the above mentioned critiques until they were pointed out to me afterwards.  If you liked S1 you should enjoy S2 just as much.  Additionally S2 has what is considered one of the greatest endings in all of anime so you will definitely want to be extra vigilant about spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Pacing is definitely a problem at times, and there are certainly contrived solutions (not all of which are DEM though, I think that term is too liberally thrown around at any unrealistic sequence of events), yet I would argue most of the characters actually act in ways that follow not only their personalities and motivations but, more importantly, their mental and emotional states of mind. 

No matter how old or intelligent you are supposed to be, you will not be a cold and calculating machine if your own personal biases and emotional mood swings make you lose control.

Some dudes tend to far too easily blow up over certain characters doing irrational or simply stupid things, without stopping to think about what those fictional beings might be experiencing or feeling. Human beings don't always act in the most rational or optimal ways, so why should these characters? Flaws of all kinds have a role to play.

I've discussed some of the most common complaints about character behavior in other forums and often found them to be rather superficial, narrow-minded and too quick to judge events out of context.

Even though he is my favorite anime character of all time, I have no problem with you hating Lelouch. He is a very polarizing character after all, so as long as you're not indifferent about him I'm fine with it.

But I do have to ask in all seriousness: Do you really sympathize with Britannia THAT much (you know, discrimination and slavery and shit) because you're still subconsciously trying to convince yourself that Britannia is the equivalent to Great Britain because of a similiar name or is it just a thing you do to be funny? I'm starting to become seriously worried about your mental health. ^/s

I think it is your mental health that should be called into question if you cannot see Britannia for the glorious empire that it is. It's social Darwinism, the filthy elevens are treated like cattle because they are naturally inferior to Britannians, it is in their genes to bow and scrape at the feet of the better race.

And I really wish people would stop trying to convince me that 'Great Britain' exists. It's the Bielefeld Conspiracy all over again...

Not sure if you realized later, but Lelouch didn't gain the ability to influence people using just his voice. He had that command set to trigger at a certain time. And, I think you will find Cornelia becomes much kinder but just as badass as the series goes on.

about your Question Season 2 is most definitely verry enjoyable.I'd personally say the beginning part and the end are verry good but there is definitely a part in the middle where it kind of streches on and it feels like the eps could have been used better.

And also while Lelouch still has a Strategie that he follows for the most part during the Battels themselfs, the focus is much less on the Tactics and more on the individual fights between the pilots and depending on how you like the fights that might be a + or a - in your Book personally i preferd the way Season 1 handels the fights but I cant deny that some of the fights are really pretty intense.

Season 2 has its flaws but they dont stop it from beeing entertaining

I'd say it's not quite as consistent as season 1, with some real low points, but the highs are just as high if not higher.  The ending though, oh that beautiful wonderous ending, makes all of this worth it.  It's a huge part of the reason why Code Geass is so highly regarded.

The thing I never understood was why Lelouche's reveal caused Kallen to freeze up like that.  She knew he wasn't Japanese, and it wasn't like she and Lelouche were especially close (that she knew of, anyway).

She expected something completely different out of the man behind the mask. She had initially judged Lelouch to be the opposite of Zero back in episode 9 or so, and his devil-may-care attitude towards her and the liberation of Japan during the last episode was quite unnerving. Lelouch was speaking like a villain there, not like a great leader.

Can I just list off how uncharacteristically stupid Lelouch is in these episodes? 'Cause I'm gonna.

* First, he blows his ONE chance to indefinitely Geass Cornelia. And, don't go giving me that shit that he was "too noble" to do it. He hates her guts, and should have had no qualms stealing her free will forever.

* Two, he leaves in the middle of a make-or-break battle without even ATTEMPTING to think up a good excuse, thereby not only practically ensuring loss, but also making the Black Knights think he's a coward.

* Three, when faced with Suzaku pointing a gun at his head, rather than removing the helmet and revealing himself, at least giving himself a chance at showing to Suzaku and Kallen he has some nobility and trust in them, he has to have Suzaku shoot in off.

* Four, (this doesn't actually involve Lelouch; I'm just ranting right now) Jeremiah's return was WAY too short for all the build-up.

On the plus-side, Nina finally made the [face that made a thousand lesbians' ovaries burst.](http://i.imgur.com/cO1hiWa.png)

Honestly just felt like lelouch was in shock. Although thats a pretty bad excuse all in all. Also the whole commanding someone to give up tgeir free will is a massive plothole. The show would quickly make no sense if lelouch commanded everyone to obey his every command. I dont blame the show for no explaining the plotholes by putting up bs restrictions tailored to the plot. 
>> ARTICLE
His stupidity often involves personal affairs or family matters. Lelouch is too obsessed with Nunnaly's well-being and other personal biases, even when it hurts his own supposedly ideological cause, and he thinks that after getting his hands so dirty it's not even worth trying to excuse himself (a position I completely disagree with, but I can see why he thinks that). 
>> ARTICLE
Stupid Lelouch is best Lelouch. The great part about this anime is that despite his super power and crazy intellect, he still shows a lot of human flaws. As he should being 17 years old. He tries to take on the world and finds out there are a lot of things he can't deal with. The effect grief has on him, how he panics, his emotions. He makes miscalculations and when he does it's spectacular. It gets highlighted even more when he faces off against his foes in R2 as some of them are the pure analytical/calculating types that do not let emotions effect them.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people seem to miss this, and it's always the ones who call Lelouch a Gary Stu or make the same stupid "keikaku doori" comments.
>> ARTICLE
I think he couldn't bring himself to Geass Cornelia because he still feels tremendous guilt over what happened with Euphie. That whole incident is throwing an extra dimension to him where it's not about being strictly noble or strictly a rebel anymore. Despite how much he wants to be purely rational, he can't. And that's why he shows himself to Suzaku the way he does. There was too much guilt in him to keep playing Zero straight forever.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. That actually makes a lot of sense.

Oh, thank God. I was worried that we were continuing the 2 a day schedule and saving the last episode for tomorrow. I've seen the show a ton of times before, but still, that would have been awful.

A few episodes ago, someone asked about the in universe history of Knightmare Frames.  Since I had some free time today, I figured I'd put together a "quick" summary about where they come from and their history up to around where we are. (I also figured this would be a nice break from some of the doom and gloom in the recent episodes) This'll be primarily about Britannian machines, with only some mentions of significant non-Britannian frames.

It started with the creation of the 'emergency survival cockpit' for conventional vehicles.  Feeling that metal boxes with rockets and parachutes wasn't providing enough mobility, someone decided that they needed legs.  Since the cockpits were small, they were only able to attach two legs, resulting in. . .walking cockpits(...?) that were the first 'generation' of Knightmares.

The second gen saw the creation and implementation of Landspinners and Factspheres to the design.  Since these new technologies performed erratically (and it wasn't really about emergencies or survival anymore), R&D was outsourced to two groups: a Britannian military-based robotics project (who put weapons on them and called them 'Knightmares') and a private more social-oriented group, the Ashford Foundation (who essentially began what amounts to a massive PR campaign for their 'Frames')

In the third generation, the Ashford Foundation built the Ganymede prototype, the first Knightmare designed by someone with a brain, and as such, the basis for nearly all the Knightmares to follow.  The pilot for the Ganymede and the 'face' of the project was a commoner known as 'Marianne the Flash' (I was going to call her Marianne Lamperouge, but apparently, that's just fanon).  In doing this, she caught the eye of the Emperor, Charles zi Britannia, and was made one of the Knights of the Round (six, and later two) before becoming Charles' fifth wife.  The meteoric rise of Marianne (a 'commoner') and the Ashford Foundation alongside her (her 'sponsors,' gaining too much power, too fast) created many feelings of ill will amongst the imperial court.  Marianne's assassination all but destroyed the Ashfords, losing both their business and their noble status, who retreated to Japan.  

This left all Knightmare production to the military, who had begun to incorporate the unstable but superconductive material Sakuradite as a power source in the new 'Yggdrasil Drive' to allow Knightmares to perform at effective combat levels (this is also why Knightmares explode so easily, since a strong impact directly to sakuradite makes it explode).

The fourth generation saw the first mass-produced Knightmare, the Glasgow, which was first deployed in the Second Pacific War (invasion of Japan).  Their high speed allowed them to completely dominate the Japanese forces, only losing a single battle to Tohdoh in what would become known as the 'miracle of Itsukushima.'  The Glasgow was also the introduction of the Slash Harken, essentially a weaponized hookshot.  Though the Glasgow has been retired from the military, many of them have been given to the police force, who switched up the weaponry and rechristened them 'Knightpolice.'  Glasgows are also the most common Knightmare unit among rebel groups, as seen with Kallen's old Glasgow and the 'Burais' (modified Glasgows) that were given to the Black Knights in R1.

It's pretty straightforward from here.  Gen five saw the Sutherlands, which were a general improvement all around.  The sixth generation is known as the missing generation, since nothing happened except for the Gawain, the Knightmare Lelouch stole and used in R1, which was essentially a prototype for a bunch of new tech.

Gen seven is primarily the Lancelot (and the various mass-produced Vincents that were based on it).  The biggest innovation in the Lancelot is that Sakuradite is scattered throughout the frame of the Knightmare, dramatically increasing performance and allowing the use of the MVS (Maser Vibration Sword) and the Blaze Luminous shields.  It also means that anyone piloting it is insane, especially if it doesn't have an ejection system.  The Guren Mk-II is considered the equivalent of a seventh generation frame, though instead of being made of explosives, it sacrifices all long-ranged weaponry for close-combat instadeath.

The other Knights of the Round all have eighth generation frames, which saw the general adoption of float systems, energy shields, giant lasers, transformers, dual vibrating scythes(?), and other improvements all around.  Other eighth gen frames include the Shen Hu(Xing-ke), the Zangetsu(Tohdoh), and the Shinkir(Lelouch).

Wow, that was a lot longer than I thought it'd be.  It was fun to write up, though I'll understand if no one reads the whole thing.

tl;dr: 

1st gen: let's put legs on an ejection seat!

2nd gen: let's put wheels on those legs!

3rd gen: let's use an unstable ~~bomb~~ rock as the power source! (also: Lelouch's mom dies)

4th-6th gen: let's use these to take over Japan/kill people!

7th gen: Anyone who pilots a 7th gen Knightmare is insane. (except for Kallen, she's best girl)

8th gen: things get ridiculous, but you already knew that

What about the Gloucesters? (The ones Cornelia and her henchmen use) Where do they fit in?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I guess I missed those.  Much like there were modified Glasgows, there were modified Sutherlands as well, though they weren't nearly as common, the Gloucesters being the only notable example.  Gloucesters were designed for better close-combat than a standard Sutherland, and often came along with a jousting lance.  Despite being considered generally superior to the Sutherland, the difference was not enough to warrant a new generation (they were both in the fifth), or even replacement, as we see both being used in R2.

Edit:  As a side note, the improvements made both to the Lancelot (making it the Lancelot Conquista) and the Guren (making it the Guren Flight-Enabled Version [which, really, they should have kept the Guren names in Japanese, it would have made sense, and Kashshiki sounds a lot better than Flight-Enabled Version {Nishiki and Mk-II are about equal in my eyes <wow, I'm getting carried away with this>}]) were not considered enough to boost them up a generation either, so they're still both in Gen Seven.
>> ARTICLE
This is amazing work.
> especially if it doesn't have an ejection system

Isn't one actually installed in R1 after Cecile complains about it though?
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, it hasn't been confirmed whether or not the Lancelot has been given an ejection block, though I imagine it would be fairly high up on everyone's priority list (except maybe Lloyd).
>> ARTICLE
R1 ep 17 @17:50 when Toudou slashes Suzakus cabin open and everyone finds out Suzaku is the one piloting Lancelot Lloyd says : "It doesn't have an escape block yet". That pretty much confirms that they were like "Lol screw safety NEEDS MORE BOOM BOOM !!!" even that far into the show. Further evidence in next ep when the geass command to live didn't make Suzaku immediately eject himself (could be that running with Lancelot was more efficient but since Live command made him go full primal instincts I don't think he thought that far ahead)  And this was just b4 they installed the flight thingy which they mounted directly on his back, effectively making it impossible to now eject his whole cockpit since there is something blocking the way.

So yea only Suzaku is crazy enough to be in a knightmare that has no escape pod. 
Which suits him perfectly and we can see the reason why Lloyd says on couple occasions that they wouldn't be able to find a devicer for Lancelot if they lost Suzaku. (ofc he is also incredibly agile and generally good in combat)
>> ARTICLE
Well first of all i feel its kinda unfortunate that we are discussing the 13th and 14th eps rather than the 12th and 13th, but thats just our schedule.

Episode 13 breaks my heart no matter how many times i watch it. I choked up hard during those last five minutes. And knowing what was coming just made it worse. Rolo may well be quite an interesting character in his own right but ill be damned if i dont absolutely loathe him. I never particularly cared for him but when i first watched the show every time he appeared on screen after this i just wanted him to die right then and there. 

Shirley may not be the most popular girl in the show, but i find her story and love for Lelouch absolutely heartbreaking and one of the saddest personal arcs in the show. When i think about everything she went through, having her father killed by zero, having her memories wiped against her will and still ends up falling in love with Lelocuh for a second time. Even after regaining her memories she still cant see Lelouch as a bad guy and ends up wanting to be by his side, even after all the suffering he has caused her. Call it unrealistic or whatever but i cant help but love her. Her death scene alone is heartbreaking, but the fact that her death was avoidable makes it all a lot worse. Now im biased as fuck but  for me she is easily the most interesting and overall best girl of the show.

Also, people keep saying "Lelouch killed Shirley's dad", but in fact he was just caught in a side-effect of a battle.  It's a little unfair to assign Lulu full guilt on that one.
>> ARTICLE
Or to assign him the blame of wiping her memory. Honestly, that was one of the better options. He could've handled it better, but keeping her out of everything he was involved in was probably for the best.
>> ARTICLE
So, rather than add to the massive walls of bullet points flying around I've just got two things:

-For anyone who doubted how Lelouche actually felt about Shirley, keep in mind that he jumped *entirely off* a building in order to go after her.  Purely on reflex.  He'd be dead if Suzaku hadn't been there.

-When Kenoshita asks if it was really necessary to shoot children, am I the only one thought 'actually, yeah, kinda'?

Edit: Also, I realize this makes me a heretic around here, but I actually like this OP more than JIBUN WOOOO.

Fuck everything about this episode. Shirley is the only character Lelouch cares about not hurting. He hurts Nunally, he hurts Kallen, he hurts everyone, but is committed to seeing out the end of his actions. Shirley is the only one he loves enough to actively try and prevent getting hurt. It's absolute bullshit that people don't like Shirley even though she's clearly the only person Lelouch can bring himself to love. Udder bullshit that Rolo is such a cunt. Fuck this episode, Shirley is the best girl for Lelouch, anybody who says otherwise is wrong.

Thanks to all of you who responded to me yesterday. Im glad there are others who agree with me on that whole spoiler tease issue. Again, Im not mad about it. I just wanted to bring it to everyones attention again so thanks for listening. Also, [this link right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34v048/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqyb2gf) should take you to my comment from yesterdays thread which now has my episode 12 write up!

~~Yes! Episodes 14 and 15 today! Only ten episodes left! Lets do this people.~~ ^hahahaha I watched the correct episodes, dont worry. ;)

**Episode 13**

*So this turned out to be pretty funny. At least I think so. The stuff in parentheses is my reaction to my reactions after having gone back and watched episode 12.*

Someones freaking out. Shirleys getting her memories back from dreams? (I thought the power of dreams was truly powerful)

NEW OP! Welcome back, FLOW. I did like the previous OP though. It was good.

Ummm, Sayokos looking badass. (the only reason I accepted this was because she had a moment in the OP where she looked like a ninja so I thought theyd explain it more)

How did Shirley get her memory back? Seriously? (at this point I was apparently confused/angry that no explanation was given)

Jeremiah and Villetta are about to meet up.

Holy shit though. Who the hell is Sayoko? (She went full on ninja, and they had yet to explain it more. I thought it was highly possible that your theory was coming true, /u/Durinthal)

Cornelia. Still a bad bitch. VV wants to kill God so man wont fight?

Jeremiah can break Geass. Interesting. (He just keeps getting upgrades so I let it slide)

Sayoko nooooo! Shell be alright. Horrifying sheik.

Jeremiah is part of the order? So VV and Charles are probably as well, and also those guys with the robes.

Still love the Suzaku/Lelouch [teamwork.](http://i.imgur.com/aTr3iBd.jpg)

So I wonder if others will have Jeremiahs power of un-Geassing people. Or if people can be re-Geassed after Jeremiah undoes it.

Tamaki with no job just dgaf anymore. Screw your meeting.

Shirley, why are you doing this again? Get. Out.

Works on Knightmares. Works on cyborgs.

YES! HE FINALLY TOLD SOMEONE! YES!

Yes! Finally some quality, new information.

OMG

Rolo why? Rolo no. I liked you. Youre the one who does this?



For those who remember, this was the thing that I spoiled myself about way back when. Shirleys death. Even still, there were tears. There definitely wouldve been a few more had I watched episode 12 first, but there were still tears.

Lelouch crying and continually using Geass to try and force her to live :( It seems he can re-Geass people though.

JYB fucking nails that scream.

ALI PROJECT is back too. Really cool that they got season ones bands back.

**Episode 14**

atb 1997. I dont know the timeline. How long ago is this?

YES! Here we go! Ahhhgggghhh, too short. Just raised more questions.

Rolo. Youre going to be fucking murdered. I was on your side.

More Geass users?

There were those [strange people](http://i.imgur.com/vHbGdBD.jpg) again, and also a [huge mask?](http://i.imgur.com/t1Nr9Px.jpg)

Everyone at Shirleys funeral :(

CC is in great shape. Why have I not ordered Pizza Hut yet? CCs still talking to Marianne (I dont think this has been 100% confirmed, but Im pretty sure thats who it is), aaaaand she got cut off again. Everyone gets cut off.

I dont know how Lelouch has gone this far without knowing the terms of his contract. They could be something awful. Probably are gonna be awful.

Yes. Capture VV! Why the heck did CC go though? Risky.

Lol [This](http://i.imgur.com/I930cY6.jpg) was part of the preview at the end of episode 13. I thought Marianne was going to be in that encasement. It was Kallen. *Sigh,* I just want to see Marianne already.

[Suzaku, you're taking her away? C'mon, I just want someone to talk about Lelouch with.](http://i.imgur.com/kX0mhLP.jpg)

Zero will have to explain the truth to The Black Knights eventually, right?

Damn. [Bartley lit up. Scientists blow up.](http://www.gfycat.com/IllLawfulIberianmidwifetoad) Brutal.

Ahhh. More CC stuff sort of, but I want more.

Oh snap. Kid Geass users.

Oohhhhhh, *deceased* kid Geass users. Rolo is heartless.

You dare speak her name to me? Definitely more to the Jeremiah/Marianne relationship. There must be. Ugh, just give me more [Marianne](http://i.imgur.com/OFUza8j.jpg) already, Code Geass. Please!

Somethings going to go wrong, and Rolo is not going to die.

Cornelia put [as many guns as she could](http://www.gfycat.com/UnlawfulCalmKarakul) on the side of that Knightmare.

[Jeremiah with the save.](http://i.imgur.com/ufaMJMw.jpg)

Twilight gate?

Suzaku, you dick. Dont turn Kallen. See, Lelouch, if you had told Kallen the truth this wouldnt even be a tough decision for her.

Oh. Thats the gate. Thats how theyve been enter the Sword of Akasha room.

Wait did Charles not tell VV everything? Deceiving his older brother.

Oh crap! This is getting interesting. Too soon for anything serious, but this is going to be interesting.

**Post Episode(s) Thoughts**

/u/Lyonaire, I was already at a disadvantage watching the events of episode 13. Like I said though, there were still tears. I did as you suggested and re-watched the end of episode 13 after watching episode 12. It was a good idea so thanks for making me do that.

Look what happens. Look what happens, Lelouch, when you tell somebody about your true reason for being Zero. Omg. This was such a good moment. Jeremiah breaking through Lelouchs trap mustve scared the crap out out of him that he finally decided to spill the beans. I think theres more to the Jeremiah Marianne relationship than it just being his first assignment. He wouldnt be that loyal to his first assignment. What happened between them that he loved and respected her? Perhaps the two were partners, both as Knightmare pilots and as sexy time lovers, before Marianne went off and married Charles.

Im also looking forward to seeing Cornelia team up with Lelouch and what hes going to tell her. I wonder if hell be truthful about Euphemia. Hopefully. Even if its just them in private. Jeremiah will help convince her either way that she should be fighting against her father.

The opening scene from episode 14 was confusing as hell. I couldnt tell if VV and Charles were actually there or not. Their voices had a lot of echo like how they sound in the Sword of Akasha room. Is it possible they were somehow watching the past?

[thoughts on the future](/s "Theres obviously still something about CC that we dont fully know. I cant say yet whether she is an alien or just someone created by the order of those Geass people. The bigger unknown is what her endgame is. We still dont know the terms of Lelouchs contract. Im thinking that CC gave Marianne Geass. Those two werent able to accomplish CCs goals so now she is using Lelouch, and it was just coincidence that he was Mariannes son. CC may harbor some resentment towards VV since the order didnt show her the respect they showed him. Idk.")

[still more future thoughts](/s "The order is also strange. Are they based on some alien civilization (which I think is likely) or were they created on Earth? Is Geass Earth created? If the order was made on Earth (by Charles) then it could be evidence for our theory of creating Geass users to power the Sword of Akasha. I still like this theory even though I dont want to try too hard to cling to it. Against this is the fact that CC and VV were leaders of the order. If I want to believe that those two are aliens, and even if theyre not, theyre ageless, then how long has the order been around? Cant be that long considering Charles doesnt appear to be ageless, and I think hed be the one in charge of the order. Perhaps Marianne is also ageless. She and CC worked together a long time ago. That opening scene from ep14 was just VV and Charles viewing the past. Charles found out about all the Geass crap through Marianne. VV came to him and warned him that CC and Marianne were the bad guys, just like he went to Suzaku and told him Lelouch was bad. Ultimately, CC and VV have some sort of feud going on. Maybe.")

Good lord. That was more me writing out my thoughts as I have them than it was a unified theory. I still have too many questions. I need more info.

That would have been awesome, but alas.

>  Bartley lit up. Scientists blow up.

The pan over to the scientists that immediately get hit by a rocket is horrible.

> Cornelia put as many guns as she could on the side of that Knightmare.

[She knows how this works.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka)

>  Too soon for anything serious, but this is going to be interesting.

I'm not certain about that. We may be headed for the next "phase" of the show where we get into the Geass side of things from Charles's view so I wouldn't be surprised if we get some major revelations in the next episode or two.

> I think theres more to the Jeremiah Marianne relationship than it just being his first assignment. He wouldnt be that loyal to his first assignment. What happened between them that he loved and respected her? Perhaps the two were partners, both as Knightmare pilots and as sexy time lovers, before Marianne went off and married Charles.

I agree, though I doubt they were lovers. [Harry Potter book 6/7](/s "I could see something of a Lily and Snape kind of relationship though, where Marianne was only friendly toward Jeremiah but he couldn't let her go.")

> I still have too many questions. I need more info.

Agreed. I think your last point about CC and VV has merit though.
>> ARTICLE
> JYB fucking nails that scream.

Yep, that entire exchange is just....golden? The way he tries to break the laws of physics to geass her into staying alive. Its just heartbreaking. It reminds me of a certain episode of Stein's gate.

[S;G spoilers](/s "Imagine Suzuha coming in and disarming Rolo (let's conveniently ignore his Geass for a moment) while shouting to Lelouch "THE TV IS ON!"")

>> ARTICLE
> atb 1997. I dont know the timeline. How long ago is this?

ATB begins when 55 B.C. begins for us, so this takes place in about 1942 for us. For further reference, Lelouch was born in 1999 ATB.
>> ARTICLE
Well thank you very much. This is interesting.

~~Charles currently looks older than he did in that scene, but not 60 years older. Marianne, I guess really just in the scenes showing her death, still looked relatively young as well.~~

**edit** Rereading this, I was dumb. I sort of mathed it wrong. We're only about 20 years after that scene. Thanks /u/SeanyMac23. 
>> ARTICLE
> Who the hell is Sayoko?

She stated like 1 or 2 episodes ago that she's the 37th successor to a martial arts school and has been in some sort of secret service.  It was a quick moment, but they did put it in.

> I dont know the timeline. How long ago is this?

The show is presently in 2018 ATB so it was 21 years ago.

> I dont think this has been 100% confirmed

She's addressed Marianne by name a few times already in their convos

> Suzaku, you dick. Dont turn Kallen. See, Lelouch, if you had told Kallen the truth this wouldnt even be a tough decision for her.

He's not looking to turn her.  He's interrogating her.  Also, Kallen knows about geass now and that Lelouch is a prince since Nunnally told her all about it in their off screen convo.  Kallen gave the audience that info by saying that she never would've guessed that Nunnally was an imperial princess.  Though she should've known as soon as she was announced as Viceroy and made the SAZ announcement invoking her authority as a princess.

> Wait did Charles not tell VV everything? Deceiving his older brother.

The two of them haven't been 100% honest with each other about a lot of things.

> Im also looking forward to seeing Cornelia team up with Lelouch

Do you really think that Cornelia is suddenly going to team up with Euphy's murderer who also happens to be the person that forced her into committing genocide?  Remember Euphy was to Cornelia as Nunnally is to Lelouch...
>> ARTICLE
> He's not looking to turn her. He's interrogating her.

I think Suzaku *did* try to turn Kallen against Lelouch, when he told her Lelouch must have murdered Shirley. Perhaps it was just because he wanted her to switch sides to help with the interrogation, but I feel like it was more than that.
>> ARTICLE
He pretty much straight up asked Kallen if she would sell out Lelouch knowing he was responsible for Shirley's death. She refused (100 rank loyalty, TYVM) and so he brought out Refrain.

* Jeremiah, youre cool, man, but dont go slashing up girls in maid outfits. Unless youre a guy with that kind of fetish, in which case

* Viletta - Shell work for you for as long as she lives, until the second she thinks she can get a better deal. Not that I 100% blame her; she was blackmailed into helping.

* But why dont I believe it? Because you know hes Lelouch and can do whatever the fuck he wants.

* Until she *triple*-crosses you. I think. There are really only two things I remember about this episode.

* Shirley: He needs to know Lelouch is Zero, and that he killed my father.

* /u/rascorpia: FUCKING DO IT ALREADY!

* /u/Durinthal: YES! Anything to make Lelouch have to face consequences!

* /u/Neawia: Um maybe not?

* /u/EditorialComplex: Er

* Me: Youre gonna regret it. And not because of Lelouch.

* If only Shirleys theory was correct, this show would be so much less aggravating.

* That roof should really have a higher guardrail. Maybe even a fence.

* [Damn, Suzakus been working out.](http://webm.land/media/QGOa.webm)

* I dont wanna lose you or anyone else in my life! Not one more person! Please! I can hear the gears in /u/Durinthals head grinding from here.

* If Lelouch had been on top, both of us would have fallen. Not if it was Stunt Lelouch. Well maybe not in her current condition.

* Shirley is able to pick up on facial cues better than fucking L.

* This whole conversation between the three of them post-Lelouch hanging up makes me so queasy Damn, foresight hurts.

* [This scene pretty much confirms for me that only people with some type of Geass/Code implanted in them can see the red-iris effect.](http://webm.land/media/Y2Q8.webm)

* Fuckin stone cold. One punch in the gut. Lights out.

* Ironic that out of all the colors they could have chosen for his faceplate, they picked orange.

* Very clever of Shirley to be able to probe Suzaku for answers without really giving away that she knows anything.

* Youre not willing to forgive him. You dont want to forgive him! There are certain watchers in this thread that are grimacing hard at that line.

* She forgave him for killing her dad and exposing her to Mao a long time ago? Alright, hon, whatever.

* Aw! You just missed the Yes part!

* Viletta, you wanna pull your skirt out of your butt anytime soon? That cant feel good.

* Oh, yeah. Forgot that Ohgi didnt know she was with them now.

* Shirley no please Hes good on his own. Just stay outside.

* Please just leave the gun.

* Its sheer loyalty. Behold the new orange joke of this guy.

* Seriously. They need to find something to mix that sakuradite with so that disturber shit doesnt work.

* Oh

* Jeremiah Gottwald: Fuck science. Heart of ~~the Cards~~ Loyalty is all I need.

* First person Lelouch tells the truth to, without being forcefully exposed, and it just so happens to be to exactly the right person to get him on his side. Id call plot contrivance, but having Freemans luscious voice now fighting on our side makes up for it.

* And now as if to make up for this sudden grace

* Rolo, dude. Shes saying how she wants to help. She has no plans to expose him or betray him. Dont let your own sense of neediness get in the wayOh, why am I wasting my time?

* Smart of Lelouch to phone ahead and make sure his newest operative didnt get instantly flambed.

* And now Hey, at least with Jeremiah you can Geass someone as many times as you want and not have to worry about Yeah, it doesnt help.

* [Im just gonna leave this thing I made here.](https://vimeo.com/126867031)

* * Disclaimer: I did not make this AMV by myself. I re-edited it from another one, removing the spoilery stuff and changing the song to something I felt was more appropriate.

* Shirley, please dont You only have so much blood. Dont waste it doing a dramatic death monologue Oooh

* So, yeah. What was that some of you said about Shirley getting her memories wiped not protecting her from harm? Or that Lelouch didnt truly love her?

* Just imagine This is gonna be what Suzaku has to go through when hes on his deathbed. (Assuming Jeremiah doesnt unlock him at some point down the line.)

* NEw Ed Yeah, no one cares right now.

* I close with [this.](http://webm.land/media/LRKi.webm) You just have to her the pain in Lelouchs voice here, sub/dub preferences be damned.

I'm curious btw. I love your comments on these threads, mainly the only reason I go through them, but does it hinder your enjoyment of the show? I mean writing down notes as you're watching Lelouch beg Shirley not to die seems like it'd kinda pull you out of the moment. Also, what did you think of Shirley's death? Seems like most people are split on thinking it's one of the saddest moments of the show and not caring at all.

No one can resist Crispin Freeman's voice.  It is more powerful than even Lelouch's geass.

Well it's not exactly like the order was causing her pain per se, it just took hold but was impossible to follow.  It's similar to some of the orders Light gave in Death Note.

Lelouch kept Shirley in what's basically an active war zone around a large number of people that were out to kill him if he slipped even once, including an unstable assassin that he was emotionally manipulating. All of this *after* she was already used to get to him once.

Rolo may have shot her, but Shirley's blood is on Lelouch's hands.

* Ugh

* Hey, Narrator C.C. is back Oh, nobody cares.

* Cool, Marianne and C.C. are togethHOLY SHIT! [LOOK AT CHARLES AMAZING HAIR!](http://i.imgur.com/Me2Imu1.jpg)

* Going Biblically, God didnt create a world of lies; humans did that. But then, theyve made it clear that the God theyre talking about isnt the Abrahamic one, so Ill just move past it.

* Rolos bragging. Hes fucking bragging about it, like he just stepped on a spider that was crawling too close to Lelouch. Did he seriously not hear that wail of anguish Lelouch just let echo throughout the whole, damn building? This kid is really as psychotic as his name implies. (His real last name is Haliburton, if anyone missed it.)

* Lelouch is amazing at being able to hide all his pain and anger. The mans gonna give himself a stomach ulcer holding all these negative emotions in.

* Interesting how V.V. doesnt deny being involved in Euphies Geassing. Being a Code-bearer, he probably feels a bit responsible. He just doesnt really give a damn.

* Bet some of you forgot Shirleys mom was still around. Well, she is.

* Nina, shut the fuck up. Or rather, dont. After how you reacted the last time a female friend died, you have no place to just be quiet about it. Blow up something. Preferably Rolo.

* Sorry, Kanon. That comforting is not gonna pay off. (Because, as we all know, the only reason a man could console a woman is because he wants sex.)

* [Even in the darkest times, she still knows how to make me smile.](http://i.imgur.com/NdpNtmh.jpg)

* How long are gonna stay inside of What do you mean No spoilers?

* You know how you guys gave Nina the benefit of the doubt when she went fucking crazy after Euphemias death? This is how Im feeling toward Lelouch right now. Hes not making up some grand plan to use the Geass research; he just wants to make sure this stuff cant hurt anyone else again.

* [I think C.C.s Code insignia just shows up whenever it wants to remind people it exists.](http://i.imgur.com/rNiStGm.jpg)

* Lelouch and C.C. finally sitting down and talking about what being accomplices really means.

* [*Sigh* I can never stay mad at you.](http://webm.land/media/aD3M.webm)

* V.V. still thinking he can just barter his way to success. For being so smart, he sure can be stupid.

* I just want to know why Lelouch had portraiture of his dorm room walls on standby.

* How long has it been since we saw Nunnally first talk to Kallen? Did it really take her that long to explain her history? The fuck?

* How many people forgot the guy who blew up with the truck in episode 1 was Kallens brother? Like, a good 80%, right?

* Cant you just call Kallen by her name, dude? I get youre trying to sound detached, but come on.

* Call Lelouch cruel and ruthless if you want (the show is certainly taking time to show his subordinates feel that way). I just call it grief. He is redirecting his rage toward Rolo at Geass itself. And he is somewhat right. They were breeding Geass users to use as weapons.

* So long, Baldy McMoustache. So long. At least he no longer has to live doing this immoral research.

* Diethards almost as good at picking up on what people are thinking as Shirley Aw, man.

* What? Who says you have to kill Ohgi? Just because Lelouch got Jeremiah to his side? Huh?

* See? Told you they were raising death machines.

* [Thats some Children of the Corn shit.](http://i.imgur.com/NlaSSU4.jpg)

* So Rolo was raised in a facility like this, along with the other kids. Clearly he doesnt exactly hold family ties in high regard. Unless its Lelouch.

* [Damn, Lelouch is looking grim.](http://i.imgur.com/Ln95rME.jpg)

* At least this time the mega-super-ultra-powered robot shell has already been introduced.

* Comparing Lelouch to his father? Thats not gonna sit well.

* Something about Jeremiahs voice just makes that Yes, your Majesty! actually sound intimidating instead of clichd. But thats probably just me creaming myself over Freeman, again.

* V.V. apparently has a hell of a grudge against Marianne.

* Cornelias doing something.

* Oh, fuck me. I forgot they did this stupid misunderstanding bullshit. Do either of them honestly think Lelouch could stoop to doing that? Yeah, yeah, Euphemia; shut up. The only reason that Lelouch didnt immediately explain it was an accident is because hes noble enough to take full responsibility, whether he meant it or not. Thats something Suzakus never done.

* Fuck. Imagine if Rolos Geass ever overloaded. Would whoever was in the vicinity of it just be frozen forever after he died? In fact, Im amazed it hasnt already, with him having been using it for years. Apparently Lelouchs Geass just really fucking likes to troll him.

* Thats right, motherfucker! Cornelia aint your bitch! (Why would this superweapon even have a weak spot?)

* For once in who knows how long, Cornelia and Lelouch are in total agreement.

* [Lol. Ninja Jeremiah with the quick-save.](http://webm.land/media/Oxtc.webm) I guess that act has at least earned him some of /u/rascorpias gratitude.

* C.C.: Hasta la vista [bitches.](http://i.imgur.com/hn5J4fF.jpg)

* Kallen, did you really forget that you were fucking there with Suzaku when Lelouch was unmasked? And its pretty obvious Charles never got ahold of you tp erase your memories. Unless maybe shes playing that Lelouch erased her memories of his identity? Whatever

* All youre gonna succeed in doing is taking her back to when she was kicking Britannian ass. It doesnt flash you back to *bad* memories, and shes made it pretty obvious that she doesnt enjoy knowing that Zero is her former straight-A classmate.

* I said yesterday that V.V. was acting against Charles orders by sending Jeremiah. Now the little brats gonna pay.

* [Back in Columbia.](http://i.imgur.com/z9ggyAG.jpg) Weird how this lighthouse was underground this time.

* I think this is the first time Lelouch and Charles have actually met face-to-face since the whole mind-wiping thing. Damn, doesnt feel like its been that long.

So, in summary, Jeremiahs cool now, Shirleys dead, Rolo is a dick, Cornelia is badass, Geass is all but gone, and Charles is looking beast. So, yeah, not much of a difference from normal. (Holy fuck, its nine oclock. Ive been doing this shit since I got out of school, six hours ago.)

The key difference there is that Nina isn't responsible for a large number of people dying. Lelouch had multiple opportunities to make things better.

> CallLelouchcruelandruthlessifyouwant(theshowiscertainlytakingtimetoshowhissubordinatesfeelthatway).Ijustcallitgrief.

I didn't mind Lelouch that much up until he mind-wiped Shirley. If everything after that is "grief" then he should be kept away from other people.

> What?WhosaysyouhavetokillOhgi?JustbecauseLelouchgotJeremiahtohisside?Huh?

Yeah, that's one thing that I really didn't get. Why the sudden change?
>> ARTICLE
Nina is only not responsible for a large number of people dying because her bomb failed to go off.  She was willing to kill herself and a ton of random, non-involved people to maybe kill one person.  I'm not sure that the fact that she unintentionally failed to do so should count in her favor.
>> ARTICLE
She was also clearly severely mentally unstable. Lelouch is shown to be completely in his rational mind. While neither are GREAT, intentional atrocities are worse than ones done in madness. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm more with u/GawlKholin here. Compare the Narita incident to Tokyo.

Lelouch plan to blow up the side of the mountain, destroying Britannian forces and cutting them off from their commander. It works too well and a large amount of casualties occur as a result. Lelouch notably reflects that he should learn physics to more properly gauge how destructive it would be.

Nina goes mad following Euphy. When she learns Zero is coming to Tokyo, she does a last minute dash to finish her pet nuke project. She completes it and rampages out in her madness, solely focused on killing Zero, clicking the activator in the middle of the capital. Thankfully her math was off and it didn't work.

Zero expected 1 and got 2. He caused tragedy and should be held accountable. Mitigating factors are ignorance of what would happen.

Nina expected 3 and got 0. Her bomb didn't do anything, but she intended for it to kill millions to ensure that Zero died. Mitigating factors are her grief and madness.

Both should be locked up in mental institutions as they are both clearly unstable.

In a way it's a debate between manslaughter and attempted murder. Which is more serious? How important are intentions?
>> ARTICLE
Why are we comparing Narita to Tokyo? You're right in that Narita, at least, was a tactical maneuver gone wrong. It's not one of the legitimately reprehensible things that Lelouch does, like abandoning his allies, wiping Shirley's memory, ordering a massacre of noncombatants, etc. 

>Both should be locked up in mental institutions as they are both clearly unstable.

I don't agree. *Nina* is clearly unstable, yes. Lelouch has never been shown to be anything but in his full right mind. Let's not forget that the very first command he ever gave anyone with Geass was "kill yourselves." Granted, they were going to kill him, but wouldn't a "don't kill me" have sufficed just fine? 

>In a way it's a debate between manslaughter and attempted murder. Which is more serious? How important are intentions?

But even our modern legal system has a way of saying not guilty by reason of insanity, which I think you can make a very legit case that Nina was suffering at that moment. 
>> ARTICLE
It was just a random example that I could draw parallels between. Certainly there is a vast amount more that Lelouch has to account for that Nina doesn't. I guess I was just trying to impress that Nina's intended action was terrible and should be judged on that and found guilty. 
But she has extreme mitigating circumstances that reduce the sentencing she should receive, namely metal health services. 

Lelouch should be judged on his actions and found definitely guilty. I'm far less sure about his mitigating factors leading to clemency like Nina. Lelouch is cognizant, but given the totality of what he has done, it's reasonable to believe that he is mentally disturbed. If you explained his plan, it is insane. 

As I view it, not guilty by insanity is really guilty but not culpable due to insanity. The guilt should be uniform, it's the punishment that adjusts to severity vs mitigating factors. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Nina is certainly emotionally unstable, but I don't think she is unstable in any way that absolves or even lessens her accountability for her actions.  Her actions were not performed in the heat of the moment.  She heard about Euphemia, and went down to the basement to work on a bomb for a few hours (most of the night) and was still willing to kill everyone.  We saw just a few episodes ago that even now, over a year later, she is still in the same mindset, charging at Zero with a dinner knife the moment she saw him.  I would say she is no less responsible for her actions than Lelouch (who certainly has more to answer for than Nina).
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. We saw no indication from her character before that she was in any way violent, the most aggressive she ever got was some casual racism. She clearly has some sort of codepenency disorder with her obsession with Euphy, snaps when she hears about her, and from that point forward is no longer in sound mind. She was willing to take *herself* out, after all.

And then she spends a year *not* getting the therapy the poor girl obviously needs but instead being subtly manipulated by Schneizel, who keeps using Euphemia's name to motivate her, ostensibly to create bigger and more deadly weapons.

She's a person in dire need of therapy and trauma counseling who instead is being manipulated by a charismatic sweet-talker who knows how to dig at that trauma and keep it fresh.

Does that absolve her completely for her actions? No, of course not, she still bears some responsibility for them. But in context, she is clearly not as intentionally and willfully malicious as Lelouch is. She's being used.
>> ARTICLE
You're right about Schneizel, he's definitely using her, and by his side is not the best place for her, and while you're right about her not having violent tendencies, she still does some. . . dubiously thought out things (I'm specifically thinking about when she tried to break through Euphemia's guards just to thank her).  To me, it seems like she was always somewhat unstable, and Euphemia's death just made her shift that instability towards killing people.  I can see where you're coming from, though.
>> ARTICLE
> Kallen, did you really forget that you were fucking there with Suzaku when Lelouch was unmasked? And its pretty obvious Charles never got ahold of you tp erase your memories. Unless maybe shes playing that Lelouch erased her memories of his identity? Whatever

That actually wasn't Kallen's brother.  Naoto dies at some point before the series.  The guy you're talking about is apparently named Takeshi Nagata.

OK, back as promised with my full thoughts. 

**Episode 13: Assassin From the Past**

I'm seriously going to try to take fewer notes now that we're doing multiple episodes.    

- This nightmare of Shirley's is creepy. But then again, remembering all of that shit probably doesn't do much for her mental health.    
- New OP! FLOW is great. And it all but confirms that Schneizel is going to be a (the?) primary antagonist for S2 besides Charles.    
- What the hell was Tohdoh's Knightmare (I think) flying at? Maybe the true form of the Sword of Akasha?    
- New Guren and Lancelot! And judging by the wings, we've moved from Gundam 00 to Gundam SEED Destiny.     
- Captain China and Captain Japan make a good team. China is slowly falling to Lelouch's forces.    
- It must be seriously disorienting for poor Shirley being faced with the radically different world she'd come to believe was the truth. Though I'm confused about why Shirley alone didn't remember Kallen was with the BKs. Milly mentioned her before in that context, didn't she?     
- RoboJere vs Ninjamaid! What a weird show this has become.     
- Cornelia ices VV on the spot like a boss. Interesting that he said that they weren't going to kill a typical God figure. I wonder what, then? Also note that VV called himself her 'uncle,' so I guess he really is Charles' biological brother?         
- Villetta uses Jeremiah to get out from under Lelouch's control. Can't really blame her, not like she was ever on his SIDE, she was just being blackmailed. I hope Sayoko's okay :(     
- Worst. Three-way date. Ever.      
- And Villetta.... is actually choosing Lelouch's side. Huh.     
- That went from 0 to 60 really quickly, Shirley. Though I suppose from her point of view it makes sense to suspect the two of them.   
- Suzaku is on the verge of cracking the case, and Shirley stops him. Well done, Shirley.     
- Something tells me the "you don't WANT to forgive him" conversation is going to be important.     
- WTF no Shirley don't run back in oh no why would you do that      
- So Lelouch has mounted Gefjun disturbers on ALL the trains? Well played, Lulu.      
- Wow, this confrontation between Jeremiah and Lelouch seriously did not go as expected. That's... a twist. M. Night Shamalyan's Code Geass.  
- WHAT     
- ROLO NO NO ROLO WHAT      
- NO WHY WOULD YOU     
- NO THIS IS THE WORST THING     
- FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK         
- WHY ROLO WHY NO          
- my heart is hurting      
- Everything about this is awful and nothing is okay      
- love is over        

What a tremendously tonally inappropriate ED.      

...Shirley has angel wings in it :(



**Episode 14: Geass Hunt**       

- I watched it twice just to be sure, but I don't think Shirley is in the OP. I didn't even notice last episode.   
- I took a half hour break to play some games and I'm still sad.     
- So CC, Marianne, VV and Charles are all hanging out. Young Charles looks like a fucking boss. And that's interesting motivation for the two of them. To stop lies.   
- No way Lelouch forgives Rolo after this. No way Rolo survives the series. Honestly, the both of them feel pretty culpable here. If Lelouch hadn't spared Rolo because he was useful, if he hadn't started the rebellion in the first place, Shirley would still be alive.     
- Lelouch is lying to Rolo about VV, right? No way he knows. He just wants to spur Rolo's sense of revenge.     
- oh GOD Shirley's mom breaks my fucking heart. She's lost her daughter and her husband to this stupid war.     
- This is the most heartbreaking anime funeral I've seen since Maes fucking Hughes.     
- ROYMUSTANGITSRAINING.GIF          
- And Lelouch doesn't even have the decency to show up oh god you fucking asshole.       
- That could have been a cute scene of Nina being comforted, but Kanon made it look creepy as hell.     
- So whatever this order is, CC used to lead it. And now she's helping Lelouch wipe it out, to make sure he's the only one with Geass.     
- That was a pretty clever scheme with the false room.     
- This conversation between Nunnally and Kallen is pretty adorable, actually. It's a nice change from the indiscriminate slaughter going on in the other plotline.     
- As long as we're discussing characters in relation to their various tropes, I'd say this slaughter of unarmed scientists certainly counts as Lelouch's A.) Moral Event Horizon B.) Jumping off the Slippery Slope      
- GOD ROLO YOU'RE SO FUCKED UP WHAT THE FUCK               
- Spinning always works? And yet, the armadillo.     
- And VV hates Marianne for some reason.        
- Does Lelouch use the same activator for everything?       
- Cornelia shows up with guns. Lots of guns.      
- Aw, CC was tearing up when she shot the dudes.     
- Aaaaaand now it's Suzaku's turn to flirt with the Moral Event Horizon with that Refrain.     
- What the fuck, dude.       
- And VV lied to Charles. Somehow I think that's going to be the end for him, given the contract. Meanwhile, the Black Knights are wondering if their boss is really a good guy. (Hint: No. No he's not.)      
- And here we go, the long-awaited confrontation between father and son.     
- "The time has come at last!" No, it hasn't, because there are 11 more episodes left in the series.       

This pair of episodes was really depressing and now I need to go hug my cat.     

What happened made me really loathe Rolo as I'm sure it did more of you, but I'm sorry, I can't let Lelouch off the hook. Sure, I'm sure he felt bad, but it's because it was *his fucking fault*. He's the one who dragged Shirley into it in the first place. He's the one who decided to use an unstable assassin who was known to kill his allies at the slightest provocation. He's the one who started this whole fucking war.

I'm sorry, Lulu, but you get no sympathy from me. That, plus your crossing the moral event horizon in ordering a slaughter of unarmed scientists, makes you just as much a villain as Charles. 

If Lelouch gets a happy ending, I don't know what I'll do but it won't be good. Motherfucker deserves nothing but ruin.

Yep, that's pretty apparent. He's about as mysterious as Charles is right now, but at least we can *guess* where Charles is headed with our Geass-related theories.

Both VV and CC have some strong feelings about Marianne. Hopefully we'll find out why soon.

Agreed on all parts. Most rewatchers seem to disagree with our stance on Lelouch though, which is really baffling to me at this point. I know there's a lot of show left, but I can't think of any plausible redemption strategy for him right now.

Your mistake is thinking Lulu was ever interested in being a hero.

Lulu isn't interested in being redeemed. He doesn't want to be forgiven. He WANTS people to hate him, because he felt he deserved it.

In short, Lulu hates himself. Hates that he was gifted with natural talents of deception and murderous planning. That there really isn't a "good" way to do what he does. He isn't a good pilot, he isn't strong, and he isn't fast. He couldn't be your usual goody two shoes mecha anime protagonist because he doesn't have the right kind of skills for it. The only way he could help his sister is by being Cobra Commander, and that means he has to lie to her. Every hour of every day.

And he hates it.

I meant redemption in the eyes of the viewers, not in-universe. I'm failing to see any way that he could become likable, but somehow he is for a lot of people.

If you need him to become a squeaky clean saint in order for him to be likeable in your eyes, you got the wrong idea. Lulu is trying to do good in the only way he knows how, if you don't think he is doing enough he would just shrug his shoulders at your views and kept going.

Lulu would love to have Suzaku's powers. Then he would have been able to be a superhero. But no, he was gifted with supervillain powers. Them's the breaks.

>Well, if you're going to go that route, Lady Marianne is clearly at fault for having had children

Having children and starting a war in which you know there will be collateral damage feel like different levels of responsibility, here. I think the more damning part is that Lelouch weighed Rolo's skill (at killing people) to be more helpful than the liability where he would occasionally kill someone who was ostensibly one of his allies for little to no reason. 

I mean, what if Rolo had killed Ohgi or Kallen or Tohdoh for saying the wrong things? What if Milly or Rivalz had stumbled on the wrong door at the wrong time? 

>Right? Teared up for real.

Seriously the most soulcrushing anime funeral this side of Maes Hughes. 

>He's too busy taking down the source of all Geass, which is what he blames for her death

Geass doesn't kill people. Murderous shotas with Geass and the people who keep them around kill people. 

He's not a very good human being, is what I'm trying to say. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Rolo's killing skill was what Lelouch was after.  It was mostly (1) keeping him from working as an enemy and (2) just doing the time-stop thing without necessarily killing.  The assassin thing was more of a downside.
>> ARTICLE
I understand why you're angry at Lelouch, and I'm not saying he's completely innocent here, but I'm not sure why you think he 'dragged Shirley into' this.  He went to great lengths to keep her from getting involved including erasing himself from her memory entirely in R1, and it was only when her memories were restored (which he didn't know was possible) that she involved herself again and became even a potential target for Rolo.  Like I said, Lelouch is certainly a guilty party here, but I don't know that I would say that it's really his fault.
>> ARTICLE
His disregard for civilian casualties killed her father. 

Her grief means she went looking for him after meeting Villetta because she couldn't stand the thought that it was really him. That's when she found his identity and shot Villetta. That's when he needed to Geass her. 

If he hadn't killed her dad in his mudslide trap, odds are she wouldn't have felt the need to follow him that night. He bears responsibility. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's quite as cut and dry as that.  Narita was supposed to have been evacuated by the Britannians before the battle (something we actually see them doing), which Lelouch should have known because he received the report of their plans from Diethard (it's implied that Shirley's dad was working with Code R, the one group that didn't evacuate).  He also didn't think the mudslide would have been that big, and says as much when it happens.  So, I wouldn't say he had a disregard for civilian casualties at that point, since he had no real expectation that any civilians would be hurt by what he was doing.
>> ARTICLE
Even if it wasn't intentionally disregarding them, he still caused it. The beginnings of it still lie with him. He's surely at least PARTIALLY culpable for getting her involved in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
That is true, but after that he did what he could to get her un-involved.  That's why he erased her memory, to keep this exact kind of thing from happening.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think that violating someone's memory like that deserves a check in the "good guy" column, though. :/ at best, AT *BEST*, it's on the darker side of gray. 

Why not go whole hog? Geass her and her mom into leaving Japan and going back to Britannia. That'd make her REALLY uninvolved. 
>> ARTICLE
> Geass her and her mom into leaving Japan and going back to Britannia. That'd make her REALLY uninvolved. 

Something like that came to mind as an alternative solution back after Lelouch mind wiped her, but I don't remember if I mentioned it at the time.
>> ARTICLE
I've . . .never thought of that before.  I was trying to think of something relatively not harmful he could have done to really remove her from the situation, but that had never occurred to me.  You'd probably use Lelouch's Geass better than I would.  But yeah, I agree, it certainly wasn't the best thing he could have done, and like we just saw, it helped to lead her to her death.  Lelouch certainly blames himself, I think, and I certainly understand why you blame him as well.  I just tend to blame Rolo a ~~lot~~ bit more.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, there's no doubt that Rolo deserves the lion's share of the blame, that's inarguable. But this is just another one in the long line of "Lelouch is responsible for terrible things and he's barely better than Light Yagami on the Villain Protagonist scale at this point." 

Haha, I cant take full credit, I just thought of what Hermione did to her parents in the last Harry Potter book :P 
>> ARTICLE
I would strongly question that comparison as far too simplistic.

Light Yagami had no sense of empathy for anyone else on the planet. His emotional range was very restricted. Lelouch, while he does ultimately continue to follow through with terrible actions, is visibly capable of being internally conflicted and is fully aware of how his own acts can be classified as morally questionable or outright evil. To ignore this, even if you dislike him as a person, and merely equate him to Yagami is not supported by the evidence. 

>> ARTICLE
"Barely better than Light," huh.  That's harsh.

Even if it wasn't your idea originally, it's still a good move.  I feel like one of Lelouch's problems is that he's great at crazy schemes and logistics, but he's really bad at dealing with people, so I don't know that a solution like that would have occurred to him.

Nice dream there. Interesting with all the masks... and she *does* remember that he wiped her memory. Now she's even questioning the "normal" characters and of course Lelouch interrupts before she can say anything to Suzaku.

Here comes Jeremiah. Huh, didn't expect Sayoko to take him head-on, I unfortunately don't expect this to end well for her.

I love how Cornelia's first reaction is to kill VV outright. Too bad that didn't actually do much.

"If there's a God who made men fight each other?" What?

I was curious if Jeremiah's thing would work while he's frozen, apparently so. *How* I don't have any idea since he presumably controls it and he couldn't have done anything at the moment, but I'm not going to think about it too much. Villetta either turned quickly or has a trap planned.

I don't blame Shirley for being paranoid. At least she seems to realize Suzaku isn't working with him.

Oh, now Suzaku can lose his (forced) will to live. I expect him to find a reason after that anyway.

Suzaku doesn't want to forgive Lelouch, and neither do I. Shirley... why? Why forgive him, and then why run back in there after him like an idiot? Love makes you stupid, I guess.

So Jeremiah finds out that Lelouch is Marianne's son and promptly flips sides. Thanks again, complete-lack-of-foreshadowing.

Poor Shirley, you definitely shouldn't have mentioned Nunnally. There goes any hope I had of liking Rolo. [After the hints](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34qvyw/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqx84yk?context=1) from /u/TxXXF and /u/LazyPyromaniac, I expected something bad was going to happen there as a result.Thanks to /u/Atario for attempting to mislead me back into thinking nothing's going to happen at least.

We did learn that Lelouch can re-Geass people. I expect that to come into play again later.

---
I started watching the next episode immediately after but my heart wasn't into it and I was exhausted. So the next day...

1997? Hey, Marianne's alive and hanging out with CC. Charles and VV are there and everyone's happy. Well, kinda, there's still the whole "killing God" thing.

Oh damn it Lelouch. Rolo just admitted he killed her and you're just going to keep on using him. How many others will die along with Shirley before you decide that's enough?

[Here's another puzzle piece.](http://i.imgur.com/yun1r4A.png) Who wants to bet that Lelouch wears that mask before the end of the series?

Suicide my ass. Suzaku knows better than that, right after they saved her. That poor woman, lost her husband and now her daughter. [This is the kind of impact Lelouch has,](http://i.imgur.com/OCWdeDu.png) and yet you people still love him?

Kannon is... interesting. Didn't expect a hug like that. Maybe Schneizel's personal unit is a giant polyamorous web, that would be a first.

Okay, CC is *definitely* having a direct conversation there, presumably with Marianne. What's she planning?

Angry Lelouch, I like it. Embrace your dark side, raze the world. "If this truly is the power of the king, then I'm the only one who needs to have it!" See, even Lelouch agrees with me that the show would be better off without all of the Geass bullshit. Even CC's not immune to scrutiny now, though I'm sure that contract is still going to haunt Lelouch later.

A while ago I was wondering if VV actually had plans for Nunnally, but no she was apparently just bait. All of this ties back to Marianne, somehow.

[This is a textbook example of chaotic evil.](http://i.imgur.com/zXdBFOq.png) Say what you will, [this is just more evidence for Lelouch's villainy in my book.](http://i.imgur.com/Fs0xgb3.png)

Bartley's up... and immediately gets mowed down. Thinking back on it, if Clovis had been able to deliver CC to Charles in the first place it would have been an instant victory for the emperor, since she's apparently been the target all along.

gi's being targeted by both Diethard and Villetta, I don't envision things going well for him.

[That's creepy.](http://i.imgur.com/3IkmlPC.png) The one kid looks like he can control actions to an extent, but not minds. Oooh, notice that they have Geass in their right eye, just like Rolo. They were given the ability by VV. Mao and Lelouch have Geass in their left eye and it was given by CC. Charles has it in *both*. Could he have multiple powers as a result, if CC and VV granted it to him separately?

Jeremiah turning to Lelouch because of Marianne... again this reminds me of Game of Thrones where absent parents continue to influence their children's fates.

Suzaku and Kallen both know Shirley wouldn't kill herself. Suzaku rightfully thinks it's Lelouch's doing, even if he didn't pull the trigger himself.

Huh, Rolo's heart stops when he uses his Geass? That explains why he can only hold it so long, but I wouldn't be surprised if Britannian medical technology was advanced enough to have artificial hearts or similar devices available.

Lelouch *almost* gets rid of Rolo there but alas, he lives another day. Again, Best Princess shows her stuff. I wonder if she'll cooperate with Lelouch after this... probably not, considering he's the one directly responsible for Euphemia's fall.

And so CC ends the research on Geass. She just wants to be with Lelouch, it's sad. He keeps calling her an immortal witch and she must despise that part of herself.

Now Suzaku's turning to the dark side as well with the Refrain. No happy endings here.

Remember how Charles said he wanted to smash this "world of lies" at the beginning of the episode? VV's been lying to his little brother.

[Welcome to working for Zero,](http://i.imgur.com/OacFE7R.png) you're going to keep committing atrocities under his command.

[Heeeeeere's Charlie!](http://i.imgur.com/teF5U4V.png)

[Wild speculation turn 12](/s "Thanks to Charles, Lelouch discovers that he killed his own mother by accident. Charles erased Lelouch's memory of it so he could in theory have a happier life, but he was so distraught by her loss that he couldn't face Lelouch and so disowned him and Nunnally. He deliberately gave Lelouch the assassination memory to see if he would be strong-willed enough to overcome the lies and be worthy of succeeding as Emperor, which he is. Schneizel is mildly depressed by that until Nina comforts him and they start dating as both of them need to at least put up a facade.")

U_U sorry... but you need to understand! This is *the worst* Shirley deserved better than that and you shipped her with the monster himself!

Shirley was dumb and had it coming.
>> ARTICLE
So it's very clear that Lelouch is approaching his problems as a utilitarian. The ends justify the means so long as the net result at the end of it all is "positive." Is the killing a hundred to save a thousand idea.

We however live in a much more Kantian inspired society, where we try to hold people as an end and never as a means. By our accepted philosophy, lelouch is an absolute villain driven by selfish desires. 

In a major way, this show is a prime example of why utilitarianism does not work. The individual suffering cannot be written off. Lelouch is from episode 1, a terrorist. 

But that's not to say you can't like a villain. He is driven, charismatic, and intelligent. We can root for a villain in fiction, especially one that is an underdog. We can be impressed with his conviction and ability even though all he can create is tragedy. 

So I guess my point is, perhaps lelouch is a good character, obviously not a good person. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for bringing some actual philosophy and ethics into this! I don't know enough to feel like I can contribute to a discussion about the opposed views, but I think it's neat that an anime can provide a way for us to reflect on our own values in a meaningful manner.

I agree that you *can* like villain protagonists, and I have with other series. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun hating the protagonist, though.

I agree, Code Geass is a great example of anime that makes you think, super fun.

Thinking back to when I was watching, I think I was just excited, impressed with his cunning and theatrics. It was just a fun journey to see how much he could salvage from the dust once it settled. I find it thoroughly interesting to read all your reactions and how they are melding together.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's assuming that we all subscribe to Kantianism and not utilitarianism. I think what you've just proven here is that Lelouch means different things to different people depending on their outlook on morality. I personally would be far more inclined to call Lelouch a hero than a villain because he sees the bigger picture. I completely understand that some consider him a villain, but honestly I think the best term for what he does is 'antihero'. He's not a horrible person, he's not doing evil for the sake of evil. [spoilers](/s "He's doing it to, in the end, save the world.")
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that does assume Kantianism is more socially accepted in our society than Utilitarianism. Utilitarians should be holding out judgement at this point to see if the end result does outweigh all the negatives. Of course, moral relativists would disagree with either of these normative views.

I wouldn't say Lelouch is evil, he is not malicious in seeking out pain and suffering. He is just apathetic to anything but his own goals. He is a sympathetic villain. Saving the world? His goal is the destruction of Britannia, founded on destruction and hatred, justified as being for Nunnally's safety. There is more to the world than his or her happiness.

[R2 End spoilers](/s "All of that is said in the context of what we know as of this episode. Careful with casual spoilers like him saving the world, that intention isn't clear yet. Of course in the end, he does save the world, so Utilitarians should embrace him as a hero. Kantians can embrace the fact that he knew he was in the wrong in many ways and accepted his due punishment. At that point he straddles Hero/Antihero. ")

>> ARTICLE
That's true, I spoilered it.

What exactly is the difference between a sympathetic villain and an antihero? In my mind, that line must be extremely thin in many instances, if not invisible altogether. Maybe Lelouch is both. Heck, if one considers all moral viewpoints as at least somewhat valid, then Lelouch is all three types of characters. From a pure utilitarian viewpoint he's pretty much a hero, from a kantian perspective he's pretty villainous, and from what I would consider the most reasonable perspective in realizing that he could've done some things with less bloodshed but in the end his intentions were noble, he's an antihero. Not sure there's a word for that last one though. 
>> ARTICLE
I take the sympathic villain as the character who does bad things attempting to reach usually a good goal (ie Doc Occ wanting to create sun to solve energy problems). Often times their methods significantly affect everyone around them negatively.

The antihero is the character saving the world, but being a jerk about it. He has bad qualities that rub you the wrong way (only saving people cause he gets paid or something). It's more character flaws than actual actions taken.

At least that's how I understand it. And yes, it is a very thin line. It's hard to truly nail down where he should be on a continuum of character types. He wants to be a hero but the only way he understands how to get to his goal is to be a villain.
>> ARTICLE
Okay yeah, if that's your definition of a villain and antihero then no question Lelouch is a villain. But normally when I see antihero defined around here, it goes hand in hand with people like Kiritsugu and Lelouch, meaning most people define it as closer to how you define sympathetic villain.

Oh, come on. You can't put that on Lelouch, that's 100% on Rolo. Lelouch did what he could at the moment by putting her under Suzaku's protection. It's not his fault Shirley was stupid enough to run back in.
>> ARTICLE
Rolo at this point is so emotionally unstable you can't really hold him responsible for anything. He's like a little kid who has for the first time realized and experienced the concept of love and caring and doesn't know what the correct course of action is when his loved ones are involved. 

In the end he regresses to the only way he knows how to deal with problems since he was raised by an order of assassins. A sane person would argue with Shirley and possibly hurt or threaten her to make her abandon Lelouch but Rolo was taught that you deal with a problem by killing the problem. Something that Lelouch didn't try to correct in the slightest even though he knew Rolo would be surrounded by people he could easily hurt. If you were to take Rolo to court and have him be judged I'm sure he could claim insanity and he would be judged more lightly in the end. 

Also take into account that for all his relationship issues with people and his flaws Lelouch is a great judge of character and knows how to deal with various individuals so he should be aware of Rolo more than he is but is choosing to ignore his since he sees Rolo as a simple tool to be used and not a (somewhat) complex person. Hell, the only reason Rolo joins him is because Lelouch recognizes his loneliness/craziness and tries to harness it.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch is keeping an unstable, remorseless assassin around and that's not his fault?
>> ARTICLE
(While writing this I realized that Lelouch was probably more to blame than I initially thought. I still think Rolo is like 95% to blame, though.)

~~I don't think it is.~~ I firmly believe that in the beginning keeping Rolo around was the right decision. Rolo does love him (however twisted that love may be) and a guy that's effectively capable of stopping time is an incredibly powerful ally. One could argue that Lelouch should have realized that Rolo would eventually do something like this to keep Lelouch to himself, but I think Lelouch thought he could keep that from being an issue. Rolo's only going to kill people that stand in the way of that and at the moment only two do. CC, who's immortal and therefore not in danger and Nunally, who's in real danger, but the plan has always been to get rid of Rolo before that becomes a problem. (Shirley was on the way to be a third, but they weren't romantically involved enough yet.) 

The reason Rolo does kill Shirley is because she says she wants to make it so that Lelouch can be back together with Nunally, something Lelouch couldn't predict. But you're right, keeping Rolo around is risky, but Lelouch is certain he's got it under control. It's kind of like a dog owner not thinking his dog is going to hurt anyone, but then one day it does. Is it the owner's fault? How you answer that will probably be how you answer whether or not it was Lelouch's fault.

I think you can easily say all 3 central characters (Lelouch, CC, Suzaku) are all terrible people who are using reprehensible methods to achieve what they at least believe to be noble or at least not evil goals.  They all started out innocent and with good intentions, but have let their end goal warp their morals and actions to extremes and ultimately it calls into question whether the goal they're chasing, no matter how good or noble, is worth all the sins they've committed in the pursuit of achieving it.
>> ARTICLE
Suzaku is still a lighter shade of gray for me, with Lelouch closer towards black and CC in the middle mostly because I still can't get a read on her. Until the very end of this episode, Suzaku hadn't done anything I would describe as truly evil, whereas Lelouch was shitting villainy left and right. 
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that you read it that way because I think that's entirely how the show up to this point has intended for that triumvirate to be viewed.  

In my opinion CC giving geass to Mao at such a young age and then abandoning him once it made him unstable is pretty awful.  Also, she has 100% been an enabler for Lelouch for entirely selfish reasons (their contract and the fact that she pretty clearly has romantic feelings towards him even if she would never admit it).  

I think Lelouch and Suzaku are both huge hypocrites at this point, but Lelouch has at the very least full on embraced his hypocrisy (she even acknowledged it at one point saying that he didn't have time to argue who was the bigger hypocrite).  Lelouch preaches that the ends justify the means and then goes on to criticize how other people work towards their goals.  Suzaku on the other hand goes on about how anything gained through contemptible means is worthless yet almost everything he's gained this far could be said to be through contemptible means, especially his knighthood which was gained by taking his best friend (yes I know terrorist etc) hostage and bartering him for the title all the while knowing that Nunnally who was very important to him as well was in danger.

I guess my overall point is that this show is trying to create a situation where the protagonist and antagonist roles are merely defined in the eye of the beholder rather than one being of better moral fiber than the other.  I think that's kind of cool.

That's a good point.

I'm not sure I agree with you on this point, though. I think Suzaku could be called hypocritical (and is it Lloyd or Cecile who calls him out on this in R1, I think) in that he hates people getting hurt so joins the military to protect people, but... militaries literally exist to hurt people. That's certainly hypocritical. But what else is? 

If anything, Suzaku has been relatively consistent in his belief that things are best changed by working within the system. It's been a gradual path for him from foot soldier to pilot to officer to knight to KotR, but he's been using his legitimate authority to effect change. He's also taken pains to avoid collateral damage and save civilians wherever possible. 

Hell, you could even argue that his turning Lelouch in despite their friendship was him adhering to his Lawful Good alignment, because their friendship shouldn't supersede Lelouch's crimes. 

If I had to put them on the D&D scale, I'd say Suzaku started out as Lawful Good but has (as of the end of 14 with the Refrain) descended into Lawful Neutral. Lelouch was... I'm not sure where he'd fall on the Law <-> Chaos line, but he's gone from Neutral to Evil. Neither of them is a better person than they were at the start.

> Here's another puzzle piece. Who wants to bet that Lelouch wears that mask before the end of the series?

Hmmm, all of those child Geass users were using their right eye. Rolo also uses his right eye. I seriously don't remember which eye Mao used, if any. Charles uses both eyes. Is Lelouch the only one who uses Geass with his left eye? [thoughts on the mask](/s "I'm not sure this is important, but that mask would cover up his eye. Perhaps the mask enhances Geass, but Lelouch can't use it because it blocks his eye. Lelouch will have to increase his Geass strength in order to have it in both eyes like his father. I think Charles will be wearing this mask, if no one else does.")

> Mao and Lelouch have Geass in their left eye and it was given by CC. Charles has it in both. Could he have multiple powers as a result, if CC and VV granted it to him separately?

I saw this as I continued reading your post, but figured I'd put it up here since it goes with my response. That is a truly interesting thought. I've been guessing Charles's power has just evolved over time causing him to have two Geass eyes. Your explanation is good though. I'm only curious as to why he activated both eyes on Lelouch if he was only using one power.

> This is the kind of impact Lelouch has, and yet you people still love him?

I'm still on Lelouch's side. I think we're getting to the point where he's realizing there's more at stake than revenge/Nunnally's happiness. If he ends up preventing a greater evil, these unfortunate consequences won't seem as bad. Crap like that was going to happen. CC warned him when she first gave him Geass. Now don't get me wrong. Lelouch has done some stupid things that could have been prevented. He shouldn't be forgiven. Still, nobody else could have done what he is doing. I really don't think he should've won the best guy contest, although I guess I should wait until the series is over to make that claim. The things he's done so far though aren't exactly best guy material in my book.

> "If this truly is the power of the king, then I'm the only one who needs to have it!"

I don't know when I said it, but way back a bit I was worried that Lelouch would get too much power and lose sight of what he was fighting for. That quote from him is making me worry a little again.

> Oh damn it Lelouch. Rolo just admitted he killed her and you're just going to keep on using him. How many others will die along with Shirley before you decide that's enough? 

Didn't you just hear him say he's doing this to stop Britannia from using Geass to harm others in the long run?

You... just... don't... yet... understand!

> You... just... don't... yet... understand!

I have a new theory for why everyone loves Lelouch, which if true will instantly earn the series a 1/10 rating from me. I'm not going to voice it now just to give the writers the benefit of the doubt.

Edit: I'm still not going to tell you what it is, but here's the encrypted form:

>You... just... don't... yet... understand!

Seriously. Does he not realize Lelouch just tried to kill Rolo? Or that he's getting rid of geass because of all the madness it causes?
>> ARTICLE
If he's anything like me, he realizes it, he just doesn't care. None of that makes up for the fact that it's fundamentally his fault. 

Hell, the atrocities he's committing in Shirley's name are *worse*. You think someone as sweet and gentle as Shirley would want hundreds or thousands of unarmed civilians gunned down in her memory? 
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, civilians. Civilians that experimented on humans and let Britannia do all the atrocities and genocides they did.
>> ARTICLE
Massacring unarmed noncombatants is still a war crime. 
>> ARTICLE
Unarmed combatants who did crimes that would warrant execution or life imprisonment in many modern countries, like kidnapping, assassination, genocide, massacre, human experimentation, torture and many other things.
>> ARTICLE
And they should face a war crimes trial, absolutely. 

As should the people who ordered the summary mass execution of noncombatants. 
>> ARTICLE
Except they never would, because they are a secret organization that controls Britannia, a country that control majority of the world. There was no way for them to be taken to a warcrimes court, not also when they can easily alter people's minds.
>> ARTICLE
Okay. 

Massacring unarmed combatants is never not going to be a war crime. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone with Geass is never unarmed
>> ARTICLE
Ok, this is rapidly becoming way too serious, but I'll continue for the sake of the argument. 

All those scientists were abducting kids from their families to experiment on them with geass. They had no concern about ethics, about the families they took them from, about the fact that these kids were going to be turned into trained assassins. 

Rolo wasn't born like this, and we still see remnents of the person he could have been, had his life not been ruined. These people were making weapons out of kids and sending them to commit attrocities, and as Lelouch says, the only ones who should fire are those who would risk being fired apon.
>> ARTICLE
Then take them captive. Try them. Indiscriminate summary execution is still indiscriminate slaughter, even if the people do deserve it. 
>> ARTICLE
That would be nice if we were in a perfect world, but we're not. Lelouch has one island and a small army. He can't afford to take Brittanians prisoners, he needed to get out of there before their main forces showed up. There are limits to the number of things that Lelouch can do, and one of the reasons he's such a good leader is he can make it appear that he can do whatever, but it's **all an act**, put on for brittania (and his followers) benefit.
>> ARTICLE
True. But indiscriminate slaughter of unarmed noncombatants is still a war crime, even if they're up to no good. And we the viewers can still judge him for that blood on his hands. 
>> ARTICLE
True. I wont disagree that lelouch has done some bad things, but I think their mainly due to the situation he's in. If he does succeed in toppling brittania, he will bring about an era of peace in the world, which may be worth the sacrifice of those people. Alternatively, if he fails, everyone will have died for nothing, which is why he continues. In this case, the end would definately justify the means, it's just a matter of whether he can get to that end.
>> ARTICLE
But do the ends really justify the means? From an ethical standpoint that's not so clear. And what about all the other end that are destroyed as he walk down "the path of blood" as Kirihara approved of? Why can he (morally) dictate his desired world over like Shirley's?
>> ARTICLE
> Does he not realize Lelouch just tried to kill Rolo? Or that he's getting rid of geass because of all the madness it causes?

Trying to make up for it later doesn't undo earlier events. Killing Rolo won't bring Shirley back.
>> ARTICLE
HOW THE HELL WAS HE SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WOULD KILL SHIRLEY? He didn't know that (a) shirley had somehow gotten his geass removed (b) that she would meet rolo before him (c) that she would mention nunally and (d) that rolo would act in that manner without his permission. Lelouch didn't see the scene where rolo killed an ally without question, and the moment he did, he got ready for the attack on geass HQ and sped up his plans for rolo.
>> ARTICLE
Of course Lelouch couldn't have known that Rolo would kill Shirley. I'm arguing that he was aware he had a very sensitive bomb in his hands that could explode with a little jostling, and it's his fault for not getting Rolo out of the picture earlier.

Didn't Rolo casually ask Lelouch if he should kill Suzaku in an earlier episode? That should have been a huge hint that he was dangerous. Aside from that he also had Rolo's records which would also be an indicator.
>> ARTICLE
Best part from these episodes is Jeremiah and the sudden surge of loyalty. Orange best character.
>> ARTICLE
Orange's turn makes a little more sense if you watch Picture Drama 4.33, which came with the DVDs for the first season. 

I'm conflicted though. I feel bad about Shirley's death but, one way or another, I like how the episode itself was executed. Shame. 

As for Kallen and what she knows about Lelouch's identity...she was never told, at least not on screen as far as I can remember, about his past as a prince of Britannia. 


>> ARTICLE
With this thread we are now officially past the half way point. No new Ghibli film today, haven't had the time. Might go watch one after these threads but I don't think I will. Not much else to say today, the daily grind at work as always.

**Episode 13**

* Shirley has the most horrifying (k)nightmares.
* Oh yeah, new OP
* Still no Jibun
* Yeah it's kind of forgettable really
* Now this is the perfect opportunity for you to kill Lelouch. Hell if that is the ending people are talking about I would be perfectly content with it.
* Mmm Pizza Hut
* RoboJere has a sword arm? AWESOME
* He is literally terminator now
* DAYUM
* Cornellia wasn't going to listen to any of that shit. Straight dagger to the head.
* Maid-sama ded
* KILL THAT TRAITOR ROLO
* Wait what? Why not kill him? GRRRRRRRRRRRRR
* Well at least RoboJere gets shit done
* MAID-SAMA IS STILL ALIVE?!?
* I take that back. RoboJere you incompetent bastard.
* I feel like I'm a character in Mars of Destruction. I can see a person be decapitated and still think they can survive
* Suzaku is the real hero in that scene. Pulls up the weight of two people with one hand.
* I'm counting on you here RoboJere
* WTF? What was the point of de-geassing them if you are just going to knock the unconscious?
* I also have to wonder if RoboJere can see the red around peoples eyes if he can canel geass affects
* Shirley, you're the prime candidate for shipping but you really do speak some utter bollocks sometimes. You actually think that a crime such as the murder of Princess Euphy (may she rest in peace) is forgivable? On what planet do you live?
* Why is she all lovey-dovey with Lelouch again anyway? So he says some genuinely kind and words and somehow your dead father (who was forcably wiped from your memory) no longer matters? I suppose I can buy the forgiveness thing but to love him on top of that? Really?
* Shirley if you end up saving Lelouch again I will destroy you.
* How convinient that the emp device they have planned on using just so happens to be around when RoboJere decides to attack, let alone how Lelouch would be dead if he had come after him at literally any other time
* I'm not sure if Code Geass has ever shown this before (apologies for missing it if so) but Nunnally doesn't actually have her eyes damaged. So that must make her blindness a PTSD thing. I guess we can expect to see Nunnally open her eyes before the show is over then.
* **Oh for fucks sake** RoboJere
* I can't win. I literally can't win.
* You'd think that if you could create a geass to cancel other geass then you would give it someone who was, well ya know, MENTALLY STABLE.
* R.I.P Shirley you deserved to die
* Knowing this show she isn't actually dead
* In fact all this talk about being "Reborn" I can't wait to see RoboShirley
* The ED is a really cheery song to follow that scream

**Episode 14**

* Young Charles!
* I applaud your ability to not rip out Rolo's throat knowing what he did
* I don't applaud your disrespect for personal space
* Who commits suicide by shooting themselves in the abdomen, come on now...
* C.C Needs to clean up. That bitch be skanky.
* "The fact that you are asking those questions means you have regain your memories" 
* ...
* ...
* I don't even...
* There is 3 characters left in this show that I care about now. They are the only thing standing between my forehead and the wall.
* And you won't kill Ohgi, so why even bother acting like you will, use the screen time wisely and show me more Cornellia instead
* Rolo is colder than Shirley's dead body
* Oh V.V is spinning? Time to use your Nen!
* CORNELIA! CORNELIA! CORNELIA!
* V.V Ded (but probably not)
* To be honest I just want him gone so that Charles comes out of the shadows
* NO
* NO YOU CAN'T END THE EPISODE THERE
* WHY DO THIS TO ME! 
* HAVE I NOT SUFFERED ENOUGH?

...
See you tomorrow

[some thoughts from past speculation](/s "Nunnally has Geass or maybe she will be given Geass when she opens her eyes. Then she proceeds to use Geass to either make everything better or just much worse. If she ends up having Geass, hopefully it's a nice power considering she's super sweet like Euphy.")

I do think she'll open her eyes at some point though.

> You'd think that if you could create a geass to cancel other geass then you would give it someone who was, well ya know, MENTALLY STABLE.

Agreed. Still no idea why they used him for the experiments in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
> Agreed. Still no idea why they used him for the experiments in the first place.

Have you heard that voice? More convincing that any Geass order. In-series, though, it was probably because they hoped his intense hatred for Lelouch would push him to win. They had no idea how devoted he was to Marianne.
>> ARTICLE
The voice is wonderful, no doubt.

I just thought they'd have a hard time controlling him because of his intense hatred for Zero. Were they originally using him just to fight Zero? Because now it seems that he was going to be used as a replacement for CC (whatever they need her for). Right? Like a back up plan since they couldn't capture her. They kept saying his upgrades were based on CC's powers. So how could they have hoped to control him if all he wanted to do was go out and kill Zero? Why not use anybody else who would just do exactly as they asked?

Of course, I could be wrong about the whole "backup for CC" idea, and he was just meant to kill Zero. Then I guess it does make sense. They definitely couldn't have known he was devoted to Marianne.

I hate this episode. I hate is almost as much as episode 23 of R1.

Something about young girls tragically dying for no real reason in order to further the development of the main character pisses me off. It doesn't help that neither of them had any inherently bad intentions in their nature. And one was turned into a super tragic character that started a massacre. 

I can somewhat justify Lelouch knowing he had to deal with Euphemia after massively fucking up, what I cannot deal with is fucking Rolo acting super impulsively because he has no sense of morality.

Remember when I said at the start of this season the person I hate is Rolo? This is (mostly) why. Fuck you Rolo, I liked Shirley. 
>> ARTICLE
Coming from a re-watcher, at this point I felt more sorry for Rolo than Shirley because of his story. Call me a monster but I just didn't like Shirley's character one bit, I didn't even come close to shedding a tear when she died.

Ok, you're a monster

Yeah, out of the 50 epis of Code Geass, I have only refused to rewatch only epis 23 of R1 and 13 of R2.

That's Rolo's whole deal.  Emotionally needy, amoral, quick to kill, doesn't think things through.  Add to that the clear attraction between Lelouch and Shirley and he wasn't gonna have anyone take away the target of his new obsession.  She was more or less marked by him for some time.  All he needed was an excuse and an opportunity.

But yeah, fuck Rolo.

ROLLO, WHAT DID YOU DO.

I'll admit, I was spoiled that Shirley would die and knew it would come eventually, but I thought we'd get to see her confront Lelouch first.  How can security fail to set up a simple perimeter, especially when they're *told to guard "that girl right there"*?  A Knight of the Round took over, you had literally one job!  Ugh.

You deserved better, Shirley.  And that cover story?  Maybe the only thing that could have made this even more devastating for her mom.  Poor woman.  :(
>> ARTICLE
Damn Rolo went too far killing Shirley. Geass can't save lives confirmed :(

Why do they make V2 look like a girl? 

I thought the Pizza Hut logo was censored on the blu-ray? I saw one during the C2 scene (episode 16). 

All the OPs have been super disappointing since the first. This new one is defiantly the second best one (it's not hard) but it's still nowhere close to first one. The EDs have all sucked. Just minor complaints, the show itself is still great :)

* Cornelia with her new hairstyle looks hot

* Oh yeah, eat shit Rolo. Hope you crash in your Knightmare

* I actually liked Shirley and her development. Didn't understand why a lot hated her

If I were to rank the top three girls in Lelouch's harem, it would be:

1. C.C.

2. Shirley

3. Kallen

These threads are impossible to follow with everyone posting 50 bullet points. This is not conducive to good discussion and is an eye sore. I would much rather read paragraphs than this incoherent babble. It's too taxing to slog through 20 different ideas for each post, when there should only be a small number of ideas to better facilitate discussion.

Sorry guys, I'm out.

I'll finish the show at my own pace, but won't be visiting these threads anymore.

Also, I'm not having a single problem following the discussion.
>> ARTICLE
Can't blame you. There's a lot to read through, and not everyone will enjoy doing that.

I think the reason there are bullet points and such is to provide everyone with our first time reactions. Instead of a watching a reaction video, you're just getting our thoughts in written form. A lot of the discussion comes at the end of our posts, or more commonly in the responses where we start bouncing ideas off of one another.

Do come back for the series discussion though. No reactions there. Likely just our reviews, discussions, and maybe debates.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to talk about focused issues from the episodes go ahead and bring them up, you'll get what you're looking for. As /u/Neawia said we're pretty much doing written reactions and getting into discussions in the responses.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree. Its a good way to jot out all your thoughts while watching a show, but it makes responding to opinions and discussing them a pain.

I realize some people just want to read first timers reactions, but personally that ain't for me.
>> ARTICLE
That's okay, people have their own preferences. At least come back for the last episode thread, there might be less of the bullet points and more like essays.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the essays should wait until the overall discussion thread after 25
>> ARTICLE
I'm at work so my full reactions will come in about an hour and a few, but: Fuck Rolo, and fuck Lelouch. I hold both responsible for Shirley dying. And 14 is clearly Lelouch's moral event horizon.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad to see "O2" go, but this new opening isn't bad! Is [Nunnally](http://i.imgur.com/8MTOwPB.png) going full [Lacus](http://i.imgur.com/TFeCqlJ.jpg) now?

Jeremiah's done a complete 180! Do the dubbers actually know that "Your Majesty" is for kings and "Your Highness" is for princes? Because if so, and they're using "Your Majesty" purposefully, then Jeremiah's lines are all the more poignant.

With that outright slaughter, Lelouch has finally gone completely off the deep end, and his followers are starting to realize it. With eleven episodes left, is he going to regain his sanity at some point, or is it all downhill from here? I hope he gets it back together, because it will be a long slog and a sad conclusion if he doesn't, but only time will tell.

**Episode 7**

* The Japanese VA for child Lelouch was quite good in that first scene as brief as it was
* Ah less-awesome-gannicus, I can't wait for Griffbat Zorlight West to inevitably kill you
* Wait after all that they are setting up a home for asshole cat? Are you sure it is Lelouch with the mind control powers?
* Maybe if you actually just said "No we didn't kiss, I don't like him, we aren't in a relationship" there wouldn't be anything to misunderstand. Good old anime tropes. Lacking basic communication skills despite being more than old enough.
* Cheese-kun is best -kun
* She actually isn't that far off getting a Cheese-kun hugging pillow at the rate she eats Pizza hut. If she shows up with one next episode this show will be an indisputable 10/10
* To add to that: Was Cheese-kun an actual thing in Japan or anime original?
* Viceroy has the most fabulous hair so far
* How can Lelouch think every minute detail of a plan out but not question this green haired girl at all? She's creepy, eats your bank accounts worth in Pizza hut and makes ominous remarks and you are just like "Okay"
* Yeah he goes on about living to protect his sister all the damn time, I don't know why you even think he might shoot himself
* Ha! Glorious Britannia is one step ahead killing off these folk for not reporting those vile terrorists!
* Bullshit. That dude wasn't looking anywhere near Lelouch when he used the mindcontrol
* The background music around 14:30 is pretty funky
* Wait cat festival? THEY'RE MAKING THAT ASSHOLE CAT HAVE ITS OWN PERMANENT FESTIVAL? 
* I hate you student council...
* IT'S NOT QUITE A BOOB GRAB BUT THERE IT IS!
* Ah Griffbat, the one thing you forgot to take into account is how elevens are an inferior species to the great Britannians, accept this simple truth
* I bet that Griffbat Zorlight West is just Crowd Control being better than Lelouch and planning ahead of his failure
* Ah well. I was hoping they would save the reveal for next episode so I would look smarter but *it's whatever*
* What is this 'people' or 'nation' you speak of? There is only Britannia and Britannians, the rest are of little importance

Looks like the show is finally going to start transitioning away from the high school slice of life stuff and start moving towards the unjust and wrongful attack on Britannia. I will still desperately hold onto the hope that Britannia will live on.

Huh, even as a kid Lelouch had a ridiculous cape. Ooh, I just realized that Milly's family is the one sponsoring him through the entire thing. Okay, so even before the invasion he hated Britannia, he just decided to bring it down after that.

Sisterly conflict between princesses? I could see Euphemia turning against Cornelia assuming both of them stay alive for a while.

I like seeing Shirley and Kallen together, and as expected Shirley thinks she's going out with Lelouch. And then Suzaku falls on Shirley, I wonder if they'll have a thing in the future. Nina's working on... something. By herself. I'm guessing nothing good.

[Cheese-kun?](http://i.imgur.com/hbrLoxy.png) I didn't expect CC to pull a gun on Lelouch like that. Good reversal with threatening himself, but I wonder what will happen to her if he dies.

Another civilian ghetto invaded and a deliberate trap for Zero. Another game of mechachess, but this time Zero loses. Good thing CC was there to save him, I foresee using her in costume in the future to create alibis for Lelouch. Though...

[Wild speculation round 5](/s "CC has a little chat with Kallen while in Zero's disguise and Lelouch is forced to bring her into the loop to prevent her from doing something stupid. Shirley begins flirting with Suzaku and they hit it off well until he accidentally kills Kallen in a mech while trying to stop Zero from getting to Cornelia.

To be honest the battles are the least interesting part of the series to me, thus why I don't have much to say about them. I'm not surprised by that since I regularly enjoy watching entire series along the lines of the student council sections here, not so much on the full action series. I remember I really liked the first FMA series a decade ago, but was really bored when I tried getting into Brotherhood a year ago.

**SO** close, but **SO** far...
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch was pretty far down the succession line so he has a lot of half siblings, yeah? He's already killed one without remorse. Cornelia's probably next. I wonder if he has any family besides Nunnally that he has fond memories of.

I'm thinking his father had something to do with his mother's death. Possibly CC as well since they hinted at her being quite old or ageless, maybe she's always being cloned. There was a picture of her on an old battlefield I think. I'd also say it's possible that CC gave Lelouch's father Geass and he used it to expand Britannia. He probably no longer had use for CC and cast her aside, and now she's using Lelouch to help exact revenge on the Emperor.

Seriously though, I'd love to start learning more about CC. She's so mysterious that you can predict almost anything about her. I want to know what she's all about... and I hope she gets that Pizza Hut pillow. Well, at the rate she's ordering pizza she'll have it in another few episodes.

A few other users were talking about Lelouch being arrogant and such. I agree, but this is the first time he's truly trying to put his plan into action. And with the power of Geass, can you blame the guy for thinking it might be easier to accomplish his goals then he previously thought? Either way, I think he realized after his defeat in this episode that he can't do it on his own. He wants to build his own army and nation. I'm just worried that he'll end up killing his father and be tempted to rule over everything himself instead of letting the nations go back to governing themselves.

Day 5...I'm wondering how long you guys will last before you get sick of me. I shall continue to beat you round the head with my bad jokes until that day comes. *You have been warned.*

**Episode 5**

* Oooooh didn't think the Ishvalan war happened in the Code Geass timeline
* We might not get Scar so Nunnally has been chosen to carry on the legacy of the Die hard films
* Speaking of which, we need a [Basque Grand](http://i.imgur.com/0bqrQhU.jpg) equivalent. Not that any character can actually match the glorious man that he is. 
* I also hope there is some ships I can jump on
* Fuck it just give me Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a re-skin
* That said FMA:B didn't have Pizza hut. Code Geass 10/10, never change
* [Lelouch](http://i.imgur.com/Cny4Mjd.png) is probably thinking he smoked a little too much weed
* [\(   \)](http://i.imgur.com/SrZVAPZ.png)
* Huh? Crowd Control? *Well I guess that sort of counts*
* Fuck that just shows how much I used to play League
* Almost forgot that this is a teen romantic comedy "No you misunderstand" 
* [Bitch please](http://i.imgur.com/Gj3nDQE.png)...you think I wouldn't notice that was you?
* Don't just climb on top of her this is a romcom not an ecchi
* Wait...crowd control is eating Pizza hut..is it episode 25 already?!?
* Hang on. She get shot in the head. Why have I not questioned the fact that she is completely fine up until now.
* "I'm sorry for trying to commit suicide. I didn't realize someone was below me"
* [I hate my life :D | Everything Is terrible :D | Go die :D ](http://i.imgur.com/4Askaj3.png)
* I don't see no bad guys
* She has like 50 different styles rolled into 1. [That's some crazy shit.](http://i.memecaptain.com/gend_images/I-6Btw.png)
* Whats-his-name sees right through your bullshit
* And that is why I hate cats. Little bastards.
* I guess I can ship Whats-his-name and brain damaged girl
* Oh man the cheek holding scene. I was actually joking at first but this is a true TRC through and through
* Holy shit [she is the anti-chirst](http://i.imgur.com/HkMaRwa.png). Bloodshot eyes, carving crosses into the bricks with a sharp blade...I would not want to meet her in an dark alleyway. 
* [That's right](http://i.imgur.com/daVX5Aw.png)...feed my nationalistic ego you filthy eleven!
* #rekt
* Brain damaged girl has a strong pimp hand
* Awww yeah! I'm a huge fan of duel wielding swords
* Henceforth your name shall change from Whats-his-name to Gannicus. Do the name justice.
* ANNNNNND She runs into a mech fight. *Your* name has now changed from Brain damaged girl to Brain dead girl
* So she is a princess of Britannia, no wonder they are going down the shitter
* *Shocking plot twist*

Welp. Sorry for the late post. Took me like an hour to do this write up since it was a bitch to format. There is bound to be mistakes and such but I lack the energy to check it.

Now I'm going to go finish the new boob dungeon episode that I have stop-started like three times now.

Took me the longest time to get that "crowd control" = CC.  I always like to think of Carbon Copy.  Or that her name is Ceecee.  But since I'm watching the dub, where they oddly decided to change it to C2, that's ruined.  Siituu, maybe?
>> ARTICLE
They didn't change it, though.  That's how it's pronounced.  It's stylized C.C. in both versions and pronounced C2 (or as close as they can get in the sub) in both versions.  It's just a common mistake when people aren't listening to pronunciations while watching subs.
>> ARTICLE
in the german dub they also call her c.c. instead of c2
>> ARTICLE
I never actually watched the subs  I just assumed everyone called her "CC" because she was called that in the subs.  So this is one of those Throat-warbler Mangrove/Raymond Luxury-yacht deals  :/

They call her C.C. (Or CC commonly) in text just because that is how it's written.  It's just not pronounced how it's styled.

I see so many opportunities! Lelouch is free game so pick someone else to go with him. I'm leaning Kallen but that's mostly because she's gotten more screen time than other girls. Suzaku x Euphemia is one I'm anticipating but who knows if it'll happen?

[New challenger approaching!](http://i.imgur.com/C9BFEx0.png) Cornelia means business. Also apparently Britannia took over the Middle East *after* Japan? I guess those mechs don't run on fossil fuels.

CC's just chilling with Nunnally, I like it. Also just two episodes ago Lelouch was saying he'd never lie to his sister, and yet here he is making up an excuse to drag CC off. She's being obstinate about not answering questions too, they're an appropriate pair.

*Science!* guy is keeping tabs on Zero. I like him, moving on his own on the fringe of the regime. Meanwhile Jeremiah's out of favor and likely to become even more of an extremist if he doesn't get offed soon. Also the Japanese Liberation Front hasn't been a player yet but they keep getting screen time so I'm expecting them to shake things up in a major way eventually, probably getting in Zero's way at an inopportune moment if you want to heighten dramatic conflict.

[Too bad they repeated paragraphs on this paper](http://i.imgur.com/cd8cuoD.png) but I read it anyway, I appreciate that it isn't just gibberish. Unsurprising that Lelouch wants to bring even more chaos to destabilize Britannia.

Suzaku gets acquitted of assassinating Clovis just so he can survive to interfere with Lelouch's plans another day, but then [a princess falls on him.](http://i.imgur.com/lWBW9pR.png) Or at least I'm guessing she's a princess, as:

1. Royalty seem to be a dime a dozen around here.
2. She has to escape from presumably being under heavy guard.
3. She isn't dressed like a prisoner.

[Shifty-eyed Kallen](http://i.imgur.com/atSHuSi.png) is cute, she's climbing up my best girl chart. ^(I'm not keeping a chart) ^^at ^^least ^^not ^^on ^^paper Aaaand now Sophie (and as a result, the rest of the school by the end of the day, I'm guessing) thinks Kallen and Lulu are dating. All in the name of keeping Kallen from spotting CC.

So Lelouch *can* issue persistent commands. ...yeah, I'm going to give up on the logic of the Geass and how he uses it.

Suzaku's an outsider either way, seen as a traitor by the Japanese and a mudblood by the Britannians. Instead of trying to break the system with Zero he's just going to be slowly crushed to death by it and ruin the other's plans in the process. I wonder how much they're going to pound in the parallels between Lelouch and Suzaku as the series goes on.

And Suzaku once again takes the route of self-impairment by protecting one of the less stable elements of the military and ensuring that things will just get worse. Villetta's the woman with Jeremiah, I finally got her name! Yep, Euphie's a princess. I wonder if she'll stick around for Suzaku's sake, which will lead to him becoming her champion.

This could make for one giant [gambit pileup](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup) down the road with all the parties involved (I saw that there's an entry for Code Geass there but didn't read it). There are the scientists, Jeremiah and Villetta probably on their own, Cornelia and her forces, the Japanese Liberation Front, Kallen and her terrorists, CC, Lelouch, Euphemia, and Suzaku among others I've likely forgotten (including the civilian students).

Euphemia is Clovis's sister? So presumably Lelouch's as well. And now Suzaku's at the school, how convenient! So that means...

[Wild speculation round 3](/s "CC also comes in as a new student and joins the student council along with Suzaku. Nina develops an unrequited crush on Suzaku who's instead in love with Euphemia. Meanwhile everyone else thinks Lelouch and Kallen are dating except Kallen thinks it's him and CC because they're acting weird around each other. Kallen begins to fall for Lelouch anyway but can't bring herself close to him - or anyone else - because she's too busy fighting Britannia with Zero who's also mysteriously charismatic. Rivalz is mildly depressed by that until Sophie comforts him and they start dating.")

Emperor Wakamoto took the Seduction Focus with the *Way of Life* DLC and modded the game with console commands to let him have more than four wives.

[Maps!](http://i.imgur.com/PTrZhaG.png) I love maps and could spend way too long studying them. I remember Cornelia was fighting in what looked like the Middle East last season, but did the Chinese Federation take that area over after she left? And weird that Australia looks like an independent nation at this point.

Not sure what to think of this OP. Ooh there's the locket again. [...is that Rolo holding it?](http://i.imgur.com/fy2rGiF.png) Looks like we're going to get even more unique overpowered mechs too.

Back on Kamine Island... So they shot each other and they both missed. I don't get why Kallen would run away from there, honestly. Even if Lelouch was using her, he's still the best chance she ever had at accomplishing something. And even if she didn't like Lelouch, Suzaku was still her enemy and that was a good time to try to take him down.

And just like that Lelouch is before the Emperor. Ah, the Knights of the Round, I'm guessing we'll see them in action later this season.

[](#deadpan) Emperor Geass! This is my surprised face. Both eyes at that, huh. So if CC wasn't responsible for him getting the power, I wonder who was. Marianne, or someone else connected to her?

Sayoko... I'm still wondering what her deal is, but I suppose she was partially recruited to help keep Nunnally safe. Poor Rolo, given a false life like that as well. Unless he's a spy for the emperor, which I'm not ruling out.

Oh Kallen, what are you going to do now? She's probably just there to get answers, not shoot him. At least I hope so.

Nice job Suzaku, you're now in the direct employ of a crazy man who wants to kill God.

I like the question Kallen asked of him, questioning if she was really serving under her own free will. That makes a lot of sense for why she would have left him back then too, if she was wondering that immediately.

Calares, your fabulous facial hair is not long for this world. Did Urabe even have a name last season? I don't remember him at all.

Hm.. some other new mech? With either cloaking or teleportation or some insanely fast movement. Oh right, Urabe was one of the four warriors with Td.

I like Guilford, glad he's still around. Also Diethard, and I love his reaction to Zero's return.

[Knights of](http://i.imgur.com/8p8bNEh.png) [the Round.](http://i.imgur.com/4hisnjk.png) Guess that wasn't a prince and princess last episode, too bad. And looks like the Chinese envoys are getting in on it.

[Nina!](http://i.imgur.com/sXmMA6i.png) Looks like she's working for the technologists now. [Not sure if Geassed or just weird eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/pXYCPjQ.png) Still wondering where Villetta's headed character-wise.

Rolo was in that mech, eh? I thought he could have been a spy. Maybe one of the Knights of the Round undercover? ...and he has Geass too. Not particularly surprised that more people have some form of it, but I am disappointed. At least the rebellion plot's continuing for now.

[Wild speculation turn 2](/s "Turns out Shirley, Rivalz, and Nina have all been given Geass abilities as well. Nina's makes anyone obsessively fall in love with her, Shirley can infer any identity that a person goes by, and Rivalz can turn anyone into a boring side character.")
>> ARTICLE
Why are disappointed about more people having Geass, again?
>> ARTICLE
It's formulaic in a bad way. MC has this one unique, cool power and wrecks enemies for a while? Now all the villains do as well so they can be on the same level. It also makes Lelouch less interesting to me as a result.
>> ARTICLE
I get that.

Also, since we aren't allowed to talk too much about your speculation, I'll just say that one of the theories in there is more relevant than you might think.
>> ARTICLE
> I'll just say that one of the theories in there is more relevant than you might think.

Damn, Rivalz is going to turn the show into Glasslip, isn't he?
>> ARTICLE
SHIT SHIT HE KNOWS
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really think that played any role in my finding Lelouch to be interesting as a character. Just as well, as we saw with Mao, not all of those abilities are the same. 

The simple fact is the world is a lot bigger than Lelouch thought. He is not the first person in history to be given a magical power.

>> ARTICLE
I don't even think it's bad, if anything it makes things more interesting. Really presents the question as to who gave them their Geass, etc. 

> It also makes Lelouch less interesting to me as a result.

I disagree with this. It certainly makes Lelouch less unique, but it doesn't make him less interesting. From what we've seen, each Geass is different, and the ways in which they can be used and are used by their wielder just makes me appreciate Lelouch even more.

Honestly part of it's just my expectations for the series. You know how you might take a bite of something expecting it to be sweet, but it's sour or bitter instead? Kinda like that.

I never really cared about the Geass aspects of the show before and just wanted it to be about Lelouch, with this unique ability, bringing down Britannia. I would have been perfectly content with a brief handwave calling it alien technology that can only bond with one human.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully it will force Lelouch to better use his Geass in order to defeat others who have the power as well. Some of his commands have been well thought out but many are just "die" or "tell me what you know." I think he can get a bit more creative, and he'll need to if he wants to succeed.

>> ARTICLE
> Well, we know from this episode and the last one that Lelouch has been under surveillance by the Britannians, presumably to watch out for if he gets his old memories back?

I don't think they were worried about this. Well, Charles' personal agents weren't, at least. Charles and the personal agent both admitted to tracking Lelouch and monitoring him not to make sure that his memory got back, but in order to use him as bait to lure out CC. 

As for the ideological deviations, I think that was just mega observation and were just noting everything they could. But the reason they were tracking him was completely to lure out CC.

> Oh, there's where the Spinzaku meme comes from.

Not yet. Spinzaku comes from literally my favorite scene in all of anime, no contest. The entire scene is just amazing and I remember going crazy during it.

> Charles' Geass is pretty terrifying. Though, that explains why Lelouch's memory was changed, but what about all of the other people at Ashford? Did Charles Geass them all individually? Also, how was he able to seal Lelouch's Geass just by removing his memory of it? We've already seen that at this point, Lelouch's Geass exists independent of his will.

Yeah, Charles' geass is pretty strong. We can probably assume that Charles just mass geassed Ashford Academy, similar to how Lelouch can use mass geass. He probably gathered them all together and rewrote their memories, just because it's more practical. Similar to how Lelouch can command a crowd of people, it's probable that Charles can as well.

> Lelouch being all strategist/chessmaster is always really fun.

Who doesn't love to see Lelouch embarrass the nobility? That's just classic Lelouch right there.

> I really liked the conversation between Lelouch and Kallen when she pulled the gun on him. It's interesting to note that she trusts Zero, but not Lelouch.

Yeah, I really loved this scene. She's trying to distinguish her loyalty between Zero and Lelouch and she's obviously having trouble doing it. I find it cute that she has no problem disrespecting Lelouch, but idolizes Zero.

> Where was she hiding the gun...?

Behind her, she was holding and hiding her hand.

[Code Geass R2 Spoilers](/s "You're correct, Rolo's geass can't stop time itself, but it can stop peoples perception of time. It has no effect on the physical world though, meaning he can't stop a missle. Lelouch wasn't in the radius of Rolo's geass. It's important to note that they're on completely different floors and the building is actually quite large, meaning Rolo would have to extend his geass hundreds of feet. I'm pretty sure the larger the radius, the more strain it has on Rolo. As for Lelouch hearing the radio, you might just be overthinking it. It's not like the knightmare is slow by any means, they were fighting in presumably close quarters. Rolo probably just used his geass to make things easier.")

EDIT: 
[more spoilers](/s "The likelihood that Lelouch was affected by Rolo's geass is actually just as likely now that I think about it.

I hadn't considered the raw power implicit in Charles's Geass. Especially since, [Code Geass R2 Spoilers](/s "as we know based on Rolo and Mao, not every Geass has to work only once. Charles's might work multiple times.") That'd make it a hell of a strong power for manipulating politics in a court... so I'm sure Charles has used it a lot.

[Semi-spoilers for CG and Akito the Exiled](/s "If anyone is also watching Akito the Exiled, this is almost certainly how 'Julius Kingsley' aka brainwashed Lelouch came about. The unconfirmed theory is that Charles geassed Lelouch into thinking he was a Britannian military advisor, then sent him off to help in Europe for the one year interim between R1 and R2.")
>> ARTICLE
I thought about this before too, but rewatching this episode it came to my attention that Charles specifically told Lelouch that he'd lead a normal life. This makes me believe the situation in Akito the Exiled is pretty much the same as the "Rolo" character in Nightmare of Nunnally.
>> ARTICLE
This is a possibility that I hadn't thought of actually. But assuming Charles can use his geass on somebody more than once, he could have just brainwashed Lelouch as seen in this episode, then used his geass again to send him to the EU, then wiped his memory of it afterwards and restored him to the normal student. Another point which leads me to believe this is 'Julius Kingsley' being accompanied to the EU by (tagging just in case) []( /s "Suzaku. And the mild hatred/ disdain Suzaku shows to Julius Kingsley. I bet they'll show some interesting interactions between the two in the next couple of Akito the Exiled films.")

For example there could be a clone of Charles and Marriane with their exact memories. (actually, Charles geassing someone to have his own memories and take over if he died sounds like a great idea, R3 confimed?) ") 
>> ARTICLE
Ooooohhh man.. watching this episode makes my blood boil. This is the height of Suzaku being a cunt alright. I don't think I've hated this guy more at this point than any other within the series. His vision of changing Brittania is so idiotic. Suzaku as a character has great ideals, but is incredibly naive, and this is exemplified clearly within this episode. He's just way too idealistic with no leadership qualities, and is just unable to grasp the reality of so many things. That's what separates Lelouch's vision and Suzaku's, their understanding of the real world. 

The scene between Lelouch and Kallen is one of my favorite scenes in the show. And yes it's completely because I ship them together (I got very mad when CC interrupted >:( ). I think it's important to note how Kallen tries to distinguish her loyalty between Zero and Lelouch for the first time. Up until now, they've just been completely separate entities, but now that she knows Lelouch is Zero, it's really interesting how she reacts: she attempts to reaffirm her loyalty to Zero and separate them.

I also love how Lelouch reassures Urabe that he's not expendable, despite the fact that Urabe himself believes so. This just shows Lelouch's charisma and charm as a leader, even if he's just a high school kid. Also, CC's lax attitude while they're being rekt makes me laugh. I love her =) 

When Lelouch notes that the mysterious Knightmare "Isn't Suzaku, and tactics cannot defeat strategy" I think that's a testament to Suzaku's ability. Even if he's not intelligent, the fact that he just has so much raw power that he can defy any sort of strategy amazes me. Urabe's sacrifice is sick, how he just pushes Lelouch out of the way and encourages him. It's also heart warming how Lelouch's words really got through to him, as he recited it back to Lelouch. Poor guy gave up everything for Zero.

Lelouch's look of panic when Kallen prepares to sacrifice herself for him is also interesting.. some people are definitely worth more to Lelouch than others. Despite Kallen essentially being the Queen of the Black Knights, I don't think Lelouch's panic was of losing her as an ally, but personally losing her. 

Lelouch's laugh when he smashes Calares, LOL. The sarcastic farewell to the General was just insult to injury. When Lelouch has that laugh, you know he's won. His signature laugh to mark his first victory upon returning. 

Lelouch's comeback speech is just too wicked. The world is still a wicked place in the eyes of Lelouch, and he's correct. Without the bloody revolution that he's attempting, the world will just stay stagnant. Change can't come from the system when the system's full of Brittanian scum who're enjoying their comfortable lives. Look at the Brittanian Knight of Rounds. The aristocracy is just too comfortable with exploiting the workers (Japanese in this case), so why would they ever stop? To the people who think Lelouch is a villain, you're wrong. He's undoubtedly doing the right thing. Those who have power are against Zero because he aims to demolish them, and rightfully so. (sorry my Marxist views stepped in here)

What a great episode. Lelouch's power is completely reinstated and the show's rolling again. It's time to conquer Brittania. 

All hail Lelouch!!

/u/billycoolj, I like you. Good stuff.

If Zero had not formed a rebellion, everything would be worse for the Japanese. Britannia would continue expanding and using the rest of the world for their own desires, and Charles would have a much easier time obtaining the power he needs to do whatever crazy ass thing he has planned. Lelouch was necessary. Some people might not like him (I do), but he's mixing it up and resisting an oppressive government/country/whatever Britannia is.

Is this whats right? And how the hell was he able to just walk into the Emperors special chambers? VV told him about it or something?

Aaaaaaand [there it is.](http://i.imgur.com/FDavK0p.jpg) Knew it. It was a safe enough prediction, [but I called it.](http://www.gfycat.com/GrimMiniatureGnat)

False memories of a false life. That was just pure evil. I know Lelouch has been doing something similar to everyone else, but none of his Geass-ees knew what was happening. Lelouch knew what was coming and literally stared a terrible fate in the eye. For all he knew, this was the end. His father was screwing him for the second time, and hed have no memory of Nunnally. This is the lowest weve seen him, and JYB sold it. Shit. I just really felt for him in that scene.

CC didnt give the Emperor Geass. Im inclined to believe this is true because CC finally seems like a good ally/friend/love interest for Lelouch, but I cant be sure.

Yes, absolutely yes. The theatrics are necessary. Wouldnt be Lelouch without them.

Lelouch using the maps to give orders is incredibly entertaining. The maps are like steroids for his already jacked brain. Everything is flawless.

The Black Knights hated on Zero at the end of R1, but Im glad a few still have the utmost faith that he can save Japan, or rather the world.

Kallen, please. Put the gun down. Youre not going to shoot him.

Suzaku better double-cross the hell out of the Emperor, but that might be putting too much faith in him. And the Emperor wants to destroy a god? What god? Someone from these other strange planets? And hes gonna do it with the Sword of Akasha (sp?).

Lots of Kallen fan service shots these first two episodes.

Little brother, Rolo. You bastard Geass user. Youd better not mess with Lelouchs uncle!

This just came to me while doing my write-up even though there really wasn't much from the episode that made me think of it. Maybe VV is to Charles what CC is to Lelouch. He has the same weird name so I'd say it's possible he's the one who gave Charles Geass. VV needed the Emperor to accomplish something (killing a god?) the same way CC needed Lelouch (maybe to stop VV.) So I'm curious what the relationship is between CC and VV. Do they know each other? Related somehow? Or maybe they're simply just part of the same strange alien race. Idk. We'll find out, won't we?

That would be my guess after thinking about it, but there might be more to it later.

Yeah, I have no clue about any of that and I don't think there's much we can even guess at beyond that.
>> ARTICLE
I guess calling them friends at this point is useless. I can understand now that Suzaku had reason to act the way he did, but he only acted. He didn't listen to Lelouch's side of things. I mean, he does realize that Charles is Lelouch's father, right? And that he was the one who cast out Lelouch and Nunnally after, presumably, having something to do with their mother's murder? Suzaku must know this. His family helped them when they were children. Then he just goes and brings Lelouch to Charles who uses Geass to completely screw up his memories. Does Suzaku not care for Nunnally any more either? She's done nothing wrong, and he should be trying to help her.

I know people can do stupid things when they're angry or in mourning (if Suzaku even had time to mourn Euphemia). That shouldn't change the fact that Suzaku should feel a bit of regret for what he did.

If, of course, he wasn't Geassed, which I'm not ruling out just yet.
>> ARTICLE
> He didn't listen to Lelouch's side of things.

I don't disagree with you about Nunnally, but Lelouch didn't really try to explain himself, did he? ~~Even a simple "Hey, my sister was kidnapped and is being held here" could have done wonders back on the island.~~ From Suzaku's point of view Lelouch is attempting to destroy everything he's trying to protect. Not the society, but the people in it.

Edit: whoops, went back and rewatched the scene and forgot that he did say that. Still, Lelouch never said anything about why he's trying to bring down Britannia.
>> ARTICLE
> Still, Lelouch never said anything about why he's trying to bring down Britannia.

You're absolutely right, and he should have. I'm surprised there wasn't more resistance on Lelouch's part.

I mean, the show literally starts with Lelouch declaring to Suzaku that he will obliterate Britannia. I think that Suzaku knows exactly why, he just can't accept the deaths that Lelouch has caused. I do think that it was both more civil and more fucked up than expected. Holding him down while his every memory is stripped away? Messed up. Not killing him dispite how pissed he is and how much he wanted to kill Lelouch, better. And turning him in for a promotion is in line with Suzaku's desire to change things from within.

Lelouch shot his princess who was in the middle of a cultural genocide that she would never have stopped. Yes, it was Lelouch's fault she was Geassed, but Suzaku never knew that.

Damn good point. Nice.

Their conversation on Kamine Island at the end of the first season makes me think otherwise. Lelouch says that Euphemia killed innocent Japanese people and Suzaku immediately begins talking about him having the Geass and letting everyone else take the blame.

Given what Suzaku knew about Euphemia he probably doubted she would have willingly given that order, so he could reasonably assume that Lelouch commanded her to give the order, then killed her and took credit for saving the Japanese people as a result.

That I agree with. Why Lelouch didn't immediately try to explain it was an accident is beyond me. You could say it was because he thought Suzaku wouldn't believe him, but he could have at least tried.

I'm surprised it's just now starting. My hatred for this guy stemmed back from the first season when he was just constantly being a thorn to Lelouch's side, disrupting his plans. My hatred for him solidified this episode, though. Turning in Lelouch for a promotion is just despicable, especially considering how many times Lelouch has saved him. 

> Honorable, but stupid sacrifice. The new Knightmare is clearly too important to die yet.

Are you talking about Urabe's sacrifice? Because it wasn't stupid at all. Lelouch even said that Urabe's sacrifice wouldn't go to waste. It bought them just enough time to plant the explosives and save the day. Without Urabe's sacrifice, Kallen would have died as well, and at that point Zero loses. There's a reason Kallen is the ace of the Black Knights, she's essentially the Queen of the Chess board. If she's out then the Black Knights lose before they even get to start.

> The Chinese noble has red eyes? Geassed? It is supposed to be implied that Zero used Geass on him in order to secure a safe haven in the Chinese consulate? Or something else?

Yeah, Lelouch geassed him in order to get him to comply. That's what is implied by the guys red eyes. Lelouch is back in action this episode!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hate him in the first season. He was incredibly frustrating, but it kind of made sense why he was doing what he was doing. This episode though, his actions were unforgivable. I know he never agreed with Lelouch on how to go about changing the world, but he never listened to Lelouch's reasons. Suzaku knew what Lelouch and Nunnally went through, right? You'd think that after finding out your childhood that you helped save is Zero you could at least give the guy a few minutes to explain himself. Instead, Suzaku still clings to the notion that his way is the only way to go about changing Britannia. He turns Lelouch in to The Emperor and completely obeys him, holding Lelouch down and allowing his entire memory to be rearranged. 

Crap, now I'm thinking that VV or even the Emperor Geassed Suzaku. Just because Lelouch used Geass on him doesn't mean someone else can't, right? If that's not the case, he's just an ass. I hope he gets a chance to redeem himself and he takes it.

> Are you talking about Urabe's sacrifice? Because it wasn't stupid at all.

I meant it more like, c'mon, there's a mysterious new badass mech, and there's no way it's gonna die yet. The rest of what you said was right though. Didn't really think about it like that. 
>> ARTICLE
> Just because Lelouch used Geass on him doesn't mean someone else can't, right?

Confirmed: Lelouch had Geassed himself (against Mao) so if Charles could use it on him as well it means they don't interfere with each other. That's aside from Mao's which doesn't alter people's minds to begin with.

So that's most of the confusion sorted now - other than who the hell Rolo is and why Shirley seems to have given up on the whole Lulu being Zero thing, unless she got her memory fiddled with by Charles off screen.

Seriously I'm starting to get scared of what the EU and China must have hidden up their sleeves that's stopping the Britannians just rolling over them with their super mechs.


And Suzaku you dick, stop fannying about with the Knights of the Round table and go be friends with Lelouch again. I don't reckon they'll stay enemies until the end so either they'll join up to save Nunnally or this is all some kind of convuluted super long con plot by Lelouch and Suzaku.

Actually no, the knightmare itself is nothing special. It's a mass produced unit of Lancelot. It's a step up from regular infantry units, but nowhere near Gurren or Lancelot Albion.

Her and the rest of the student council at minimum. Nunnally's missing and they aren't the least bit concerned about Lelouch or wondering why Rolo's just *there* suddenly?

> Seriously I'm starting to get scared of what the EU and China must have hidden up their sleeves that's stopping the Britannians just rolling over them with their super mechs.

Wishful thinking and a hope that the creators wanted to focus on the rebellion rather than the Geass power itself.
>> ARTICLE
Well, with more Geass powers floating around, they become less precious.  So in a way, this does put more focus on the rebellion.  And they force Lelouch to rely more on Batman-level strategizing/preparation rather than simply Geassing everything into submission.
>> ARTICLE
Unless you're implying there will be less Geass usage overall I don't see how that can be the case. If anything I'm imagining Lelouch will have to use it *more* just to counteract the others.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the Geass powers are now just one more tool in use by all sides in service of other things, and are neither the point in themselves nor something only Lelouch gets to wield and be special because of.

Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays are days that I'll contribute the least due to work. I just post and work on those days. Others I discuss with you guys.

Have fun with today's episode!
>> ARTICLE
Whoa it's day 2 of Season 2 already? I was planning on watching this with you guys since I never got around to watching it after finishing Season 1. Yeah, I know... But after the mindfuck that was Season 1, which I binged in two days flat btw, I desperately needed a breather. To sit down and sort out my thoughts, make sense of everything that had happened lol. I had no idea what to rate the show, no idea if it was even good or bad! So yeah, that took about a week, but by then I had moved on to other stuff. Now this seems like a good time to get back into the show. If only I can spare a little time. Saturdays are packed! Get back to you in a few hours.
>> ARTICLE
Please, for the anime gods, don't drop it, you HAVE, you MUST, watch until the end before rating it, DO IT. And tell me your reaction later. The final episode, is everything.
>> ARTICLE
Will do! I've heard that a lot of people were pissed by the ending though.
>> ARTICLE
Its the most redeeming part of the show for me. Don't not watch season 2. Its more of a trainwreck than one, but its glorious.
>> ARTICLE
Pissed at first, but upon having time to think about it, it's been widely accepted as one of the greatest endings to an anime in all time.

Like, Cowboy Bebop level good.
>> ARTICLE
It's saturday! That means a ton of new episodes for the currently airing shows.  Poor rewatch thread will be buried I think. No problem, I could be in those threads but instead I choose this one...*it's not like I want to post for your guys or anything*

**Optional Question:** Which show are you enjoying the most so far this season? (Leftovers included)

**Episode 2**

*  Either Lelouch and Suzaku can't aim for shit or they are faster than bullets. Either answer is exceptable.
* No idea why Kallen is so shaken.
* Knights of the round? Makes the Lancelot mech have more meaning. Also are we going to see a certain 'King' Arthur? 
* Of course best guy has a geass ability too. This makes me very happy. I'm guessing V.V is his version of C.C?
* So if C.C can override the geass effect on Lelouch then does that mean V.V could do something similar to someone that Lelouch has controlled?
* I do have to wonder if Charles has a bigger plan in mind. It would seem odd to just wipe his memories and call it a done deal. I almost believe that he wants Lelouch to challenge him again, given how manic has laughter was on episode 22.
* I know C.C is immortal and all but I really hope she dies already
* And I know that Suzaku dragged Lelouch to the emperor and everything but it has been established C.C won the fight with RoboJere and kallen is as loyal as ever so was there really no fight before Suzaku got away?
* Well it is implied that Charles has his hands on Nunnally so it shouldn't be too hard to get Lelouch to give up on the rebellion again
* Charles has a weapon for destorying God? You're telling me that he is such a badass that he has slain God and taken his place in the heavens?
* This, /r/anime, is why you have shit taste in best guy. Lelouch 'best guy'? I can taste the vomit in my throat
* "Have you ever used your geass on me?" Well I think that fact that he doesn't have his eye covered and yet you are not going around slaughtering the Japanese gives you your answer
* Too soon?
* [Lelouch asking the logical questions.](http://i.imgur.com/2i0t1Go.png) 
* You know I would like Kallen more as a character if they didn't shove her ass into the screen every few minutes
* Urabe! The character nobody cares about is about to die
* Honestly the design of kallens mech just looks really uncomfortable overall
* R.I.P useless commander
* GIVE ME THE REAL VICEROY BACK
* I understand people will be glad to have Zero back but is no one going to question how he abandoned the last rebellion and left them to die?
* Woah, Yuri-girl has a new get-up. She a state ~~alchemist~~ scientist now? Wonder what happened with the mech-nuke as well.
* 'United states of Japan'. Don't worry this is an alternate timeline, so 'Britannia' won't make the same mistake.
* Fight me Americans.
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH "ONII-CHAN" HAS A GEASS TOO
* You can have a geass! You can have a geass! Everybody can have a Geass!

So. Charles can wipe peoples memories. Lelouch can control peoples minds and then that wipes their memories. Onii chan can, do something? Now all we need is for Suzaku to get the Geass he deserves. 

Leouch has got his work cut out for him that is for sure. If he had just died on the first episode and Nunnally had been the main character instead I would be a lot happier but a season and bit over and I just want him dead already. It does make me wonder about Nunnally though. Can she have a geass ability with no eyes or could it manifest in other ways, because that would spice up the story a lot more than anything else has, especially if Nunnally finds out the truth about Euphy and turns agianst him. I never realized just how much I want that until now. 

*Pls Code Geass.*

**Pls.**

Blood Blockade Battlefront because I am a conceited New Yorker who likes seeing an anime set in my city.  Also the ED is the greatest compilation of terrible dancing ever.  Words cannot express my love for it.

>Either Lelouch and Suzaku can't aim for shit or they are faster than bullets. Either answer is exceptable.

I think Lelouch's aim is shit, but Suzaku actually hit the target he was aiming for (Lelouch's gun).

> I do have to wonder if Charles has a bigger plan in mind.

He and the OSI guys both mentioned that Lelouch was being used as bait to draw out CC.  So I'd say that's part of a larger plan.

> it has been established C.C won the fight with RoboJere and kallen is as loyal as ever so was there really no fight before Suzaku got away?

Kallen was hugely conflicted and confused in the moment.  Lelouch who she has no respect for and thinks very little of turned out to be the same person as Zero the man she admires and would gladly die for is a pretty big deal.  In addition finding out about Geass would seriously cast some doubt in her mind where her loyalties should lie.  Oh and Suzaku was pointing a gun at her so there's that.  CC was at the bottom of the ocean with RoboJere so Suzaku had plenty of time to get away.

> You're telling me that he is such a badass that he has slain God and taken his place in the heavens?

He hasn't killed him *yet* but that's the plan.

> You know I would like Kallen more as a character if they didn't shove her ass into the screen every few minutes.

> It does make me wonder about Nunnally though. Can she have a geass ability with no eyes or could it manifest in other ways

Well, remember, Mao's geass had nothing to do with his eyes, so I think eye contact is just one more arbitrary restriction put on certain geasses... geass... geassi...? Whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm you're right but do you still need to have functional eyes for the Geass to manifest? 

That is the question I'm wanting the answer for going forward.
>> ARTICLE
> Now all we need is for Suzaku to get the Geass he deserves. 

Good gravy, I hope he doesn't. I know you're loving the guy now that he's pro Britannia, but I don't think that would be good at all for his character. Especially if the Emperor or whoever gives it to him so he can be stronger than Lelouch. I'm started to side with /u/Durinthal. I don't want too many people to have Geass.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm started to side with /u/Durinthal . I don't want too many people to have Geass.

Oh I agree but the show seems to insist otherwise. Though It we are going Geass crazy, then Suzaku is the man to get one.
>> ARTICLE
> Though It we are going Geass crazy, then Suzaku is the man to get one.

Yeah, I agree with you there. No one else has been set up to have it except... [crazy theory time](/s "Nunnally. She's had Geass this entire time, and has been faking her blindness. She will open her eyes in order to save Lelouch by destroying Charles, Suzaku, and the rest of Britannia.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm fully on board with that theory. The Nunnally-Geass hype train is about to depart the station.
>> ARTICLE
That theory is actually...kind of awesome. So she is faking her blindness because she can't control her Geass when she opens her eyes?
>> ARTICLE
Truthfully, that theory was 70% joke, 30% legitimate theory. Now both you and /u/Durinthal have said it would be awesome to see. I didn't give it much thought, but yeah, she can't control her Geass when she opens her eyes. Oh man, that'd be sick. Maybe she doesn't even know she can use Geass. Someone will find a way to heal her by the end of the series, and when she finally opens her eyes she'll start uncontrollably mass Geassing everyone. Could be really helpful or it might just screw things up even more.

Or maybe she was some sort of Geass prodigy. They weren't trying to kill Marianne, they were trying to kill Nunnally. After she went blind and crippled they figured there was no way she could use Geass anymore so they just let her go. Now Charles needs more people with Geass to power his super weapon so he's kidnapped Nunnally to use as a sacrifice.

You guys are awesome. Thanks for causing me to think all that, as crazy as it is.

Ummm, on a serious note, have they even said how she went blind in the first place? It's possible I just forgot. Was it just a side effect of the the accident/murder?
>> ARTICLE
> when she finally opens her eyes she'll start uncontrollably mass Geassing everyone. Could be really helpful or it might just screw things up even more.

Given how the series has gone so far, I'm leaning toward the latter.

> Now Charles needs more people with Geass to power his super weapon so he's kidnapped Nunnally to use as a sacrifice.

I like that. I still think CC and VV are somehow bound to him and thus he's making them go out and contract his bloodline to give them the Geass ability. Your theory gives a good reason *why* they're doing it. And the full details of said contracts have never been given either, maybe there's a "used as sacrifice to kill God" clause somewhere in the fine print.

> Ummm, on a serious note, have they even said how she went blind in the first place? It's possible I just forgot. Was it just a side effect of the the accident/murder?

I don't remember an explicit reason given. I don't think it was because of any physical injury but I could be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Sooo, still operating under the theory that Nunnally (and possibly other royal family members) have Geass: So maybe that's why Charles didn't kill Lelouch. He might still need him for a sacrifice. Perhaps he needs blood sacrifices from his lineage, and that's why he has so many children. Of course he might have a buttload of kids because he's the Emperor and can bone anyone he wants. Anyway, maybe his bloodline has a higher tolerance to Geass than most, and if they're powered up first, their sacrifice will be worth more. We still have zero proof that others in the family have Geass, aside from Rolo, if he even is royalty. So I like our thoughts on this, but I'm not 100% on board with it all just yet.

I like how you were thinking of CC and VV as bound to Charles. I'd say maybe CC went rogue, so to speak. Perhaps she no longer agreed with what Charles was doing, and she needed a way to fight back. Lelouch fits that job description well enough.

Ugh. Then why was CC watching Lelouch when he was a kid? Why did Mao get Geass if he wasn't a member of the royal family? Because CC didn't know that his power would be uncontrollable? She just wanted to test out giving Geass to *anybody?*

Good lord. I'm getting way too into this theory. I need to stop. So many questions need to be answered. It's gonna be fun though to look back on all of our speculation.

Anywho, thanks for the back and forth, /u/Durinthal. I think today was one of the slower days overall for the rewatch, but this was probably my favorite discussion so far.
>> ARTICLE
> Why did Mao get Geass if he wasn't a member of the royal family? Because CC didn't know that his power would be uncontrollable? She just wanted to test out giving Geass to anybody?

Hypothesis: Mao *is* another part of the family, albeit disowned much like Lelouch. CC granted him Geass under Charles's order then went rogue after Mao broke down.

And I agree, this was a fantastic day for discussion. So many theories flying around!
>> ARTICLE
> Watch show are you enjoying the most so far this season?

Hibike! Euphonium; I'm a band geek and it's fantastic.

> I'm guessing V.V is his version of C.C?

That would be my guess. I wonder if they're all linked together somehow though.. How did CC know that Nunnally is being taken, and Charles seemed to instantly know that Lelouch lost control of his Geass? CC didn't warn Lelouch about VV though, so she can't sense him directly I guess?

> I do have to wonder if Charles has a bigger plan in mind. It would seem odd to just wipe his memories and call it a done deal.

He has to. He could just kill Lelouch and wipe his hands if he wanted to, he's the damn Emperor. Who would object?

> You can have a geass! You can have a geass! Everybody can have a Geass!

Well, there goes one of my recap lines for tomorrow.

>  Can she have a geass ability with no eyes or could it manifest in other ways, because that would spice up the story a lot more than anything else has, especially if Nunnally finds out the truth about Euphy and turns agianst him. I never realized just how much I want that until now.

so on friday I decided to start season 1, and finished season 2 on saturday night about 29 hours later. Holy shit I was expecting this show to be good but I really didn't think it would be this good.

I'm actually so excited for the episode 25 discussion so I can share all of what I thought about this anime with you all
>> ARTICLE
Suzaku, 100% fuccboi confirmed
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much. What Suzaku did to Lelouch is just a fuckboy move. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm back, and I have nothing witty to say to introduce this, so Lets get started.

Turn 2

* Do I even have to write about the intro? Um It's funny to hear C.C. refer to herself in the third person? Whatever, moving on

* I just realized Babel Tower As in the Tower of Babel. As in the thing the Bible talks about ancient people attempting to build to reach heaven, and were punished by having their languages and eventually cultures split apart. I get it.

* I wonder if these subordinate Knights just have Yes, my lord! recorded and played back at the end of everything debriefing.

* [Still having a grand, ole time with Kallens assets, I see.](http://i.imgur.com/uCXlLsO.jpg)

* [Spinzaku still in full stride.](http://webm.land/media/kX2C.webm)

* And, here we learn that Charles does indeed have a Geass: The ability to erase and rewrite memories. You know, if he can do that to the same person as many times as he wants, as its implied he can, then Lelouch got majorly gipped. Rewriting memories is practically the same thing as forcing your will over others; all you have to do is give them a past where they share your beliefs.

* Suzaku literally just got there, and hes asking for a promotion? No Good day to you, sir. How are you? Do you need anything, what with being *Emperor* and all?

* Still, it seems Charles is cool enough to at least humor him.

* Its interesting to point out here that while Charles has Geass active in both eyes, he is still able to turn it off and on at will. Thats some self-control.

* And, damn. Did Charles seriously spend time Geassing the *entire* student body, teachers included? Even if he was able to like get them all at once by holding a school assembly, thats still a crap-ton of effort on his part. Who says Emperors dont actually do any work?

* This is also the first time I've actually correctly heard his name pronounced: Its Charles *zi* Britannia, not Charles *vi*.

* I freaking love C.C. with the smack-down. Don't blame me for contracting him, bitch; I just saved your ass.

* So, we cant commandeer this Knightmare, can we? I'm not sure if Lelouch is just saying that because he likes to hear himself talk (Which, I mean, who doesn't?) or if he seriously forgot for a few seconds that he can look practically any Knightmare user in the eye and go, This is not the Knightmare you're operating for. Move along.

* Its pretty nice of the Geass to make the person give the QR Code when he just simply asks for a Knightmare. (Yet, its still not smart enough to know when Lelouch actually means to order someone or not. Honestly, you'd think C.C. could have included some emergency off switch when she contracted him. And Mao, for that matter.)

* Aww. I really do like Lelouch and C.C.s playful banter.

* I have to give credit to the Viceroy. He actually takes responsibly of the situation and goes to fight the Black Knights himself, rather than just sending out waves of nameless subordinates. Zapp Brannigan would be disappointed, Im guessing.

* Glad to see Kallens blow-dryer arm got fixed. I have always wondered how none of the residual heat affects her armor.

* I get that Lelouch has the barons log book, but you'd think *some* of the sentinels would have changed location a little bit.

* I never thought I'd ever say this about a high school girls voice in an anime, but Kallen sounds a *touch* too deep for someone her age and look. Then again, the Druish Princess was a bass.

* "I'm honored your Majesty, but why me?" "Because you are a main character, son. Thats really the only reason."

* A weapon for destroying God? Well, why didn't you say so?! You didn't need to overthrow Japan to get power; theres over a million pathetic losers over at /r/atheism that would have gladly assisted you in your goal.

* Kallen does have a point. What did Lelouch honestly gain by just not telling her? Was he trying to protect her or thought she may let something slip? Nah, who am I kidding? He just has a really obsessive flair for the dramatic.

* Notice how Lelouch manages to avoid actually answering the question about whether hes ever used his Geass on her. Of course, for something as small as gaining information about her involvement in the rebellion I doubt she would really care that much.

* About time someone points out how ridiculous Kallens outfit is.

* Yeah, Im now convinced they just have that shit scheduled to play the moment he finishes an order.

* Wow, [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/eEJr2Vt.jpg) really shows off just how tall and lanky Lelouch really is.

* Everythings going according to plan. Someone gonna make the standard Death Note joke, or do I have to?

* This scene is sort of a precursor to what people talk about when they say the fight scenes in R2 are a lot more exaggerated and over-the-top. Lelouch does the standard spiel about how awesome he is, then all of a sudden something insane like a teleporting Knightmare shows up.

* If you consider yourselves disposable, you'll never beat the Britannians. Lelouch is good at talking up his subordinates egos. Reminds me of the antagonist of Psycho-Pass 2: Show care and compassion to your followers, so they willingly sacrifice themselves should the time ever come. This isn't a complaint; I'm just pointing out a similarity I noticed.

* [Got nothing on this one. The cameraman just did what he felt was right.](http://i.imgur.com/nMIUt4a.jpg)

* You never see prototypes in TV and movies ever have any real bugs or glitches that real prototype models would have. For something that new and untested, Im highly surprised how it performed flawlessly in battle.

* Okay, seeing this fight actually makes me wonder, what was the point in building these things? Like, I get its a mecha anime and all, but *in universe* what was the point? Knightmares seem extremely complicated to handle, way more than something like a helicopter or plane, undoubtedly take hundreds if not thousands of man-hours to design and build, and even more money than that to actually get all the materials and people to put them in place, yet we constantly see them just get annihilated in only like three hits. Like, make something that will last longer than a WWI era tank and maybe we'll talk. (And, if Girls und Panzer has taught me anything, its that WWI era tanks are actually a *lot* sturdier than those things.)

* Okay, I admit it. That was a pretty badass way to go out, dramatic speech and all.

* I love how C.C. just doesnt give a shit. Shes like, I'm gonna live no matter what, and have pretty much become numb to pain, so for all I care we could get nuked to hell, and even my clothes won't get damaged.

* [See, dub-haters? Just try to tell me JYB doesnt own that laugh.](http://webm.land/media/10au.webm)

* Cornelia was wise when she picked Guilford as her right-hand man. Hes loyal, wise, and pretty compassionate, actually bothering to thank those below him when he takes charge. I'm not even gonna bother with the Yes, my lord thing again.

* [Diethard is about to fucking cream his pants.](http://webm.land/media/GhCU.webm)

* You ever noticed how unnaturally disjointed Lelouchs [fingers are?](http://i.imgur.com/FiYn2Ul.jpg)

* Vilettas thinking, Should I kill him or just make him flunk out of school?

* Well, Ninas [looking a little peeved.](http://i.imgur.com/0SFr0MC.jpg) At least this time I dont think drawing her gave the animators nightmares. (Heheheh punz)

* [I cant tell if hes Geassed or just trying to start a new fashion trend.](http://i.imgur.com/cLh0R68.jpg)

* A nation consisting of just one room. Excuse me, madam. I would like to direct you to the glorious nation of [Molossia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Molossia).

* Damn, Li Xingke is so badass. Oh, and surprise, surprise Rolo was in the Knightmare.

* And he has Geass.

* On a side note, Rolo in the dub is voiced by Spike Spencer, who you may remember as the dub voice for Shinji in NGE. He just seems to have a knack for voicing really annoying characters, doesn't he?

Whelp, thats Turn 2 finished (or episode 2/27 if you're a pleb). I enjoyed it, as expected, seeing as how I already have seen it and enjoyed it Er, anyway looking forward to Turn 3 and reading your own comments, everyone!

> Its pretty nice of the Geass to make the person give the QR Code when he just simply asks for a Knightmare.

The command is to "hand over your Knighmare".  What constitutes handing it over is up to the person's interpretation, which, if he knows what he's doing, would include anything necessary to operate it.

Still manipulating people. He doesn't tell her that he's already Geassed her so she'll be wary that he'll use it at some point in the future. Or at least that's how I'm interpreting the move.

You should probably spoil tag a lot of this post =P. Even though you didn't directly spoil things, a lot can be implied (correctly) from what you said.

And yeah, I completely agree that Season 2 is the better of the seasons. Season 1 is absolutely fantastic, but Season 2 is just on completely different proportions. Season 2 is just epic, on a completely different scale.

People say Season 1 had better writing than R2, but you have to remember that R2 was continuing a story whereas Season 1 was just establishing it. Season 1 would definitely seem more creative because it's new. R2 wasn't new, it was taking the old central plot and advancing it and maybe adding a couple things. but even then I don't agree that Season 1 had better writing.

Getting darker. I know everyone has been saying things get dark, but I don't think it's been too bad so far aside from Lelouch killing Clovis. But I'm ready for the horror! Bring it!

The thing is that code geass basically censor all the dark shit, think about if they had showed all the dead bodies that have rolled so far, not even clovis death showed gore. Think about how many body of civillians they could've show hahaha

It does lack gore, but there is nothing wrong with that. Arguably the darkest moment of this season still has the potential to made you laugh (if you have a rather twisted sense of humor like myself)

tomorrow is the 14th right? Your schedule said we should be at episode 10 by then, are you sure your schedule is correct?

I delayed the schedule by a day since the first episode was on Easter, and I got a lot of messages saying to move it up a day. That and it was a holiday that everyone should celebrate, even if it doesn't matter to some people.

I'll edit the schedule if you like.

Done. I also added both episodes of Akito the Exiled into the schedule.

Oh yeah, for those of you who don't know, we are doing Akito the Exiled. We can't do the last two episodes because they haven't come out yet, but this is a good way to warm up to the series.

>> ARTICLE
I'm 10 hours late, as usual, but let's see how our major actors did this episode!

**Zero** - "*You're old-timers who can no longer be saved.*" Huge win. He personally dealt a huge blow to the Japanese Liberation Front (JLF), showed up Cornelia, confirmed her weakness, and began his PR campaign. This is where his plan appears to begin to snowball.

**Cornelia** - "*Tsch. Should I expect that of him [Suzaku]?*" Pretty rough day for her. Though she didn't lose anyone she cares about, like her little sister, or any of her personal guard, she was embarrassed by both the terrorist Zero and the non-citizen Special Envoy pilot.

**Suzaku** - "*I couldn't save them... Not again!*" He got to play a hero, so that went well! ...ish... kinda. He did exactly as he was told, excelled at it, and then because of Zero's explosive theatrics everything went wrong. Still, not too bad. Lloyd is happy with him, too.

**Diethard** - "*The responsibility?! I'll accept it all!*" Actually, today was fun for him. Zero lived up to his hopes, so he got to continue his broadcasting of *The Most Interesting Terrorist In The World*. He wasn't even pressured by anyone other than his media boss to stop. Much better than when Jeremiah was pressing him to be super-nationalist.

**Kallen** (and co.) - "*Allies... of justice?*" Drove right through Cornelia's personal guard. Not dead. Definitely a plus. Starting to understand what this Zero guy is all about, though he still doesn't answer straight questions.

**Student Council** - "*Eleven...?!*" - Nobody had a nice time this week. Shirley's Dad made an appearance, briefly. Nina got herself into serious danger because of her uncontrollable anxiety/ptsd, Shirley and Milly couldn't save her, and Rivalz only got to watch as his friends were hostages on TV. Nunally is in the same boat ^(minus the watching part, of course >_>). Nina got saved by a real-life princess, so don't expect her hyper-jingoistic traits to get any better... *P.S.: I didn't get to say it, but a few episodes ago, Nina said "*It split!*" I wonder what that's about...*

**Euphemia** - "*Take me to your leader!*" Distressing day, but she's unharmed, apparently. Got out of the economic conference hell. Saved some poor girls. Met the enigmatic terrorist leader who knew heaps about her somehow. So far, managed to not get shot by him, though he seemed keen at the time. Probably left alive to be used against Cornelia.

**Lloyd & Cecile** - "*I made a request but since our command structure is different we're treated as irregulars.*" - Well, that didn't last long. The second the goings get tough, they let the eccentric guy's pet science project and his immigrant pilot get right in there. Worked pretty well. The new VARIS rifle worked perfectly, Lancelot exceeded expectations once again, and it wasn't even damaged this week! Lloyd's pretty happy.

**Todo** - "*...*" Fuck. That could have gone better. His ally died, accomplishing nothing in the process. His resistance movement suffered a serious setback, and now there's a competing insurgency that's going to siphon off support and volunteers from the JLF. Not a good day.

**C.C.** - "*It'll go well this time. But I'm not a guardian.*" She seems satisfied, despite not being anywhere near the action. Still no clue who or what she's talking to.

I also -really- like the foreshadowing of next episode in the first 30 seconds this week. Not only did we get to see an Eleven ghetto, and the rough shape people are in following not just Shinjuku but also Saitama, but now we're starting to see the drug problem coming out.
>> ARTICLE
=_= so tired

**Episode 8**

* "We won't leave you alone" - they are going to be split apart.
* Lelouch has got some major #swag going on with that pose there
* Oh look those student council members happened to be taken hostage at the lake that was super secure, *who would've seen that that one coming...*
* At least this episode is dedicated to seeing anti-Britannia extremists die
* Didn't realise you could modify a city into a cannon
* Oooh, Antichrist-kun is back
* Knights of justice? You really did earn the 'light' part of Griffbat Zor**light** West
* I bet Lelouch will show up just as they are about to kill a member of the student council/brain dead girl
* I don't even think his head is [attached to his neck here](http://i.imgur.com/d6hGzfG.png). You keep me away from Lelouch.
* Yes..elevens...that is what you filthy cretins are!
* "You people are obsolete, there is no saving you" YES, YOU TELL 'EM!
* Knightmare shots can't melt steel beams
* Those hairstyles would be super recognizable to anyone at the school even with the masks
* Ends with Lelouch being fabulous

I want to see more of the cape action he has got going on in the future! That or pro-Britannia story lines will be satisfactory. Getting quite close to the two episodes a day switch. I shall curl up and cry when the time comes.

> Kid Lulu: *YOU AREN'T MY DAD ANYMORE!*

> Cornelia: It's worthwhile to sacrifice a few pawns in order to gain access to the king, don't you think?

Well, [those are different looks.](http://i.imgur.com/ya52ovg.png) Oooh, looks like Nina might have been assaulted before. Kinda explains the racism, but still. Aaaand now they're hostages.

Finally an explanation of what resources Japan has and why it was invaded.

Zero has a pretty swanky pad at least. You'd think Lelouch would have gotten a second cell phone by now, or at least turned it off while he's in costume. Can't wait until Kallen tries calling Lelouch and Zero's phone rings next to her.

With Euphemia among the hostages, I'm not sure everyone's getting out alive. As far as characters go she's kinda expendable *and* her death could push Suzaku over the edge one way or another.

Is Shirley's father famous? I don't remember what her family name was. Maybe just showing up as a relative of a hostage on the news, I dunno.

Really Zero, just driving into the middle of the army? Any reasonable commander would have shot him before he even got close. Aww, young Euphemia and Cornelia are cute. I guess that's the bargaining chip in his favor to prevent instant death.

Cecile and Lloyd! I like them. And looks like they didn't get rid of Lancelot after all. Though why a mech needs to take a three-point stance before launching is beyond me.

Uh.. Zero just revealed that he's familiar with Euphemia, who's mostly been out of the public eye before now. She'll have to die before she figures everything out. Or would she not reveal Lelouch? I could see her keeping a secret like that and it would make for a fun turn against Suzaku and Cornelia. That's what I want to happen now.

That was a lot of explosions. Zero really does love the camera. Somehow all the hostages are safe though, including Euphemia. [Kallen, at least try a different hairstyle.](http://i.imgur.com/0mXChxW.png)

Order of the Black Knights? Yep, sounds like something a 17-year old would invent. I'm amused that the media guy is all on board with a full broadcast, anything that makes for good ratings right?

You'd think that before long the other members of the student council (or maybe even Nunnally) would notice that Lelouch is missing and conveniently unreachable whenever Zero's making a public appearance.

[Wild speculation round 6](/s "By chance Euphemia is held hostage on several more occasions, each one leading to a cat-and-mouse game between Zero, Cornelia, and Suzaku. Euphemia comes to admire Zero and joins the Order of the Black Knights to be closer to him, eventually taking over as a tactical second-in-command. Suzaku is mildly depressed by that until Shirley comforts him and they start dating.")
>> ARTICLE
some day... some day you'll be right
>> ARTICLE
About the "Order of the Black knights", you got to remember this is a setting where an absolutist imperial monarchy is a modern superpower, with princes and knights and everything. 

>The trope name comes from the black knights of feudal Europe, men who would paint their armor and shields black for a number of reasons. One reason to do this was because they had no liege, making them analogous to Ronin Samurai. 
> A more sinister motive for the paint was to disguise who it was they served. A knight could move freely and serve his lord's wishes without bringing him blame by painting over his coat of arms, one of the few ways to reliably identify a man in full platemail.

Also a chess reference. I get it, but it doesn't make it sound any less silly to me in a modern context.

Did anyone else see Lelouch not killing Euphemia? I thought it was kind of obvious

The idea is the sow fear in the Royalty, that he is cominv for them. At least, I think. After all, it makes no sense to kill her now, she is the only hostage that matters to the Viceroy

If only for that split second when he pulled out the gun. Who the hell knows with Lelouch? Euphemia seems like a good egg though.

As much as I also dislike that girl for not being aware of her own biases, I can't really blame her for growing up in a sheltered, prejudiced society, then being (impliedly) abused or harmed by an indigenous non-Brittanian, and thus having a kind of PTSD/anxiety episode whenever she's put into conflict with a non-Brittanian.

tl;dr that girl needs therapy.

&gt; From rascorpia:

--------------------------------------

So I'm currently using the powers a random green haired girl gave me to command a poor unfortunate soul to post this for me.

It's my birthday so I'm out with friends instead of lurking on /r/anime. Regardless I thought I would do the good thing and do the write up before I went out, so here you go.

**Episode 6**

* Episode title "The stolen mask", does that mean we get Dio? 
* "And your name...do I still call you Lelouch?" Nope. It's Griffbat Zorlight West (Subject to change)
* Oh man this episode is even better for my ego
* She can tell who he is just by his hands? Mad skillz yo
* [Sit yo' ass down bitch](http://i.imgur.com/aQz2Tgh.png)
* Crowd Control really does put a lot of effort into being creepy
* HAHAHAHA Pizza hut delivery. This show is so unbelievably shameless it's beautiful 
* Oh shit it is the asshole cat
* And now he is knocking import stuff over, to be expected from asshole cat
* LeLouch must have the smallest head on the planet if the helmet can fit perfectly on a cats head
* Britannia aren't even the main enemy of the series. It's the cat.
* Nunnally knew what the cat took, she does wanted to fuck shit up for him
* I feel like this is the episode I will look back on fondly when the show starts getting real dark
* Now she can tell the cat had an injury?!? Nunnally could take over the world if only petty mortals didn't bore her
* How dare they let a filthy eleven on the student council
* "All men are not created equal! Some have shit taste in best guy, others do not!" ... " We alone move forward and so it is, even with the shit taste of /r/anime, Basque Grand continues on as best guy!" 
* ALL HAIL BRITANNIA

I'm in a rush so not going to comment much on this episode. Fairly straightforward anyway. 

See you tomorrow eleven scum!

Let us take a moment to appreciate the great Norio Wakamoto, Ham Extraordinaire and the Japanese voice of Charles vi Britannia. When he found out about  a [fancomic changing the Emperor's speech to be about the ineqality between breasts,](http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/225262) he proceeded to make a recording for it.

That did not come out right.
>> ARTICLE
Hey! I'm still pretty new to anime so this is my first time watching Code Geass. I figure writing up some notes and joining in on the discussion will help me enjoy the show more so here goes.

**Thoughts / Predictions**

- Since Zero was the cause of his demotion, I don't think Jeremiah will be willing to help Zero at first. Possibly later on. Either way, Jeremiah's not going to be with the military for the entirety of R1. Maybe he and Villetta will end up helping the scientist and Suzaku.
- Thankfully this Pizza Hut sighting was obvious. Or maybe I just haven't been observant enough to spot the others.
- Milly thinks the cat ran off with an embarrassing photo of Lelouch at the Christmas party!
- A lot of time is spent on this cat. Either this is a filler-ish type episode or someone is already going to find out Lelouch is Zero. Maybe Kallen, and Lelouch won't be able to use his Geass to erase her memory.
- Lucky Lelouch. The entire school chases after the cat with your helmet, and no one finds out the truth.

This may have just passed right over my head, but have they stated yet if Lelouch is 100% Britannian or is he part Japanese? This would definitely help shape predictions as to how and why Lelouch wants to destroy Britannia.
>> ARTICLE
He's full-blooded Britanian.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks. I'd have to guess then that Lelouch's family (possibly just his father) did something quite horrible for him to want to destroy the *entire* empire. Maybe they had something to do with his mother's death and his sisters blindness. Gonna be fun to find out.
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could be in your shoes, experiencing it for the first time again :/

Also, yeah 6 is pretty much filler. There's a few episodes that seem like SoL school filler. 

Not sure if you're aware either but pizza hut is everywhere in CG. I think they even had an [](/s "offer to collect coupons to exchange for the plush that C.C hugs all the time. Spoiler tagged because i'm not sure if it's been shown yet")
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely excited. I've only been watching anime for about three months, but I've heard about Code Geass before that. First time doing a viewing with a group of people too.

Everyone had been talking about Pizza Hut in the previous episodes, but I just hadn't seen it. I guess it'll be featured more throughout the rest of the series too. Pretty funny stuff.

> Euphie: Farewell cruel wor--hello there handsome.

> Lelouch: *How do I get a girl to not turn around? Better make out with her.*

> Oprah: **You** get a princess and **you** get a princess and **everybody gets a princess!**

---
The emperor has a plan? Wonder what that involves.

Of course all the students are suspicious, but I really wasn't expecting Nina to be the racist one. So Lelouch somehow saved Suzaku when Britannia first invaded? Hm... I remember the two of them from the opening of the first episode but don't think anything along those lines happened then.

Euphemia's responsible for Suzaku going to the school, no surprise there. I expect the two of them to get closer in the future. Clovis painted [Lelouch, Nunnally, and their (not his) mom?](http://i.imgur.com/7Gg6ueX.png) I guess they must have been close at one point in time.

Sounds like Suzaku's going to be spending a lot more time with the ~~scientists~~ technologists and Jeremiah's going rogue after his demotion. Shakeups in the military!

[That damn cat.](http://i.imgur.com/f6SUdC8.png) And then Milly's announcement turns the entire thing into a ridiculous spectacle. [I like](http://i.imgur.com/4c7NwwB.png) [this girl.](http://i.imgur.com/Wg5ismD.png)

Aww, the the military threw out Lancelot. I guess that means the technologists just need to invent an even more overpowered weapon to top it.

I know Shirley would pick Lelouch for a kiss if she found the cat, but who would Rivalz choose? Or Milly? Kallen's too shy to pick Lulu, I'm guessing.

Nice callback to the opening of the first episode with Suzaku once again hauling Lelouch up. Time for most of the student council [^(damn it, Nina)](http://i.imgur.com/UNxVB1d.png) to accept Suzaku and, just as I expected, he joins them. Good way to bypass the reward with Nunnally.

So Britannia's still at odds with the EU and China, but I don't currently think we'll see much of them getting involved as far as the show goes. Unless...

[Wild speculation round 4](/s "The Chinese Union invades Japan to take control from Britannia. Zero joins them with the rebels and they take down Cornelia, but not before Kallen falls in battle. Lelouch is mildly depressed by this until Shirley comforts him and they start dating.")

- Even though I'm watching this daily, I keep forgetting about that anime hair.

- Aww, I feel kind of bad for Suzaku and everyone treating him poorly at school.

- at Clovis' funeral: "THIS IS MY VILLAIN SPEECH!"

The Pizza Hut product placement was finally so blatant in this episode that I realized why I'd never seen it before: *Everyone else is watching the sub.*

I watched the train scene in episode 4 three times to look for the Pizza Hut ads that everyone was talking about. I stared at the walls, I stared at the city, but nowhere did I see any Pizza Huts. And now, with this [blatantly blank cardboard box](http://i.imgur.com/b3fYwEU.png), I finally have my answer: Censorship!

I didn't really enjoy the cat chase scene, but this revelation totally made up for that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the dub, and there's Pizza Hut aplenty.  But I also remember there being no Pizza Hut when I watched it on Adult Swim years ago.
>> ARTICLE
Less censorship and more Pizza hut didn't pony up for the English release.
>> ARTICLE
Certainly! Still, there must have been *extra* expense involved in scrubbing all the logos from the show, which I find pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously suspected that this cat was some sort of a spy. Especially since I finished Darker than Black S1 earlier and there was a talking cat. Don't trust felines! 

Luckily this one just wanted to cosplay as Zero for a while. And C.C. could easily prevent this from happening, but she was too busy eating pizza (She did nuffin wrong!).

I'd think that catching a cat with a huge helmet on its head would be pretty easy, Lelouch must be pretty out of shape. Regardless he seems pretty popular with the ladies of his school, pls no harem.

Did I get it right - Lelouch started slipping from the roof intentionally so Suzaku wouldn't see Zero's helmet?

>> ARTICLE
You should check out Madoka Magica given your liking of cats. Go into it knowing nothing for the best experience, have faith in /r/anime's praise of it.
>> ARTICLE
considering watching the OVA and season 2? It really isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I'd also suggest the second manga, they have some badass characters
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching OVA 100% since it shows what happens with Yin & Hei after S1 and it's only 4 episodes.

From what I hear second season isn't really bad, just completely different from S1. I'll at least give it a try for a couple of episodes.

>> ARTICLE
While I think a common reaction to these school-centric episodes is eye-rolling and scorn, I *do* think the "school hi-jinx" episodes do serve some important purposes that are sometimes missed:

* The relative innocence of the Ashford Academy students and particularly his student council friends is something that's important and symbolic to Lelouch.  It's one of the big things that he is fighting to protect, along with his sister.  Establishing Lelouch's relationship with them is pretty important.

* But the other side of that coin is the navety of the Ashford Academy students, the fact that the world is going to pieces around them and the massive racism that's normally going on and they're mostly concerned with teenage romance and having things like cat festivals.  (Oh wait, that hasn't happened yet...is that a spoiler, should I mark that? :P)  That's something that I think is generally representative of Brittania in general (uhh, the navety, I mean, not the cat festivals thing), and it's an important setting detail.

The mixing of these two things - the fact that the same characters represent both the good things in the world that Lelouch wants to protect, and also peoples ability to nave look past tragedy - is something I really appreciate about the show.  It would have been really easy to demonstrate the second in a way that further demonized the Brittanians; but instead the show picks sympathetic characters (and also Rivalz), which I respect.

So yeah.  It's a bit jarring to go from "it's a show about terrorism!" to "let's chase a cat around to get a kiss from a student council member!"... but then I think that's part of the point.
>> ARTICLE
This was a more light-hearted episode. To think that Lelouch could have been exposed by a silly cat...
>> ARTICLE
Somehow even this episode managed to be entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
I think this is my least favorite episode because it's kind of filler, with the whole cat chase thing.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, it has the redemption of Suzaku and his acceptance in the school in it. It also gives some important character interaction for a lot of the side characters.

Remember, you can't have epic battles without knowing the characters and the situation!
>> ARTICLE
In this episode: The plot takes a much needed break.
>> ARTICLE
Not the biggest fan of the cat part, but the show is not full serious so there it is. Not that much action in this episode, just slowing down and setting the moment, can't wait for the next ones :)

This is one of the episodes I watch halfway through and then just skip to the end.

> Euphemia: Kiss my royal ass, racists.

> Kallen: Ooh yes, I get to be Zero's bitch. Does it involve ropes? I'm okay with ropes.

> Diethard: You're giving me such a history-boner right now.

> Zero: *Fine* I guess since my life is on the line I'll use the Geass on Suzaku. Not like I couldn't have done this dozens of times by now.

---
Well Suzaku's still alive at least. And he doesn't remember what happened, so that means Geass. On the other hand, what happened to Zero to forget as well?

Oooh Kallen's... about to stab Suzaku. Unfortunately not a good move. Damn it, Suzaku. I'll take a moment to appreciate that they animate nudity and don't rely on weird angles or the like to try to conceal it whenever someone's naked.

...and Zero with Euphemia. She figured it out! Good for her. Unfortunately that greatly decreases her chance of survival now. And the two pairs know each other's secrets.

Huh, Schneizel's quite the gentleman. So it kinda sounds like the Hadron Cannon teleported a chunk of the island or at least the people elsewhere. Maybe they just got blown clear of the island, I dunno.

Cornelia's been investigating Marianne's assassination.. sounds like she might be sympathetic to Lelouch at some point. While the siblings are getting along fine, I'm sure Kallen will stab Suzaku first chance she gets.

Mmm Diethard with the hard stance. I like his attitude. Who the hell is CC talking to in the hallway? Who's just pretending to be an observer? Is she talking to Diethard about that? Does he have some connection to Kallen that I'm not aware of?

[I](http://i.imgur.com/p6kLJBj.png) [love](http://i.imgur.com/7xLddHY.png) [Kallen's](http://i.imgur.com/AQj0He7.png) [expressions](http://i.imgur.com/PXNmv1x.png) and I really wish the two of them would get along.

Clovis was working on something? There's the "Thought Elevator" thing again. This isn't related to CC is it? Oh hey, [it's a magic circuit](http://i.imgur.com/mSvcZCs.png) - CC's a servant! Wait, no, she's a magus and Lelouch and Mao are servants. *It all makes sense now.* And [there's](http://i.imgur.com/zJ72tFk.png) the [symbol.](http://i.imgur.com/Sf33bTH.png) "Gawain's Druid System?" And a new mech it looks like.

And right back into the Zero persona. Gotta keep up appearances I guess. "Hostage exchange" up until Kallen gets loose then it's a scramble.

[Well that](http://i.imgur.com/PE6swJB.png) [changes things.](http://i.imgur.com/gQU5QUt.png) And [who's this?](http://i.imgur.com/gL47Srd.png) Quick guess: first princess who also has Geass was doing a lot of research into it. She has some connection to that artifact so she knows it was activated. What the hell just happened to Suzaku? And Gawain's the new mech, got it. Handy escape method, that.

"Live!" Well, I was close. Unfortunately that is *definitely* not the right command to give to him. Still causes trouble for Suzaku, though looks like Schneizel will get him out of it anyway.

---
Old Japanese faction supported by the Chinese Federation, eh? More trouble for Britannia. Tomoro? Wonder what that's about.

Heh, Lloyd helping Nina. Shirley knows... again. Nice job *getting nothing accomplished aside from ruining a girl's life* Lelouch.

So Suzaku rejecting Euphemia is worse for her than if he just kept going forward as her knight. Her direction's very much up in the air right now.

Zero wants an independent country? Diethard's turned on. And Nina gets to meet her princess!

Well I guess they did everything they could on the ground, time for flying mechs everywhere. And now everyone knows it's Suzaku piloting it!

Aww Euphemia. Too bad neither she nor Nina are getting a happy ending. I... what? Well it was apparent that Euphemia was in love with Suzaku but I didn't expect her to command him like that. And that's going to cause trouble for Nina, I'm sure.

So Suzaku's sacrificing himself... yeah, the Geass doesn't like that (dammit, Zero). Also Earl Pudding. Her nickname for Lloyd rather than his real name, I hope.

I like the music that starts when Zero hands over the energy filler to Suzaku. That's an interesting change in direction but good PR, as Diethard pointed out.

I forgot that Kallen's cover has been blown, that's terrible for her. Best girl needs a place to chill.

So just as quickly as the Chinese invasion began, it's over with. The Black Knights have a clear goal and they even collaborated with Britannia. Things are going well, which means...

[Wild speculation round 13](/s "Euphemia falls ill with Female Anime Protagonist Syndrome and dies. Cornelia and Schneizel blame it on Zero to turn the country against him. Nina goes psycho and stabs Suzaku out of a jealous rage, but the Geass is strong enough to stop him from dying even after his heart stops beating and he kills her in self-defense. Lloyd is mildly depressed by that until Milly comforts him and they get married.")

R.I.P /u/angel10701

Good evening fellow Britannians (and slaves of Britannians), I'm back again and as tired as usual. Such is the life of being royalty. For some unbenownst reason I have ran out of Kuroko's basketball episodes to watch (must be produced by lazy elevens) so I've now substituted that with real basketball. 

I am sorely disapointed that my eyes do not glow when I play. My whole life has been a lie up until now.

**Episode 19**

* Niether Lelouch nor Suzaku have their memoires? I smell a Geass effect
* Needs more fanservice
* Get her a towel fool
* I love how that scene was set up. **Lelouch:** I must use landmarks to identify where I am and establish a line of communication. **Suzaku:** I must await Britannian reinforcements, so I'll go find a steady source of water and food in case I'm in it for the long haul. **Kallen:** Where the fuck am I? Guess now would be a good time to take off my clothes and have a shower
* Lelouch :D You've killed so many people :D It's good to see you again :D
* Britannians know how to make people swoon
* The general is rocking that monocle as well
* Lelouch I've missed you! Let me take off my dress and sit in the nude! 
* This episode is trying so hard to invent reasons for having the characters strip
* Suzuka doesn't need a spear or net to catch fish, he's a real man
* Could this be? Keanu Reeves is wanting to be rid of Lelouch? Will someone finally kill the bastard?
* Of course creepy green haired girl hears voices in her head
* I wonder if the princess has actually realized the implication of Lelouch being Zero, she seems way too relaxed about this
* Genbu Kururugi isn't the last samurai, Keanu Reeves is, do you even watch these films kallen? 
* Too busy pushing for an unjust rebellion against beloved Britannia
* Suzaku don't go talking all evil like that. Remember, Britannians are the good guys, so act like one
* Okay so we know how they got out the pit of death. Who took them through it though?
* Some weird runes and such that are undoubtably related to crowd control and her creepy semi-human race
* Why did she choose him? Because she has thing for god-like human beings that put hurculeas to shame
* Most poorly guarded mech of the series
* I'm actually quite impressed that all the royal family know each other. I mean there is like 10,000 of them so it is a noteworthy acomplishment
* "Live" seems a waste of a command seal to me but hey, it worked, somehow...

**Episode 20** 

* Damn chinese!
* 50 Hairstyles of princess-brain-dead
* Viceroy Cornerllia to the rescue. Let the hype commence.
* This new prince we are seeing is actually the one with the most common sense so far
* He also gets that Euphy should not be in charge of **anything**
* I could do with a Pizza right now. Anyone know of a good company?
* COME ON SHIRLEY. THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. REVEAL LELOUCH SO HE CAN DIE ALREADY.
* You are a burden, thank god you finally realize that
* *Uh oh.* Yuri girl is here to change Euphy's perception of herself...oh, her sexuality too
* "That girl is a friend of mine" Oh you've gone and done it now! Table-kun is going to need restoring after Yuri girl has got over you saying that
* You think petty mortal weapons can topple the technology of the great & mighty Britannia?!?
* Insolent fools. Prepare to meet your end.
* "I'm glad I met you Nina" Well it won't even be worth repairing Table-kun now, just get a new one or...ten?
* Good thing Nina wasn't in the room to hear what you just said then
* Um..err..lady, he is kind of in the middle of a life and death situation so maybe this could wait
* And that mech they stole happens to be the most powerful one yet
* Where's my man Gendo? He can teach them how to make a real mech
* I think we've all learned a valuable lesson today. The world would be a better place if everyone was just a Britannian

Just five more episodes before Lelouch dies right? Can't wait. Bonus points if Yuri girl kills Suzaku out of jealous rage. Triple points if a Shirley/Viceroy wombo combo is what kills Lelouch.

If there is any spelling mistakes that bother you just point them out. I'm too lazy at the minute to read it all over.

That "Live" command actually turns out to be a pretty smart move on Lelouch's part.

This episode also helps solidify Schniezel as the true gent'leman he is.

And, keeping spoilers to a minimum, I think you're going to enjoy tomorrow's episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Either way it's hard to call it "smart"; it's not something he makes with any long term planning in mind, it's a split-second decision he makes, not a strategic choice; so I wouldn't really credit it as "smart" if it happens to work out in his favor.

That being said [MASSIVE SPOILER](/s "given that that command eventually causes the FLEIJA-ing of Tokyo and 35 mill causalities... no, I'm really not going to say that this works out in Lelouch's favor").
>> ARTICLE
Eh, they were hamming up their lines anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to point out how important "You will live!" is, to Lelouch its the ultimate gift he could give Suzaku. He never wanted to use Geass on his friends, but here he used it to save his life as opposed to something selfish like "Follow my orders"
>> ARTICLE
Though, he could have done "follow my orders" and then ordered him to live
>> ARTICLE
That would be bending his friend's will, and he doesn't want to do that. Honestly he knows he could easily take over the world or do anything if Suzaku was under his control, but free will is one of Lelouch's big things even though his Geass curse is the exact opposite (which is for a reason).

>> ARTICLE
But it's *fuuuuun...*

Yeah, I get what you mean. I'm part to blame for that as well, but I don't know a definite way to fix this problem. It is ruining the surprise, yes, but, at the same time it isn't full out spoiling the show.

If you have any recommendations as to how to handle this situation, just PM me and I'll try to see if there is any way for me to do with this problem.

[Re: Though...](/s "You know; this might undercut my previous message... but it *would* be fun to mess with the first time viewers: pick some completely pointless school episode and get a bunch of the people posting here to make a bunch of references to the next episode like there's a huge twist coming up")
>> ARTICLE
Nothing we could come up with would ever match katanagatari episode 4 though..
>> ARTICLE
As predicted, Lelouch keeps making decisions hell regret.

**Episode 19:**

* Im stunned that all four of them managed to wash ashore after an explosion and *not* get amnesia. I guess having so many other characters have amnesia gave the writers the strength to resist that trope.
* So it seems like the Britannians are collecting sephiroths now. This show is taking an unexpected turn toward the magical. Despite the main character having magic. ... Really, why was I surprised by that?
* Aww. I was thinking Live! was such a great order... until I heard what Suzaku said over the radio afterwards. Oops.

**Episode 20:**

* Oh, so theres a tempest getting in the way of your battle plans, Britannia? Maybe even some winds? Some [*divine* winds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_\(typhoon\)), perhaps?
* Euphemia, you really dont get the idea of being a *puppet* sub-viceroy, do you?
* Shirleys letter *stated that he was Zero?* Are the only ones who dont know his identity at this point his allies?! I dont even want to get into how foolish it is that Lelouch erased all memories of himself but not of his sister
* Aww, Euphemia finally found someone she could exert authority over! Good for her! Hurray for random guards!
* Thats a very nice parallel with Euphemias command to Love! as compared to Zeros to Live! Suzaku has a good thing going. Unfortunately, it seems like Euphemia must be a bit of a creeper to know of Suzakus issues with Arthur the cat.
* I love Lelouchs new mech. The color scheme is brilliant. If he wanted something that screams that it's him, he absolutely got it.

Next time on Code Geass, Lelouch continues attacking random people based on unreasonable standards that only he understands.

I knew Euphemia knew. Really warms the heart to see that not all of Lelouchs familial relationships were bad.

[We finally see some alien stuff.](http://www.gfycat.com/GrouchyEnragedAmericancreamdraft) And they're invading countries to get the artifacts. Is CC actually behind all of this, just using everyone? If not, what the hell is the Emperor going to do with whatever power he obtains from the artifacts?

[Ground breaking.](http://www.gfycat.com/GlossyCleverFinnishspitz) Was it responding to Lelouchs Geass or was that mysterious person remote controlling it? Hmmm, interesting moment. [And what did Suzaku see?](http://www.gfycat.com/FrankShortAnchovy)

Such a simple order from Zero that will now probably kick into effect whenever Suzakus about to die. Is that going to allow him to perform ridiculous feats in order to live?

Oh boy. Ninas going to die of happiness. Euphemia called her a personal friend and is sitting with her by the fire. [Nina needs her goodness.](http://www.gfycat.com/EvergreenDismalCoati)

Nina... Im so sorry.

Good music when [Lelouch saves Suzaku.](http://www.gfycat.com/DeafeningColorlessCobra) Why did CC need to be with him though?

Euphemia will likely try and help out Lelouch and Nunally. She might do it by trying to help Zero at times, and Suzaku will be dragged into it. Hell be conflicted, but Euphemia will convince him.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't mind making em. It's easy and fun.

I just made my own... for tomorrow's post.

As far as the alien stuff goes, I'm actually somewhat disappointed that they're throwing that onto the pile of plotlines. The show could be a good political rebellion drama (with the Geass as a tool and nothing more) or mysterious alien power drama (leaving out the rebellion), but I see it stumbling when trying to cover both.

So far we've only seen CC, Lelouch, and Mao on the alien power side of things. Unless the assassination of Lelouch's mother (his primary motivation) somehow ties into itand I'm not counting that out yetthey're basically two separate stories thrown together if continuing down that route.
>> ARTICLE
I just learned how simple it was to do so I had to make a few for the show.

I won't be surprised if by the end of R2 it turns out the alien storyline was the main focus all along. They're just taking they're time getting there. It may all come crashing down in the next few episodes, and we'll have way too much info to sift through.

The fact that everyone loves this show though, and that it's rated so highly gives me hope that combining the rebellion and Geass stuff will end up working out in the end.

**EPISODE 19**

Charles doesnt care.

Nina. Oh god, Nina. What did you think would happen? You cant make something like that and not know what it would do.

Lelouch has lost it, and it fucking scares me.

Those 4 in the OP all flash in colors like Anyas rainbow attacks. Lelouch at the end too.

Seriously. Tears in my eyes watching Lelouch ordering his people to search for Nunnally.

Cant believe Lelouch yelling at Rolo like that when he know what hes capable of.

Lloyd is a sociopath, and Nina is taking the blame for the FLEIJA detonation.

Suzaku is going to lose his mind. I thought thered be more to that exchange between him and Jeremiah.

Schneizel! Calls Zero a liar and outs him. Important to notice is that Lelouch was the man Schneizel loved and feared more than any other. He goes on to tell them about Geass. Oghis in on this too. This is bad.

[CC with that brush](http://i.imgur.com/wbCVAyB.jpg) is pretty funny even if she looks a little weird.

Diethard stays loyal. Smart. Doesnt matter who he is, look whats hes done.

See, this is why you tell the truth. Cornelia needed to know. Suzaku needed to know.

Lol Kallens jealous. Shes pretty much Lelouchs last ally. And theyre walking towards a mutiny. Respect for not dragging Kallen into the mix.

Holy shit. Rolos still helping Lelouch. Lelouch is done. He wants to die. Looks like Rolo probably will die. He turned out to be a little shit, but this scene is heartbreaking, and the music isnt making it any easier. Even if Lelouch lied, he was the only family Rolo ever had. What a show of power this is as well.

Lelouch is a liar. Haha. Everybody knows that now.

Suzaku has lost it.

Nice. Lelouch admits hes done wrong. All he can do now is drag his father to hell with him.

**EPISODE 20**

Suzaku and Nina. Two of the worst.

Ok, so the artifacts will connect to each other, but they were a backup plan?

*Who* is ready to begin, Anya? Ugh is it Marianne?

OMG is it?

Whats going on?

[YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/W2Y2O.gif)

This might be an illusion in Cs World, but shes controlling Anya. CCs back though!

Seems like Lelouch is gonna wing it. Wonder if he has a plan to take down Charles. And what the hell is Charles actually doing? Were the artifacts not a backup plan? Or they are a backup, and Charles is just choosing to move forward now.

Poor Kaguya. Good to see Xingkes still alive.

There is the perfect Geass order. Obey me. Forever in his service.

Kanon, cmon with the lies. There we go, Suzaku. Tell the truth. Sassy Lloyd. No? You?

Charles is a liar. Lelouch is too, a liar. Schneizels making moves.

Suzaku is Lelouch now. What matters is results.

Schneizels power grab is a good idea, but its not a good way to become the Emperor. Suzaku doesnt know Charles is immortal. Why would he try to kill him knowing what hes capable of anyway? At least hes fighting for Lelouch/Nunnally. [Waldstein still has Geass in his blocked eye.](http://i.imgur.com/fnptiZC.jpg) Wonder what it is.

Nice entrance, Lelouch. Again, great idea to pre-Geass people.

Marianne. Youre here. Youre finally here, but I still want to know more. CC taking Cheese-kun with her to the final showdown, of course.

Oh wow, Lelouch. This is a best guy move. [Such a wonderful expression.](http://i.imgur.com/RntU1B9.jpg)

**POST EPISODE(S) THOUGHTS**

I am standing right on the line. I want to watch more. There are only five episodes left. I could be done with the series in the next two and half hours. Yet I must wait. Tomorrows gonna be tough, but I wont cross over the line. Oh god though. For episode 25, yikes. I dont know that Ill be able to wait on just one episode. The *final* episode. Well see.

[Marianne](http://i.imgur.com/ji25qxd.jpg) has finally arrived! I still dont know if shes actually dead or not. It seems like she might be, but the Geass power that CC gave her allows her to somehow control others even if shes not there. She also said CC was closing her self up in Cs World again. *Again.* Did this memory wipe thing happen before or does CC just go there from time to time to get away from it all?

Marianne has something planned as well, and she wants to know if CC will still help her. Im gonna guess this plan has something to do with Charles. Marianne also said CC sealed off her own Code. So did Charles not actually do anything? CC did this to herself. She can just turn off her own immortality? Then why was she trying so hard to find someone to kill her? Maybe if she does it herself she is forever trapped in Cs World even if her memory wiped body is killed in the real world. So to be truly free someone has to kill her while her Code is active.

It looks like Marianne and CC are going to be meeting up with Lelouch and Charles somehow. This is where well finally learn all about the connection between CC, Marianne, and Charles. VV too, I guess. Well also learn about how Marianne did or didnt die.

[thoughts on the future](/s "Charles goes ahead with killing god even if hes trapped in that other dimension. Doing so causes everyone who has Geass to lose it because god was the original source of Geass. The outside world changes in some crazy way. Perhaps some of that alien stuff, if it even exists, will finally come into play. Charles talked about ending the current world and starting a new one. So maybe the alien powers take over in order to change the world. After all, theres that weird shot in the OP of Todo flying towards some crazy structure with a huge battle going on around him.")

I dont know. Its equally frustrating and exciting that theres still, *still,* so much to learn.

Oh god, tomorrow is going to be a comment fest for the ages. The next two episodes are by far my favourites barring Episode 25.
>> ARTICLE
Not calling you out or anything, but your comment is sort of spoiler teasing. We've been through this before, but no worries. At this point amazing things are going to happen every episode since we're so close to the end. Now I'm just excited to get to tomorrow's episodes. And then I'm going to hate myself for having to wait to watch the final three.
>> ARTICLE
Uhhh...Oops?
>> ARTICLE
No, no. Don't worry about it. Like I said. We are now expecting major things to happen with only five episodes left.

I feel a little like an ass for even bringing it up anymore. Just as an example though, back before the "Bloodstained Euphy" episode everyone got all hyped up saying they were looking forward to the comments. Well that kind of gives it away that something big is going to happen so it sort of spoils the surprise.

Again though, these last five episodes are going to be so packed with information and what not, how the hell could I not think everyone would look forward to them?

So, eh, my bad as well for even mentioning it. No worries.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree a bit that Nina would have known what she was doing, because it is clear now that she actually wasn't all that aware of her actions due to her extreme phobia of the Elevens. She may be technically a genius, but she has been severely compromised by whatever trauma she had by dealing with Elevens in her past. And it looks like she's finally waking up to the reality of the weapons she created.

I guess this is her "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." Oppenheimer moment.
>> ARTICLE
> Nina. Oh god, Nina. What did you think would happen? You cant make something like that and not know what it would do.

Military targets vs. civilian targets. There's a change in perspective depending on which you're aiming at. That said, don't make a weapon if you can't anticipate or handle it being used in the worst imaginable way.

> There is the perfect Geass order. Obey me. Forever in his service.

*Finally* he gives a sensible command. Very simple, very effective.

> I still dont know if shes actually dead or not. It seems like she might be, but the Geass power that CC gave her allows her to somehow control others even if shes not there.

Yeah, what her Geass technically does is still unclear at this point, but the practical effect is that she's in Anya's body.

> She also said CC was closing her self up in Cs World again. *Again.* Did this memory wipe thing happen before or does CC just go there from time to time to get away from it all?

I missed that "again" which makes me think it's something CC can willingly do. Coming out of it is another matter.

> It looks like Marianne and CC are going to be meeting up with Lelouch and Charles somehow. This is where well finally learn all about the connection between CC, Marianne, and Charles. VV too, I guess. Well also learn about how Marianne did or didnt die.

"Oh, by the way, I hear you can un-Geass people now.  Got a sec?"

>Looks like Rolo probably will die. He turned out to be a little shit, but this scene is heartbreaking, and the music isnt making it any easier. Even if Lelouch lied, he was the only family Rolo ever had. What a show of power this is as well.

This is why I find it so hard to [decide if I like or hate him.](https://i.imgur.com/AW12e.gif)

>Suzaku is Lelouch now. What matters is results.

Amazing what killing 35 million people will do to turn a man's attitude around!

>Oh wow, Lelouch. This is a best guy move. [Such a wonderful expression.](http://i.imgur.com/RntU1B9.jpg)

I think some people may be starting to see why Lelouch might have won the Best Guy bracket.  "Hard core, man.  Fucking hard core."  _Full Metal Jacket_
>> ARTICLE
> the music isnt making it any easier

Super underrated part of Code Geass is the music IMO.  With the big moments they really nail it with the music.  It always finds a way to augment the emotions the show wants you to feel.  Like this Rolo scene with a typical score that you would expect would not be nearly as powerful, but then when that music kicks in the waterworks start.

> Marianne. Youre here. Youre finally here,

You'll get a good dose of Marianne tomorrow as you would expect.

> CC taking Cheese-kun with her to the final showdown, of course.

I loved her expression when Marianne said that they have to rescue Lelouch.  She hates the fact that she cares about him so much, it's hilarious.

> I am standing right on the line. I want to watch more. 

The struggle is so real.  I think watching it within the structure of these rewatch threads helps to resist the temptation to just go ahead and binge the rest, since you feel obligated to follow the schedule in a way.

> So did Charles not actually do anything? CC did this to herself. She can just turn off her own immortality?

Yeah Charles was going to kill her as per her wish and ostensibly take her code as well, but she stopped him and sealed her code away.  I'm honestly not sure how it works beyond that.

> I dont know. Its equally frustrating and exciting that theres still, still, so much to learn.

Code Geass' plot from here to the end is like a car going 100 mph with the brake line cut.

Yeah, Kotaro Nakagawa is an amazing composer and his Geass soundtrack is pretty legendary stuff. As a viewer of Geass when it first aired, I could always remember the melodies by heart.

> The struggle is so real. I think watching it within the structure of these rewatch threads helps to resist the temptation to just go ahead and binge the rest, since you feel obligated to follow the schedule in a way.

Goes the other way too. To be honest I would have dropped the show a while ago were I watching it on my own, but I'm here so I'm sticking it out.
>> ARTICLE
> You'll get a good dose of Marianne tomorrow as you would expect.

Yes. Saw her in the preview as well. Quite excited to see what she's been up to and what she's going to do next.

> The struggle is so real. I think watching it within the structure of these rewatch threads helps to resist the temptation to just go ahead and binge the rest, since you feel obligated to follow the schedule in a way.

This is the only reason I haven't finished the show. I really don't mind though. Doing these write-ups and joining in on the discussion have been a fun way to watch a show. I don't feel the need to watch more right now, but when I watch the next two episodes later, oh boy, right when they end I'm going to want to just play the next one.

>Nina is taking the blame

And rightfully so, she shouldn't be surprised it killed people, she knew what it would be used for

Frankly, I don't really think she did. She was blinded by rage for so long, she was basically running on emotions until this event and it looks like she's finally waking up to the reality of her actions.
>> ARTICLE
I love reading your posts most of all because unlike me or some others, you seem genuinely unbiased toward one side or the other. You recognize Lelouch's faults, but acknowledge that he is trying, and understand Suzaku's side of things but also know when he's being a self-righteous dick.

That, and you actually had the sense to say this

> Nina. Oh god, Nina. What did you think would happen? You cant make something like that and not know what it would do.

Fuck. That. Cunt.
>> ARTICLE
> unlike me or some others, you seem genuinely unbiased toward one side or the other.

I could be that way too (I think that way in the back of my mind as I'm writing about the episodes), but being objective is *boring*. 

Aside from that, I've been wondering about something given that, as far as I can tell, all rewatchers here are firmly fans of Lelouch. Are /u/EditorialComplex and I oddities in our hatred of him orpresumably more likelythose that don't like him just aren't participating? I'm curious what the fandom reaction was as the show was airing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm fairly new here, but this whole sub seems to have a much more positive view of Lelouch than I'm used to seeing.  When he won Best Guy I was really, really surprised in a 'what?  I'm not sure that makes any sense,' way.
>> ARTICLE
Dat ending, man.
>> ARTICLE
Urgghhhhh I'm biting my tongue so hard right now
>> ARTICLE
See, here's the thing: As a character, I don't hate him. I think he's an interesting villain protagonist, like your Hannibals or Light Yagamis or whatever. Villains can always be interesting and entertaining. 

I just think he's a terrible person and love to root against him, like I would a great villain in another TV series.

I also like a lot of the Britannians and find them a lot more sympathetic (Euphy, Suzaku, Shirley, Lloyd & Cecile). 
>> ARTICLE
I was rooting for Lelouch until the point where he lost control of his Geass. That scene pretty much broke me and I feel like it should have broken him as well. The fact that it didn't is all the more scary.
>> ARTICLE
But it did break him. He just has a better job of hiding it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I definitely agree there. As a character Lelouch is fascinating to me and I'm enjoying watching him when I think about it that way.

On a personal level, I just want Suzaku to smack him around for a while.
>> ARTICLE
I think the one thing Lelouch is missing as a villain protagonist is a real hero antagonist, which muddies the waters. You have Suzaku, sure, but look at Suzaku's bosses: the ruthless Cornelia, the scheming Schneizel, and of course the deicidal Charles. So even if Suzaku takes the role of "hero antagonist," he's a hero antagonist who is ultimately working for OTHER villains. 

I do think that it's pretty funny that Lelouch is essentially the Evil Wizard archetype (not strong physically, mysterious supernatural power) and Suzaku is the physically capable combat ace who's trying to atone for his past. It's a complete subversion of where the characters would fall in a lot of other series. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell, just swap them around and make Suzaku the main character without showing us any of the Lelouch-as-Zero scenes (playing him straight as a villain without knowing his true goals) and it sounds pretty average.
>> ARTICLE
There's kind of a world of difference between Lelouch and someone like Light though. Light is pretty much a sociopathic monster right from that start and expresses no remorse or disgust for his actions throughout the entire series. He's one of the evilest bastards in anime.

Lelouch.... Lelouch does *some terrible things*, but he's also remorseful, cares at least somewhat about the people around him and the only thing that rivals his pride is his self-loathing. He's a human being, rather than a complete monster like Light.

You may have noticed that I did not mention Hannibal Lecter. That's because I think even a cannibalistic serial killer is better than Light.

... Seriously, and I can't emphasize this enough: I fucking hate Light Yagami.
>> ARTICLE
All the same, Light *believes* he's doing the world a favor by removing "bad people".
>> ARTICLE
To be fair for Light, he was not wrong necessarily. The problem is that he severely overreached the due process and he used the Death Note to exaggerate his sense of self importance. Getting rid of proven criminals and those who pose an immediate threat, I actually could have agreed with him, even if is still in a moral gray to put it to action. But he really overshot his original goals after that.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I don't disagree. I think Light is far worse than Lelouch as a person. But they're both villain protagonists who can be fun to see in action. 
>> ARTICLE
While it was airing? People despised Lelouch. They wanted him as dead as you do.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I have no idea. But then again, I don't follow animes as soon as they get released. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much! 

A lot of people seem to get really into anime/movies/games, and they almost act like the characters are real people. So they take sides or ship couples or whatnot. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, nothing at all, but I've just never been able to do it. I can't talk to Lelouch or Suzaku and tell them they're being stupid. Sure I can relate to some characters more than others, but ultimately I'm not part of their story. I'm just watching it so all I can do is see how it plays out.

Maybe the more I watch anime I'll get into that mindset eventually.

And Nina. She realistically should've went to counseling/therapy right after the hostage situation. That girl's Psycho-Pass would be off the charts.

Yes Nina, that's what happens when you make a nuke. Heeeere comes Lelouch's breakdown!

Oh yeah, I forgot that Lelouch didn't tell anyone that he captured Cornelia. Sneaky sneaky. And Schneizel lands right after that, guess she has a ride home now.

Hah, all of the Black Knights are ignoring Lelouch right now. Not quite what I predicted but I'll take it.

...I expect Rolo to try to kill CC before too long. Except it won't work because she's (hopefully) still immune to Geass. Never mind, Lelouch snaps first and kicks him out. That took way too damn long.

At least Nina's realizing the horror of her actions too. Should have been obvious to her that Lloyd chose science long ago.

I can only hope that Tamaki is a master diplomat, otherwise I foresee this meeting going poorly.

Meanwhile, Jeremiah *is* searching for Nunnally. Milly and Rivalz survived along with the academy, that's good.

Oooh, the revelation of Zero as a prince. Schneizel always feared him, eh? As I rival even early on, I suppose. ...so why was Tamaki's loyalty rating so low again? gi ain't happy though. Cornelia gets Euphemia's name cleared as well with that recording. Even a master of damage control like Diethard can't spin all of this in Lelouch's favor.

Kallen realizes that Lelouch is all alone now. She's the one person that he can *actually* trust, but it's too late for that.

Diethard is a master opportunist. Even in betraying Zero he gets more footage to use for later. Again with the question... what is Kallen to Lelouch this time?

Going hard with the villain route here, but I suppose he didn't have much of a choice. Shun Kallen so she can continue on. Naturally he's saved by a person he despises.

The escape scene was done very well, a final hurrah for a controversial character. One who was dedicated to Lelouch no matter what, because Lelouch finally made him feel human. I love soundtrack dissonance moments like that too.

Ragnarok Connection? Yep, definitely gonna kill a god here. Lelouch ain't done yet though. My prediction wasn't that far off for once! He's out for Charles rather than Nunnally, but maybe one can lead to the other...

---
Suzaku contemplating all the death from the bottom of the crater. [Nina, too.](http://i.imgur.com/S6ttKyl.png) She's remorseful, he... isn't? Uh oh.

Charles is using the artifacts on the islands to bring the Sword of Akasha to full power, as we all expected by now.

Anya *is* Geassed! But... in what manner? Seems like she's connected to Charles or the artifacts themselves. She knows CC and they were friends?

Whoa, she can dive into CC's memories where yep, her real personality's been sealed away also as some of us predicted. But why AnHOLY SHIT SHE'S MARIANNE OH MY ^(soon to be deceased) GOD /u/EditorialComplex [WAS HALF RIGHT](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/346x8q/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqruv3z)

> I'm going to say that Anya is actually a clone of Marianne the Flash to harness her unparalleled Knightmare piloting abilities

Do I get half credit for saying [Marianne was still alive and disguised as someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34ftcq/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cquag6s?context=1)? I just picked the wrong person for her to be disguised as. I also love the music for this entire scene.

All of that aside, what Geass is currently *affecting* her? As Anya she has the red ring, but as Marianne she doesn't. Wait, could someone transfer their personality to someone else via Geass? Could *that* be Marianne's power? So Marianne overloaded a young Anya before (instead of?) dying and kind of sealed herself away; whenever Anya has the red-eye Geassed effect going it's Marianne in control. Just a guess right now, but that could account for Anya's ongoing memory issues if maybe Marianne could turn herself on/off at will.

Okay, back to her and CC. I bet I can tell you why CC sealed herself away instead of dying to Charles even if she didn't know herself (sorry /u/souther1983, [I was wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/353gjm/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cr1alli?context=1) and should have seen this coming). It was looooooove. Or at least that's my assumption.

Confirmed that CC *did* give Marianne Geass, so there's that. Not sure what CC needs to pick up, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

A nice moment between Cornelia and Villetta there, wonder what both of them are going to do now.

Diethard disowning Zero now. And just as he says, the masked hero is merely a symbol. Not even Lelouch could prove it for sure if none of the Black Knights vouch for him.

[Damn it, mystical artifacts in Antarctica are never a good sign.](http://i.imgur.com/g0Xqioo.png) So is Charles going to destroy the world here along with God, or what?

So there are only a few people that know that Zero isn't really dead. Jeremiah has his doubts, I'm sure, and clearly wants to verify it.

Finally a generic "you'll obey whatever I say" from Lelouch. So much more useful, but I guess it requires more micromanaging.

Suzaku ain't right in the head anymore, even Lloyd realizes that. Convenient Schneizel, interesting that they're all lying about Guilford firing the nuke. I guess because it's easy to scapegoat a dead man and they didn't want to blame Suzaku for it? Kinda weird, all things considered.

Suzaku owns up to it, and... lies even more about why he did it. Just like Lelouch did with Suzaku at their last meeting. Well, here's Suzaku crossing the line.I'm amused that it just nudges Schneizel into the territory where he decides it's time for a coup.

Kaguya, I don't think you were even married to Zero on paper. Maybe I'm wrong there.

Poor Gino, one of the few good, honest men left in the upper echelons of Britannia.

> The true nature of people is that they want to be controlled. By ethnicity, by religion, by tradition, by authority.

...by Geass? But interesting that Schneizel only says *perhaps* to becoming the emperor. Also "authority has another meaning" implies... I'm not sure what.

Suzaku's out to commit regicide, but to be honest I'm not sure *why*. Does he blame Charles for all of Geass? Does he just want to become the Knight of One for some reason? Bismarck's there to defend his majesty, of course. [Damn, another one I was wrong about](http://i.imgur.com/h4uNXKI.png) but /u/EditorialComplex [called it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34v048/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqyb0th) Now we just have to guess what power he has.

Heh, Diethard thinking he was wrong about gi's role. He's not wrong, but that's not a bad thing.

Strength without a standard to follow... yep, Suzaku has definitely lost his way.

[Lelouch still has style.](http://i.imgur.com/CVaxrN1.png) And those Geassed folks earlier come in handy defending him. [Completely unnecessary but still cool.](http://i.imgur.com/rbv1rCO.png)

~~Anya~~ Marianne was sneaky there, finding an easy way past Bismarck. [Ah, Cheese-kun, of course CC couldn't leave him behind.](http://i.imgur.com/GRp8fhi.png) Also a good way to tell she's back to her old self.

Smart move by Lelouch to blow the entrance. How do you get rid of an immortal? Bury them, seal them away from the rest of the world. And Lelouch obviously has nothing left there... or at least that's what he thinks.

[Wild speculation turn 15](/s "Marianne and CC figure out a way to get into the Sword of Akasha and rescue Lelouch. With Charles as good as dead, Suzaku returns to Schneizel, who declines the throne in favor of Cornelia as long as Suzaku is named the Knight of One. Kannon is mildly depressed by that until Nina comforts him and they start dating.")

I still think Charles has been repeatedly geassing folks on a whim to change their memories, including the Knights of the Round. Marianne's geass does seem to be the transferal of her consciousness, but I suspect she's been hiding out in C's world, not inside Anya.

>Finally a generic "you'll obey whatever I say" from Lelouch. So much more useful, but I guess it requires more micromanaging.

"The ends justify the means" is something I generally refuse, so I have to disagree with him.

I would disagree with his attitude too. I am not fond of such behavior in real life.

But in a certain sense, Suzaku is merely going back to his old self after realizing his righteous ideals did not prevent more death and destruction. His more questionable moments throughout R2 and post-Euphemia were, in a manner or speaking, foreshadowing this.

Here we have the child who killed his own father because he thought it would bring peace and end the war. In a sense, Suzaku already did what Lelouch has been wanting to do all this time. The difference is, he had spent his whole life trying to be forgiven for that decision and making sure it wouldn't happen again...until now. It certainlyl sucks to be in that position though, to say the least.

* At least Lloyd acknowledges that he just DGAF. This hypocritical bitch is just so UGH!

* Yeah, you did. Sucks that first bomb didnt go off. It would have meant sacrificing the school, but it would have been worth it. Seriously, though, I fucking hate her.

* Son of a motherfuck. I think I hate this part most of all. Seeing Schneizel just smugly strip Lelouch of those that had previously fought so hard for him Fuck me.

* Fuck yeah. Jeremiah is probably the only part of this episode that doesnt make me wince. He tries so hard to help Lelouch and honestly hopes Nunnally is alive. Shit, I may actually cry watching this episode. And I didnt cry during any of the previous horrible points in the series.

* Black Knights Interior Custodian Minister. How did Tamaki get my job?

* Fuck, Jeremiah is so cool.

* I cant even be annoyed by Rivalz. Im just so emotionally drained from whats already happened and from knowing whats going to happen.

* Oh, motherfucker, here it comes. Fucking Schneizel

* And here more than any other moment do I hate Lelouch (minus the scene where he knocked down C.C.). For not being honest to his friends. Had he just said who he was and what he could do, he wouldnt have to go through them all being disillusioned and betray him. Diethard said it best. Who gives a fuck how he does what he does? The point is he does it.

* R, D, and EC must be giddily jumping up and down at Lelouch losing it all. Man, this hurts.

* To be honest, though, even if they had already known about Lelouch and Geass, hearing his confession to Suzaku about Euphemia would probably have sent them over the edge anyway. Holy shit, can I please just watch Watamote? Thats nowhere near as cringy as this.

* Oh, fuck you, Schneizel. You know good and damn well that if Lelouch had managed to ever Geass you, he would have had you jump off the nearest cliff-side.

* Oh, yeah, you notified him alright. After making sure he would never trust the messenger. Fuck, my blood is boiling so hot right now I could cook myself from the inside. Is Li anywhere nearby? He may want some of this.

* Fucking Tamaki. I know his crying is supposed to be humorous (and it is), but hes basically just channeling my reaction to this scene.

* At least Ohgi still calls Lelouch his comrade, even after that whole outburst.

* [Im hurting, C.C.](http://webm.land/media/gHVb.webm) And holy fuckballs, she was so adorable holding up those bandages.

* I hate thinking about what C.C. went through as a child for her reaction to her master hurting would be for him to take off his clothes. It makes my skin crawl.

* Diethard just immediately moving on to who he thinks can get him a better story. For as much as he defended Zero before, all it takes is one bigger opportunity and he goes total turncoat. At least the others hate Lelouch for reasons other than just hoping to get famous.

* [This was the noblest thing Lelouch could have possibly done in that situation.](http://webm.land/media/y6kQ.webm) By making everyone, believe that he never cared about them, he stops them from having any second thoughts about turning against him, thus protecting them from Schneizel lest he think any of them might remain loyal to Lelouch.

* Fuck, yes. Even after all he did to him, Rolo still cared for and loved Lelouch, because Lelouch did the one thing no one else ever did: He at least pretended to care.

* *This* is the best part of the episode, and almost makes up for all the previous pain. (Almost.) Rolo managed to not only save Lelouch from death; he instilled back in him the will to live. I have no idea how others are going to feel about this episode (likely no one will react the same way I did), but I at least hope that this somewhat puts thing into perspective: Lelouch now has his own reason to live, and its time he used that reason to kick Britannias ass.

* See ya, Shinji. You were an insane, obsessive, homicidal son-of-a-bitch, but at least you managed to pull off one good thing in the end.

* [Suzaku has been taking lessons from Lelouch.](http://webm.land/media/YXT6.webm)

* Its my just punishment. Are you people finally satisfied? He fully accepts that he screwed it all up, and this was the result. And now hes trying to make amends.

* [Charles hands are fucking enormous.](http://i.imgur.com/J3nHuV4.jpg)

* Lelouch in the preview seems seriously grateful for and upset about Rolos passing. And preview Lelouch is one that everyone can actually trust. Give em hell, Lulu.

> R, D, and EC must be giddily jumping up and down at Lelouch losing it all.

He's losing tools, just as he admitted. He's not suffering yet.

First Rivalz, Milly, and all the other civilians need to find out that he's Zero. The Black Rebellion, the whole war brought to Tokyo and Ashford Academy? That's all his fault. The death of Shirley? Lelouch kept an unstable assassin close to him, one that was known to kill on impulse. The assassinations of Clovis and Euphemia? That's on Lelouch as well. The people will demand he face justice, and he shall.

Then the public needs to learn about his Geass as well. How he *controlled* and *manipulated* people all without their knowledge or consent. How he wiped Shirley's mind so she wouldn't even remember his face and would be left thinking every night, "Who is this strange man in my life?" How he commanded the once-beloved Princess Euphemia to start a *genocide*. The F.L.E.I.J.A. that destroyed part of Tokyo in an instant? Suzaku was forced to fire it by Lelouch's Geass upon him. Make every single person in Japan wonder in fear if he had used it on them as well, if there was still some trigger out there that would made them act against their will. Maybe they would kill their loved ones simply because *he* wished it. The people, in their fear and wisdom, will call for Lelouch to lose his eye so that he may control people no longer, and he shall.

After that come the smaller, more intimate betrayals that hurt much worse. First, Suzaku. They both promised to protect Nunnally, but now because of Lelouch she's dead and shall never know a better world. Lelouch had promised the downfall of Britannia, but now it is stronger than ever because of him.

Then Kallen. She had faith in him, true belief that he would bring about a free Japan and fulfill her late brother's dream. He used her, her companions, everyone in her life for his personal vendetta, and he failed.

And finally, *finally* CC abandons him as well. He failed to fulfill their contract. He isn't good enough for her. He's not worthy of being called Marianne's son.

Then, and only then, when he is using his remaining eye to stare at the blank walls of a windowless cell in an unnamed location deep in Britannia, realizing that he will forever remain there alone with only the memory of the horrors he has caused, can you say that Lelouch has lost it all.

I dunno, I think building a bomb with the expectation that it'll be used against an enemy military and having that same bomb used against civilians explains her reaction pretty well.

Except Suzaku fired pretty much at random when Geassed. You don't think that he, presumably been having told about the approximate blast radius (since FLEIJA seems to only affect what it touches and nothing else) could... i dunno, fire high enough to take out the black knights but not touch the ground? That seemed obvious to me. 

>You scare me.

It's what he deserves. His lies have led everyone around him to ruin and it's about time he catches up. It's also what leads the people he's manipulated to start finally realizing that. It's great. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's what he deserves. His lies have led everyone around him to ruin and it's about time he catches up. It's also what leads the people he's manipulated to start finally realizing that. It's great.

Sure some of his actions were questionable, and a lot happened that could've been prevented, but what was the alternative? Do nothing? There would be no Black Knights, no military force capable of standing up to Britannia. In a world without Zero, Charles, Clovis, and whoever else knew about Geass would have a much easier time reaching their end goal. We don't even know what will happen if he's still going to kill god (and I think he will). The world would have ended up a mess without Lelouch. Charles would go from Emperor to omnipotent being with no trouble at all. No one would be able to stop him. I know that barely anybody knew about Charles's plan, and if they did they would have tried to stop him. I guess the world got lucky that Lelouch that Lelouch had a bone to pick.

So, does Lelouch deserve it? Objectively; debatable. Subjectively; yes. You could absolutely say he deserves it, but you can also say he doesn't.

We all have our opinions on the matter, and I think that's helping make these threads really fun to be a part of
>> ARTICLE
But Lelouch didn't know that. It would be one thing if somehow he had known all along that Charles was up to a world-ending plot, but he didn't. All he's cared about this whole time was A.) Nunnally and B.) revenge. Anything else that he's done that's been beneficial has been secondary. This was what Suzaku was challenging him to do in the previous episode, put the world ahead of himself for once.

It'd be like if you were drunk driving and accidentally hit Hitler who had time traveled to the future to steal Allied plans and win the war. You didn't know he was going to do that. You just lucked into being a hero. 
>> ARTICLE
You're right. I'm ultimately just trying to say that even if people hate Lelouch, you have to at least accept that he did some good, even if it was literally nothing more than an accident/coincidence.

The end goal didn't turn out to be what he wanted, but some good ended up coming out of his selfish motives.

* [YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!](http://webm.land/media/aySA.webm) This must have been how it felt to you guys a few episodes ago when he did the same thing to Lelouch! Oh, if only he had ground her face into the dirt as well!

* Notice how the OP keeps subtly changing. By now, its nighttime when Lelouch does the hand-raise.

* Charles: I never imagined using such an ancient device. Do you think we could chrome-plate it before we use it?

* [One more time with this shit.](http://webm.land/media/JoiS.webm) At least now were getting somewhere

* Aww I kinda wish they had kept amnesiac C.C. for a little longer, just so I could see what her plan was to save Master Lelouch. Ah, well, realistically she probably would have just gotten herself captured or killed in that state (they never really explain if shes still immortal or not)

* And to pretty much no ones surprise, Marianne ended up having using her Geass to transfer her soul into Anyas body. Seriously, /u/Neawia just straight-up called it yesterday:

* > Is it possible Marianne is connected to Anya or something?

* Im probably the last person to say this, but noble rank isnt everything. I wonder what /u/rascorpias reaction to that will be.

* He cant establish himself without us. Diethard actually has a really good point.

* Stubbornly maintaining that the means are more important than the end result. I was idealistic and self-righteous. I can feel D, EC, and R all screaming out against this traitorous move, and it brings me joy.

* I cant believe Im actually sort of half-agreeing with Schneizel here, but I doubt even Charles would argue this. He doesnt give a fuck about being emperor anymore. He has bigger fish to fry. (Is that still a phrase?)

* Finally, Suzaku is seeing the way things have to be in this world. I almost have to thank you, Nina. You building that bomb is what finally led him to this epiphany. But Im not.

* Kaguya

* Even Gino recognizes that Schneizel is just a heartless, power-seeking bastard. Hell, even Cornelia doesnt look too happy about this development.

* Where the hell was Bismarck hiding, Charles hammerspace?

* Oh, hey, he has a Geass. No one cares.

* I wonder what would happen if you were to cut off an immortals head, kind of like what Mao planned with C.C. Would you just be comatose until someone put it back in place, or would both parts or your body be sentient, and you have to stumble around with your only frame of reference being wherever your head is facing?

That's basically how I've felt about Lelouch every episode since Mao/Shirley.

> Are you happy yet, guys? Is he finally his just desserts?

In the words of Marshall Eriksen: not yet.

> This must have been how it felt to you guys a few episodes ago when he did the same thing to Lelouch! Oh, if only he had ground her face into the dirt as well!

I don't think I took that the same way that you and most others did. I saw it as Suzaku falling and embracing the destruction he's caused rather than a sort of dark sarcasm directed at her. I guess it's effective as both though.

> Holy shit! Its the NGE ending! It all makes sense!

Maybe the penguins hold all the secrets of the universe?

> Lloyd is so bored. Hes like, The worlds fucked and I helped in doing it. Might as well play darts. From the sound of it, Lloyds apathy is rubbing off on Cecile.

Still two of my favorite characters just because they really don't give a fuck about the world at large.

> I can feel D, EC, and R all screaming out against this traitorous move, and it brings me joy.

Surprised, I am not. Suzaku had been getting steadily less noble and this was the most likely result.

> So, yeah You know a few of your guys theory that Charles needed Geass users to power the Sword of Akasha? Not a bad hypothesis, but unfortunately not true. Turns out all he needed to do was yell at some DNA strand made out of skulls. Go figure.

I know, I'm kinda disappointed by that.

> /u/Durinthal: Um I guess Im okay with this? Seemed kind of anti-climatic.

It's far from over! We still have a god to slay, after all. Also the last time Charles was supposedly sealed there he popped back up at the end of the next episode, so I don't expect it to last.

>> ARTICLE
> I know Im in the few, but I cant stand seeing Lelouch in this much pain.

Thanks for making the webms of those Lelouch scenes. I couldn't stand seeing him like this. Shit made me tense up. Last episode ends with him calmly asking Rolo if he could speak to Nunnally, and then as soon as this one starts he's flipping out. He truly has nothing else on his mind other than finding his little sister. You could say this is all his fault, but that absolutely does not take away the pain he is experiencing. She was the only thing that was important to him. Nunnally and Marianne too. Now both of them are gone.

> Diethard just immediately moving on to who he thinks can get him a better story. For as much as he defended Zero before, all it takes is one bigger opportunity and he goes total turncoat. At least the others hate Lelouch for reasons other than just hoping to get famous.

I definitely think that's part of it, but hopefully it's also Diethard staying true to himself by wanting to record history as it happens. He did defend Zero, but everyone else was against him. If he couldn't save Zero, at least he's going to continue documenting his story, even if it ends with his downfall.

> Rolo managed to not only save Lelouch from death; he instilled back in him the will to live.

The power of siblings, just like VV said to Cornelia. Rolo may have been a bastard at times, but he came through in this moment. It doesn't matter how hard his betrayal hurt when he killed Shirley. I felt for him. That scene was heartbreaking. In the end, he was just like his brother. Loved his sibling, did some questionable things, but ultimately just wanted happiness.

> Charles hands are fucking enormous.

I can't stop laughing at this.

> And to pretty much no ones surprise, Marianne ended up having using her Geass to transfer her soul into Anyas body. Seriously, /u/Neawia just straight-up called it yesterday:

Can't take all the credit on that one. I could've sworn a few people talked about something like that when those attacks happened to Anya the first time.... Just went to check it out and I think it was because of /u/EditorialComplex who said:

> Rewatching it, we see in quick succession: Lelouch, Marianne, Lelouch and Nunnally. And CC says "so that's what you did," when she talks out loud to Marianne?

> ...please tell me my "Anya is a clone of Marianne" joke isn't actually true.

Pretty sure that's what led me to think Marianne had a connection to Anya somehow.

> Could I at least see his face to confirm it? Captain Orange aint buying your shit.

You're goddamn right he ain't. Can't wait to see if he comes and helps Lelouch. Maybe he'll get to meet up with Marianne again too.

> So, yeah You know a few of your guys theory that Charles needed Geass users to power the Sword of Akasha? Not a bad hypothesis, but unfortunately not true. Turns out all he needed to do was yell at some DNA strand made out of skulls. Go figure.

I'm a little disappointed we were wrong. I need to go back and look at which parts of my theories are even still possible. Probably not many at this point.

> /u/Neawia: Smart thinking, Lulu. Not sure how it will play out for you, though.

Pretty good. I really liked his plan. He has nothing left except making sure Charles can't succeed. He doesn't even care about himself. He's finally a bit selfless. The only reason I'd wonder how it will play out is because there are still 5 episodes left. Something is going to happen.

Question: Am I the only one who thinks that in a different sort of world, Schneizel would be a *damn good* emperor? He's intelligent, he's charismatic, he's usually fair and even-handed and understands the value of diplomacy and making people see things your way vs trampling them underfoot. He was the one who Euphy ran the SAZ by and he told her it was a great idea. 

I mean he's also conniving and believes people want to be ruled, but if someone *has* to be a ruler, I think you could sure do worse than him. 
>> ARTICLE
To really know what kind of Emperor he would make, you have to know what he wants to accomplish.
>> ARTICLE
I think in theory he'd be a good emperor, but in practice it wouldn't go too well.  Schneizel doesn't explicitly trample people under foot like Charles or Lelouch.  He's much more subtle than either of them, but he's equally as uncompromising when it comes to his plans and ideas.  Instead of completely railroading people with sheer might/geass, he manipulates them into giving him what he wants much like Nina with the FLEIJA or Suazaku with committing regicide.

To your point about the SAZ the reason he pushed for it was because he knew that it would completely undermine Zero and the Black Knights.  The Japanese people and Euphy were just pawns in his giant chess game against Zero.  He's smart enough to know that the SAZ put Zero in an unwinnable situation without Britannia really having to cede anything to the Japanese other than a token piece of land.

I agree though that you could do worse than him, I mean your emperor could be someone who's obsessed with killing God and looks at Darwinism as a religious ideology like Charles.  You could also have Cornelia who is rash and often doesn't think things through immediately.  She doesn't even pretend to play nice even when it would behoove her to do so.  She would probably kill people all the time over perceived slights.

* Seeing Kaguya depressed makes me sad as well

* I find Cecile hot while playing pool with that serious stern look on her face. IDK why

* Schneizel gains advantage against Lelouch in their chess game involving warfare

* Best girl regains her memories!

* One of the reasons why Lelouch is my favorite MC so far while watching anime is because he doesn't mind being seen as the bad guy. As long as he achieves Nunally's wish, which is a more gentle world. Him telling Kallen and everyone that they are all his pawns was a brilliant decision. He knew he was done, so if he was gonna go out he's gonna go out with a bang. No bullshitting or beating around the bush

**Episode 19: Betrayal**

- Before we begin, this seems like an apt title because I can imagine like, five people or groups potentially betraying others. Lelouch betraying Rolo, Schneizel betraying Charles, Charles betraying the rest of his empire, Tohdoh's faction betraying Lelouch, and MAYBE Suzaku betraying Britannia.    
- Charles really doesn't care about the mortal world, does he? And they're on Kamine Island, so the Thought Elevator. Is that a new KotR? I don't remember seeing her before.     
- Jesus christ, 35 million? How the hell do you even fit 35 million people into that space? I still have no idea how to really conceive of how the Tokyo Settlement even worked as a living space. It seems so very underground but every building we saw was open-air?    
- Nina clearly didn't intend for that to be used on civilians. (Or perhaps just her own people.) Hey, the school survived! Lelouch, on the other hand, once again prioritizes Nunnally over all else. This may be one too many times.     
- Oh shit, Schneizel coming to talk with the Black Knights. And just in time to save his sister. Is she older or younger? I legitimately can't tell.     
- Lelouch finally letting it all out on Rolo. I'm actually on his side for once in this conversation!     
- Arming yourself with FLEIJA is a little extreme to protect yourself, Schneizel, but it gets the job done.      
- Man, Suzaku... he literally did everything right. He didn't want the FLEIJA on the Lancelot, he warned Lelouch about it before the battle could begin to convince him to retreat, he would have rather died than fire it, but the Geass forced him to anyway. Any way you look at it, he's virtually blameless, but from his point of view all of that blood - including Nunnally's - is on his hands. Rivalz meeting up with Milly is a badly-needed point of levity.      
- And Schneizel drops the bomb that Lelouch probably should have come clean about a season or so ago. It looks a lot worse coming from him, of course.        
- Oh man, Schneizel is one by one dismantling every single possible reason the BKs could have ever had for trusting Zero. Starting to think I know who the titular betrayal is going to be from. And Ohgi and Villetta just come to seal the deal. I was going to say it feels like Villetta should have told Ohgi that a while beforehand, but I guess they never had the time to?             
- Sorry, did I say Lelouch's identity was the bomb? If that's the bomb dropped, the revelation that the horrific Special Zone massacre was Lelouch's doing is a fucking FLEIJA.        
- And there's our betrayal. Looks like building a house of lies has to come crumbling down sooner or later, Lelouch. That 100-rank loyalty of Kallen's is doing him a little good, though.       
- And he finally does a little good with his lies, at least, by getting Kallen out of the line of fire. Only to be saved by the yandere. Why would the Knightmares crash if it's only their pilots' perceptions that were frozen? Wouldn't they just stay going in a straight line?                    
- Sorry, Code Geass, you're not getting me to feel bad for the little murderous shota.      
- Yup, glad he's gone. No forgiveness after Shirley.         
- Suzaku's lost it, though. That's not good.          
- And Chuck is about to make his move. Lelouch vows to bring him down into hell with him.      

To be honest, I have literally no clue where this show is going. With six episodes left, it looks like the Emperor's plan is coming to fruition in the next episode or so, but if Lelouch wins there... is Schneizel really the big bad? With this episode's betrayal he literally has no army save for the Shinkiro.       

**Episode 20: Emperor Dismissed**

- Judging from the episode title, we'll be seeing Chuck's plans come to a head here one way or another.      
- I think Suzaku's snapped. Nina, on the other hand, is acting calmer and more rational than we've seen her since the Euphy incident.       
- Chuck is planning on getting back to the Sword of Akasha here, and Anya... has another episode.     
- Wait, what the fuck?     
- Wait, what the fuck??????       
- So... I was right? And Anya's a clone of Marianne? WTF is going on?? Marianne has Geass from CC... a shapeshifter? She wasn't killed, made herself look like a child and had Charles change her memories? I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WTF IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW        
- Not the penguins, noooo! Charles you MONSTER       
- With Zero "dead," even if Schneizel agrees to free Japan, the whole rest of the UFN is fucked.        
- Suzaku's crossed a mental line of his own, and wants his own custom Knightmare, the Lancelot Albion. Fifteen bucks says that's the Lancelot version in the OP with its own energy wings to match Kallen's Guren SEITEN.      
- And Schneizel does what I thought he would, and plans on succeeding Charles one way or another.      
- And Suzaku's gone off the deep end for real this time. How Lelouch-esque, of you, Suzaku.       
- I wish we could have finished listening to what Schneizel was about to say. Does he really just want the power of the Imperial throne?      
- Where the hell did Suzaku get a fucking sword from? I mean it's cool, but. Really?        
- That glow... Bismarck definitely has a Geass of his own.       
- I like that the command of Suzaku's "live" curse is literally: Dude, run the fuck away from this guy.      
- Bismarck has a point. The whole reason Suzaku succeeded, the reason Euphy ever trusted him, was his desire to work within the system and work towards the good of everyone. He was a badass, but he was *gentle.* The world doesn't need two Lelouches. Hell, it doesn't even need one.      
- Lelouch is straight-up just Geassing people into becoming his followers now. Those aren't soldiers, dude, they're slaves.       
- Man, this Bismarck dude seems like a pretty stand-up guy. How the hell did he ever agree to follow someone like Charles, anyway?       
- Two things: So Marianne really is inside Anya's body (how??), and the thing that CC had to get from her quarters before they left was... Cheese-kun? Really?      
- So that crazy pillar thing is God?      
- I really have no idea WTF is going on in this show anymore.       
- Now Lelouch did the thing I thought he did five or so episodes ago, and pulled a Piccolo, trapping them both inside the Sword of Akasha.       


This show sure has taken some unexpected turns. A few of my predictions look like they're coming true (Anya is a clone or whatever of Marianne, Schneizel as the ultimate final boss, Bismarck sealed his eye because he has a Geass power) but the WAY in which they're coming true is... I have no idea where it's going from here tbh.        

Well, that's not TOTALLY true. I know the main thing about the ending, I just have no idea how we get there and right now, with only five episodes left, I'm no closer to guessing than I was at the beginning.  

Prediction about Bismarck's Geass: It's the opposite of Rolo's, as in, it speeds up his perception exponentially. He used it whenever he was going to attack, so I can see it being like "now I'm super-analyzing your stance to learn your weak points, and I'll attack there."

Hey, man, priorities.

> Lelouch betraying Rolo, Schneizel betraying Charles, Charles betraying the rest of his empire, Tohdoh's faction betraying Lelouch, and MAYBE Suzaku betraying Britannia.

And pretty much all of those happened in these two episodes. Convenient!

> And Schneizel drops the bomb that Lelouch probably should have come clean about a season or so ago. It looks a lot worse coming from him, of course.

Yep, it's bad when your rival commander can just casually drop that your commander is his little brother and it's a surprise.

I KNOW IT'S GREAT

> With Zero "dead," even if Schneizel agrees to free Japan, the whole rest of the UFN is fucked.

Eh, that was still probably coming regardless of what happened in Japan. Even if a bunch of other areas rose up in rebellion, the Black Knights are not nearly enough to combat all of Britannia's military.

> Suzaku's crossed a mental line of his own, and wants his own custom Knightmare, the Lancelot Albion. Fifteen bucks says that's the Lancelot version in the OP with its own energy wings to match Kallen's Guren SEITEN.

Not taking that bet, we all know these mech upgrades come frequently.

> Where the hell did Suzaku get a fucking sword from? I mean it's cool, but. Really?

Doesn't matter; cool sword.

> Bismarck has a point. The whole reason Suzaku succeeded, the reason Euphy ever trusted him, was his desire to work within the system and work towards the good of everyone. He was a badass, but he was gentle. The world doesn't need two Lelouches. Hell, it doesn't even need one.

I loved that line. Suzaku was betraying himself and Bismarck called him on it.

> Man, this Bismarck dude seems like a pretty stand-up guy. How the hell did he ever agree to follow someone like Charles, anyway?

Maybe something to do with his Geass? Still not sure what it is, maybe it was something horrific that ostracized him but Charles valued him even with it.

> So that crazy pillar thing is God?

Eh, I've seen weirder.

Doubtful. The key feature of every Geass we've seen so far is that it affects *other people's minds*. Even Rolo's "time stop" was just other people's perception of time freezing.
>> ARTICLE
> And pretty much all of those happened in these two episodes. Convenient!

Wow, you're right. I mean some of them are a little stretch-y in terms of betrayals, but they mostly did happen. 

>Doubtful. The key feature of every Geass we've seen so far is that it affects other people's minds. Even Rolo's "time stop" was just other people's perception of time freezing.

That's a good point. I'm wondering what else it could be, though. It's hard to tell if it's an always-on-once-activated (like Rolo's, presumably without the drawback) or he's just activating it before each of the two sword strikes he defeats Suzaku with.

It doesn't seem to require eye contact in order to be activated, though.

Still hate the fucking fuck. Glad to see Suzaku give her the verbal slap she deserves.

>  I still have no idea how to really conceive of how the Tokyo Settlement even worked as a living space.

I don't think anyone really does.

>  And just in time to save his sister. Is she older or younger? I legitimately can't tell.

According to the Code Geass Wiki they're the same age.  She's technically a month older actually, not that it makes much of a difference.

> Sorry, Code Geass, you're not getting me to feel bad for the little murderous shota.

**NO MERCY**

> Why would the Knightmares crash if it's only their pilots' perceptions that were frozen? Wouldn't they just stay going in a straight line?

Yeah that didn't make a ton of sense.  It seems like the Knightmares can stay up on their own so no reason for them to crash instantly when the pilot gets frozen.

> I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WTF IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

And this is why it's great not to spoil first timers.

> Not the penguins, noooo! Charles you MONSTER

Charles confirmed as worst human.

> Cheese-kun? Really?

Cheese-kun is vitally important because he represents pizza hut product placement.

> So that crazy pillar thing is God?

No that's what Charles is gonna try to kill God with.

> Lelouch, on the other hand, once again prioritizes Nunnally over all else. This may be one too many times.

He's still a kid. He was what, 17 when he became Zero. All of his motives stem from his childhood. He's beat it into himself since he was a boy that his father abandoned him, that making a world where Nunnally could be at peace were the only things he knew. He's been holding onto those feelings for probably close to a decade. Nunnally is all he had left that he cared for. Of course he would prioritize finding his sister. He thinks she fucking died. If there was ever a time this was acceptable behavior, it's right now.

> And Schneizel drops the bomb that Lelouch probably should have come clean about a season or so ago. It looks a lot worse coming from him, of course.

Yep yep yep. Been spouting it for the past five plus threads. Tell the damn truth. This is one of Lelouch's bigger mistakes in my opinion.

> Kallen's Guren SEITEN.

SEITEN pronounced "satan." OMG. Lelouch/CC always calling him a devil. His number one protector pilots the "satan."

> I really have no idea WTF is going on in this show anymore.

I don't think I ever did. They answer one question, and two more pop up. Five episodes left and I feel like the most important things haven't even been discussed at all yet.

For a 17-year-old boy, maybe. For the leader of an international army, not at all. Lelouch can't just afford to be the selfish boy anymore, because he has literal armies and nations depending on him now. 
>> ARTICLE
I know he does, but just because he has those responsibilities doesn't mean he automatically ceases to be a 17 year old. He could have tried harder and made better decisions, but overall I think he's done a good job of balancing the two. The only reason he leads an army is to fight for Nunnally. It's unfortunate for his allies that she is his number one priority when they have other things they are fighting for. But they are all fighting for their own reasons. Just because his are different, doesn't put him in the wrong.

He's young, maybe a bit naive, and has simple desires. He made mistakes. Kids make mistakes. He's still helped to do a hell of a lot more for the world than anyone else has, and now we finally see that he isn't being entirely selfish anymore. He has acknowledge he's messed up, and is planning to sacrifice himself in order to prevent Charles from messing up the world any further.

Ah..*sigh*
Today was a bad day for democracy. So many things wrong with this election. I never studied the US during my politics course but as I understand it is pretty shitty over there as well. The old is dragging down the new and it shows. 

The worst part about all this is that the conservatives won the seat where I live. I can handle the conservatives winning elsewhere, that doesn't necessarily bother me, but it was absolutely vital that ANY other candidate took our constituency. Too bad we have a high population of rich and retired folks that have enough money to not give a fuck. 

I want to start a Northern Rebellion. Preferably without the Lannisters involved. 

In other news, I got round to the next Ghibli film. This time is was "Only Yesterday". It was...okay. I loved how it talked about periods (/r/nocontext). It is not something I've been looking for in my anime, yet now that I think about it, this is the first anime to talk about something that is relevent to roughly half our population. Just a niche little thing I guess. The art and presentation was nice and reminded me of "The wandering son" in a way. My main problem was that the arcs felt quite disconnected, which hindered any significant message that this film could have told. The ending was also rather anti-climactic and overall the story just felt so...mundane? It's not a bad film per say, it simply lacking the necessary 'umph' to push it into the realm of Ghibli's best. 

Apologies for missing yesterdays thread. Had stuff to do that took me into the early morning. *I did* have time to get it done but I would have hung myself after if I had. I have too little energy lately.

**Episode whatever**

* No Guilford! Don't trust him!
* Time for more mech battles. Could not care less.
* I think this the first time I've noticed that Britain appears to under the command of a different empire. Huh. You should err...get on that Britannia...
* Orange guy that is actually orange is giving me Gilgamesh vibes. Just the hair style and this talk of "Meager offerings"
* Yo rebel, if you are that scared of death then don't go fighting a civil war
* Waiting for Cornellia to show up at the shrine. "Suzaku! I thought you came alone" ... "I did!" ..."My name is Cornellia, you killed my sister, prepare to die"
* Why wouldn't you just say that you lost control of your geass? Hell you can even take off the contact lenses to prove it
* Kill him now!
* "I can't change the past" Yes but common sense would have avoided a lot of this mess
* A BETRAYAL! YES!
* Of course by "end the war" they mean, keep him alive so that he can be rescued/escape at a later point
* Why will no one kill him?!? They lose nothing. NOTHING.
* OH LOOK, NOW HE CAN GET AWAY
* FUCK THIS SHOW
* 1/10
* There has been like 500 different points that this show could have ended at but don't because of some variety of bullshit
* Also- How dare you use Cornelia's image for your vile acts
* Schneizel handing out an existential crisis
* Think of all the patients that Lelouch killed with that EMP
* Schneizel holds all the cards, just how I like it.

**Episode 18**

*  I do find it odd that Lelouch has tasked Rolo with getting Nunnally. He knows he killed Shirley out of jealousy so he must be insane (or have a side plan) to trust Rolo with this.
* Is litres an accurate measurement for a weapons destructive capability?
* See this is loyalty. Guilford is sticking with 'Cornelia' no matter where she stands
* You can have Euphy attempt genocide, you can take away a mans free will but you truly crossed the line with this one.
* Just use the scarab gun for Christ sake
* Rolo is going to kill Nunnally!?! Guys you should have warned me about this one. I was not prepared.
* Guilford is going to have one hell of a trip when he sees the real Cornelia
* Everyone should wear Cornelia masks similar to what ninja maid did. NOW EVERYONE IS CORNELIA.
* That is actually a good point now that I think about it. Couldn't anyone just wear a mask to look like a major character so people like Guilford would go cray-cray?
* So NOW they decide it would be a good idea to kill Kallen because they couldn't before right? All them ***reasons*** yeah?
* Season 1 looks like Picasso's greatest work compared to this
* DON'T MONOLOGUE
* PULL THE TRIGGER AND BE DONE WITH IT
* COME OOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
* Now invincible ass and tities is back to help save the day
* Remember when Kallen was a character? Me neither
* What is Lelouch even doing when he is rapidly tapping on the keyboard, like, does that even do anything?
* I feel asleep for like 5 minutes, what did I miss? "Oh there was this really cool mech battle and kall-" So nothing.
* AWWWWWWWW YEAH CORNELIA AIN'T NO DAMSEL IN DISTRESS! SHE CARVES HER OWN PATH OUT!
* If this show actually has Rolo kill Nunnally then I will admit it has balls
* Damn. That nuke was awesome. 
* 2/10 show
* Knowing the bullshit in this show it will turn out that Nunnally somehow survived through the power of space magic and friendship
* Seriously, If Nunnally lived through that I will drop the score of this show even further. It is more poorly written than Sword Art Online and that is an accomplishment

Next two episodes will be up within the next hour (22:45-23:45)
>> ARTICLE
> That is actually a good point now that I think about it. Couldn't anyone just wear a mask to look like a major character so people like Guilford would go cray-cray?

That would be *amazing*. At some point, people would have to stop trusting their superiors based on rank alone. They'd only be able to obey orders that actually made logical sense and seemed like they would lead to a better world. Eventually, everyone would be tasked with making the decisions they personally thought were best, after open public debate. A direct democracy would be born!

**Episode 19**

* I love how Lelouch ends up being the one to kill his sister. That's karma for you buddy.
* PFFFFFFT WHAT? HAHAHAHAHA
* WOW
* /u/the-sublimer-one is right. Screw everything about Nina. So design a nuke that can wipe a city off the map, you then pressure someone to use it, the nuke then kills thousands of people and your reaction is "How could this have happened? ... They're all dead"
* Nina isn't human. I know there are some dim people out there (such as the writers for this show) but there is no one living who wouldn't be able to comprehend the implications of using a nuke on a highly populated area
* Poor Rolo :( He just wanted to kill your sister because he loves you :(
* I think we all know where Space Dandy went (   )
* "The minister of internal janitorial affairs" One man. One Janitor. One mission. Tamaki: The legend that is
* Shit is going down
* The Black Knights are pissssssed
* This is actually a pretty decent scene for once
* Ha! You think you can kill Zero with Kallen around? She will use the power of her breasts to deflect the bullets then produce an absolute terror field with her ass while Lelouch geasses everyone in the room including Schneizel who he will then use to conquer the world. The end. 
* ["What am I to you?"](http://media.japanpowered.com/images/03_04.jpg)
* #Rolo
* Let a man finish his scentence
* He ded
* Suzaku has gone Asuka
* Charles is going to create a new world. Would expect nothing less from the god himself. Did [HS](/s "Kyon kiss him") by any chance?
* Charles looks great with a pony tail

**Episode 20**

* Suzaku is taking 'cold' to Gendo levels now. "A great success"
* Charles can control the CC/VV/Whoever things via the marks now?
* Okay now I'm lost. So pink haired girl is Marianne? or is Marianne simply a mask in order to talk to C.C? or is Marianne mind controlling pink haired girl?
* It's too late for this shit
* They should have really used these funky tracks more often
* When shit hits the fan you can always rely on slice-of-life school to calm things down. (I literally just wrote that as 'slife-of-lice'. I need sleep I think.) 
* I feel like this is how the Birdemic begins
* "War? Mundane & obsolete" This is why Charles is best ~~guy~~ God
* Kaneki for best bro 
* Episode 20, the world is ending, the war is at its peak, Zero is "dead" and yet we are watching Britannians play pool. Some things really don't change do they.
* I really like Cornelia's new "I'm a bad-ass" look
* Best girl 10/10
* Oh..yeah...loli princess, kinda forgot you existed, sorry about that
* (Totally a discarded plot device)
* "It is in everyone's nature that they want to be controlled" Keep your BDSM fantasies to yourself there Schneze
* Wuuuuuuuuuuuuut Bismark has a geass? what is it? TELL ME NOW.
* Why did Lelouch set off that explosion? Was it just so he could look cool by turning his back to it?
* How did he geass everyone on that ship as well? He would have had to board it at some point so how could they have not noticed him getting on? It's been in the air since the emperor was on it so it's not exactly like he could have jumped aboard when it landed. Does Britannia not invest a single penny in basic security checks?
* "Neither Geass, gun or sword will work against me" ... "But I can beat you at Chess!"
* I sort of get Lelouches logic but if Charles is going to take control of God then it would make sense that God would also have a way to shift space and time to his will, so it would seem a bit futile to just blow up the doors.

AND IT IS OVER. 

You may now bow before me mortals.

Those billiards aren't going to shoot themselves! Even high-ranking officials need to take a break. Oh, and I guess they agreed to a cease-fire earlier.

That whole thing has gone nowhere. Xingke's still not dead yet so I hope he has a part to play still.

People keep blithely saying "nuke", but that's not what FLEIJA is.  A nuke is a massive explosion  fuzzy-edged and imprecise.  FLEIJA is a geometrically-perfect sphere that removes from existence all it touches  hard-edged and exact.  Just look at those cars cut in half, the remaining half still spotless.

She was broken mentally since S1. Don't forget that she tried to detonate a prototype FLEIJA in the middle of the academy where all her friends were. She's so absorbed in exacting revenge that literally no one else enters her mind. At least until it goes off and she realizes what she has done.

I admit, it is still amusing to read your posts, despite the fact I do not share most of your thoughts about the show at all. I have to wonder about how much of your rage is inherently exaggerated, but I guess other people enjoy reading them for that reason too.

That said, you do seem to have an awful lot of complaints based entirely on not liking or tolerating a particular idea, period, because it isn't what you would do or want to see...regardless of whether or not it is internally consistent within the show's own universe (which has never been realistic in the first place) and actually reflects the ways all these characters have already behaved in the past.

You ask for "common sense" while ignoring the famous saying that it is the least common of all senses. Why? Because people, including but not only limited to fictional characters who represent caricatures of humanity, will not always follow it. Let alone when emotions, biases and passions are at work. That is not, in my opinion, bad writing. Which is why, among other reasons, I could never share your concluding remarks, let alone your scores.

At the end of the day, I do hope you get at least some entertainment out of this.

**Sorry for the wall of text. This was not meant as a rant against you, simply answering your question.**

Code Geass is entertaining, I just wouldn't be doing this if I hated every single minute of it. Case in point would be the Evangelion rewatch that I dropped out of very early because I wanted to watch it at a much slower pace to be able to enjoy it. 

The rage is somewhat exaggerated yes, it ties into the whole 'Britannia' persona quite heavily but that is not to say I don't have complaints. When I look at season 2 all I see is a mess that takes the worst aspects of season 1 and extrapolates them tenfold.

I think at the core of all my issues with the show is that nothing feels natural, even within the confines of the world that is Code Geass. Not the characters, the conflicts, the mech battles, just nothing. I'll go into a key points anyway. This is not an extensive list of every problem I have, merely the highlights.

**Characters:** Perhaps the worst part about Code Geass has to be the characters. With the exception of a small central part of the cast, all the characters are extremely shallow and depend on various tropes and cliches for their entire appeal. They develop very little (if at all) and yet appear in episode after episode to the point that they exist solely to serve as a plot device to further the main characters own development rather than well...be a character themselves. From the moment they are first introduced to now, they have yet to change or develop in anyway- people such as; Tamaki, Lloyd, Rivalz, Ccile, Diethard, Kaguya, Loli princess, Toudou, Gino, Sayoko, Rakshata. Even when characters like Ohgi and Rolo get some development it is extremely surface level. I don't expect 'Guts' level of depth but when characters appear a dozen or more times, as a viewer there is an expectation that these people will be expanded upon to justify their extensive screen time but of course that never happens.

Now I left out some big names and that is for a very good reason. Lets start with Kallen. Perhaps the one 'Character' (using the term liberally) I hate the most is Kallen. Kallen is nothing but tits and ass who exists solely to fill a place in Lelouches harem and act as a ace for the Black Knights despite her talent at mech fighting coming out of nowhere. There is no gradual build up, no tension in her fights, she just hops in and as soon as she flies off you know that the battle is over. I could skip past every scene she appears in this show and I wouldn't have missed anything important. She had potential at one point early on in season 1, but I gave up all hope on that when her ass started to get shoved into the camera like a child begging for attention. She has become Ms.Fanservice, designed to be a contrived way of having the Black Knights win every fight they get in to so that the writers don't need to bother writing scenarios with carefully planned out tactics and close, tense battles. 

Lets move on to Suzaku. Suzaku's entire motivation to be a mech pilot is incredibly dumb. As he says himself, he joined up with Britannia so that he could "change the system from the inside". Not the worst motive right? Well think again because instead of entering politics which would enable him to do just that, he enters the army where he can be sidelined to fights that would never result in change. He gets close to characters that do have power, then never bothers to take advantage of this, forming connections or persuading them to a new way of thinking. What this does is highlight the real reason he shows up all the time. Because the writers wanted a childhood friend for an antagonist, so they build this weak masquerade around him that could barely justify his presence when engaging with the Black Knights. God forbid they have dragged out the whole "I will get my revenge on Lelouch" arc for 25+ episodes now and it is still the same as it was before.

Then we have C.C who is another major offender. Her job is to just sit around eating pizza doing nothing outside of looking cute and making snarky comments for a season and a half. When she finally does see some development midway through season 2 approaching the finale, it has the same lazy execution that plagued Angel Beats. Rather than using that season and a half to build her character up to the this sob story of a reveal we instead get it thrown on us in a quick and carefree manner making it impossible for me to actually care about her supposed suffering. There is no build up so it just ends up feeling unnatural. 

I would talk about Lelouch but I want to save that for another time.

**Story:** Let me sum this one up. Plot holes, contrivances, asspulls, inconsistency, weak execution and plot armour abound. You can say what you want about how ridiculous Code Geass likes to be but at the end of the day it is still marketing itself as s deep and engaging mech/thriller. It is not going the Gurren Lagann route and at the same time it is not putting any effort into being a satirical commentary or parody. With that in mind, the flaws I just pointed out can't be so easily 'hidden under the rug' and tossed up as an intentionally unrealistic experience. Gurren Lagann goes over the top and then some which it does to serve a purpose whether that is showcasing a character or for comedic relief. In Code Geass these things are done so that the writers can put less work in, nothing more. It is lazy writing that does not add to the experience and I can't help but hate that. 

I could rewatch the show and point out every little problem but instead I'll just bullet point a few:

* Lelouch not using to Geass to fully control important characters. I realize that the story would not last long if he did this but the writers didn't even bother creating a reason for why he doesn't. I've heard people say that "He doesn't like to take peoples free will away" but to me the doesn't hold up when he regularly does so for 'red shirts'. He won't use it on his arch-enemy but it's fine for your everyday hardworking Joe.
* People either shown dying or sustaining what should be fatal injuries only to come back the next episode completely fine. I've started to make it a joke at this point how characters never truly die in this show. Hell, I even believe that Nunnally will somehow come back even though she got nuked off the planet.
* Plot armour is used as a means to have characters survive impossible situations rather than tailoring a situation where there 'armour' doesn't need to be tested without making that equally as contrived. Examples include; Some mechs exploding after 2-3 bullets but the main characters can sustain hundreds. Suzaku shooting Lelouch just manages to cleanly break the mask but not kill him. Mechs having super shields that only break right when they can retreat or counter-attack safely. Characters taking any number of injuries then recovering from them quickly with no pain, readjustment or permanent damage.
* Geass ability is inconsistent. One moment it inhibits absolute control while in others it can be overcome with force of will. In most scenario's it is undefeatable but then in others it is altered with a kiss. 
* Any potential for meaningful conflict is squandered by the fact that it is resolved near instantly. Case in point would be the loss of control over his Geass leading the massacre. The show builds it up to be a major conflict going forward but then it is solved by adding "special contact lenses" into the mix and is never talked about again. Likewise RoboJere's Geass canceler should have posed a major threat but a reason for him to turn sides is made up on the spot and because Lelouch plays chess he is able to convince Jere to serve him, like he does multiple times whenever a threat arises. There never even seems to be a challenge to it. This continues with the Loli princess who comes as a major character for like two episodes, joins up with the rebels, then is forgotten by the creators of the show until just now. Everything just gives off a 'half-baked' vibe which is disappointing.

Now I could be here all day so I want to make one final point before I finish. The point I hate the most and what enables the more asinine elements related to the characters. 

Power Creep Mech battles. 

Power creep is a very real thing and not something that a long running show can hide from. That said, you can still build up in a way that makes logical sense and feels natural. Code Geass does no such thing. Instead, whenever there is a indecisive battle, a completely over-powered mech is thrown into the fray that is capable of killing all the competition with no effort. "No effort" describes the problem perfect as these mechs are not brought up beforehand. We don't see them being tested in the background or see schematics littering the floors of their base. Nope. What we get is a out of nowhere free mech that was put there by the writers to substitute strategy and bring an instant end to any threat. As the show goes on it gets worse and worse as these mech's become able to win the war almost on their own. Worse still, they act as 'enablers' for characters that are already OP for no real reason, overshooting the willing suspension of disbelief by a country mile. They detract from the story, they are used as a cheap trick/writing tool to avoid real issues and fulfill there purpose as an unbelievable asspull. 

I think I'll end it there but you get the point. You can dispute some of these things but at the end of the day I have more than enough reasons in my mind to rate this show poorly. 

The first season was average. This season is atrocious.

Edit: Will spell check sometime in the next century.
>> ARTICLE
Kallen, Plot armor and Power Creep Mech Battles are the points that you nail very nicely. 

Everything else I either disagree completely or to a major extent. Not gonna go into detail as to why since there is still 5 episode left which you need to be taken into consideration before any final verdict can be made. Considering your opinion so far I highly doubt the show will manage to redeem itself in your eyes but it will be interesting to see your reaction to the ending.  You can expect me in the final discussion under your review commenting vigorously.

That being said you are completely entitled to your opinion and since it does greatly contribute to the discussion you get an upvote. (WARNING ! Duo to high levels of sodium and chloride contained within this upvote users are advised to handle it with caution)

You brought up a lot of good points, and to be completely honest, I agree with a lot of it. It sucks it's kind of late into this thread's history. More people should see it.

Can't wait to see what you have to say at the end of the series, if you so choose to write more like this.
>> ARTICLE
(Continued from below)

However, I would argue Kallen still served a purpose within the story in terms of the big picture. This was certainly easier to tell during the first season, where she had more opportunities to interact with Lelouch and the rest of the gang outside of battle. I can agree with that complaint. But I still disagree with your subsequent claim about fanservice automatically overriding all of that. Take the scene in the island. She was initially nude and all, but I liked her follow-up conversation with Suzaku. Moreover, even during the second season there have been a small handful of scenes where she has played a decent role as a character. Could there be more? Yes, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. I think it's interesting to see how she has her doubts about Lelouch but honestly wants to understand him. Too bad the man doesn't exactly try to make it easier for her. I am not too concerned about the romantic side of things, but it doesn't annoy me either. I do have a big problem with how much time she spent in jail though. That was a disappointment.

Let's speak of Suzaku. He is probably the single most misunderstood person in the entire story, because his initial personality can be annoying to deal with, but his contradictions make him quite interesting in my opinion. Suzaku's original motivation for joining the Britannian military was the direct result of his childhood crime, which was a powerful source of trauma, rather than what he publicly says in declarations that shouldn't be taken too literally. Are his so-called ideals rather nave and immature? Of course they are. The man basically wanted to punish himself, by helping to keep the peace and sacrificing his life for it. There is masochism at work here and the story explicitly points this out as an unhealthy part of him.

Now, you talk about why he doesn't use his connections for the better of Japan. The details are important. His nature is that of a fighter, not a politician. He couldn't possibly do any of that as a mere pilot. He needed to rise up the ranks first. That was the biggest obstacle. Until meeting Euphy, there was no opportunity for that. In fact, Euphemia's actions were, at least in large part, motivated by what she understood after meeting him. He had a positive impact on her. During the second season, Suzaku aimed to become Knight of One in order to directly reform Japan in the long run, which meant he had to serve the regime. Otherwise, he had basically no problems cooperating with Nunnally until then. There is even more to say about the subject, but I will leave it here for now.

Concerning C.C. as a character, I would say there was in fact more build up than what you are willing to admit. We had all her interactions with Lelouch, including but not limited to her snarky comments, as well as various short sequences which gave us small hints about her past. Perhaps you wanted things to happen in a slower and more deliberate fashion, but I think that is a matter of personal preference rather than an objective complaint. 

I am almost certain that we will not agree about Lelouch, but my view is that he is an extremely entertaining and interesting character. The core themes of the story are all about him. His flaws, which are far too many, do not necessarily detract from the experience...unless you happen to be so repulsed by his way of thinking that you simply can't stand the man. I never felt that way myself, despite strongly disagreeing with many of his arguments. One way or another, he did a great job driving the show forward. 

**Story**:  Code Geass does not remotely try to hide that it has a ridiculous and unrealistic narrative. In  fact, this is directly and intentionally exploited by the staff for the sake of providing entertainment. This is made clear in so many ways, including the actual multi-purpose tone and over-the-top style of the production as well as numerous in-jokes plus out-of-universe interviews, that one does not gain anything by approaching it with absolute seriousness and without the ability to laugh or chill out. That is not a sudden burst of laziness coming out of nowhere but a key part of the entire mission statement behind the series. 

Furthermore, your claim that none of this has anything to do with comic relief or showcasing characters is extremely questionable. The methods employed are not identical to those used by Gurren Lagann, this is true, but that doesn't mean they are not present. It simply goes at things in another way. Quite a few scenes are amusingly tongue-in-cheek, including making fun of Lelouch himself (or him making fun of other cast members), but what is interesting is how we also get various opportunities to highlight something about him or a few of the other characters. I think the mix of drama and comedy works, more often than not. 

It is a thriller, yes, but in a very theatrical and operatic sense. What I have said before about it being a soap opera is true. The series rewards those who value emotions over reason. Some viewers cannot feel anything if they are not approaching a show totally seriously and logically, but that is neither a natural nor a human limitation. We are irrational beings at heart.  In fact, the history of theater and literature is full of counter-examples to such a requirement. In that respect, there is not much of a point in making a huge deal about its real or imagined contrivances and plot holes (a term that is used far too liberally in the first place, even for situations where there is an explanation, regardless of whether it is an impossible or impractical one). 

Even if you have correctly pointed some of them out, that doesn't prevent many viewers from successfully developing an attachment to at least a few of these characters and feeling invested in their fates. I think the show did something right on a fundamental level in order to accomplish that. Unless you ever wanted to imply anyone who feels that is a moron, I guess, but I would find that to be an unconvincing claim (not saying you are making it per se). 

Your bullet points deserve to be addressed, so I will try.

* This strikes me as why doesn't Gandalf just tell the giant eagle to take away the One Ring and get rid of it without going on a journey with the Fellowship. Beyond that, there are different degrees of taking away free will and that does create a moral distinction. Depending on your own personal values, permanent slavery is a fate far worse than death.  Lelouch usually either simply kills people with Geass, which is a fate all soldiers are prepared for, or only temporarily forces them to follow his will. I believe his change in attitude and mindset about how to use Geass in recent episodes is a sign of just desperate he is and how low he has fallen.

* Hey, Mao himself came back with multiple injuries! He was not fine. But seriously...of course, it is rather silly to see that happen. Yet I believe the Code Geass world has established a pattern of working like that. Fake outs have been present since the first episode with Suzaku and C.C. not dying. Moreover, I will point out that in several cases the death was ambiguous and a few of those have valid in-universe explanations for their survival. I could do without this, admittedly, yet it doesn't ruin anything for me. When a character is in fact explicitly shown to die without a shred of doubt, such as in the case of Euphemia and Shirley, they do not return.

* First, when have any of Lelouch's robots sustained hundreds of bullets? That is hyperbole, considering he is often defeated in battle. Second, there are indeed mecha with special technological abilities such as better armor or shields that cover this. But while you think this is a problem, I think it is fair. There is no such thing as a mecha genre rule that all robots must be created equal.

* Geass is magic, not science. More importantly, there are different types of Geass powers. Only Lelouch has the explicitly described ability to give out absolute commands and nobody has been able to break through his orders. Temporary resistance, as in the case of Euphemia, is merely indicative of strong willpower, but it hasn't stopped the effect forever. C.C. kissing Lelouch and that restoring his memories is not inconsistent. The Emperor's Geass rewrites memories but doesn't order Lelouch to never remember. C.C. has displayed the ability to go into people's minds. If anyone could help him, it would be her.

* Okay, let's take this one at a time. I didn't like the contact lens as a solution either, that much I will give you. But let us look at the whole thing. Was the true source of conflict behind this series ever about Lelouch and his Geass? I would strongly disagree with that. Geass was both a curse and a tool for him (or his enemies), but not the underlying point of his goals. The real conflicts would be Lelouch versus the World/Britannia (including the Emperor and Schneizel), Lelouch versus Suzaku (of course) and Lelouch versus himself. Jeremiah's motivations were not properly introduced within R2, yes, but they were explained in a DVD picture drama, long before the second season aired. I can't really expect you to see all of those, true, but I think it is worth pointing out. I didn't care for Tianzi myself, yet the loli princess served her purpose as a hostage during the China arc and as a representative of her nation after the fact. 

I have already mentioned the topic of power creep, so to speak, in my earlier paragraph about the mecha.

Ultimately, I would have to say that for me the first season was great and the second one is weaker yet not horrible. Of course, you have the right to think the show deserves to be rated poorly. Your complaints are not all wrong and many will be debated forever. But just as well, at the end of the day, there are also reasons why other people, including yet not limited to me, do not agree with you.
>> ARTICLE
**Upcoming wall of text**

I suppose it would only be fair for me to respond in kind. Are there some valid issues among your many complaints? Yes, but we must agree to disagree. Code Geass was never meant to be natural at all. It is an extremely operatic and over-the-top production in both form, content and function. Soap opera sequences are an essential part of how it operates. 

It is fair to have very different expectations at the very beginning of the show, but the material itself quickly makes clear that nope, it is not attempting to portray a realistic world. Therefore, at least in my case, I can go along with the show's own pace and flow of events, rather than trying to unreasonably fight against it. 

**Characters**: I do not necessarily like every single character nor what is done with all of them, but I think Code Geass did manage to come up with a few very interesting characters at its core, which keeps the entire story and its themes together. They are surrounded by many who, while far from receiving tonts of development, still had their moments. Not every character needs to be fleshed out in equal proportions. I understand wanting more, that is fair, but there is a limit. Several of these people are just fine as extras who serve a smaller or larger supporting role. That includes, but isn't limited to, occasionally serving as a plot device. Tropes and cliches are essentially universal to fiction. It is almost impossible to avoid seeing them. 

Did someone like Tamaki really need to have a profound character arc? No, I think he is just fine as comic relief. Is that shallow? Yes, but it is not wrong. That said, we did get to see his position towards Zero change slightly throughout the series. He was far more antagonistic at first and later turns into what we could call an opportunistic subordinate. I felt that was appropriate. For their part, Lloyd and Cecile provided some amusing commentary about Suzaku and his circumstances in particular, which brought some color to their side of the story along with some valid insight too. Is that a problem? No, certainly not for me. Diethard gave us another perspective on Zero at various points in the story, almost bending the fourth wall a little bit. He also participated in an interesting way in a few other sequences from time to time. Rivalz was literally useless, but it was still funny to see how a completely average person was occasionally mixed up in some of these strange situations happening around him. Sayoko is odd in the sense you'll find the most characterization for her in the DVD booklets that came with the first season of the show. But otherwise, she is just a ninja maid. And that is absolutely fine by me. 

I think Rolo's development was simple but not too superficial. Of all the new characters introduced for the second season, I would say he received a completely valid character arc with a fitting resolution. How his twisted mindset contrasts with the views expressed by other characters, including Lelouch himself, was not done too badly in my opinion. Despite not initially liking his role in the opening stages of the season, I have come to increasingly appreciate his participation in retrospect. 

I do not share your thoughts on Kallen either. Within the entire mecha genre, both past and present, it is extremely common for ace pilots to be naturally talented without any special training. Kallen has this, but so does Suzaku. This is not a new or unique characteristic of Code Geass by any means. Super Robot shows, Real Robot shows...many of them tend to display this same sort of situation. It is a completely standard convention. I would have to assume that your attitude towards the rest of the genre should be equally cynical in this respect. 

Regarding the mecha (and "power creep" as you call it)...the question of tension in battle is more complicated than it appears. I think the show as a whole has a mixed record in this respect. It has done a decent job in terms of providing a variety of combat sequences. Some have a certain amount of tension and tactical complexity, but there are other scenes that merely look cool. Like the attack animations in a Super Robot Wars game. That said, sometimes the tension is the result of context, due to the events and implications surrounding the battles, not because of what actually happens in them. R2 does have a few relatively boring fights, but it also has one of the best fights in the entire show. I can't really elaborate about that one though. Not yet.

Then there is the issue of fanservice. I can understand that not everyone tolerates it. It is a personal matter. Frankly, I like fanservice. There is no shame in admitting that. Anime and fanservice have a long history together. Gunbuster had several bath scenes with unnecessarily explicit nudity and the girls wear skimpy outfits for no good reason. Godannar has about five times as much fanservice as Code Geass does and I still had a lot of fun watching that show. Gurren Lagann has Yoko's tits bouncing all over the place and  even though her last space suit makes the girl look like a stripper I really didn't mind that either.

They were under direct orders from Nunnally not to kill her.  If they had killed Kallen or even attempted to at any other point that would've been directly disobeying the viceroy's orders and punishable by death.  As to why Nunnally would let her live, well that's obvious.

What the hell is with this new OP? It even recycles most of the video from the last one. I wonder what's going on with Villetta though, and [this looks promising.](http://i.imgur.com/rARykkp.png) And [more mech upgrades!](http://i.imgur.com/PvaYcvw.png)

Oof, little Shirley is cute and it only makes it worse. Confirmed that Lulu kissed her, though obviously neither of them feel good about it. Expecting it to be awkward between them for a while.

[Nice visual dissonance with CC hugging Cheese-kun while talking about deaths Zero's responsible for.](http://i.imgur.com/fX2cGYy.png) While she's being a bit cruel she's far from wrong. I like the shift in art style from all the [other characters](http://i.imgur.com/wNeuPUs.png) to [Nunnally](http://i.imgur.com/Lpar77R.png).

Whoever came to talk to Shirley about Lelouch is probably up to no good. Once again I'm a fan of Cecile and Lloyd's interactions. I have to wonder if they're shagging in the office when Suzaku's at school or something.

Ooh, Diethard gets to meet Zero... but they're going to once again go after Cornelia. Honestly I was hoping for more fallout at the school. Shirley, why are youdamn it, Villetta. She's on to Lelouch, that's not good.

Speaking of, I like the conversation he has with Kallen. So close to revealing himself but so far at the same time. Seems like she's inspiring him to push on as much as he is for her.

Mission go time! And Zero just blew up the ship. And lied to his own soldiers about it. It was apparent he didn't care much for the JLF at Narita but this I wasn't expecting. He's starting to become obsessed with Cornelia, I think. Wonder where Diethard's off to.

Oh crap, Shirley's near the battlefield. Run! [Blue Zero,](http://i.imgur.com/GoTKMWz.png) [red Suzaku.](http://i.imgur.com/hldiXUs.png) The latter gets the upper hand and that looks like a rough landing. Uh.. Shirley, put the gun down. And don't look at the man in the mask that's falling off his head.

Need to ponder the ED song more, but [nice](http://i.imgur.com/bw8sGOI.png) [visuals](http://i.imgur.com/Sloly1U.png). [Ugh.](http://i.imgur.com/4Qg4Ixw.png)

---
[Not quite a love letter.](http://i.imgur.com/iZ07sY1.png) Ugh, poor Shirley. Bit on the nose there with the remark about the princess and impure thoughts but Nina's reaction is worth it. CC's a little jealous of Shirley, I think. Wonder if they're going to draw this out, but at least Lelouch is on the right track.

Euphemia might have her own suspicion of who Zero is. She can get a knight, eh? Suzaku has another promotion waiting for him it seems. Ooh, something of Cecile's past there. Wonder who or what Suzaku's replacing for her.

[Aww those photos.](http://i.imgur.com/FpjVojQ.png) Also [wow, CC's outfit.](http://i.imgur.com/41yqWuB.png) Is this the first time she's worn something else?

Uh.. creepy stalker dude, get away from Shirley. He seems to be well aware of Lelouch's nature though, was apparently watching Villetta and Shirley the other night. Didn't expect Shirley to actually shoot her! This guy's getting into her head easily. [Well, shit.](http://i.imgur.com/zNQGDwB.png) I guess that explains the title.

[Creepy clapping dude wants a duel](http://i.imgur.com/TGllZjV.png) so I'm expecting him to show Lelouch up. CC knows this guy? That's a very bad sign and she knows it's bad news for Lelouch. So there are different types of Geass and Mao's lets him read people's thoughts? And looks like I called it on the sunglasses if his little visor there stops Lelouch's from working.

Ooh, Ogi found Villetta and she's still alive. That should be interesting, but sidelining that for the moment.

Well at least Shirley didn't aim to kill Lelouch. Villain exits but looks like he had a further plan for them, good thing CC intervened. [Was he listening to recordings of CC?](http://i.imgur.com/iT1ijSE.png) Between that and his reaction to her, I'm guessing he's not too mentally stable. [And I wonder what this means...](http://i.imgur.com/MOLeT8a.png)

Uh, Lelouch... don't wipe her memory right now. *Everything* is a bad idea. [That's terrifying.](http://i.imgur.com/oSqmOFi.png)

**WHAT THE HELL LELOUCH?!**

[Wild speculation round 10](/s "Lelouch gets hit by a truck. Everyone else is better off for it after going to therapy, except for Shirley who apparently had no goddamn idea who he is anyway and who knows what kind of life she'll have now because holy shit, you don't just wipe out someone's entire fucking memory like that. Kallen finds solace in roller derby or something instead of fighting against Britannia, I dunno. Suzaku gets promoted to a knight and lives happily protecting Euphemia; Nina meets her once and then spends some quality time with a vibrator. Nunnally keeps rolling without her brother and comes to rely more on CC, who took care of business with Mao on her own time and now has little to do but eat Pizza Hut and cuddle with Cheese-kun all day. Milly is mildly depressed by that until Rivalz comforts her and they start dating.")

These were my thoughts exactly.  I figured he'd erase some bits and pieces -- mainly his secret identity -- but *everything?*  I was... unprepared.  Right when it looked like he was about to take responsibility for everything, too.  I don't think this way counts.
>> ARTICLE
He wanted to make her not love him so she doesn't get hurt.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that, but I just feel like a command ending with "Think of me only as a friend from now on.  Do not fall in love with me," would have been sufficient.  I guess that doing it this way makes it easier for Lelouch to not love or concern himself with Shirley in return.  It also makes her unable to be targeted just for being his friend, but Lelouch still has plenty of those to target, unless [(first-timer speculation)](/s "Shirley is just the first of his friends that Lelouch is going to mind-wipe.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he can Geass someone to do something that is physically imossible. In this case, NOT falling for someone.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch's animal magnetism is too strong to stop with mind control?  I'd buy that.

More seriously, though, (still only on episode 14) Lelouch's Geass seems to mess with brain chemistry on some level.  I don't why it wouldn't work, although it certainly *could* fail.  I'd just want to know why.
>> ARTICLE
Because Love defeats all!
>> ARTICLE
Still not sure why he didn't just make her forget the past few hours, and make her think Brittania killed her dad.
>> ARTICLE
Also, in a merciful way, he made her forget about her suffering about her dad. 
>> ARTICLE
Because this way, he won't have to worry about her ever again. It's either that or kill her.
>> ARTICLE
I KNOW. That would likely avoid the fallout that's almost certainly coming. Instead it's like using a chainsaw to trim your hair.
>> ARTICLE
Great analogy.
>> ARTICLE
He wants her to never fall in love with him. It is for her sake that he forcefully removed her from his life, as it is clear very soon any association with him would put her in mortal danger.
Note that if Lulu was truly a villain he would not have done more than just have Shirely killed. This is what makes Lulu different; he is capable of killing, but very often when the opportunity presents itself, he back off and picks the more difficult path. The man is not as evil as he himself wanted to be.

I'm pretty sure the subtitles you're watching are the old ones from [gg] (and with old I mean those subtitles came out as Code Geass aired back in 2006/7). The version I'm watching says something along the lines of "To think that you'd come out into a crowd"

**Episode 13**

* JIBUN W-...ut? why is there a cat being strangled? is it asshole cat? and when do I get my JIBUN WOOOOO back?
* I actually have listen to the english dub once or twice since I made the switch and I really don't think it's bad at all. I can see why people like it. Will still be sticking with the Japanese though. 
* Huh. I never thought about whats-her-name's perspective on the rebels killing Shirley's father
* Watch closely children. This is what the rebel scum does. It tares good Britannian families apart for the sake of violence and petty conflict.
* I love how they spliced a Pizza hut delivery inbetween the funeral scenes. It's like they want you to cry while eating Pizza instead of ice cream.
* Too bad I already had Pizza, I am immune to your powers o-
* ...a Pizza hut meal would be really nice now though
* O
* O
* O
* H
* Cheese-kun makes her(?) debut 
* That is a very suggestive position there Lelouch
* I love the track at 12mins
* OOOOOOOOOOOH Shirley is on to him!
* She is either going to die or he is going to use his hypnotoad powers
* Green haired girl talking about 'the same mistakes'. I'm so betting that she fucked up the timeline and is using Lelouch to change it.
* Nothing like watching filthy elevens die
* THAT'S IT SHIRLEY
* SHOOT HIM
* THINK OF THE BRITANNIAN LIVES YOU CAN SAVE
* Well at least the new ED is good

**Episode 14** 

* J-J-^^JIBUN...^^wo
* Who shot who now?
* I think we all know why she wants to meet the princess &#3232;_&#3232;
* Sigh, I really want someone to punch that cat
* Everyone likes everyone in this show
* Oh great the memorial [is buffering](http://i.imgur.com/5odEEIR.png) *again*
* Creepy girl is rocking the steam punk/goth look
* SHOT THROUGH THE HEART AND YOUR TO BLAME
* DARLING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME
* WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
* Now everyone is hypno toad
* Space Dandy how the hell could you tell that Lelouch was different
* Wouldn't it be great if Mao was just Lelouch but from a different timeline? Hence why he can understand Lelouch so well and why Crowd Control would be so desperate to fix the future haha
* You can't just tell someone to forget their own father
* You can just tell someone to forget their own father
* Lelouch you bastard
* I really want Britannia to crush him like the maggot he is!

Wish I had more to say but those episodes were reasonably straight forward. Jibun woo is gone, Lelouch is a bastard, random geass guy came out of nowhere and table-kun has not been seen again. The only thing left to hold up this show is Cheese-kun. I shall expect great things.

Also I'm copying this from my free talk friday post:

> * What do you have me tagged as? (if you have me tagged at all)

> * What should I tag you? (I want to be able to recognize awesome peoples)
> * Would you be willing to star in a completely original sports anime called /u/rascorpia's baksetball? if so what would your totally-not-superhuman ability be?

I think Lelouch is not a bastard. His choice was correct and the only way to continue his battle to crush Brittania and to keep Shirley alive. He could have killed her. There and at the spot and no one would have asked questions and the problem would be solved from his side. But since he has/had feelings for her, it needed another solution.

Well, since crushing Brittania is not a well-received idea from your side I can see why you call him a bastard.


>> ARTICLE
Well, he could have just ordered her to forget he's Zero, and never absorb the information if it's presented again

I really think the "lost memories" premise could have been handled better. We didn't get to know Shirley quite enough as a character, and it zoomed through Lelouch's regret a bit too fast. The Candy Land art style didn't help much either.

That said, I'm really enjoying the show so far.

If you're curious about where CC got that new outfit, there's part of an audio drama you can look up called "Stage 11.351 The Girl in the Straightjacket". You may be able to find an english dub of it.

The number relates to the episode it happened near. So in this case it happens after the battle of Narita where CC's outfit was torn.
>> ARTICLE
The OP wouldn't be as bad (still pretty bad) if there was an entirely new animation to go along with it. They just took most of the first one and slapped a new song on it. Lame. Still, the song itself is definitely my least favorite OP from the anime I've watched thus far.

**Episode 13**

- CHEESE-kun! Seriously though, did Pizza Hut work out a deal with the studio? It's nothing more than product placement, right? Or should I expect heavy plot involvement like CHEESE-kun betraying CC and Lelouch, getting it on with Table-kun, and ruling over Britannia?
- Lelouch quickly works past his inner struggles and decides to accept inevitable consequences. Blowing up the JLF ship was a total Lelouch move. It allowed him to do things his way without his subordinates being able to question him. This is definitely a turning point for Lelouch. I'm expecting him to be more ruthless and decisive even if his plans fall apart if only because of Suzaku.
- And Shirley, c'mon now. Bombs are going off and mechs are fighting. Get out of there. I'm a little surprised she ended up being the first one to find out who Zero was, and I bet Villetta is right behind her.

**Episode 14**

- Nina's motives are impure ;) but I bet Suzaku will hook her up at some point since he might be the one who will be Euphemia's personal guard.
- I bet Eumphemia knows, or at least has a very good idea now, who Zero is.
- Who is Cecile using Suzaku to replace? It seemed like more than just a previous soldier. Maybe a child or other family member.
- Visor guy gets some lines. Who is he aligned with?
- Son of a bitch. Who is this guy... and he has Geass!
- Wonder if CC knows about him... oh, she knows. Mao.
- Geass can be different powers. Wonder what kind Lelouch's father has (if he has Geass, and I think he does).
- Oh! Shirley giving Lulu the order of simply, "die" just like he did to the soldiers in the tower.
- Mao is quite infatuated with CC. Listening to voice clips of her all the time. And CC's line about him being out among people: maybe he was antisocial, but overcame his anxieties when CC came into his life and gave him Geass.
- NOOOOOOOO! I can't believe he went that far with erasing Shirley's memory. This is too sad. Seems like he really loves her. He could have killed her but instead pushes her very far away. Lelouch already has so much weighing on him (his past, the people he's killed, erasing Shirley's memory). I'm worried he might break at some point. That's a lot to hold on to.


Damn. Great episodes.

**Thoughts on the future**

Hmmm. I think Mao is eventually going to help Lelouch because he clearly has feelings for miss Water Drop. And seeing as he called her CC, I bet Lelouch is the only one who knows her true name. I wonder if we'll meet all the people she's given Geass to, and I bet she's not the only one we'll meet who has the power to give it.

Lelouch will get his blood sample and track down Villetta on his own. Ohgi (Ogi? sp?) will get in the way somehow because he doesn't trust Zero 100%. Zero won't care and will try to kill Villetta with the intention of using Geass to make Ohgi forget everything. He'll come close to killing Villetta, but Jeremiah will be back in action and save her.

Tough to predict the whole Shirley situation. She has to go away, right? At least until, let's say, Lelouch's father uses her as a bargaining chip or something similar to that scenario. How can she go back to the school? Everyone will be so confused as to why she doesn't know who Lelouch is. Unless Lelouch erases everyone's memory of her.

>> ARTICLE
Remember, "the path of carnage".

 I love this episode, and the breakdown of shirley, she is such a tragic character :( so many tears, and if you tough this would be your "typical shounen always right mc who save the world with justice" - welp, welcome to the dark my friend.  
>> ARTICLE
"Path of carnage/blood"... that's what Kirihara was talking about?

Everyone keeps talking about how dark this show is going to get, and I think I'm going to be surprised (in a good way). I likely haven't watched anything that will match this level of intensity. I'm excited.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, kirihara himself know it very well, being a rich family and supporting all the terrorists groups, that the path to destroy britannia  is full of murder. 

The thing is, until now lelouch only had used people far from him, it was the first time he hurted someone he cared alot, and this is a very important moment for his character.

Anyway, the most important thing about geass, is that most of the philosophy you have to extract from the show, most of the darkness you will have to put yourself in the world and think how those characters feel and stuff like this. Because the show itself omits a lot of the suffering, because of its pace.

So, when you watch it, do some parallels with current world, think about the implications of the war, about terrorism, media control, manipulation, hierachy, pride. Try to not see lelouch/suzaku as a hero/villain, its not that black and white, see them as humans, all the characters, there is a lot to fulfill in geass world that make the series a lot better than if you watch it as a mecha/hero shounen anime.

**Episode 13:**

* Lelouch really does seem to be grieving. Hes definitely a different character from Light. I wonder if hell harden up someday?
* &#128167; got her Cheese-kun! Those are harsh words from someone cuddling a pizza mascot.
* Hmm. So Lelouch is toughening up, but he isnt giving up the guilt, either. Kallens removed the sticker covering her mothers face in that photo; is she also guilty but determined, or will she lose her resolve?
* Holy shit, Zero, I thought you were [already standing](http://i.imgur.com/qy8pWEV.png) while addressing your troops. *And then you [stood up](http://i.imgur.com/qXEoTfC.png) and it was like youre wearing stilts.*
* Its no surprise that the Japan Liberation Front has a large stock of liquid cherry blossoms, considering that their leader mines it. That raises an interesting question of how best to deal with the cherry blossoms, though. The previous episode said that such sales agreements could change the fate of the world, so the question is, should the rebel leader sell it to the place thats least damaging to their cause at the risk of having his intentions exposed, or should he sell it to the highest bidder to be able to pocket the most money for his troops?
* Mmm, shirtless, helmetless Lelouch. Kallens quite a girl for always being willing to stand back and protect his secret.
* Did Lelouch just murder the JLF?
* WTF, reporter dude? Is this anything for a story, or are you actually crazy? That cackling was a bit uncalled for!
* It must stoke Cornelias ego that everyone knows her name and is out for her blood, whereas theyre all just nameless to her.
* Are Kallens feelings turning romantic, or is she just protective of Zero because hes their brilliant commander that they desperately need?
* Hahaaa. So Shirley at Gunpoint is indeed a subversion. Very nice. Alas that Shirleys never going to be able to kill Lelouch, so hopefully Lelouch can keep proving that hes not Light.

**Episode 14:**

* The actions one takes are answered by consequences waiting at their conclusions. There are no exceptions. In those days, we really believed that to be the worlds one and only truth.
* Whoa, Shirley, you done murdered a dude! Hurray for the end of the reporter, at least!
* Nunnaly, you want to meet Princess Euphemia? Do you want to say hi to your sister or something? Do you even know that youre supposed to be in hiding?
* So our dear engineer prince is obsessed with his machines, while its up to his assistant to point out that "possible outcomes" and "probable outcomes" arent the same thing when people are concerned.
* Oh, Shirley, dont commit suicide! Life gets better from here. Not with Lulu in it, sure, but he would have been a terrible husband anyway.
* &#128167;, why are you wearing a tiny hat?
* oh, Shirley didnt murder the reporter; she attacked poor, disgraced Villetta. Poor Villetta. I like her somewhat more than the reporter, anyway.
* A new geass appears!!
* Wow, that is a very circular phone. The future is weird.
* "Mao," huh? Yet theyre playing chess, a game with completely unchangeable rules. How delightfully ironic!
* hey, Villetta isnt dead! Of course not. That would be too straight-forward
* Wow, people in this world are surprisingly willing to use guns, for an anime.
* Conveniently-placed photos, hurray! What better way to stir memories than to throw photos at them?
* LOL. Mao just walking away? I love it. aww, Id hoped he really was leaving. He really is super crazy, though!
* Aww, Lulu, sweet pea. Erasing Shirley's memories was good of you. But unfortunately, youre making your plans based on false information Forgetting wont be enough to protect Shirley from everyone whos out for her blood now.

In the next action-packed episode of Code Geass... &#128167; puts on another outfit?

I think the romantic feelings will show up if/when Kallen finds out Lelouch is Zero. She seems smart enough than to truly fall for someone she knows nothing about.

> Nunnaly, you want to meet Princess Euphemia? Do you want to say hi to your sister or something? Do you even know that youre supposed to be in hiding?

Good thinking there. I'd say it's possible that Nunnaly doesn't even know Euphemia is her half-sister. I wonder how much she knows about any of her half-siblings.

*YOU WILL FORGET THAT THERE WAS NO POST YESTERDAY. ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!*

Internet was playing up so I could only get online for a few minutes at a time, so it was impractical for me to post yesterday. I suppose I could have used my phone but I'm too lazy for that. Plus I had to finish Kuroko no basket, *I just had to!*

Anyways here is your three episode write up. A scorpion always pays its debts.

**Episode 10**

* OH YOU DUN FUCKED UP NOW LELOUCH
* There is no way this story can end now without him dying
* Did they just kiss at the end too? Digging yourself an even bigger hole here

Well I didn't expect THAT much to happen in just three episodes but it did. Guess that is why we are switching to two episodes a day from now on, can understand why people binge watch it. A lot to talk about but I think the one question on everyone's mind...

...**who will Table-kun take into his bed next?**
>> ARTICLE
> Wait...what...WHAT...WHAT THE?!? SHE JUST!?! SHE WHAT!?! DID...DID I SEE WHAT I THINK I JUST SAW?!?

I know, right? I knew Clamp liked to push boundaries, but damn. In a kid's show? No way in hell that scene was shown on the Cartoon Network run.
>> ARTICLE
Kids' show?  Since when?

Also, I don't think this ever aired on Cartoon Network, only Adult Swim.  And yes the scene was there, I dun seed it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a kid's show? It looks pretty clearly aimed at the 13-17 demographic to me. It's clearly between shounen and seinen.

Ah, was it Adult Swim? Okay, then. It's been a really long time, and I know they have/had Toonami on really late blocks. I don't really follow along with that channel anymore. Still, to show a teenage girl doing that, even as a cartoon, on US television ... I'm stunned (and relieved) that didn't cause some massive outrage here.
>> ARTICLE
Genocide, war crimes, massacres? Dude being microwaved to death? Fine! Something everyone does? HELL NO.
>> ARTICLE
I'm certainly not a prude or anything about it. It didn't offend me.

I've always thought society was pretty warped when we have glorified murder so prominently in our video games, movies, etc; yet we freak out like it's the end of the world when someone's nipple gets exposed on TV.

But given the reality of the world; I was just really, really surprised that they did that. Especially given the girl was a minor, and this was a cartoon. (but of course, being a cartoon, there's no reason it *should* be an issue with society.)

^(Previously on Brokemech Mountain)

> Zero: Time for a field trip! Don't forget to have your parents sign your permission slip. Kallen, I got you covered there.

> CC: Does Pizza Hut deliver to the JLF base? We're leaving if they don't.

> Kallen: [*Now Playing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM)

---
Aww yeah, Todo knows what's up. Glad there's *someone* competent in the JLF. I like [Guilford's look, particularly the glasses.](http://i.imgur.com/0W7uiWh.png)

Euphemia lets Suzaku charge in and ruin things. I still like her though. Really Suzaku, you're in the army *so people won't die?* What do you think you do in the army, hand out candy all day? [Cecile and Lloyd are the best.](http://i.imgur.com/WqjcEjI.png)

Hah, Cornelia complaining about being attacked from behind. This is war, ~~all~~ most bets are off. Not a bad battle between Suzaku and Kallen, but whoops, Zero got left behind. I don't think I could [stare down a mech pointing a very large gun at me.](http://i.imgur.com/VvPEVCl.png)

And there comes CC. Neat, she has the Geass mark on her forehead like those creepy people in the OP. [Indirect contact?](http://i.imgur.com/8JKYKmE.png) Shows Suzaku some of his.. fears, I guess? Something about his father.

Come on Lulu, you should know better than to touch her. Too many images flashed by, couldn't get any good screenshots beyond the [stone symbol](http://i.imgur.com/deIIPY1.png) but I also saw CC with some wound on her chest? Not sure what that was. Also the shrine, the roiling clouds of death covering everything and those walking dead looking figures.

[I'm suddenly reminded of Evangelion.](http://i.imgur.com/8gwRhf0.png) Should make for a fun time in school after this.

So what *is* her name? Ah, so she had forgotten everything, like what she said about the snow. Lulu's only going to say thanks once? The man does not know how to be gracious.

[Orange is still kicking!](http://i.imgur.com/v0JrPT4.png) *Now* I expect a turn for the crazy.

---
[A Word document outlining your assimilation plan.](http://i.imgur.com/8UXQjt8.png) I guess I was right for them to be concerned about a Chinese threat. [Jeremiah's considered dead](http://i.imgur.com/0ItQWp6.png) so he can go off the books now.

[It's the girl from the OP!](http://i.imgur.com/leRoZK6.png) And she somehow had a very powerful mech to hand over to Zero.

Aww, Shirley. Still jealous of Kallen and thinking that she ran off with Lulu. Well she did, but not the way Shirley's thinking. Milly has the right idea, just spit it out already. [Voyeur CC wants to watch a confession.](http://i.imgur.com/IBnpHf1.png) Wait, does CC like him too? I wasn't expecting this to become a harem, damn it. Also [who the hell is this?](http://i.imgur.com/XebN0FV.png) Aww, just going to a concert. Okay, I'll take Shirley if I can't get Kallen, she's my #2 right now.

Mm, distrust among the ranks. Was building before the mountain incident but Zero nearly got them killed there. Nice that Kallen is stepping up to defend him.

[Well,](http://i.imgur.com/Gts5uTv.png) [that happened.](http://i.imgur.com/TjtYqaw.png) The meme's been beaten to death so I'll just say she probably needs help.

Lelouch relying on CC again? Wonder how she'll take that now. [This is why I like Lloyd.](http://i.imgur.com/5GtSOMW.png) Shirley's... at Narita? That can't be anything good. [And who's this woman?](http://i.imgur.com/NNnWg9b.png)

Zero's starting to remind me of Batman; give him enough prep time and he'll always find a way to win. Kirihara's way of becoming a traitor on the surface but continuing support of resistance movements in the shadows is unfortunately necessary for these kinds of things. You can't have *everyone* resist outright or they'll just get wiped out entirely.

So now Kirihara knows Zero's identity, I guess also necessary to gain his trust (and by extension the trust of the Black Knights). Oooh, [the girl funding them behind the scenes is Suzaku's sister.](http://i.imgur.com/dLKYCLG.png)

[](#nanami-hug)

Shirley... [Did they just kiss?](http://i.imgur.com/MimG6jM.png)

[Wild speculation round 9](/s "Shirley wants revenge on Zero and desperately attempts to recruit Lelouch to help. He reactively uses the Geass on her to make her forget that Zero was the one responsible for her father's death and instead blames it on the Britannian military. With that, she flips to supporting the Black Knights and joins them, spending more time with Zero until Lelouch decides to ask her out after discovering her inner fire. Kallen is mildly depressed by that until Suzaku comforts her and they start dating.")

This was the closest speculation yet, gj mate!

Best villain approaching.

The wound on CC's chest is the same as the geass mark on her forehead and the church and lelouch's eye i think?  Not sure why its there though

Oh, don't act like you haven't jacked off to a picture of your crush.  Errybody always frontin'.

Poor Nina.  Chin up, girl.  Someday you'll find Euphemia mildly depressed and you'll comfort her and start dating.

It seems to me like this goes way beyond a simple crush. Maybe I'm wrong though.

As per usual.

To hell with "X is mildly depressed by that until Y comforts X and they start dating" and we have a legitimately good speculation.

I figured everyone ignored that part anyway.
>> ARTICLE
No man, that part is hilarious! 
>> ARTICLE
So I was accidentally spoiled today. I was just googling how to spell something, and I came across it. Thankfully it wasnt anything too major, and it will still be interesting to see how the show gets to that part. Please though, if its your first time watching like me, dont go poking around for info and risk coming across spoilers. I think the Code Geass vets will excuse our spelling errors and answer any questions that we have. Theyve all been cool about that stuff so far.

Ok then does everyone board the Suzaku hate train because he comes in and screws up Zeros plans? It was predictable and irritating to watch Suzaku stroll in and save Cornelia, but I cant say I hate the guy yet. Id like to learn more about his past first. To what extent did he help Lelouch and Nunally? What happened with his father?

CC info! Maybe Ill just call her Water Drop for now since they made a point of covering up her true name multiple times. The info was decent though. Seems she has quite the troubled past, be it on Earth or wherever she may actually be from. Im still waiting to find out what she needs from Lelouch (thanks /u/Slifer13xx in yesterdays thread for reminding me about the wish) and if her motives will change now that he has shown her some kindness; kindness that she seems to have never received before.

Shirley is jelly beans of Kallen (adorable blushing included, [one](http://i.imgur.com/w4NogCI.jpg) and [two](http://i.imgur.com/ymmrIHP.jpg)). Water Drop is having some mixed feelings about Lelouch as well. Kallens next. The ladies love Lelouch.

Whats this? - - A love letter. - - Oh, from you? Haha! Great delivery, and that other guys laugh was too good (watching the dub).

Wtf Nina? What are you doing? I mean, was it what I think it was? The hell? And after reading all the comments, I find out that's the table-kun reference. I am ~~aroused~~ surprised.

[Too cute.](http://i.imgur.com/j2IszNY.jpg)

Ah shit poor Shirley. Lelouch better not lose his way. This will shake him up a bit, but he should know that with what hes trying to accomplish there will be some unfortunate events by his side.
>> ARTICLE
I also call her *Water Drop* xD
>> ARTICLE
Mind mentioning the spoiler? Curious.
>> ARTICLE
What were you spoiled about? Now I want to know :D.

Spoiler tag though, if response.
>> ARTICLE
Longtime fan of Suzaku here. When everyone was going nuts against Suzaku, I stood up for him when the show first aired. No regrets! I think Lelouch needs a foil to really shine as a character.
>> ARTICLE
So what exactly was the spoil? And I never understood the Suzaku hate really, I mean; He did nothing wrong.. Yes he interrupts Zeros plans but that just makes it interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Because his methods are stupid. he is in the military stop people killing each other, blames Zero for the deaths at Narita but completely ignores the Britannian military massacring entire ghettos.
>> ARTICLE
>He did nothing wrong

Are we watching the same show?
>> ARTICLE
I'll PM you. I don't even want to put a spoiler tag on it. No need for any temptation for those of us who haven't watched this series yet.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I know how it is. I've been spoiled so many times by googling too. Good thing it's not some **HUGE major** spoil.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I like Suzaku. If it was just Lelouch, it wouldnt be the same. Sure its a annoying when he stops such well played plans, but that just makes him kinda badass.
>> ARTICLE
Did you just drop a Kill la Kill reference in there and then just expect it to go unnoticed?
>> ARTICLE
I kinda did. I was debating whether or not to link the song. I'm only eight episodes into KLK and they've already used it a lot. I guess they'll be using it every episode.

Well, I finally saw the scene with Table-kun. Guess I can stop watching now.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 11:**

* I have yet to get over the fact that EVERYONE IS MADE OF NOODLES.
* If your mech gets damaged, why would you climb out of it in the middle of a firefight?! Sitting in a damaged mech still has to be better protection than sitting *on* a damaged mech.
* Todo (mis?)represented as the brilliant commander of the Elevens? Its neat that there are characters actually making a difference out in the world that we have no idea about.
* Suzaku continues to be the most innocent, ernest guy ever. Hes great. Euphemia, for her part, is an interesting mix of obedient and principled. I'm enjoying watching her moral struggles.
* The Guren Mark II is impressive! Its nice that newer mechs are actually better. Its interesting that Kallens call sign has been upgraded from Q-1 to Mark II along with it. I also love that Suzaku assumes the pilot is a guy; of *course* he's the sort of person to naively assume that everyone he's fighting is male.
* C2 YOURE MAGIC. Shit, Suzaku, youre in the military because of your dad? C2, what happened to YOU? So did C2 contract with Lelouch so that he could avenge her?  Are the freaky naked silhouettes a form of atomic bomb symbolism? Did Britannia nuke Japan?
* So C2s real name is &#128167;. Finally, we learn!
* Oh, dear. Are the Black Knights going to go on a rescue mission for someone who isnt actually captured? That's not going to end well!

**Episode 12:**

* fled to the American colonies, now known as homeland, Britannia. So, Britannia is America. That figures.
* C2, I know youre magic, but stop talking to yourself. Its weird. Unless there are actually two C people talking to each other.
* Nina, were you just rubbing one off against the Lamperouges table? I'm not saying tables are a bad method, but that's still super creepy.
* &#128167; doesnt show up on cameras? I didn't think vampire fiction was in full swing back in 2006.
* Why is a mechs power source called an energy filler and not a battery? [I guess that's colonization for ya.](https://i.imgur.com/1Uirw.png)
* So the Britannians think some woman called Rakshata is piloting the Guren Mark II. I love the fog of war! 
* The scene with Taizo Kirihara was perhaps the most epic thing so far. Great to see Zero revealing his true face! Id prefer that to endless teasing that he will with him never actually doing it.

From the preview of episode 13, it looks like &#128167;s in uniform. Will she become a Pizza Hut delivery driver to get sweet pizza discounts? Or do you have to show up in costume to claim your Cheese-kun plushie?
>> ARTICLE
> EVERYONE IS MADE OF NOODLES

Hahaha! Everyone is pretty lanky.
>> ARTICLE
> So the Britannians think some woman called Rakshata is piloting the Guren Mark II. I love the fog of war! 

That or maybe she just designed it, going by how they recognized the weapon used.

> Great to see Zero revealing his true face! Id prefer that to endless teasing that he will with him never actually doing it.

I want to say Kallen will find out his identity soon, maybe if Shirley brings it up to her.

To all first-timers:

You better listen to the opening a few more times because from tomorrow on, we will all be skipping the opening of this series until the last episode.

Do NOT listen to the next opening more than once.

First-timer here... should we skip it because bad song or because spoilers?
>> ARTICLE
Awful song.
>> ARTICLE
Because [MAJOR CG SPOILERS](/s "it's not jibun wo").
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to realize I might be the only person in the world who actually loves that song.
>> ARTICLE
Uuuuuh, to be fair, I used to have that song on my Code Geass OP/ED/insert-song playlist for completionists sake, so I eventually got used to it and didn't really mind it that much anymore, heck I even kinda liked it at one point. I think the hook is quite catchy and the melody isn't all that bad, but it's just the vocalists voice that drove me nuts when I first heard it.

And I mean it's not like that is the worst song I've ever listened to, but out of all anime related pieces of music that I know, it's pretty far down there D:
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, it became kinda catchy after a while. 
>> ARTICLE
So that's Table-Kun. huh, odd but hey whatever floats your boat some people are into robots, Nina can go for a table if she wants.
>> ARTICLE
I only knew Table-kun by name.  I don't know *what* I expected, but it wasn't this.
>> ARTICLE
This is the second time I watch this show. And I still don't truly understand what Nina is doing with that table. Why did they put it in the anime anyways? To show that's she's kinky or something? Or is that Table the true holder of Geass?
>> ARTICLE
To show how evil and manipulative Table-Kun is, how she used Ninas love (and kinkiness) for Euphimia to satisfy herself sexually and then start her plans to conquer the world with geass 
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that they're either trying to show that Nina is too innocent to buy a toy or sully a hairbrush, or they assume that lesbians hate penetration.

As a distant third option, maybe they happen to know that table corners are at a great height and feel nice. That would surprise me, though, since I believe the creators are men and that doesn't seem like a common hentai trope.

In any case, they really seem to be playing up her crush quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Grinding on table edges is something that is observed by many teachers/parents when it comes down to very rudimentary and early masturbatory behavior in girls. It's not only something that has been observed as a behavior in Asia, but in other parts of the world as well. And besides, it's very easy to get away with, compared to let's say, boys masturbation. So it's likely they took a rather erotic and sudden 'quickie' scene for Nina. Also, the character designer for Code Geass used to do hentai, so they likely have a lot of experience with kinky behavior.


>> ARTICLE
I didn't think CLAMP had anything to do with the show beyond character designs, so I'd discounted their experience. Forgive me for not googling too much about Code Geass right now!

I definitely hadn't considered that the writer and director are well old enough to have daughters and so probably know about table corners that way. That makes a lot of sense.

I definitely agree with it being in-character for Nina! It seems like I was probably being too cynical by thinking the creators weren't doing it for realism.
>> ARTICLE
Well, CLAMP designed the clothing mostly. Like the gothic/Euro-centric stuff the characters wear. While the actual character designer is Takahiro Kimura who has done stuff like Gun X Sword and Dirty Pair Flash character designs. He does some really amazing feminine designs in shows that use his style and I hope more shows in the future has them.

Yeah, the table thing is kind of well known in erotica circles or with parents/teachers who realize it's a basic thing even very young girls might do out of habit. It is something babysitters might have to deal with as well.

Yeah, Nina being the kind of opportunist she is, tends to be impulsive like that. 
>> ARTICLE
Grinding on things is a pretty common masturbation technique.  And this one is a pretty safe one to show, when you think about it  nothing need be exposed.  Also, quickly bailing out of it is easy for her to do, and built-in media holder besides.

I wish I had time to write more about it, because it's actually just fucking wicked. This completely gave Suzaku a 180 in my book, and he ended up as one of my favorite characters due to this scene.

* Lelouch: Nunnally Its you Youre alive.

* Nunnally: Yes, thanks to our brother, Schneizel. 

* Lelouch: Really? How?

* Nunnally: He just did.

* Lelouch: But really, how? That explosion was inescapable. There has to be some rational reason for how

* Nunnally: FUCK YOU IM BLIND!

* Nunnally is such a fucking plot device by this point. Shell side with anyone or do anything that the writers need her to just to postpone Lelouchs goals. Or maybe shes just /u/Durinthal in disguise.

* [Such a good retort.](http://webm.land/media/A2yL.webm) Just, Shut the fuck up, girl. Im busy working.

* Lelouch is such a brilliant liar. Again, by alienating himself from those he cares about, he ensures their safety.

* I thought showing him the power of the F.L.E.I.J.A. would convince him to surrender. In direct contrast to Lelouch, that was such a terrible lie. If he didnt surrender after seeing what it did to the Tokyo settlement and what he thought it did to his *sister*, you knew blowing up Pendragon was just to further your own goals. Of course, Nunnally is too stupid to figure this out.

* Nunnally: I want this sin to be on my shoulders.

* Schneizel: And I dont want the trigger for something that can turn the entire surface of the Earth into a crater in the hands a crippled, blind girl. So, no.

* [Is anyone there seriously wasting time playing chess, or was that just for you to knock over?](http://webm.land/media/Ncii.webm)

* Charles was right earlier when he warned Lelouch about having to live in Schneizels world, where the philosophy is: I consider you a threat? Enjoy having your entire city join the wind.

* Cornelia: And you plan on disciplining the entire human race by yourself? Only a god could pull that off.

* Schneizel: Then, I shall become a god.

* Cornelia: Youve been watching Death Note again, havent you?

* Transmit Pattern Sigma to all forces. Not sure what you accomplish by transmitting Elijah Wood to anyone, other than reminding them what kind of beauty theyre fighting for.

* If we can defeat Lelouch, this will be over! Oh, itll be over alright. For all of you, once Schneizels done.

* This is the first time Ive realized in way too long that Guren is only spelled with one R. Oops.

* Lelouch: Motive, Geass. With Jeremiah on your team, it all pretty much equals out.

* You idiots actually thought that Lelouch didnt have a backup plan? Using nature itself as a weapon. Suckers.

* No, Ohgi. Why? I cared so much, but not really.

* But how could he sacrifice his own forces?! Dude, have you been paying any attention, like, at all?

* With this act, I will wipe away my brothers sins! By committing much, much, MUCH greater ones!

* Okay, Lelouch, do you seriously think Schneizel is dumb enough to not have hundreds of F.L.E.I.J.A.s on reserve? He could just fire like ten of them at once and decimate the entire area in front of him. Why he didnt actually do that, I have no idea.

* Right, forgot that these guys have spent so much time around Lelouch that his plot armor rubbed off on them.

* Meaning I have to depend on Nina now. Dude, you may as well just go ahead and surrender right now.

That is the gist of it.

Code Geass Britannia did originate in the Isles, but the nobles fled to the New World after the French Revolution successfully swept across Europe. 

It is similar to what happened with Portugal in actual history, when the royal family fled to Brazil during the Napoleonic Wars. The only difference is they did eventually return to their homeland.

Nope, too far west for New Mexico. Pendragon is approximately where Yuma, Arizona is in our universe.

Since there are no longer any landmines to worry about, I can say that they actually explained this a long time ago in a Picture drama. Surprisingly, as early as [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc0oV3YUCA8). You can see he's actually *really* devout to Marianne and her family, so it actually does make a lot of sense when he realizes Lelouch has the same motivations. He had no idea what happened that day, and once Lelouch explained that the Emperor was behind it he understood.
>> ARTICLE
> Yesterday when Kallen kissed Lelouch only Kallen's eyes were doing that watery eyed look. Today, Lelouch's eyes do the same. CC it is.

To be perfectly honest Lelouch is a complete dope when it comes to personal matters like love because he has a severe case of tunnel vision.  It probably never occurred to him that Kallen might have feelings for him until she kissed him and with CC he probably still doesn't know.  Also, keep in mind Lelouch is a pretty fantastic actor and I think the fact that he didn't say anything to Kallen after she kissed him rather than spout some grandiose lie speaks volumes.

> He's married to his obsession.

So so true.  Lelouch ultimately doesn't give a fuck about love or his love life or any sort romantic relationship with any of the female characters (or Suzaku!), but all he cares about is his end goal.  Weird guy that Lelouch.
>> ARTICLE
> Pendragon was the capital of the Holy Britannian Empire. And for some reason it was located in New Mexico.

It's actually in Arizona, which might be worse.  

Also, in the Code Geass world Britannia lost the British Isles to Napoleon and the royal family fled to the American colonies where they had previously undermined the American revolution by bribing Ben Franklin.  

You can read all about the fascinating fake history [here](http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Holy_Britannian_Empire).
>> ARTICLE
One detail that I think is worth pointing out about these two episodes is how Schneizel, not Lelouch, was the person who spoke about creating a state of permanent peace.

Schneizel wanted all the nations of the world to live in fear of getting attacked by Damocles again and that danger would allegedly keep humanity from fighting itself. In other words, a more genocidal and obviously unilateral version of the concept of deterrence. That peaceful -yet tense and potentially stagnant- state of affairs is what Lelouch considers to be Schneizel "seeking the present" as it were.

Compare that with how Emperor Charles wanted the world to return to the "past" with all his talk about the end of lies, mental unification and meeting the dead. Crazy metaphysics aside, I think that is a valid way to sum it up.
 
For his part, Lelouch explicitly tells Schneizel that he believes in humanity's will to keep struggling in order to find happiness. Quite idealistic, to say the least, but that would be part of the so-called "tomorrow" which he and Suzaku keep referencing. It is indeed fairly ironic, as Schneizel himself points out, considering this is all coming from a man who has used Geass on many people to control their will.
>> ARTICLE
This ridiculous assumption of stagnation just because nation states are not warring blows the whole thing apart. Not to mention there was zero explanation why the gods are apparently the hands of progress rather than the people, such that killing of the gods would be equivalent to freezing time? How does that even make sense?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as much as Schneizel is playing the role of villain in this show, I would say he has the more straightforward ideology compared to Lelouch. If Schneizel is to completely succeed, he may even be right in his assertions.

Late again. Pretty busy. Was a bit sick. ~~Gifs might be added in later,~~ ^didn't ^have ^time ^to ^make ^any, ^sorry but for now...

**Episode 23**

Sayoko is ok, and Jeremiah drops in from above. Good opening.

No, Nunnally, you don't know everything. Lelouch is straight up embracing the villain, and it's killing him to do it to his sister.

Lelouch knocked his chess piece over.

Nina... I can't. It's good you're feeling bad about it, but you've been an idiot.

Schneizel making decisions for everyone. "It was better for them," and "Lies are expedient." Everyone in this family lies. This is all ridiculous. He's going to destroy the world. The less of evils. OH NO, CORNELIA!!!

So Schneizel captured Sayoko and Nunnally and faked their deaths.

Lifeless puppets. Like those you Geass.

Lol Tamaki rallying those kids. Todo's girl. Villetta pregnant? Finally trashing the otter suit. Gino x Kallen :)

Why does Lelouch have a sword? ALL HAIL LELOUCH!!!

Damn. That's cold, Anya.

Literally a chess game with people's lives.

Is that a volcano?

Nunnally shows no mercy.

Nina to help Lelouch? No way. Let's see it happen. If she finds out Schneizel wants to use FLEIJA to destroy the world she'll freak out and try to stop him.

**EPISODE 24**

Arthur's just sitting there by Lelouch and Cecile.

CC gets her own pink Knightmare. Can't wait to see what Lloyd and the gang were working on. Xingke maybe will start realizing Scheizel's also kinda evil.

Nina's making me feel bad for her. She was annoying, but this development is nice. Go Nina.

Awww, they love each other.

I hope this works... AMAZING.

Oh no, she dropped the detonator. Nunnally, you can walk. Get up, girl.

For a second I thought those idiots couldn't turn the corner, but it's Gino!

Schneizel abandoning Nunnally. At least he straight up admits he should sacrifice others.

CC's smiling.

She opened her eyes. Such a surprise.

Lelouch with a checkmate?

They didn't betray Lelouch. They're just saying that to protect the hostages, and get everyone to hate Lelouch.

Cornelia! Good. Never really said it, but I always liked her. Glad she's ok. This is sweet, but how the hell is Guilford alive?

Lelouch with a touching speech about happiness.

OH SNAP! More recordings. Brilliant. Diethard is gone. Oh, that's cold, Lelouch. Though I don't know what Geass would have done for Diethard at this point. Wonder if Schneizel will come around to resist Geass.

Well played, Nunnally. This final episode better be amazing.

**POST EPISODE(S) THOUGHTS**

~~Again, not much for now. Sorry, sorry. I will be back later hopefully to discuss and update. I'll likely be late on posting again tomorrow, but will be here in full force for the series discussion so long as nothing comes up.~~

Seriously this ending better be good. I don't really know what to expect that would make it one of the greatest endings in anime. It doesn't feel like it will accomplish that, but I'm willing to be wrong.

[final future thoughts](/s "Lelouch, I can only hope, finally tells the truth. Only to Nunnally. Suzaku can be there too to back him up. Nunnally only wants to help make the world a better place. CC somehow makes it up to them, and she gives Nunnally Geass that will manifest in a way that helps save the world. Lelouch dies, forever remembered as a power hungry tyrant who tried taking over the world. Before he dies though he'll order Schneizel and I don't know, whoever else is still Geassed that is "evil" to kill themselves. Nunnally takes the throne with Suzaku as her knight. I have no clue what CC does. She's still immortal.")

He's so badass at this point.  His switch in loyalty came out of nowhere, but he's so much more fun this way than when he was a stereotypical antagonist.

Nunnally knows the facts as presented by Schneizel.  None of what Lelouch has done would look good in her eyes since she's definitely more of a pacifist than him (despite firing the FLEIJA).

> Nina... I can't. It's good you're feeling bad about it, but you've been an idiot.

Yes she's been an idiot, but she's also an extremely unstable teenage who has been carefully manipulated by a man at least 10 years her senior for the better part of a year.  Also, the devastation from the FLEIJA was carefully implemented in her mind as just a concept and numbers the whole time until she actually saw its effects firsthand

> Schneizel making decisions for everyone.

He's gone a bit kooky.  I think he so rejected what the emperor was and his detached nature from decision making that he went to the far opposite extreme.

> Gino x Kallen :)

So one sided its not even funny.  Gino puts in so much effort, but he knew he lost the minute he saw Kallen's face at the mere mention of Zero when she was being held prisoner in Tokyo.  I'm honestly not sure if Kallen has ever looked happier in the series.

> Why does Lelouch have a sword?

Swords are cool duhhhh.

> Damn. That's cold, Anya.

Well given that she lacks a personality you could say everything she does is cold.

> Is that a volcano?

Casually blowing up one of Japan's greatest landmarks and their greatest natural resource in one fell swoop.  Talk about a Daily Double...

> Awww, they love each other.

They definitely have an intense connection beyond Geass, but I don't think either one has given it enough thought to really sort out the way they feel for each other.  Also, since CC is centuries old, but is kinda sorta into Lelouch does that make her a cougar?

> Schneizel abandoning Nunnally. At least he straight up admits he should sacrifice others.

Schneizel gives zero fucks about anyone but himself and won't hesitate to let people know it.

> This is sweet, but how the hell is Guilford alive?

He's a named character who's been given over 5 lines of dialogue makes him extremely hard to kill.  You'll have to do better than a glancing FLEIJA blow.

> Wonder if Schneizel will come around to resist Geass.

The only person to remotely resist Lelouch's geass was Euphy and even then she succumbed to it.

> Seriously this ending better be good. I don't really know what to expect that would make it one of the greatest endings in anime.

Expect Arthur and Carve-tan (AKA Antichrist-kun) will reveal that they've been waiting on the sidelines for everyone to kill each other and then spring their master plan into action.  Spoiler alert: it involves ritual sacrifice to Satan and lots of flames.  There will also be tea served because while they may be demonic beings on Earth they would never sink so low as to miss tea time.

> His switch in loyalty came out of nowhere, but he's so much more fun this way than when he was a stereotypical antagonist.

I dunno. I still would've preferred more episodes of evil Geass-cancelling cyborg Jeremiah. As an opponent for Lelouch, there was so much more they could've done with him. And between his appearance in the first title sequence and the scenes with him and VV, it felt like they'd been building up to his going after Lelouch for a while, only for it ultimately to be wrapped in under twenty minutes.
>> ARTICLE
> I still would've preferred more episodes of evil Geass-cancelling cyborg Jeremiah.

I can totally see that and agree that I felt shortchanged by it when I first watched.  I kept thinking is that it?  When's he gonna stab him in the back?  I guess ultimately Jeremiah's crazed loyalty was fun enough to at least mitigate the issue.

>> ARTICLE
> Also, since CC is centuries old, but is kinda sorta into Lelouch does that make her a cougar?

It should, right? I say yes.

> The only person to remotely resist Lelouch's geass was Euphy and even then she succumbed to it.

Schneizel seems like the kind of guy who would at least give it a shot. He's the closest thing Lelouch has to an equal so I'd expect some resitance.
>> ARTICLE
We could try to argue they are both roughly comparable in terms of skill, but the big difference is Schneizel was not seriously motivated to win at all costs. He did care about the real world, unlike the Emperor, but always treated it as more of a game or exercise. 

The occasionally cynical cruelty of his methods was not indicative of any true personal investment in the outcome. He did not even want political power for himself. Didn't even bother to think that what he was proposing could be seen as "god-like" until Cornelia questions him about it. He was quick to accept such a role then, true, but didn't seem all that excited by it.

Without that kind of ambition Schneizel has less emotional vulnerabilities than someone like Lelouch, yet also less of a reason to resist after already using up his last card. 
>> ARTICLE
> His switch in loyalty came out of nowhere, but he's so much more fun this way than when he was a stereotypical antagonist.

I will admit that part's fun. His insanity being channeled into loyalty is great.

I will say that I love the score by Kotaro Nakagawa and Hitomi Kuroishi. It's almost, but not quite, on the level of Toshihiko Sahashi's masterful Gundam SEED/SEED Destiny soundtrack. (Which is, of course, the only good thing about SEED Destiny).

Any idea what that piano track is at 19:20 in episode 23? It's one of my favourites but it's not on the OST :(

Sadly, no. They didn't include every single track on the OST. I am not sure about that one in particular, but some people on Youtube have resorted to different methods in order to isolate and/or reconstruct a few of the missing songs.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame they left some out, thanks anyway :) 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I think the Code Geass soundtrack as a whole is much better than the opening or ending themes.

Personally, I have become a huge fan of Kotaro Nakagawa ever since the days of Planetes and Gun X Sword (very different shows, but they all share composers...as well as directors).

Especially Check Mate. Holy shit, do I love that song.

Honestly now that I look at the last 2-3 thread I start to see that delaying the final episode to tomorrow might have been not such a good idea as I though at first. The hype is greatly due to these last 2 episodes and people are overthinking it before they go to the last episode.

[Big spoiler avert ye eyes](/s " Since we have so many smart people here who analyze the show very well and are making correct predictions lots of the shock factor is lost. Makes me feel stupid that so many are predicting the ending right when I didn't even imagine it in my wildest dreams on my first watch. Albeit I was 15 then. Then again we are totally to blame for it with all the hype how the ending is so good and ofc. Lulu is voted best guy so every1 is thinking that there has to be a reason for it")

So Nunnally got away in a decoy escape ship, what's Guilford's and Sayoko's excuse?

For a super weapon the F.L.E.I.J.A's seem pretty crappy. I mean the only named character they've killed are Odysseus and the sisters. (And they barely even count)

"It's killed millions! I mean no-one you actually know or care about but trust us, it was all very sad"

>> ARTICLE
What about Asahina? You know, the guy with the glasses?  
Never mind, I guess there wasn't anyone important.
>> ARTICLE
The official answer is Sayoko managed to save Nunnally. She left Ms Lohmeyer to die.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the main characters in this show has a lot of contingencies and unique technology to help them. FLEIJA against any conventional military/civilian force is still extremely dangerous. Even though the main characters made it out alive, it did take out many dangerous enemies of the Black Knights.
>> ARTICLE
What Ramsay said about Sayoko. She was in the same shuttle as Nunnally. Her assistant, the annoying Britannian lady with glasses, was the only person in the decoy shuttle that Rolo saw blow up.

My take on the other: Guilford's robot (Vincent) is the same exact model as Rolo's robot, which can remove its legs and still fly around (see R2 episode 14 for example). 

Since the legs were the only part that we saw get affected by the FLEIJA field, presumably he could have purged those, flown away and then ejected to avoid dying. Schneizel must have kept him under custody because of his being brainwashed by Lelouch.
>> ARTICLE
Sayoko was on the same shuttle as Nunnally. Guilford is probably...umm...saved by the power of love and magic?
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 23: Schneizel's Guise**

- Pendragon is a crater. Which means that the other members of the royal family (Odysseus et al) are all dead?      
- Hey, Sayoko. Since Nunnally's alive, you had to be too. You look in much worse shape, though.      
- I just realized in the OP, that big-ass thing Tohdoh is fighting is the Damocles? But the Black Knights are on Schneizel's side. OPs always lie, of course.     
- Nunnally calling Lelouch out in a big way. His lies to her mean that she has no reason to trust him; did he ever ASK her what she wanted?      
- And Lelouch lies to her in response. You can't save the world with lies, Lelouch.     
- Cornelia doesn't believe Schneizel about the evacuation, which means I don't either.      
- Nunnally wanting the FLEIJA firing switch for herself. Damn, she's not fucking around. I kind of feel like everyone has been underestimating her.     
- Suzaku's become a pretty stone-cold badass and that's a neat cloak. "Zero Requiem," again.       
- And here we see Schneizel's true character. Cornelia was right; the people of Pendragon (including the royals?) are dust. Lelouch and Schneizel really are two sides of the same coin, aren't they? Ruthless liars who pretend their evils are for the greater good. His plan: terrify everyone with the threat of FLEIJA into becoming peaceful. Very Light Yagami of him. Meanwhile, Cornelia's having none of it.    
- Aw, Cornelia, no :( You ended up being a pretty decent person after all in the end.       
- The song from Euphy's death makes me so sad. Montage! Nina eating Cecile's inedible food! Arthur NOT biting Suzaku! A Knightmare that's pink which means it will clearly be piloted by a female character! Xing-ke still bleeding when he coughs! Man, when is he going to kick it? And from the way Villetta touches her belly, I'm guessing she's pregnant.         
- And Kallen and Gino on the same side. I kinda ship it.       
- My god Lelouch, what the fuck is that sword? It's tackier than your outfit and that's a feat.      
- Schneizel has FLEIJA, Lelouch has hostages. Smart of him.     
- What does he mean that Mordred is the only power they have aside from FLEIJA? Schneizel has the Tristan, Guren SEITEN and Shen Hu, doesn't he?     
- Lelouch and Schneizel, treating it like a chess match. Both are posturing. I kind of like it.     
- Kallen gets first blood! 400g to her. Lelouch, on the other has troops Geassed into literally being willing to fight to the death for him.          
- Lelouch also has a way to make a volcano erupt, to his benefit. By blowing up the Sakuradite in the mines. But it's cost him his ground army, too. And aww, serious Death Flag for Ohgi.      
- Meanwhile, Nunnally finally dirties her own hands.       
- Ohgi's okay! Tamaki actually did something useful!       
- So Nina's working on something that can counteract FLEIJA, after all. No pressure, Nina.      


**Episode 24: The Grip of Damocles**

- So Ohgi stayed behind? Way to play with my heart, dude, you JUST survived a serious Death Flag. Stop pushing your luck!       
- Meanwhile, Nunnally keeps firing FLEIJAs, disturbed by how easy it is to kill hundreds if not more with a single press of a button.      
- Even Suzaku can't break the Damocles' shield. I like how Arthur is just sitting on the ground in front of Lelouch on the bridge. Ship's cat!      
- Meanwhile, Schneizel acknowledging that he fully intends to take out the Black Knights with Lelouch.      
- Xing-ke puts up a good fight in Shen Hu, but is clearly outmatched in terms of Knightmare performance. If only the Black Knights had their own Ninth-Generation frame. HMMMMMM.     
- Xing-ke gets into the Avalon, but Tohdoh is out of the fight. Tamaki too, but it's not like he was ever going to do anything important.     
- Some interesting personal conversations from Lelouch. Seeing the effects of FLEIJA seems to have actually jolted Nina's mind back into rationality; whatever she's done she's able to separate it from her hatred of Zero.     
- CC and Lelouch are having a moment, but Kallen interrupts it. She wants to kill Lelouch herself; I suppose it's fitting.      
- And Nina's developed a counter-FLEIJA, using the power of Suzaku's Geass to get the timing perfectly. Well played.       
- Schneizel finally loses his cool, if only for a moment.      
- Enter Gino. The two former comrades-in-arms square off.      
- And Schneizel is willing to destroy Damocles, FLEIJA and Nunnally to take out Lelouch. Even Kanon thinks this is too much.      
- Kallen's tech superiority and skill makes CC a quick opponent, but the witch lives. Not like she was going to die anyway, but still.     
- Sayoko, Cecile and Lloyd save the hostages. But they lie and say it was a threat, instead of an order. I'm beginning to suspect that the predictions some of the others made about Lelouch having a Celestial Being gambit (aka unite the world against him) are true.      
- Cornelia's alive! And Guilford, too! Except he's either been blinded by FLEIJA or decided that the Blues Brothers look was what he really wanted after all. I'm kind of glad that the two of them apparently get a Good End after all.      
- So Lelouch made a recording anticipating the conversation they'd have? That's a little silly. Nice gambit, though.    
- Also, an interesting turn of phrase. His prior Geasses were "serve me" or "become my slaves." But he specifically orders Schneizel to "obey Zero." It's functionally the same, of course, given Schneizel knows he's Zero, but it makes me think.        
- There goes Deithard. Dude just wanted to feel what Geass was like before the end.       
- Once again, technological mastery means Gino can't beat Suzaku. *If only the Black Knights had their own Ninth-Generation Knightmare frame.* HMMMMMMMMMMMMM.      
- Oh wait. THEY DO. Hey, Kallen.       
- A climactic confrontation between brother and sister.      
- And Nunnally's eyes finally open. She challenges him to Geass her, too.     

And we're set up for the finale! Nunnally is finally vulnerable to Lelouch's Geass, but that feels like the line even he wouldn't cross. He's done all of it for Nunnally, so would he make her his slave, too?

Not like he hasn't been effectively disregarding her will this whole time, but that feels like a bit much even for him.

I am, however, anticipating the showdown between 9th-gen Knightmares. I expect it to be a proper Sunrise final mecha duel, with plenty of philosophical arguing alongside the battle to the death. Don't disappoint me, Code Geass.         
>> ARTICLE
> Hey, Sayoko. Since Nunnally's alive, you had to be too. You look in much worse shape, though.

For this show I wouldn't have been surprised if the nuke vaporized the half of the shuttle with Sayoko on it, leaving Nunnally alive.

> I just realized in the OP, that big-ass thing Tohdoh is fighting is the Damocles? But the Black Knights are on Schneizel's side. OPs always lie, of course.

Not over yet and now Lelouch is in control of it, wouldn't count that out yet.

> My god Lelouch, what the fuck is that sword? It's tackier than your outfit and that's a feat.

I expected at least like, a scepter or something since he's Emperor.

> Cornelia's alive! And Guilford, too! Except he's either been blinded by FLEIJA or decided that the Blues Brothers look was what he really wanted after all. I'm kind of glad that the two of them apparently get a Good End after all.

I want at least *one* couple to be happy at the end of this. Ideally gi/Villetta but it seems like Cornelia/Guilford is best bet right now.

> So Lelouch made a recording anticipating the conversation they'd have? That's a little silly. Nice gambit, though.

Same thing he did with Mao, including somehow anticipating the pace of the conversation.

Sayoko's still kicking too, now we're gonna see how they survived.

Nunnally calling them on their bullshit, finally. And Lelouch *just keeps lying*. Yes, please fire a F.L.E.I.J.A. at Lelouch's face.

CC doesn't know about anyone unconnected to Geass, sure. But how did she know Nunnally was taken back at the end of the first season then (aside from the theory that Nunnally does have Geass and she's lying now)? Did VV tell her he was taking Nunnally? If so she would have known it was a trap then and yet she still didn't tell Lelouch anything at the time.

So now Schneizel's also going to the "rule by force" option. Diethard has a new crush! Well damn, that was a quick way for Cornelia to end. RIP best ~~princess~~ member of royalty.

I'm starting to wonder if CC might kill Lelouch herself just to prevent even more death and destruction, but I'm guessing she still loves him too much.

[The hell's on this?](http://i.imgur.com/49kgv0Z.png) Purple ketchup is the only thing that comes to mind. Also a pink Knightmare, I wonder who that's for. Xiangke ain't dead *yet* but it's coming, probably waiting for the most dramatic moment. [That blush,](http://i.imgur.com/RwkhcMz.png) I hope she finally told Td. [What?!](http://i.imgur.com/vActBXN.png) I guess /u/The-Sublimer-One wasn't kidding about gi and Villetta bangin' for a while. I love that montage and once again good music.

Gino joins the Black Knights! That's a poignant moment with Kallen, showing that he feels he's lost his homeland as well.

Kallen, I don't know why you're surprised by the lengths Lelouch goes to in order to protect himself. He's always hiding behind one thing or another.

The return of mechachess, except this time Lelouch is outmatched. Jeremiah should just start using his Geass Canceler and see how many they can get to surrender.

Lelouch really does carry that switch everywhere. This goes back to Narita where he previously used the terrain against Cornelia.

Nooooo gi! You need to live for your child! Aww, Tamaki and Kallen saved him.

Nunnally's tired of this shit. Fire away, princess. Nina's the ace up Lelouch's sleeve here, but will she deliver? Going by the common stance against her from the crowd, I'm going to say no. And it looks like that pink mech is for CC after all.

---
Nunnally, keep pressing that button like you're playing Stoh right, you're blind and haven't played video games. Sorry, carry on.

Td's out. Xingke's still fighting. Kallen's... nowhere to be seen for the moment. Tamaki does something useful for once and delays Suzaku for just long enough. Suck it, Lelouch!

Still wondering what Nina's superweapon is and, more importantly, why she did it for Lelouch. Oooh, maybe Nina's thing is a way to deactivate a F.L.E.I.J.A. That would be nice and would make sense for her.

Ah, there's Kallen. I guess CC doesn't care about anything but Lelouch now. Thinking about it more, my feelings about any of the main characters died along with Suzaku's sense of morality a few episodes ago. All I want now is for gi to make it back to Villetta so they can be happy together.

Yep, that's exactly what Nina's device is. Good for her.

Gino being on board Damocles is not a good sign for him, but at least he's fighting for good. Kind of. At this point it's evil vs. evil at the top but he's doing what he can. Same goes for Kallen.

Cornelia's alive? Yay! And.. Guilford! Guilford survives and there are two more people I care about.

Alas, Diethard's magnum opus shall remain unfinished. Lelouch could have had so many opportunities to use Geass on Schneizel before, and yet he does it now after so much death and destruction.

Nunnally opens her eyes! No Geass visible yet, but at least we got that part right. Should I try to guess what happens to everyone? Here's a start...

[Wild speculation final turn](/s "Lelouch uses his Geass on Nunnally to make her think she's a different person, then orders Suzaku to take her to a safe place far, far away. Damocles merely crashes into the ocean without killing more people, but not before all the named characters escape. With Schneizel serving him Lelouch conquers the rest of the world before he wipes out the all of the Britannian royals at once. After that, Suzaku kills him because that was part of the Zero Requiem all along and the rest of the world somehow figures out how to get along. Kallen is mildly depressed by that until Gino comforts her and they start dating.")

Here are random thoughts about the past few episodes, that I had to catch up on today because Friday and Saturday were busy days.

**Episode 19:**

Welp, the Black Knights collapsed around Lelouch about as dramatically as one could imagine.  All those allies, gone.  Where the hell is Jeremiah's LOYALTY when you need it?  It *was* kind of nice to see Rolo's final act, even if I still can't forgive him for Shirley's death.

**Episode 20:**

C.C had to go back for something important... aaaand it's Cheese-kun.  You crazy girl.  Welcome back.

**Episode 21:**

What?  That escalated very quickly.  The Human Instrumentality Project failed.  Keeping track of who's against whom is about to get confusing.

**Episode 22:**

Nunnally ALIVE?  Witchcraft.  (Or decoys, as gets revealed later.)  I do like yesterday's comment that the writers for Code Geass wanted to have their cake and eat it, too, as far as Nunnally's "death" is concerned.

**Episode 23:** 

Ohgi survived the Massive Hex-wide Dirtamancy!  And... Cornelia. :(

**Episode 24:**

Wait, Cornelia survived!  And Guilford, too?!  I guess he *was* right on the edge of the blast and got lucky.  Poor man.  Diethard getting rejected right at the end was kind of cold, even for Lelouch, but I guess I can respect the decision. Kannon looks so dejected at the end.

**Welp,** here we are.  I do know what's coming [final episode spoilers](/s "as far as Lelouch's death"), but I *still* don't know how we get there.  It's been a privilege, everybody.

You think *that's* something (referring to the ending). Wait until you read *my* post on it.

The penultimate thread!


Honestly I'm quite glad this rewatch is coming to a close. Most of the shows I've been watching have had to go on haitus to get these posts out so it will be nice to have the free time back. Of course I will also miss mocking various elements of the show and by extension, you, /r/anime user.

[](/s "You know I'm only joking")

[](/s "I actually wouldn't miss you at all")

[](/s "That was also a joke")

[](/s "or was it?")

**Episode 23**

* Nice to see that Ninja maid was at least bruised by the nuke. 
* Obligatory/Daily "Fuck you Code Geass"
* Lie to Nunnally and she blows up a city. Remind me not to get on her bad side.
* I'm surprised Lelouch could repress his Siscon side to say those things to Nunnally
* Someone needs to get me a gif of that Lelouch faceplam
* Can C.C just die already
* Can Nina just die already
* Can everyone but Cornelia just die already

**Episode 23**

* No comment...lets just get this done
* Nina sold out to subway
* I feel like this montage is building up to the boxing match of the year
* O_o Ohgi having a kid?
* Why does anyone even think Lelouch could lose this war? He will just spawn an invincible mech out of nowhere that can insta-win the whole thing
* I want to see Lelouch bury Schneizel's ass so far into the ground he comes out of the other fucking side of planet
* ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!
* The fuck is happening? I thought you played chess? Why haven't you won already?
* Ah...so satisfying see the Black Knights die
* I hate to give credit to Lelouch but I think this scene is fairly good. I remember reading that some tactician (can't remember who) played against a regular chess player and got absolutely destroyed because he went in with the mindset of conserving pieces whereas the chess player would gladly sacrifice them to win the game. This scene just seems to mirror that. Lelouch plays chess and while this is a real battle, because of the Geass dynamic, he is able to act on the same principles he would apply to the game.

**Episode 24**

* Nunnally is simulateously wiping away the sins of thousands of people along with her brother
* Careful there Schneze, you are putting too much faith into Nunnally firing the nukes, you obviously aren't familiar with the 'power of love'

Agreed, and after doing daily rewatches almost continually since the beginning of December I'm going to enjoy a break from all of that. LoGH will have to wait for another time, unfortunately.

Should have seen that coming from you after he had Cornelia shot, I suppose.

Of course! It's obvious if you take into consideration he's the main character and laws of the universe and narrative alike don't apply to him.

To be honest I feel this show is so much carried by Lelouch that if you don't like him and what he's fighting for and constantly rooting for him to win, no matter how ridiculous it happens, you will not become a huge fan of the show. He IS the show.

I get that, I just don't like having to turn my brain off to be able to enjoy something.

> ...you will not become a huge fan of the show. He IS the show.

I'm not the most qualified to talk about this since I didn't enjoy the show but I do imagine there is more to it than that. Granted he still is a big part of it since he didn't win the best guy contest without being popular.
>> ARTICLE
There may be some other part about it. I couldn't tell you why I like the show so much myself. Maybe it's just because I don't think when I watch anime.

Regardless, I'm sorry you took the time to participate this far into the rewatch and didn't end up enjoying it at all. 

What's really odd about my opinion of the show is that I really really loved it a lot but didn't really enjoy the ending.

I guess I really just like fun more than logic in anime. Hell, I enjoy Gurren Lagann more from an inspirational standpoint than satirical one so I suppose I just love the ridiculous.

As far as any real point to Code Geass, I think it has some interesting quotes littered throughout the series that can be good to apply in daily life. I think the main message of the show has something to do with the dangers of vengeance and fighting fire with fire or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
>I told you this show was a trainwreck and not to take any part of it with any sense of reason or logic whatsoever or you'll be disappointed

I find that remark far too one-sided, because many of us do think the show follows its own method to the madness. There is a certain reasoning at work, beneath all the superficial insanity or implausible situations. And the key to understanding it is, precisely, Lelouch himself.  Just blindly liking (or disliking) the character and nothing else does not guarantee that a particular person will (or will not) get it. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you 100%, but remember that /u/Enel- was trying to prep Prince Scorpio himself for this season. For some people you *have* to come off as one-sided.

THEN he uses the time that Schneze sits there and stares at the screen to catch up to him and board the shuttle so he can geass him.

It's unknown how much time he had to set that up. All we see is he runs off somewhere in the fortress, not what he does after that or how much time till we cut to the scene on the shuttle. He also, obviously, took control of a lot of the staff in the fortress. It's not a stretch for him to get all the info about where Schneizel is/where he's headed. Nor is it a stretch for him to have the video set up to play and casually step up at the right time to control Schneizel since he literally had the entire ground crew geassed before they even got to the shuttle.

That said the recorded conversation was over the top. I chalk that up to a rush to wrap up the series. It would have been nice if they built in awkward pauses/interrupts Schneizel at times to show that it wasn't perfect like they did when he pulled the trick with Mao.

As for why go through the trouble? Cause Lelouche is a megalomaniac that loves his theatrics. If he didnt do something dramatic to end his enemies, he wouldn't be Lelouche.

Well...that time was for Suzaku, who has been shown to be essentially superhuman, rather than Lelouch. 

>But Nunnally has the willpower to open her eyes

We know that her blindess is psychological. Like I mentioned the other day, this type of Geass command is not identical to Lelouch's absolute orders. The Emperor rewrote Nunnally's memories of the assassination, which created a trauma that she needed to overcome. 

>You may now feel free to explain to me how all this makes sense because I sure as hell don't understand it.

The short version is we all have different priorities. I tend to care about how the characters interact with each other or how their different ideals contrast and connect.

>Ah...so satisfying see the Black Knights die

Not to mention the destruction of one of Japan's most recognized monuments to bring that about. Lelouch, you cold bastard

To preserve my brain's integrity, I just assume he recorded that waaay in advance, like before the battle even began. If he could predict every one of his moves up to this point, then sure, why not. It's the only theory that keep myself from over-thinking about it
>> ARTICLE
>I hate to give credit to Lelouch but I think this scene is fairly good. I remember reading that some tactician (can't remember who) played against a regular chess player and got absolutely destroyed because he went in with the mindset of conserving pieces whereas the chess player would gladly sacrifice them to win the game. This scene just seems to mirror that. Lelouch plays chess and while this is a real battle, because of the Geass dynamic, he is able to act on the same principles he would apply to the game.

That's Game Theory at play. It's a line of logical reasoning in competition that assumes that both player A and player B are making the best moves possible (as far as their individual intellect can go at least) to win. The counter to this theory is the layman (or pretending to be the layman) that doesn't or can't use the best moves. Since in high level competition, the games are about anticipating your opponent and being a few steps ahead of them,  when you have a guy that makes the worst move all your projections are meaningless and you get pulled into chaos. In this chaos, the layman has a more equal chance to win the game since the superior player gets pulled down to their pace.

Lelouch is really bad against this, and that is why Schneizel is his worst enemy and the Final Boss. They tried to message this back at the Chinese Wedding where Schneizel played chess against Zero. Zero had realized that they're both too good to risk losing and proposed a stalemate. Schneizel made the worst (And certainly illegal) move in putting his King in Check right next to Lelouch's King. This move is Schneizel's whole ideology, and he uses it to fish out Lelouch's as well. 

Schneizel doesn't give a shit about the rules, and he wanted to see if Zero would stick to his honor or become ruthless. Zero couldn't take that dishonor so he ran away like a coward. I don't know if Schneizel knew who Zero was (I'm sure he was on to him but wasn't sure) but he then brings up that Charles would have ruthlessly take the King no matter how low hanging the fruit. Charles doesn't care about the rules either (he actually doesn't care about this entire world). Ironically Schneizel eventually does push Lelouch to become the ruthless person he needs to be by taking everything away from him.

Scenes in this series are extremely understated to say the least.

To be fair, constantly discussing its faults could really drag out the discussions while the show is still airing. I think even the most ardent Geass fans realizes the show isn't perfect and has its plotholes, but to be fair, the show is entertaining because it's not afraid to have some truly outrageous plot-twists even if they may not be perfectly elaborated upon.
>> ARTICLE
This particular show tends to spilt people right down the middle and each individual half can be further divided into even more factions, so that is not surprising.

If you ever want to seriously understand why there are many people who honestly like the series or at least have a more positive outlook about it, all you have to do is read some of the other contributions. There are all kinds of opinions about it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, I've been keeping up with the threads so I sort of see why people like the show, but it seems to more like they are just blinding themselves to its faults. Maybe that's not a very tolerant way to think about it, but I can't help it.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass tends to be one of the first anime people watch, when all the tropes and cliches are still shiny and new. In the same way that I found Death Note fantastically gripping at age 17 and somewhat less so when I rewatched it last year, Code Geass is a series best viewed through rose-tinted glasses.

Still, despite its asspulls and pretensions to cleverness, it never stops being a *fun* show to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Entertainment is indeed the name of the game, as per the staff's stated intentions, but I believe that description falls a little short. The show became ridiculously popular because it was able to appeal to people of all ages, genders and interests. Many other series have tried to do that, of course, but they do not necessarily manage to succeed.

For instance, I was already well over the age of 20 when the show originally aired and have gone back to it multiple times. Do the math. 

To be honest, the experience of rewatching Code Geass has had both positives and negatives for me. You can never hope to replicate the exact mix of anticipation, excitement, frustration, dread, satisfaction, anger, sorrow and all the other emotions the series initially provokes in people the first time through. 

Moreover, there are certainly various aspects that could have been handled better or at least differently. This is quite true. But just as well, revisiting the material also makes me realize what the series has actually done much better than those that followed in its wake. Besides, watching the show with the big picture in mind also helps to clarify a number of things that aren't always obvious at a glance. 

There are certain references and in-jokes that one might not recognize without any knowledge of the mecha genre, other anime productions and even behind-the-scenes information. Such familiarity does not always need to equal additional criticism. Personally, I find such discoveries to be pretty interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
>But just as well, revisiting the material also makes me realize what the series has actually done much better than those that followed in its wake. 

Yeah. I'm thinking back to Valvrave and currently catching up to the end of Aldnoah Zero, and I can say that despite all of Code Geass's faults it's still better than both of those shows by far, and they were in many ways trying to be Code Geass. In fact a *lot* of anime (mecha especially) since Code Geass have tried to be Code Geass, in at least some small part.

It got a lot of stuff wrong, for sure. But it really did get a *lot* of stuff right, or we wouldn't be here (re)watching it.

>There are certain references and in-jokes that one might not recognize without any knowledge of the mecha genre, other anime productions and even behind-the-scenes information.

For example, Jupiter. A lot of the newbies were talking on and on about Jupiter, but it ends up having no real significance (as far as resembling Jupiter). Jupiter has historically appeared in a lot of Sunrise works, and it being in CODE GEASS is a callback to that.

That's called a spoiler... which is unacceptable for any show, and should never happen unless someone wants to be spoiled.

I got what you meant though. I remember the day before we watched the episode where Euphemia was Geassed and started slaughtering Japanese everyone was saying stuff like, "OMG I can't wait for tomorrow's episodes," or "the first-timer's reactions are gonna be great!" Seeing stuff like that clearly warned me that something big was coming up, and it definitely took away a little bit of the excitement.

Yeah, I got a lot of PMs after that episode, stating that they didn't get much excitement because they were expecting something due to the comments in the thread. That's why I'm starting to enforce this. I'll keep on doing this 5 more times until people have the thought in their brains.

/u/Durinthals on to something with Rolos locket, but what?

[Shirley cant cook!](http://www.gfycat.com/UnpleasantSpanishDobermanpinscher) Doesnt matter, Lelouch knows how. He can break an egg with one hand. And Ive finally come around to the way many of you have been thinking Id totally watch a SOL version of this show. I just didnt realize it until now. I want a cook-off!

Yesterdays threads speculation about Geassing the school (or at least the student council) was correct.

Villettas undercover. Good. More answers. They called her my lord. So more questions too. I guess she received a promotion. Not sure why.

[Lelouch is on the horse!](http://i.imgur.com/TEDqXMc.jpg) Is this the only time he does this? I want a polo competition!

If Suzaku took Arthur I just I dont know. What is that cat really up to? I think were all underestimating his importance in all of this.

[Jealous Rivalz.](http://i.imgur.com/nsSGqTb.jpg) And Rolo really selling the little brother act.

Is that locket something strange or is Rolo desiring/falling into a normal life?

Maybe he doesnt want normal since he straight up murdered that guy using his area stop-time bomb.

Seriously. Come on with Kallen. Her image has been too sexual/girly these first few episodes. I know shes still a badass, but whyd they pick her for that role? Why not Milly? And is there anything more to the scene where she walks in on the CC and the Chinese men? Why would it have made more sense for CC to be the bunny girl? Plus Kallen interrupted what looked like an important conversation that couldve revealed more info about Chinas plans.

Oh no! Who will save the prisoners? Or actually, Lelouch might have to let them die if he wants to remain undercover. Eh, there are a few important characters on that chopping block though, so theyll probably be saved.

[My brand](http://i.imgur.com/q3G40kF.jpg)

Youre just picking up a gift, Shirley. Its not a date. Relax.

Family. The way he said it so maybe Rolo does want normalcy.

Cable car awww. Poor Shirley. I thought she was going to point at a Pizza Hut.

Lelouch will have to get CC to kiss everyone so they can get their memories back.

Uncle Chinas pissed. What the hell happened that he just flipped out like that? Earlier he told semi-nude Kallen that he has an interest in the Black Knights.

Overall, it felt like enough happened this episode, but nothing too major. Just a nice, easy episode to watch. Quite nice.

- It convinced me that I want to see another show that focuses only the school.
- The preview for episode four left me wondering how the hell Lelouch escaped being held at gunpoint by Rolo. Does Rolos Geass have limitations (a cooldown, perhaps)?
- Im curious to see what China has planned. What did they want to do before Zero Geassed them?
- And still no Nunnally, so some of the crazier theories from yesterday are still on hold.

Furthermore, I like the *role* Suzakus character has, I just dont like him. I think Britannia [needs](http://www.gfycat.com/CleverAnxiousHog) a [badass](http://www.gfycat.com/MassivePotableChickadee) Knightmare [pilot](http://www.gfycat.com/AcidicWavyAyeaye) or two, but I wouldnt have minded a new character, one of the other Knights of the Round maybe. At this point, Suzakus not doing anything to change things, hes just carrying out orders from the Emperor and killing Britannias enemies. He was told about the thought elevator and Sword of Akasha and whatever else so he should have an idea of Britannias endgame. Hopefully hes working on something to prevent that or I still think its possible he was Geassed by VV or the Emperor.

Don't worry. She will come back as a complete badass that is ~~indoctrinated~~ educated by Charles Zi Britannia himself.

> Why would it have made more sense for CC to be the bunny girl?

Kallen was likely just embarrassed that Lelouch had to see her like that. Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR8lqv7jTl8

Same for the whole whole "Lelouch will have to get CC to kiss everyone so they can get their memories back" thing.

I need to write a little more to better get my point across from now on.

I didn't think that was a serious question from Kallen. Obviously it was a dumb question formed from embarrassment. I just didn't like how it was used to have Kallen charge into a room with just a towel on and interrupt an important conversation.

Turn 3

* I wonder if Zeros helmet is just like something you can pick up in any corner motor shop, a la Ghostface from Scream.

* Keeping with the Scream vibe, Lelouch is playing the classic, Its not me; it just so happens that someone has a voice-changer that can make them sound exactly like me!

* Calling in front of Viletta to use her as your own unwitting backup. Clever, ~~girl~~ boy.

* [Look at him in this shot!](http://i.imgur.com/CClKi7b.jpg) Hes so tall and thin he almost puts Viletta to shame!

* Theres that [locket](http://i.imgur.com/fMvP9s7.jpg) I forgot to mention yesterday. And, Rolo, why is your business finished? Even if the Zero is just an imposter, isn't it still your job to take him out? Like, crush the resistance before it starts kind of thing?

* Wounded Viceroy. I wonder if they were told to say that, or if they really are just as in the dark as everyone else, kind of like the government in The Giver.

* [I've always wondered how C.C. is able to so perfectly fit her hair inside that helmet.](http://webm.land/media/uSZA.webm)

* As much as I love you, C.C., Kallen does have a point. By just telling the Black Knights who he was and what he was capable of, he would have likely gotten the same amount of support but without the whole mess of, YOU LIED ABOUT NOT BEING YOU! YOU HAVE THIS EXTREMELY UNETHICAL POWER THAT YOU HID FROM US! and blah, blah, blah. At least tell Diethard. You could have gotten him on your side in like two seconds if he knew about that. (Instead of five seconds.)

* I can't do this by myself! I love how Lelouch is able to command an entire resistance army almost single-handedly, but the pressures of making a meal for foods class is too much. In fact, its for scenes like this that I really don't mind the filler or cooldown episodes. The show can make for one pretty damn funny slice-of-life anime when it wants to be. But, I suppose if you want to watch a full-on SoL staring JYB you could just watch Toradora.

* [Awwwww](http://i.imgur.com/BWShg24.jpg)

* Oh, if my Lulus been killed! I have to admit, it was nice of Charles to give Lelouch his old girlfriend back, and he didnt even remind her that Lelouch killed her dad.

* Not that I mind your dirty hands on my mouth, but Have I mentioned how much I fucking love Milly? Like, the girl knows her audience.

* So, did they just build this secret, underground hide-out just for the purpose of watching Lelouch, or was it there the whole time for the Ashford family to use to indulge their peeping fetish?

* Just want to take a moment here to point out Rolos real last name is Haliburton. Take that as you will.

* I wonder if maybe Charles used his Geass to give all his underlings memories of extreme torture whenever they were given an order and didnt respond, Yes, my lord. Either that or they just really were tortured.

* [HOLY SHIT, LELOUCH IS ON A HORSE!](http://i.imgur.com/et1qF7Y.jpg) This is not a drill! Lelouch is on a horse outside the OP!

* [I see they didnt bother going back and changing the mind-locking visual to the new one.](http://webm.land/media/toER.webm) Lazies.

* Hes only one Knight! You seem to have forgotten his armor is made out of plot, so you guys are pretty much all fucked.

* Theres Schneizel! This guy has got to be the epitome of a gent'leman in anime, and I fucking love him for it.

* [Milly knew this was the only chance Rivalz was ever gonna get to pretend a girl could like him.](http://i.imgur.com/Kphwwb4.jpg)

* Lelouch actually not lying about his cell phone not working.

* Well, who says he couldn't happen to share the same birthday as your sister? Ya prejudiced dick.

* [Gosh, this poor kid is lonely. Hed prefer a feminine original gift over a replacement one just because Lelouch gave it to him.](http://webm.land/media/2N9K.webm) And, you assigned *this* guy to be his assassin should he ever regain his memories?

* Why exactly are they meeting [down there](http://i.imgur.com/Ihk5hUQ.jpg) instead of in the observation room? Do they just happen to know its symbolic to where Nunnally was held hostage or something?

* [Here it is finally revealed what Rolos Geass is:](http://webm.land/media/9e65.webm) The ability to freeze people in time, which explains why his Knightmare appeared to be teleporting when he was fighting Lelouch and the others. Also, hes quick on the kill. Even Viletta wasn't that fast to condemn the guy to death. However, since she doesn't actually have Geass I can see why he would be the one more at risk if someone were to find out.

* Yes, Kallen He really is Zero. He was in fact the first person you suspected as Zero. Now, please put some clothes on.

* I wonder if one of the rituals a person has to go through to become an Ambassador in China is to be castrated.

* [See, Kallen, this is what happens when you dont heed my advice.](http://webm.land/media/7KTx.webm) However, I do fucking adore how nonchalantly C.C. just says shes Zero.

* They wouldn't. I'm honestly surprised they haven't already. /u/rascorpia had a fair point earlier. They're all traitors, and after an entire year its pretty obvious you've gotten all the information out of them that youre gonna get. So, I'm not sure why they saved them as bait, unless somehow they expected this to happen.

* Shirley is just so wide-eyed and innocent. Who couldnt love [this face?](http://i.imgur.com/LDnNRrg.jpg)

* Was Rivalz just standing outside praying that something would happen in there between Lelouch and Shirley?

* I actually completely blanked on the fact that he didn't have Geass in his left eye in that scene.

* Wow, Rolo, could you at least *try* to come off less suspicious? Or at least less desperate?

* HOLY SHIT! [A PIZZA HUT IN A PLACE YOU COULD ACTUALLY IMAGINE A PIZZA HUT BEING!](http://i.imgur.com/jNKFtLR.jpg)

* Lol. Shirley actually trying to force them into having a date. I love it.

* The Society of Research of Male/Female Dating, or as Milly likes to call it Boring.

* Interesting how it seems Lelouchs Geass can make a person do something even if he hasn't yet specified what it is he wants them to do.

* Shirley, you creeper. But, dont stop.

* My fault Shirleys memories were wiped. Still say you could have just wiped her mind of the whole Mao captured you and I killed your father thing. Still, I suppose that doesn't make much of a difference now, anyway.

* Shirley, could you pretend I'm in here for a while?

* * How do you plan on getting out with no one seeing?

* * I heard from a very reliable source that the back wall to this one leads to the female side.

* * 

* * What?

* But, seriously, how did he manage to sneak out of there?

* I love how they immediately assume its the Black Knights and not just like a fire or something.

* And, thats just one easy way to cause panic. Why so simple, Lelouch? Why not put months of effort and planning into pouring hallucinogenic inhalants into the citys water supply, and then use a microwave device that somehow doesn't pass through human skin to vaporize it, all the while hoping no one uses the water to make tea or take hot showers?

* How did Lelouch know where to go to find the secret room? Or how to get in? Or even that there was one? Im just gonna guess part of his instructions when Geassing that one spy following him was, Tell me everything you about how Im being monitored.

* Just as I thought, your top priority was the capture of C.C., no matter how wrong the information is that you get. This I think pretty much completely confirms that either the red-iris thing is only for the audiences benefit, or can only be seen by those with Geass/Code. Cause if not, then Viletta just must have a bad case of colorblindness.

* And, now Lelouch fucked himself over by monologuing. Glad to see that not only the villains succumb to this hubris.

* And, for some reason Li Xingke is majorly pissed at the Black Knights. Must have heard that they ripped their name and everything else off from Batman.

Thats it for todays episode. Looking forward to tomorrow!

I think it's like Kirihara said/thought at the SAZ last season that most people wouldn't accept that a Prince is a rebel leader.  Especially after his disappearing act at the black rebellion, they'd just think he was messing with them.

Well actually the ambassador is a [Eunuch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch) so it actually kinda comes with the territory.

Knowledge of geass is extremely privileged information so meeting outside of an area where people usually are decreases the chances of someone overhearing them.

I forget, was it advertised in the military (or anywhere) that Zero was actually dead? Or did he just vanish and a lot of people assumed the died?

> Interesting how it seems Lelouchs Geass can make a person do something even if he hasn't yet specified what it is he wants them to do.

I think he just laid out everything in one go. "At X time you'll go over and hit the fire alarm, and if anyone asks afterward you'll tell them this thing..." Unless I missed some other piece to it.

> I love how they immediately assume its the Black Knights and not just like a fire or something.

Lelouch had called in a bomb threat that had a coded announcement for terrorists broadcast, so when the fire alarm went off I'm not surprised that some of the people (I'm assuming employees that recognized the announcement) jumped to that conclusion and panicked.

> Why not put months of effort and planning into pouring hallucinogenic inhalants into the citys water supply, and then use a microwave device that somehow doesn't pass through human skin to vaporize it, all the while hoping no one uses the water to make tea or take hot showers?

At first I thought that said "Boning".  But then I noticed.  Did you mean Nina?  Or are they both of the yuri persuasion?  If so, how are they not already a couple?

>Interesting how it seems Lelouchs Geass can make a person do something even if he hasn't yet specified what it is he wants them to do.

Just a simple "become my slave" type command, I would guess.

I thought he was referring to Charles' wipe, not his own.

>I love how they immediately assume its the Black Knights and not just like a fire or something.

The people who worked there knew the P.A. code ("Paging Mr. Maximillian from the Hakodate settlement") for a terrorist warning.  When the alarm went off, the shop people panicked, and the customers just followed suit.

>And, thats just one easy way to cause panic. Why so simple, Lelouch?

To be fair, he had no idea Rolo had Geass, much less its nature.  He may have even had plans to do something with Rolo to further a scheme, which just sniping him in the head would have precluded.

I hope I'm not remembering wrong, but didn't Diethard have a strong suspicion that Lelouch had some sort of power. Villetta and Jeremiah went to him early on in the show, and Zero's actions after that sort of confirmed for Diethard that something unnatural was going on with him. Well, I guess Lelouch didn't know about his suspicions, but Diethard still kind of knew.

> My fault Shirleys memories were wiped. Still say you could have just wiped her mind of the whole Mao captured you and I killed your father thing.

Thinking about it now, maybe he didn't want to deal with Shirley anymore. If all he did was erase her knowledge of him as Zero, killing her father, and the Mao incident, Shirley would still likely have feelings for him. Lelouch knew about that after finding the photos and stuff in her room. So Shirley would still follow him around and try to be friendly/romantic with him. He probably didn't want to be constantly reminded of the things he put her through so he pushed her as far away as possible. It may have been selfish at the time, but now he's realizing he may not have had to go that far.

>> ARTICLE
Wanna start this one off by saying this new opening is sick. The way the visuals work with the song flows so well, and the vocal effects are really wicked.

Lelouch using CC as his double for Zero. Another brilliant move. I love when CC walks into the room and teases Kallen about how she's upset about not being filled in on the inside plans. She just loves to mess with people, that witch =)

Anyways, I also really enjoyed the slice of life portions that make their way into the show. A lot of people say they're out of place but I disagree. The slice of life portions of the show really define Lelouch, instead of him being Zero all the time. I really appreciate the time Lelouch spends with his friends, living an ordinary life, instead of being the leader of the most powerful terrorist group. 

I also find it hilarious how Lelouch sets his sights to manipulate Rolo as his pawn the second he sees him. His whole inner monologue, talking about the danger he's in, and how careful he has to be, is also really cool. Honestly, it's just a testament to his ability. He's constantly thinking about the position he's in, gauging his enemy, and constantly making plans to advance. 

Lelouch's smug face when Rolo walks into the room is pretty hysterical. He holds so much disdain for him, and I don't even think it's because he's been fooled for so long about Rolo. I think it's mostly the fact that Rolo, some random guy, was designated to replace Lelouch's precious Nunnally. So it's kind of more like a "how dare he try to replace her" thing to me. Even now, Lelouch still holds Nunnally as the most precious thing to him, which is important. 

Shirley's pointing at the cabal car was surprisingly sad. The song (Masquerade) is the same one that played when Lelouch was erasing Shirley's memory, and I remember just being so upset that entire day. I think that was the first time I cried watching the show. I feel it's also real important to note Lelouch's reaction to the memory of the cabal ride, and how terrible he feels about it. At this point, Lelouch is blaming himself for everything bad that happens to his friends. It amazes me that people call Lelouch a sociopath, he very clearly feels terrible about all the wrongs he's done, and wants to fix it all in the end. 

People argue that Lelouch is fighting only for himself or Nunnally, and that it's completely selfish. In the beginning of the show, I would agree, but by this point in the series I think it's obvious that Lelouch's battle has extended. He's gotten too many people involved, and he knows it. Lelouch now realizes the weight of the lives which have been affected by his battle. I think it's safe to say that Lelouch's battle has changed from Nunnally, to himself, to his friends. And I feel this is really important later into the series.

Lelouch walking in the middle of a panicking crowd with his maniacal laughter is just wicked. "And *that* is how you cause a panic." 

I find it pretty interesting that Rolo calls Lelouch's eye a devilish eye, despite the fact that he himself has a Geass. I assume it's probably due to the power that Lelouch's geass in particular holds, since he practically has Charles' geass of changing memories as well.

> It amazes me that people call Lelouch a sociopath, he very clearly feels terrible about all the wrongs he's done, and wants to fix it all in the end. 

Because thoughts like "I'll completely wipe myself from my friend's memory" shouldn't be occurring to him in the first place, much less as something he acts on. Wanting to make amends afterward doesn't negate what he did.

>  I think it's safe to say that Lelouch's battle has changed from Nunnally, to himself, to his friends. And I feel this is really important later into the series.

After the beginning of this season *maybe* but he has yet to prove it to me. Kallen's still mostly in the dark and she's the closest ally he has aside from CC.
>> ARTICLE
> shouldn't be occurring to him in the first place, much less as something he acts on.

For real? Lelouch attempted to erase himself from Shirley's memories because he didn't want to get her involved. That seems like a pretty logical thought process: erase myself from her, she won't get near me again. What he did was completely to save her from the tides of pain that never fails to crash around Lelouch. Also, Shirley was aware of his existence as Zero. Consider the amount of emotional trauma that Shirley faced knowing that Lelouch, the person she loves the most, was the one who caused the death of her father. Do you think, that with her memory intact, she would've progressed as a sane person? The few days she had her memory she was already tearing herself apart. What Lelouch did was the right move.. and he didn't want to do it, either. He was incredibly hurt, even more so than Shirley, but Lelouch didn't have the luxury of forgetting about the incident.

> After the beginning of this season maybe but he has yet to prove it to me. Kallen's still mostly in the dark and she's the closest ally he has aside from CC.

I don't know man, the look on his face was pretty telling once Shirley mentioned the cabal car. He's constantly blaming himself for any negative thing that happens. He feels terrible about what's happened with Shirley, the Prez, and Rivalz, and he even states that "He can't let things go on like this." At this point the safety and sanctity of his friends / friendship is a huge factor in his battles.
>> ARTICLE
> That seems like a pretty logical thought process: erase myself from her, she won't get near me again.

Except he forgot about every single person that knows both of them would eventually lead to her questioning why she doesn't remember a person that she's apparently been friends with for years. Leaving a giant hole in her life like that when she still sees him nearly every day is only asking for trouble. I ranted about that already in the thread after it happened though.

And if he doesn't want to get Shirley and the others involved? Leave the school entirely. I can understand that he didn't do it before because of Nunnally, but now that she's out of the picture he's only endangering the other students by staying there.
>> ARTICLE
> eventually lead to her questioning why she doesn't remember a person that she's apparently been friends with for years.

Well, that wasn't really an issue, as we saw in Season 1. People just thought she was joking around and the question didn't really come across her. 

> Leaving a giant hole in her life like that when she still sees him nearly every day is only asking for trouble. 

I agree. But erasing her memories is completely the lesser of two evils. It's not even evil, considering what happened to her, it's a gift. Objectively, a portion of Shirley's past is a lot less significant than her entire future. Again, think of the repercussions of her having the memories. She'd be consistently suspicious, and she'd probably get deeper involved into the mess, trying to help Lelouch out, etc. It already lead her to shooting Villetta, who knows what kind of trouble she could've gotten herself in? Also, again, the emotional trauma that Shirley would have knowing that the person she loves killed her father would be unbearable, especially for someone like Shirley. It'd lead her down a path of self destruction. Even though it may seem messed up, I firmly and completely believe that erasing her memories was the right thing to do. He was trying to guarantee her safety, and release her from the burden of knowing Zero's real identity. 

> Leave the school entirely. I can understand that he didn't do it before because of Nunnally, but now that she's out of the picture he's only endangering the other students by staying there.

Still not an option. He's under 24/7 surveillance, that would be an instant red flag that Lelouch is Zero.

Still a dumb risk to take in my opinion.

That's where we have our fundamental disagreement, and it just occurred to me... Altering and erasing memories like that is anathema to me and that's a core reason of why I dislike Lelouch as a whole.

> Still not an option. He's under 24/7 surveillance, that would be an instant red flag that Lelouch is Zero.

Suzaku (and thus the Emperor and whoever he wants to tell) knows that he's Zero. The only reason it's not widely known is that Lelouch is still being used as bait for CC.

That's also assuming Lelouch escapes from Rolo and silences him one way or another before anyone else finds out, which is exactly what's going to happen. Can't get rid of those school scenes yet.
>> ARTICLE
> Suzaku (and thus the Emperor and whoever he wants to tell) knows that he's Zero. The only reason it's not widely known is that Lelouch is still being used as bait for CC.

I phrased that incorrectly. Lelouch disappearing from school would practically be revealing to Brittania that Lelouch's memories have awakened, and the emperor could put Nunnally in danger to get Lelouch to submit.

I'm glad the school scenes aren't removed. They add a lot to the show and I enjoy them. 

Also, the entire surveillance system that's monitoring Lelouch knows he's Zero. Only a select few know about geass.

A recent full rewatch of the series (I fucked up on restraining myself -- I also wanted to get my roommate through it pretty quick) made me truly appreciate just how many different fronts Lelouch puts up. I spent the rewatch trying to pinpoint which parts are more "him" and which parts are the ones he emphasizes for each role. There's a bit of his base personality in each of them, but how they bleed together once things get ugly makes him a wonderful character to analyze.

He's got so many contradictions to him in part due to how he's compartmentalized certain aspects of himself, but that just makes me more interested in figuring out how he works.

[MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR R2 Episode 21 spoilers!](/s "His ascension to the throne while wearing his Ashford uniform was a really interesting choice. At that point he's been forced to toss away the Zero persona and Nunnally isn't around so he isn't pushing the overprotective big brother aspect of himself. I would venture to guess that at least some part of him chose the uniform that ties him more to the friends he has at Ashford and the happy slice-of-life times he had there and why he's doing what he's about to do.")
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, a theme of Lelouch's is how his face grows to fit the mask. At the beginning, his Zero persona is an act, just an excuse to hide his true vengeful intentions as the discarded prince of the Empire (hence how he essentially abandons everything during the Black Rebellion when his true goal gets compromised). [S2](#s "By the end, especially after the FLEIJA incident, even though Lelouch ends up discarding the mask and identity of Zero, you could argue that as Emperor he has become more Zero than ever before. As Suzaku put it, he was turning his lies into reality.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah after watching R2 episode 2 for the rewatch... i watched the entire show in one sitting. Whoops...

There were a lot of little things I noticed this time that I had missed before, such as some of the faces that Lelouch makes when talking to certain people, most notably Kallen, Rolo, and Suzaku. You can tell he constantly has a lot weighing on his mind and although he doesn't have many monologues regarding his feelings, it's easy to tell that he certainly is not a sociopath
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah -- one of the parts of Lelouch that makes me like him so much is that everything ends up weighing on him. His losses, his fuckups, etc... he doesn't brush them off at all. Even if he acts in a manner to keep his plans moving along, you can see everything wearing down on him like [R2 Episode 7](/s "him going into the ghettos and almost using Refrain") and [R2 Episode 14 to the end of series](/s "his increasing deathwish after having lost Euphemia, Shirley, Nunnally -- for a time, Rollo, The Black Knights, etc.. He goes to confront the Emperor fully believing it to be his final action and aiming for a blaze of glory. It takes a hell of a ton of despair and self-loathing to have gone forward with a plan such as Zero Requiem.")

> Lelouch: Don't let yourself be destroyed as Clovis did. With our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to Britannia.

> Charles zi Britannia: You like my new contacts?

Couple things first:

* I'm amused that out of the three first-time viewers that have been prolific writers from early on, you have /r/rascorpia firmly on Britannia's side, /u/Neawia firmly on Lelouch's side, and me in the middle: I like the rebellion but hate Lelouch personally. I appreciate what he's doing for the rebellion as Zero but that's the extent of it. I don't necessarily agree with Suzaku but I like him anyway.

* Also a question for the audience: can normal people see when a Geass eye is active? Lelouch noticed when Charles activated his, but would your average person see it? That also goes for a person who's currently controlled by a Geass, is the red eye thing just a visual effect for the viewers? Not sure if that will ever be relevant later, I'm just curious.

---
What is it with Lelouch riding a horse in the OP? He never does it in the show.

I think the Chinese Federation might have something to say about Zero annexing their room, but for now I'm sure they're more concerned with Britannia.

Apparently Rolo *doesn't* know that Lelouch is Zero. And yep, he's the one with the locket. I'm tempted to look and see if Marianne was wearing that sometime in the past.

Nice planning there with having a solid alibi while Zero was giving the speech, I'll admit.

Poor Shirley. I wonder if she has any memory of Lelouch as Zero. Probably not if she doesn't remember Nunnally at all.

Yep, Villetta's observing for the military as ~~I~~ everyone suspected. So they know that he has Geass but not that he's Zero? Something seems off about that considering Suzaku and the Emperor know.

Not sure how Lelouch has control of his Geass now. At least he remembers he used it on Villetta. Locket's from Lelouch and is... probably Nunnally's?

Localized time stop for a Geass? That's gonna be annoying to deal with. Oh Kallen, at least put some clothes on before charging into a room.

Ooh, contacts to block the permanent Geass, makes sense but I'm miffed that CC asks him to stop digging into the mechanics of the ability. I was joking in the recap (I write those before I start the next episode) but it's hilarious whenever I accidentally stumble on something relevant.

Okay, Shirley definitely has no clue that he's Zero, otherwise she wouldn't be trying to date him again. ...damn cable car. I still haven't forgiven Lelouch for that.

Blah blah slip the tails, turn the table on Rolo. Except he doesn't know that Rolo has his own Geass. Wonder what kind of restrictions Rolo has, like frequency of use. It seemed like Villetta was well aware of it so she was probably hit by it before.

Huh, the Chinese swordsman is out to destroy the Black Knights on his own. Another player enters the game.

[Wild speculation turn 3](/s "Lelouch manages to use his Geass on Rolo and orders him to never use his own Geass again. Eventually it turns on permanently on its own and Rolo is stuck in a permanent bubble of frozen people wherever he goes, before Lelouch's Geass forces him to kill himself. Villetta realizes she still has feelings for gi and helps Zero rescue him but withdraws from the fighting afterward to live as a civilian.")

> What is it with Lelouch riding a horse in the OP? He never does it in the show

I find this kinda funny especially since the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that physical activities, like riding a horse, are really not a strong suit for him.

> So they know that he has Geass but not that he's Zero?

They know he *was* Zero, but they don't know if he's this Zero.  That's the funny thing about being a masked symbol it really can be anyone under there as long as they represent the same ideals.  Also, only Rolo and Viletta know about Geass because it's privileged information.

>What is it with Lelouch riding a horse in the OP? He never does it in the show.

> I like the rebellion but hate Lelouch personally.

Huh. That's pretty interesting. Could you shed some light on as to why you dislike Lelouch?

> can normal people see when a Geass eye is active? Lelouch noticed when Charles activated his, but would your average person see it?

If Lelouch can see it then I'm pretty sure most average people can see it, it's a matter of if they're aware of it afterwards. When people are influenced by Geass (I'm basing this off of what we've seen from Charles and Lelouch) they have no recollection of their actions afterwards, or slightly before the Geass was activated. Lelouch can recall what happened with Charles because his memory was restored, which is why he can remember that he saw Charles' geass activate. So I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, people can see geass, but they're not aware of it because it activates so quick, and they forget about it afterwards. Charles had held his geass for a long time, which is probably why Lelouch was able to spot it at the moment.

> What is it with Lelouch riding a horse in the OP? He never does it in the show.

He does in this episode. Basically, I think what the OP is trying to portray by having Lelouch on the horse is to compare him to a Prince Charming, savior type figure. He's heroic, and the show is trying to portray him as such, even through the op. He's the shooting star, the knight on a horse riding to save the day basically.

> Nice planning there with having a solid alibi while Zero was giving the speech, I'll admit.

Isn't he a genius? =D

> So they know that he has Geass but not that he's Zero? Something seems off about that considering Suzaku and the Emperor know.

Not sure what you mean? Villetta and Rolo are both aware of Lelouch's geass, along with the fact that Lelouch is Zero. As Rolo states this episode, they're the only two in the Tokyo district who're permitted to know. At the beginning of the show, they're not aware that his geass has reawakened or the fact that his memories have. Rolo is aware by the end.

> damn cable car. I still haven't forgiven Lelouch for that.

That scene was heart breaking for me. I remember the first time I watched it, I was upset all day. I actually cried too. =(
>> ARTICLE
> Could you shed some light on as to why you dislike Lelouch?

I mentioned it in a different reply to you but for everyone's benefit: altering and erasing memories generally falls under the "fate worse than death" umbrella for me. I can't really explain why, it's a personal thing. That's a core component of why I dislike him.

Looking back at the previous posts, I was on Lelouch's side right until he wiped Shirley's memories at the end of episode 14.

> Villetta and Rolo are both aware of Lelouch's geass, along with the fact that Lelouch is Zero. As Rolo states this episode, they're the only two in the Tokyo district who're permitted to know.

That's something I was confused about through the episode, so that explains things.

Edit: Wait... when Rolo charges into the surveillance room at the end of the episode he explicitly asks for his brother. How many people know that he isn't? Does he even know that? I mean, Charles could have Geassed all of them as well. Now I can't believe anyone's memories of anything.
>> ARTICLE
What choice did Lelouch have? If he hadn't erased her memories, she would have likely been so psychologically broken that she would have either slipped and given up that she knows about Geass/Lelouch being Zero, resulting in likely their deaths, or gone and tried to kill him herself, which Lelouch would never have been able to fight against, as he loves her too much.
>> ARTICLE
If this show has taught me anything it's that Lelouch can find creative ways to solve problems. That was not one of them.

It's clear that I'm by myself about this matter though so I'll shut up about it.
>> ARTICLE
> It's clear that I'm by myself about this matter

Not true. I'm with you, I just didn't have the chance to really jump in on this comment chain.

I think Lelouch went too far with erasing Shirley's memories. It was a decision he made on the spot without enough thought. He could have erased only vital information, and had her go back to living a normal life at the academy. Lelouch would still have to live with what he did to her, but that's his problem. Shirley wouldn't have knowledge of Zero, who killed her father, or the incident with Mao. As messed up as some might say it is, she would have been at peace or as close to peace as she could get. If she still happened to find her letter to Lelouch about him being Zero, so be it. That would've played out more or less the same.

Instead, Lelouch completely wipes her memory of him, and then allows her to go walk around campus. Was he really planning that their friends would believe that Shirley was pretending to not know Lelouch? He told them they had a spat. Why would nobody question Shirley as to what they were fighting about? Lelouch put no further effort into that crisis after that point.

I like Lelouch, but that was an awful plan.
>> ARTICLE
No, you're right in that he definitely could have done a little better there and come up with some alternatives.  Unfortunately, I think all of them do involve making her forget some important things at a minimum.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he kinda didnt have a choice. It's likely that if Shirley stayed like that and slipped about knowing Geass people may have came after him and hunted her. Also It's better for her to forget about Lelouch, who both have feelings for each other, than go to school, hang out and have a huge crush on the man who killed her father, which would probably fuck up her personality so bad.
>> ARTICLE
> Well, he kinda didnt have a choice.

He held her in place and erased her entire memory of him while she was shouting for him to stop. Mao already left, there was no imminent danger. And you're saying there's *nothing* else he could have done, this master strategist? He didn't even sit and think and try to reason with her for a minute even though she was in shock, just "nope, you gotta go" right there.
>> ARTICLE
He is a master strategist, not a magician or a psychologist. What would you prefer him to do? Just not do anything about it, having Shirley live rest of her life knowing that she is in love with the man that killed his father? Would it be okay for her to live knowing that the man she is in love with not only caused her father's death, but is also head of a rebellion, can die at any given moment, and is probably going to be responsible for many more deaths?

Was there *nothing* else Lelouch could do? Maybe. But what he did, at least in my opinion, is a lot preferable to just leaving her like that, forcing her to live with guilt and agony.
>> ARTICLE
...maybe *ask* her if she wants to carry any of that with her? He didn't give her the option.
>> ARTICLE
But that might be too much of a risk in the future, while at the same time being extremely taxing on her state of mind. 
Lelouch refuses to use his Geass on his friends (as demonstrated with how reluctantly he geassed Suzaku) but if he personally thinks that the best course of action would be a Geass command he would still do it.

Having Shirley out of the picture not only keeps his identity safe but more importantly for him, it keeps her safe as well. There's no telling what a emotionally unstable girl might try to do if a stressful situation would occur. Making her forget about him isn't the most humane solution, but in theory it ensures her safety and doesn't hinder her at anything in her normal life.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is Shirley loves Lelouch. She would be hesitant to say or tell Lelouch anything that'll hurt him. It was likely that Shirley would just not tell Lelouch the truth to not Lelouch worry about him. Also again, Shirley loves Lelouch. If she were to know Lelouch was Zero, It was likely for her to attempt to help Lelouch and eventually wound up getting in danger. 

Also Lelouch is kinda flawed at social stuff and is a flawed person in general, which imo at least makes his character feel more realistic unlike a lot of characters along this line that are insanely OP.
>> ARTICLE
Only the students in Ashford Academy had their memories tampered with to believe that Rolo is Lelouch's brother. Villetta and the Brittanian units that are aware that Lelouch is Zero know that Rolo isn't actually his brother. When Rolo asks for his brother, he probably said it like that because of his own personal attachment or just to say it like that.
>> ARTICLE
Probably helps him stay in character not to have to think about switching back and forth between calling him "my brother" and "Lelouch"/"Zero"/"the target"/whatever.

- I just noticed that the blond Knight dude's Knightmare is transformable in the OP. That's pretty cool, but the color scheme makes it look like a toy.  
- Is Lelouch ever actually going to ride a horse? This is the second OP we've seen him doing it in.  
- Lulu got the drop on Rolo. Aw shit, that's Spike Spencer, isn't it? Rolo has no idea wtf is going on. Zero on tape = CC with a prerecorded speech? Wouldn't be the first time Lulu's pulled that after Kallen in the shower in R1.  
- Yup.  
- Kallen's really not happy with that, is she? I kind of don't blame her, after learning she'd been deceived by Zero/Lelouch for a whole season, another trick is probably just piling on to the uncertainty.  
- Shirley is not a very good cook. I like Milly and Rivalz teasing Lelouch (and Shirley). Student Council shenanigans are adorable; there should be a slice-of-life show set at Ashford.   
- So Charles DID Geass the whole school.    
- Aha, I was right yesterday, Viletta IS just an undercover observer, she hasn't been Geassed.  
- Interesting that the priority seems to be CC, and not Zero.  
- I'm so torn. On the one hand, Suzaku kicking ass is really fun. On the other hand, the giant red backpack ruins the awesome sleek design of the Lancelot. :(  
- Did they Geass out memories of Nina, too? And Suzaku?    
- Lelouch and Rolo trying to out-gambit the other is a really fun scene. Interesting that Rolo, who I'm presuming is just a Britannian agent, is so protective of the locket?     
- Aaaaaaaaand he's a stone-cold killer even of his own allies. Holy shit, Rolo, you're fucking creepy.    
- Why do you still have the bunny suit, Kallen?   
- JFC, Kallen, put on some fucking clothes if you're going to go meet the fucking Chinese ambassador.  
- Aw shit, public execution time. That closeup on Viletta's face makes me wonder; does she have any feelings for Ohgi?   
- Oh, I'd forgotten that he can't turn off his Geass. The contact lens explains it, though.  
- I kind of love that Rivalz and Milly are following them becauas LOL DATE and Rolo is following them because IS HE ZERO   
- Lelouch there is no fucking way you can take a contact in and out that quickly.   
- Shirley you look like a vocaloid with those headphones on.   
- OK wait. So the trailer guy clearly saw Lelouch come out of the store in his new clothes trying to not catch attention. How is that not instantly rocketing up suspicion??   
- Well played, Lelouch.   
- Better played, Rolo.   
- Oh. And.... the Chinese bodyguard dude is now turning on them. Okay, I have no idea what's going on anymore.

Prediction: Lelouch somehow convinces Rolo to get on his side, because I can't think of any way he actually defeats that Geass. He rescues the Black Knights by mass time stopping all of the Britannians.

Agreed, and that's undoubtedly the order from Charles himself. Which makes me wonder if Charles also implanted some kind of trigger in Lelouch to bring him back under control if necessary, or if he can *only* alter memories. Which would also be interesting as Lelouch would have a superset of Charles's abilities, aside from maybe using it repeatedly.

> Did they Geass out memories of Nina, too? And Suzaku?

They're [unpeople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Newspeak_words#Unperson) to the school. Interesting that Nina's one, I'm wondering what happened with her during the rebellion.

> Shirley you look like a vocaloid with those headphones on.

I'm perfectly okay with that.
>> ARTICLE
The more I think about it, there's no way they'd be able to completely remove Suzaku. If he's one of the Knights, where even his enemies know him when he show up as the WHITE DEATH OF BRITANNIA, he's probably in the news all the time.

So if anything they probably just made them forget he went to school there, but they didn't unperson him.

Okay, so I'm a little late. Just started watching today after finishing the first season a year ago, but I don't remember if Lelouch ever had a younger brother. Also after watching the first episode, I'm getting a lot of Aldnoah S2 vibes from this. You know, everything back to status quo, like last season's explosive finale never happened, and Lelouch suddenly has a younger brother out of the blue with no intro, just like Asseylum-hime suddenly had a sister in a wheelchair. Hope it doesn't go the way of AZ, i.e. down the drain.

Will update thoughts after watching second episode.
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah and Captain Earth were two Mecha series from last year that ended up sorely disappointing me since they both kinda felt like they were going through the motions of what was expected from a Mecha show (and in AZ's case, the general structure of an Urobuchi story, without the weight behind it)

I'm of the mindset of: if you're gonna do Mech you can't be shy about hamming it up since you're already starting at giant robots. Gonna do a serious main character? Then make him go through fire and brimstone to win the day -- or not. Gonna do silly? THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. I say that Geass does perfectly well in maintaining the ham and cheese needed to push the series along. In fact, sometimes it feels like it goes overboard on it.

Thing that annoyed me the most about AZ though was that no one seemed to learn a lesson/met consequences (except Slaine). Inaho never really met trouble in battle and Asseylum's idealism was never really challenged. I can deal with idealistic characters, but I want to see them crawl through hell and still be able to stand tall and declare it. I ended up really liking Geass as a whole because of how you can see characters' ideals cracking and for some of them their sanity slipping as they try to deal with some pretty big events. The weight of their actions don't feel insignificant.
>> ARTICLE
> Hope it doesn't go the way of AZ, i.e. down the drain.

It's more like Aldnoah tried to become as commercially successful as Geass so they tried to do the same but didn't accomplish anything in the end.

Yep, I'm feeling the same way. At least here you can handwave half of these things as plausible with the liberal use of Geass.

Not much to say today. More shows currently airing have new episodes. I'm contemplating starting a few more shows too. I'm not sure I know where the limit is anymore. Next thing I know I'll have 1000 shows in my currently watching list. I do actually get there eventually though so I'm not *that bad*.

**Episode 3**

* Leouch that isn't Lelouch but is Lelouch is playing basketball? Cool.
* Guess that means he has the emperors eye
* Lelouch has become confidently able to control his eye again. No particular reason why as of yet though.
* I thought they already established Lelouch is Zero and C.C just fills in for him every now and then. Why is everybody questioning it again. 
* And why do they think he hasn't regained his memories? How else do you think he got out that building without questioning anything that went on? He just walked out the building and went back to school? Didn't call his brother in a panic and sob over the phone? Nope. He just showed up a school like being trapped in a terrorist situation is no big deal and you think that he hasn't regained his memories?!? Damn you guys are naive
* Woah, he actually was on a horse this season.
*  Rolo is cold yo
* Cool ability though
* Goddamn Code Geass
* Why do you have go and take a character with some potential and turn her into a generic fanservice character
* Also, you'd think that if the rebellion got/almost got their hands on Lelouch again then you wouldn't let him out the house. Heck why not just kill him already.
* So he uses contact lenses to cover the eye? Seems smart, although I wouldn't have thought something as simple as that would stop the geass.
* So they are 'special' lenses then. Bit of a lame explanation but whatever
* My name is Lelouch and this is my favourite store on the citadel
* That's it Lelouch, remember how much of an asshole you are
* **WELL YOU LET HIM OUT IN PUBLIC AND LOOK WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED**
* **Are Charles and Suzaku the only competent people around here?** 
* **Fuck I love Britannia but even I can't comprehend how stupid this is**
* **Give me back Princess Cornellia! I want a good character rather than these shitty incompetent asshats that nobody, not even pro-britannians, care about.**
* **I swear there wouldn't even be a show if someone had the sense to just fucking kill Lelouch already**
* **It's clear that C.C can't do shit without Lelouch so I can't comprehend why keeping him alive as bait was ever the better alternative.**
* **Risk total destruction for one creepy green haired girl because WHY FUCKING NOT**
* **Oh, so she uses her Pizza Hut powers to give someone else an ability after you kill Lelouch? Well that person won't be a chess master so it follows they won't be the smartest person on the fucking planet either.**
* **THEN you can start thinking about using that person as bait to get C.C** 
* (  
* / Rant over 
* **RIGHT YOU HAVE HIS GUN NOW SHOOT THE FUCKER**
* **OH SO YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME WAIT UNTIL NEXT EPISODE ARE YOU NOW? JUST TO FIND OUT THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE AND KICKIN' HUH? FUCK YOU CODE GEASS.**

* Nice to see the Chinese turning on the Black Knights as they should have done ages ago

Well today I had my loyalty tested. If it weren't for a select few characters I would have given up by now.

Rolo is a heartless mofo. He was probably indoctrinated by Charles or some secret program, but now hes fighting it. He wants a family.

Monologuing. Stop it. Rolo, just shoot him. Why couldnt Lelouch lead with the fact that hell help Rolo capture CC? He shouldnt have even told Rolo how he figured out how his Geass works.

And what? Rolo doesnt care about his own life? Hes only interested in his mission. Hes a machine.

At least everyone here is wearing their clothes, says CC to Kallen. Preach it!

Rolo killed a guy for touching his locket? Who cares about the team? Heartless.

I know what Im getting /u/rascorpia for his [birthday.](http://i.imgur.com/ege4HK2.jpg)

Hmmm where the heck could Cornellia have gone that the Britannian military doesnt even know where she is? 

[Well shit. That was unexpected.](http://www.gfycat.com/DelayedOrneryCalf)

[Colorful entrance.](http://www.gfycat.com/RaggedHandmadeInsect)

Lelouch is incredibly brave. He always strolls out into the open all by himself, but seeing as everybody lets everybody else talk without interruption, Lelouch isnt likely to be shot while he has something to say.

So Uncle Li always wanted to take over, but what is his end goal? Join Zero? Use Zero?

Yes! Love these setups! He even made sure the final guy killed himself. No loose ends. And maybe using the same earthquake tactic is a way of proving to everyone that its the real Zero?

Lelouch, fantastic acting to pretend like you care about Rolo. Kids a bit of a psycho, but I wont mind if he switches sides. Hed be a powerful ally.

Oh damn! I thought Rolo was just gonna give up his life to save Lelouch. He just stops the spear instead.

[Reunited!](http://www.gfycat.com/JadedOrdinaryBangeltiger) And Todos back! Love that guy.

See, now that was a good Geass order Lelouch gave the the mech sniper. Im glad they showed him explaining the entire thing.

Damn, Lelouch. You just dgaf about Rolo. I know hes been an obstacle and he took Nunnallys place, but try and understand where hes coming from. You have all of his files. Kids been being used as a weapon for most of his life. It doesnt seem like hes had much of a choice. If you can play him right, hell stand by your side. Youd have access to a friendly Geass user, something you havent had yet.

Suzaku: Re-enrolled.


**Post Episode Thoughts**

Diethard and co are setting up something big to help out Zero. What exactly is their plan? I wonder if Zero knows about it or if its something new that will surprise him.

Im also curious if Lelouch can come to like Rolo. Right now it seems like hes going to use him for a bit and then straight up kill him. I wonder if hell even let Rolo hang around with the other Black Knights or if hell just continue to have him stay undercover at the school. Probably more of the latter since they made that fake phone call to Villetta.

And next episode well get to see Lelouch and Suzaku come face to face for the first time in a while. Thats going to be interesting, especially if they first meet in front of other people.

[Talking is a free action.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction) It's annoying at times but I roll with it. The entry for Code Geass:

> Code Geass often uses this in a Gundam-like manner, especially with [pilots talking during Knightmare battles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist) (a good example would be during Urabe's sacrifice in R2 episode 2) and Lelouch making dramatic remarks even when his opponents just stand there pointing guns at him.

&nbsp;

> Damn, Lelouch. You just dgaf about Rolo. I know hes been an obstacle and he took Nunnallys place, but try and understand where hes coming from. You have all of his files. Kids been being used as a weapon for most of his life. It doesnt seem like hes had much of a choice. If you can play him right, hell stand by your side. Youd have access to a friendly Geass user, something you havent had yet.

I imagine this is only going to come back and bite him. Lelouch decides he's done with Rolo and tries to eliminate him but fails and now has an unstable Geass-wielding assassin out for his blood.

> Diethard and co are setting up something big to help out Zero. What exactly is their plan? I wonder if Zero knows about it or if its something new that will surprise him.

I wonder how many contingency plans Zero set up for scenarios like this.
>> ARTICLE
> Talking is a free action.

I don't let it bother me too much, but yeah, it can be annoying. I actually don't mind people talking if it's just in their head. It's possible to think things through faster than you'd be able to verbally explain them. So as a viewer, we need to hear the character's thoughts. I just pretend like a short inner monologue is actually happening in just a few seconds. I don't know if that's a normal thing to do or if I'm just a weirdo, but whatever, that's me.

And I really hope Rolo stays a good guy. If he ends up trying to kill Lelouch, that would force Lulu to really think through a near flawless plan in order to kill him. So that would be neat.

Lelouch outplayed Rolo. 'nuff said. The counting trick was too good, plus he has him on video, haha. I always thought that plan was interesting.

Also, I think at this point it's pretty clear that Lelouch geassed the eunuch. I feel pretty bad for the eunuch considering the way Xing-ke just stabs him in the throat so swiftly. I really liked that scene though, the animation was awesome. 

Guilford's plan is amazing, and it really was a good attempt. By luring out Zero, he has him within his grasps, and if he doesn't show: even better, Zero loses any sort of credibility. I applaud Guilford, that was a really good plan.

It's nice to see Tamaki still believing in Zero despite all odds. He really was Zero's first fanatic and is still his "best friend" haha. 

Lol @ Kallen, CC, and pretty much everyone doubting Lelouch. Lelouch is a brilliant man, he's not called the Man of Miracles for no reason! Also, I freaking love Sakayo <3.

Lelouch surfboarding his way out of the racket using Guilford as the slope was just badass. Also, Lelouch just scooped up Rolo so fast and nicely. That's incredible how a trick with a missile managed to gain Rolo's trust. Nicely done Lelouch, now he's yours. Looks like I was right about Lelouch's anger stemming from the fact that Rolo dared to take Nunnally's place, as well. 

Suzaku coming back to Ashford Academy... this'll be fun =)

Turn 4

* So, Rolo has actually had Geass ever since he was little. And, become a pretty damn good assassin because of it. Of course, having Geass for so long undoubtedly also made him isolated and lonely, so it helps explain why he clung so hard to Lelouchs gift like he did earlier.

* Also, the fact that we see blood spurt from the mans neck as well the rain continuing to fall proves that Rolo cannot stop time itself, only peoples perception of it.

* I wonder who it was that told Rolo that his Geass was best suited for assassination. (Like I have to guess.)

* Hmm The Sword of Akasha floats with seemingly no propulsion. Its been shown that science has advanced far past what it has in our timeline, and there are such things as mind control and magic involved C.C. confirmed as Elizabeth Comstock.

* [Cameramans drunk again.](http://webm.land/media/d7Ih.webm) 

* Why was Lelouch counting the seconds? Does he just have some weird form of OCPD? (I mean, I personally trace out letters with my eyes, so I guess there are weirder things)

* And Lelouch somehow is able to play back the conversation to that exact moment with just the press of one button? What is that, the remote from Click? CAN CHRISTOPHER WALKEN PLEASE SHOW UP NEXT?!

* For once the whole You can't kill me even if you wanted to, speech isn't just a bunch of crap to stall for time. They seriously wouldn't be able to capture C.C. without Lelouch. (Though, I can't believe Rolo actually bought that Lelouch would sell out C.C. that fast.) The whole thing about Rolos life being meaningless after accomplishing his mission isn't that much a lie, either. How fulfilling can being a nameless assassin really be, especially if it means you haven't had friends for years?

* Lelouch is really good at manipulating a persons self-esteem. He boosted Urabes confidence back when they were being attacked at Babel Tower and is now drawing on Rolos need to be accepted.

* [Its so cute to see these small scenes of the normally stoic C.C. acting a little clumsy.](http://webm.land/media/asoh.webm)

* Li Xingke seems ridiculously calm for how he was acting when we last saw him. Either that was a shot of something in the future, or he just knew he needed to do something dramatic to end the episode on.

* C.C. is just so calm about the possibility of all their plans being undone. You just know that in the most likely centuries shes been alive, shes had her plans foiled so many times that it doesn't even faze her anymore.

* Dude! [Knights of Motorcycles?!](http://i.imgur.com/9gUDLWl.jpg) Thats amazing! We can use them to play card games on while we drive to Pizza Hut!

* I assume that Lelouch [writes in English](http://i.imgur.com/opKC6u3.jpg) because, being nobility, it was one of the first languages he was taught. This would help him should any uneducated Japanese person stumble upon the diary; they would need a translator to read it.

* Anyone else feel its kind of weird how the u in Nunnallys name is pronounced as an o? Guilfords name is also pronounced Gilford. /u/rascorpia, you want to explain your weird-ass language to all us plebs?

* Rather convenient Rolo walked up right when they were talking about him, and that for some reason that room isn't sound-proofed.

* You dont kill a man because of that! I don't know, man. If I see anyone touch my Crystal Pepsi, they could be my mom, they're going in the ground.

* The mission is whats important isn't it? Who cares about the team? Rolos policy: Theres no I in team, but there is a Geass in my eye, and thats all that matters.

* Either way, don't get your hopes up. He'll probably abandon us, again. Geez, girl, youre holding quite a grudge. You might as well just flat-out say you had the hots for him, and get it over with.

* How did Guilford get his hands on /u/rascorpias [plate?](http://i.imgur.com/BiJqldu.jpg)

* [Cool of Guilford to admit that murder isnt the best option.](http://webm.land/media/BB4w.webm) GG, man.

* [Its cool that you can actually see a persons irises glow whenever the Geass command takes effect.](http://webm.land/media/r9XN.webm) So, yeah, thats just pretty much the final confirmation that Lelouch used a bit of forceful persuasion to get his wants fulfilled.

* Guilfords pretty noble, actually agreeing to Lelouchs terms instead of just having all his guys fire on him at once like another person I know of would do.

* I could just listen to David Vincents voice all day long. Hes like just a tiny step down from Troy Baker in terms of that strong-but-respectable kind of voice.

> Why was Lelouch counting the seconds? Does he just have some weird form of OCPD? 

I think it's because he suspected Rolo's geass and it's effects. In several times throughout the season thus far, Lelouch was constantly suspicious of Rolo and his abilities. At the sewer (the Brittanian lair in the academy) Lelouch was setting Rolo up pretty much the entire time, as shown by him having the footage of Rolo's geass in action. So yeah he pretty much was just testing his theory.

> I wonder how many people despise me now for making all these WebMs instead of just Gfycats?

I'm wondering at the sheer amount of English text on display here generally.  Was it originally broadcast in Japan that way?  If so, someone hired a pretty astute English speaker, because there's precious little fault to find with any of it.

>Anyone else feel its kind of weird how the u in Nunnallys name is pronounced as an o?

I think it's just an artifact of the emphasis Lelouch keeps putting on it.  Or maybe a quirk of JYB.

---
Before the episode starts: I don't *think* Rolo's Geass is actually stopping time, but rather just speeding himself up so that from inside the bubble he creates it appears that way. From outside the bubble it just looks like he's teleporting around while others move at normal speed. I could be wrong on that if I'm misremembering some things, but I don't want to start thinking about weird edge cases if so.

So as far as CC's concerned Lelouch's Geass to compel others is unique. Wonder if she's wrong or if two people can even end up with the same power.

Oh lovely, he's been an assassin for years. At least we're getting some backstory for Rolo! Glad I'm totally wrong about my Rolo == Nunnally theory from yesterday ^(unless I'm not and these are all planted memories). And I was off about my theory for his Geass too but not in the horrendous reality-warping time stop way I was thinking. As with all Geass powers (that we know of so far) it just works on people's minds.

Heh, I'm betting Rolo's Geass won't work on CC either so he'll be thrown off by that. That's assuming he doesn't know her weird properties, though he might. Nunnally parallels with Lelouch not lying to his sibling.

Still not sure what's happening with Li Xingke and the Chinese Federation.

Rolo's killed five allies already. I'm somewhat surprised he's still working with them, but I guess he's loyal to the Emperor. Guilford's not Cornelia but I still like him.

Ah, so Li Xingke just wanted to take out that consul. Internal Chinese politics coming into play it seems. Sayoko! What's your deal?

Villetta and friends have no idea what's going on, they think Rolo and Lelouch are at a theater.

Once again with the building collapses. Those happen a lot in this show.

~~Lelouch has a real weakness for family. Even fake family, apparently.~~ Well I can imagine Rolo's definitely a controversial character. He's swinging over to Lelouch's side... where he's just going to be used. Never mind that first part.

Black Knight numbers are back up! Not much of a shadowy resistance anymore though.

Unrelated to anything, it's been way too long since I've seen Lloyd and Cecile. Suzaku, get your ass back to Japan and bring them along.

[Wild speculation turn 04](/s "Marianne wasn't actually killed, Charles just used his Geass on witnesses to make them think that's what happened. CC knows this but won't tell Lelouch to both protect Marianne and so she can retain a contract with him to bring down Charles. Meanwhile, Rolo develops an unhealthy crush on his big brother figure and begins taking it out on the poor table. Shirley is mildly depressed by that until Rivalz comforts her and they start dating.")

Well, Lelouch tells Nunnally he would never lie to her but he does lie to her ALL THE TIME. He lies to everyone, after all. Except maybe C.C., which is part of why their partnership is so interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> So as far as CC's concerned Lelouch's Geass to compel others is unique. Wonder if she's wrong or if two people can even end up with the same power.

[Spoilers](/s "IIRC the Geass that manifests in a person is dependent on the person's personality and inner desires so for example, Mao gets his because he probably wanted to hear what people thought of him -- wanted to peer into their minds. Lelouch's probably because of a great desire to have the power to challenge the empire and have the control in his life that he probably didn't feel as he kept up his mask as a regular student.")

>~~Lelouch has a real weakness for family. Even fake family, apparently.~~ Well I can imagine Rolo's definitely a controversial character. He's swinging over to Lelouch's side... where he's just going to be used. Never mind that first part.

Lelouch definitely plays a lot on Rolo's desire to be considered family/needed -- he can play really well on how to talk to the kid to get him to do virtually anything he wants. Rolo isn't exactly stable and Lelouch is playing a dangerous game in keeping him around, but he's also an invaluable ally. Years on I still don't really know my feelings on Rolo -- there's a ton of frustration and pity mixed in there, but I don't think I outright hate him as a character.

> Wild speculation turn 04

So I wonder if Charles has used his Geass on Lelouch in the past, if it's possible for him to use it twice on the same person. He seems powerful though, so I'd say it's a possibility. All of Lelouch's memories could be fake as well.
>> ARTICLE
> All of Lelouch's memories could be fake as well.

[Crazy speculation building on that](/s "Nunnally isn't really Lelouch's sister and is only used to keep him in line via implanted memories. HER ENTIRE LIFE IS A LIE. I doubt that's the case though, as CC's kiss probably would have shaken those false memories loose as well... unless it only applies to things that happened to him after their contract started? Either way, as Lelouch pointed out, the memories they made together are still real so I doubt he'd turn on Nunnally in the future. I'm not discounting the Nunnally-Geass theories either, just another thing to toss onto the pile.")

So, [why are these always spoiler tagged](/s "I'm still very much on board with the Nunnally Geass theories. I think that has a good chance of playing out somewhat true. Probably not as in depth/wild as we were all discussing that day though. As far as Lelouch being previously Geassed, I'm wondering why Charles would leave him with such awful memories that would cause him to want revenge. And you said Lelouch pointed out the memories they made were real (you're talking about what he said to Rolo?), but I thought that was a lie to make Rolo want to switch sides. But if it turns out that Nunnally isn't his sister, I think Lelouch might say the same thing, but with sincerity.")

Okay, dropping the spoiler tags. I usually have them just in case I'm right and they end up being spoilers.

To make Lelouch *want* a Geass contract with CC? If we're going by the "Charles needs others to use Geass" for some reason theory. I agree with you on the rest of it.
>> ARTICLE
> I usually have them just in case I'm right and they end up being spoilers.

Oh, ok. Simple enough. How kind of you. And I love how the conversations just continue to build on the notion that our theories will end up being correct. Even if we find a fault, we don't just say "ok, that theory got busted." We just alter the theory.
>> ARTICLE
> So as far as CC's concerned Lelouch's Geass to compel others is unique. Wonder if she's wrong or if two people can even end up with the same power.

There's actually another character that doesn't show up in the main series whose Geass makes people obey him just by speaking a command, regardless of eye contact. As you can image, this became hard for him when his Geass overloaded.

Yeah, he is pretty much one of the more controversial characters in the show. I personally don't hate him, I think he's an interesting character, but with Lelouch using Rolo like trash kind of feels wrong to me. Sure, he was trying to kill Lelouch but still...

Looking forward to this episode. I'm really hopeful that things will get back on track and 'Logic Britannia' will make its return.

**Episode 4**

* Looks like someone should have checked for the barcode on Rolo's neck
* **FUCKING SHOOT HIM**
* **DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF STALLING FOR TIME!?!**
* **CAN YOU NOT COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED FROM MONOLOGUES!?!**
* *Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
* I give up
* Season two is the worst
* I would take the slightly logical Britannia from season 1 over this nonseniscal bullshit Britannia in season 2
* Seriously If I was a character in this show you would currently be watching me presenting the bodies of Lelouch and C.C to Charles Zi Britannia and having Princess Cornelia name me her Knight of Honour
* And then I would be sent to personally execute those traitors that should have been killed off a year ago
* [Damn I want that plate](http://i.imgur.com/pBVs6eV.png)
* Guilford is making sense? Thank ~~God~~ Charles someone is...
* [Couldn't have put it better Guilford ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/ZuI6C6q.png)
* **OH JUST FUCKING SHOOT THEM OR DIE**
* I just don't care anymore. We all know they are going to survive so just get on with it already. 
* Like every second they are not firing is a chance for Britannia to take action uncontested but **NOPE**
* And of course help will show up **THE MOMENT** they decide to kill them
* I'm surprised the general public don't question why they haven't just killed Zero while he has no backup
* Err how exactly did he Geass those operators? 
* Does Lelouch just have all Britannia military officers under his control 24/7?
* Invincible fanservice girl with next to no backstory to the rescue!
* I want season 1 back. Even though it shares some of these problems it was toned down a lot.
* *LELOUCH WAS LYING TO YOU FROM THE START?* **WELL YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASCEND MOUNT OLYMPUS AND BEG BEFORE THE EYES OF THE GODS TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT THAT SHOCKING REVELATION RIGHT?!?!?** 
* Leloch x Rolo ship is at 110% charge
* Pissed at Guilford's moment of glory being ruined though and there is no way Lelouch isn't just fucking with your emotions Rolo
* Lelouch is so going to pull a littlefinger at the end of this storyline [GoT](/s ""I have only loved one person my entire life..."") 
* [:D](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=JN.0xlpIktBlFzc0qCgbDPMSw&pid=15.1) 
* [GoT](/s ""My sister"")
* Welp. All the sidecharacters that nobody cared about are alive. ^*Wooo! ^Go ^them!*
* Rolo I liked you at first but in the end you are just as bloody stupid as the rest of them, even Lelouch thinks so.
* I can count the good characters on one hand. **ONE HAND.** 

Well I hope you guys had fun with season 1 because from now on it is grumpy /u/rascorpia. I will continue to rant about the stupidity of Britannia until the characters that truly made it the great empire that it is start showing up. 

**You have been warned.**

And since I'm on one', where the heck is me delivery!?! What company doesn't give a dispatch date, then when asked says "Soon" ^TM and then it still hasn't dispatched a week and a half later?!? Did you mean 'soon' as in we will execute the captured Black Knights "soon". *It's a bloody joke!*

Schneizel is coming is all I will say.

Honestly, I think that is one of the weakest complaints people can make about this series.

a) Britannian characters being distracted by monologues is not new. That has been happening all the way through.  The same thing goes for characters not immediately killing someone at the first opportunity. 

b) Both of these are also extremely common situations in games, cartoons and anime. Not some sort of unusual or unexpected flaw that is nowhere to be found outside of this show.

c) There are some possible explanations for why fictional characters and real people can behave that way. Animated works like this one simply tend to exaggerate patterns of behavior and irrationality that already exist.

Love the Haruhi crossover images. Though all things considered she effectively *did* have a Geass to command certain characters around...

- Rolo y u so creepy holy shit  
- Who gave him Geass?  
- How the hell did Lelouch know to start counting when Rolo showed up?   
- I wonder if Lelouch is serious about being willing to sell out CC, or if he's just bluffing? She seems like she'd matter more to him.   
- NVM, Lelouch is totally lying to Rolo.  
- Haha, CC can't work with guns well.   
- I'm not sure I get Chinese dude's motivation here? He's angry that the Chinese Federation recognized the Black Knights, but just calmly strolls in to have a chat with Kallen and CC?  
- Rivalz, do you exist for anything other than being Lelouch's ride?   
- Apparently Rolo's been killing his team members? Jesus christ this kid is fucked up. Spike Spencer was absolutely the right choice.   
- Guilford is a smart guy. Wait, did Cornelia die?
- I don't believe Cornelia's dead. They wouldn't just kill her offscreen like that, she's too important of a character.   
- Here we see the primary weakness of Lelouch's Geass: It makes people act like morons.  
- OK, so there's an Empress, and the eunuch dude doesn't like her. But it doesn't matter, because he just took a knife to the throat from Captain China. How much shampoo does that guy use?   
- So Viletta definitely seems like she still secretly harbors feelings for Ohgi.   
- Rolo holy shit you are creepy as fuck.   
- So now Captain China is just letting the Black Knights fight, even after he killed the Eunuch dude? I seriously don't get what his motivations are.  
- Yay Lelouch showed up. I mean, I knew he was going to, of course, but. Yay.  
- The Deithard/Rakashatatata/Sayoko/Kaguya foursome is fun. I really wonder what Sayoko's deal is.    
- Ahhh, I get it. So Captain China hated the eunuch beforehand, and actually used the black knight thing as an excuse? So THAT was his motivation? That actually makes sense.
- Don't you know you should never use the same strategy twice, Lelouch? Oh well, guess it works out.  
- And I think it's really interesting that Guilford truly does believe he's being just; from his point of view Zero and the BKs are dangerous terrorists. Lelouch, however, admits he's going down the Pay Evil Unto Evil route.   
- Riot-shield surfing. Really? More like Legolouch amirite   
- lol that one guy's name was Bart. That's way more amusing than it should be.  
- Aw, Viletta looked briefly relieved that Ohgi survived.   
- I just can't take the line "you're on notice" seriously. Kallen, who do you think you are, Stephen Colbert?    
- Lelouch taking the hit for Rolo? He has to be lying about having actual affection towards him. Lelouch should LOATHE Rolo. This is just manipulating him, I think.   
- Clearly, it's working.     
- Spike Spencer really WAS a great choice. Rolo is so messed up in the head.   
- aw, Kallen. You're cute. Clearly not as much of a hardass as she acts.   
- Yep, Lelouch was manipulating him from the beginning. Including that shot that he saved Rolo from. Well played.     
- OH HAI SUZAKU well this WILL be interesting.  
>> ARTICLE
> I really wonder what Sayoko's deal is.

Same. This show has so many characters that I want to know how important they're going to end up being. Will Kallen get out of her fanservice role? Where the heck is Jeremiah... and Cornelia for that matter? Nina looked like she might be trouble. We know nothing about Marianne and barely anything about Charles. There's probably more too. We'll have all the answers in 13 days time.

I really wonder what people mean when they say this... Kallen's the ace pilot of the Black Knights and a romantic interest for Lelouch. Is that not enough?

I know she's still a great pilot, but so far this season they're just also using her a lot more for stuff like gratuitous ass shots while she's in the Guren. I still like her a lot, but I thought they'd focus more on her skills since, like you said, she's the ace pilot of the Black Knights. And the romantic feelings seem to be one sided so far.
>> ARTICLE
> but so far this season they're just also using her a lot more for stuff like gratuitous ass shots while she's in the Guren

Yeah, but you could say nearly the same thing for everyone so far in this season other than Lelouch and maybe Rolo. What's CC's role as of now other than to make snarky remarks? 

The plot and setting so far hasn't allowed for Kallen to show off her skills because it hasn't been necessary other than in episode 1, but even in this episode we got to see Kallen wreck some Brittanians. 
>> ARTICLE
True, true. I'm still pretty new to anime so maybe I've yet to realize how prevalent fanservice truly is. Idk. I was just a little surprised when they kept showing her from behind when she was in the Guren. I don't think there were any of those shots in season 1.

There certainly are more in season 2. The writers were told to try and add more fanservice to the show to generate more viewers. Don't worry, she will still be baddass

Can I just say how much I absolutely **love** the scene right after where Lelouch gets his memories back?

When the song "Avalon" starts playing and Lelouch goes on about whether power is rightous, powerlessness is a sin and so on and so forth. 

And when he finally monologues about how now he knew why his everyday life up until now felt so strange.


*"Right. It was not me who was wrong. It was the world!"*

And then Kallen and Urabe break through the ceiling all while he mutters

*"The world can be changed. I will change it."* 

with that evil yet satisfied expression on his face and his hair waving around and the light shining down on him, at the same time as the bg song goes into its final high notes.

That scene is executed so absolutely brilliantly beyond my vocabulary and is one of my favorite scenes in the entire series.

I'm not particularly surprised that most of the Black Knights have been wiped out. *Or* maybe they just think they're the only survivors and Zero's moved to smaller cells that aren't aware of the existence of the others, but that's putting too much faith into him.

Lelouch is... back in school. And Villetta's there, chasing after him and... it's a game to them? What the hell? Did she retire from the military to become a gym coach? She knew Zero's identity, or at least she did at one point, and didn't turn him over?

Oh great, a bunch of new characters that I don't know in the OP. Oh, I and I guess Lelouch got his Geass under control again. ...who's the kid calling him his brother and he's thinking about university? The fuck is this?

Wait a minute. \**hits pause*\* Okay, for as many stupid theories as I throw out there, this one might be the dumbest because it might theoretically be possible in the context of the show. Here goes: Lelouch found a way to use the Geass on individuals repeatedly, and used it on *everyone* to make them think he's just some kid's older brother. Including himself. After that he resumed a quiet life at Ashford Academy. Welcome to R2, where the memories are made up and the character developments don't matter.

If that's actually what happened I might throw something at the TV. \**unpause*\*

Looks like the racism hasn't gotten any better. Diethard and Rakshata are still on the loose at least. Calares? I like his facial hair.

Well, Lelouch is still being targeted by someone, wonder who. He's going to presumably play chess with someone? That's my guess at least.

Kallen in a bunny suit? Um.. I'm not complaining. Was briefly wondering if Lelouch also Geassed her into a new life but no, looks like she's undercover and trying to pass something to him. Ew, gross Britannian mafia dude. Hey, I called the chess. Didn't think it would be with that guy though.

Ogi's still alive! And in prison. Todo too. They can't all be winners. I bet /u/rascorpia's enjoying this.

Cheating at chess? Even if you plant evidence, how would that work? Would he have an extra queen up his sleeve or something? Ah, forget that, Kallen's back in action!

> We pledge to the spirits of founding fathers
> And the glory of the realm our mother
> That we shall be the shields which defend our homeland
> And the halberds which smite those who would harm us

Britannian military thingy. And Lelouch really is confused about the whole thing, I think he did Geass himself.

I'm trying to think of who the Chinese Federation representative reminds me of. Such a weird voice but it sounds so familiar.

[What's with the locket?](http://i.imgur.com/xaFT8dC.png) And looks like a Burai coming to get Lelouch. Kallen still has her Guren, she's still fighting the good fight. Good thing she found out his identity.

Rolo? Thanks, random character introduced as the MC's brother halfway through the series.

CC! I hope Lelouch set up some kind of trigger to remember everything. Aaand CC's shot again. Don't worry about her, she'll be back soon enough.

They're keeping a journal on him? "No idealogical deviations," that's creepy. Thoughtcrime now? Oooh maybe Villetta was undercover spying on him at school. Bait. To get CC.

And here they're thinking they're just killing a civilian dude. [Magic kiss!](http://i.imgur.com/y9xeCvr.png) There's that gas giant again. Mmm amnesia, what contrived plot can't you cause?

~~And we finally see what happened a year ago.~~ Never mind, just a teaser. Might as well mirror the first episode. And I guess his Geass *isn't* under control, he just couldn't use it when he had amnesia.

[Look at this majestic bastard.](http://i.imgur.com/v6qTKUe.png) Also... [prince,](http://i.imgur.com/YQWfi98.png) [Suzaku and princess?](http://i.imgur.com/Totizbx.png) Again with the pink hair... Also Suzaku knows Zero isn't dead, so I'm still wondering what went on back on Kamine Island.

Cornelia and Euphemia in the ED, now you're just teasing me. Oh hey, VV and the Emperor together. I like the angel/devil theme going on there. So...

[Wild speculation turn 1](/s "VV was the mastermind behind Lelouch's amnesia. He can reflect a Geass back upon its user, so when Lelouch tried to use it on him, VV gained control of Lelouch and ordered him into the weird life we saw him in.

Pretty clever theory. When I first saw this I was just too confused to think.

> What's with the locket?

Lelouch needs to find the girl he made a promise to when he was a child. Kallen, Shirley, Crowd Control and Suzaku all have a key to that locket.

> Rolo? Thanks, random character introduced as the MC's brother halfway through the series.

I always read 'Rolo' as scooby-doo trying to say "Yolo", makes for a much more entertaining experience.

What the genuine shitting fuck? I must have spent at least 3/4 of this episode just starting at my screen in confusion.

What the bloody hell is happening? Why is the Britannian woman their PE teacher? Why is Nunnally a man now? Why is Suzaku with the Emperor? What the fuck is going on?


I don't know how the fans who watched it while it was running dealt with this, if i'd waited nearly a year with R1's cliffhanger for this to be the first episode I would have been beyond pissed.

But then again I actually enjoyed this.

Here we go. R2!

- I was warned, but this sure is odd. Some sort of dream/alternate reality?
- Cool OP. A lot of the mechs now have the hadron cannon, and there are a bunch of new characters by the looks of it.
- Todo noooooo! Looks like Lelouch will have to break him out of prison again.
- Alright, so maybe Lelouch did some sort of mass Geass so he could go into hiding? Or somehow memory wiped himself but he already used Geass on himself.
- Im just gonna wait for the explanation on this.
- Hahaha! I thought [that was gonna be Lelouchs mother.](http://www.gfycat.com/ShamefulRealAfricanbushviper) Maybe its his uncle! Probably not, though. :(
- They used a purple smokescreen just like Lelouch did to run away from Villetta.
- [Purple fire.](http://www.gfycat.com/ActiveSadHusky) Brutal scene.
- I like how [they shot each other](http://www.gfycat.com/ThreadbareDeterminedAfricanclawedfrog) instead of themselves. Again, just a simple order of "die." Love it.
- So this time, CC rescues Lelouch. Quite an interesting scene altogether that played out similarly to the scene at the end of episode 1 of R1.
- Suzaku, why? Amnesia too? I hope so.

Still a lot of stuff to answer. Villetta is teaching at the school. Maybe she went undercover. Shirley seems to have her memory back or is at least friendly with Lelouch again. Lelouch has a brother at school now, and there was no sign of Nunnally.

Sort of a strange way to start off the second season, but I liked it. Next its time to find out what happened in that cave.

For the record, there was an already finished script for Code Geass episode 26 that was supposed to continue the story right away from the point the cliffhanger in episode 25 ended. They changed that because the series moved to another time slot, but it is a historical curiosity.

In fact, the Code Geass R2 Blu-Ray Box set released in Japan last year included a full copy of the script for that "lost" episode. It's...interesting how they clearly changed a few things but kept some of them rather similar (based on what will be explained shortly in the next episode of R2).
>> ARTICLE
Man i cant help but feel code geass couldve been even better if the creators were given free reigns i r2. Seems like they had to change a few things, to fit the timeslot change and there are also rumours about directors forcing changes upon the creators in order to increase profits/milk success of 1st season. Really interested if you have the script for the 26th episode by the way. Could be extremely interesting to compsre to how the story actually ended up contuining in r2
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know the beginning and the ending were written before the rest of the show so it would have at least been the same end result, but probably a more cohesive journey towards said ending.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. No spoilers, but that's kinda clear. R2 is great, but loses itself multiple times and is less focused than R1

Do you, by any chance, have a link to said script?

I really really love the first R2 opening. Gosh all of the op's in Code Geass (actually the entire soundtrack) are amazing.

I think it's really interesting to see Lelouch's monologue in the beginning, and how he's practically the same person even without his original memories. Lelouch really hates the nobility, and finds the world to be sick and unfair.

Also, fuck Brittania. The entire empire makes me sick. These Brittanian's are so comfortable exploiting people, lacking any sort of remorse. It's sickening how they view the Japanese. To the people who say Lelouch took the wrong approach: look at these people. Do you really think that the world could be saved without a bloody revolution that Lelouch attempted? 

It's hilarious to see how arrogant and proud Lelouch is. The guy's naturally a great guy. When he sees the Brittanian mafia guy take advantage of Kallen, he defends her and challenges him. Even if his memories get stripped from him, he just loves to make a fool of the proud. 

Lelouch's monologue at the end when he gets his memories back had me so pumped. This episode was such a good transition into R2. The way Kallen busted in from the ceiling and kneeling down was just so refreshing. It's refreshing to see Lelouch back in power! 

Also, Kallen and CC were both amazing this episode.. :) It was satisfying to see Kallen beat up the Brittanian, and really nostalgic to see CC and Lelouch reunited. The best thing about this episode is Lelouch regaining power, but it's also really cool to see how much the world has changed without Zero. Zero was truly a good thing for the world, and without him, Brittania would run free.

\**raises hand*\* I'm not in /u/rascorpia's mentality of **ALL HAIL BRITANNIA** but I really don't like Lelouch. I can appreciate him as a character but beyond that nope.

I was really happy to know that I wasn't the only one who thought he had seen the wrong episode during my first watch.

So, am I the only one who thinks that playing a bit more with an amnesic Lelouch might have been neat (like a certain other hero in a certain other series)? Britannia!Lelouch could have been pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I think at least another episode with Lelouch still clueless would've been fine. It felt a little rushed giving him his memories back in just one episode. Seeing the others continue to fight while Lelouch does silly school things with his friends could've been funny.

Some say Lelouch is in Akito the Exiled, an OVA that takes place between season one and two.

I don't know what you mean by "some say", he is going to be in OVA3.
>> ARTICLE
> So, am I the only one who thinks that playing a bit more with an amnesic Lelouch might have been neat 

No, it would've definitely been interesting, but I don't know if I could sit through and watch that without being really angry. Just seeing Lelouch being reverted to a weak, clueless person is just so out of character for him. Watching episode 1 of R2 is always hard for me because I just want Lelouch's memories to come back and take revenge asap. But I agree, it would've been cool.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It worked with [Death Note Spoilers](/s "Light because he had L to work off during the time he lost his memories,") but Lelouch is the driving force of this show, and having him not be himself would have been boring to sit through for an extended period of time.
>> ARTICLE
And we're back! Time for the final stretch. It's the weekend, work is over and I only need to do the write up for one episode! The stars and the planets have truly aligned for this moment. I just so happen to have bought the Nuasicca manga which will arrive in a few years so this day couldn't get better. 

I tell a lie, it's better now because of you /r/anime :3



**Episode 1**

* Creepy green haired girl has been upgraded to state pilot, guess that confirms who won in the fight with RoboJere
* Yes...yes...the rebellion has been reduced to rubble as it was fortold
* Lelouch seems to be trapped inside of some artificial world. His eye no is no longer glowing and he's back to the old school antics
* Those chemicals were rather conviniently set-up for that smoke bomb
* See what a better world everyone lives in when there is no rebellion, just good ol' Britannians having fun!
* No Jibun Woo. Guess that confirms it won't be coming back R.I.P
* Lelouch is riding a horse again. Will this actually be in the show this time?
* So those two are brothers in this world? Guess that means there is no Nunnally too?
* Lelouch did get shot in the head, so maybe he was lobotomised a la Sucker Punch
* Ah the ~~propaganda~~ factual news reports are still in full swing as I had hoped.
* "Eleven monkey" That's a new one. WIll have to use it sometime in the near future
* Lelouch is back to this MLG Chess
* Eleven fighting pits? This is my kind of casino
* Kallen in a bunny costume. Haruhi must be nearby. [Maybe she](/s "was the one who created this new universe. Or was it Yuki?")
* [Who would do that...](http://i.imgur.com/ubgeGEe.png)now give me 100 reasons why Britannia is the greatest empire in the world and another 100 reasons why elevens are nothing but brainless animals
* Rapey guy is rapey
* At least Pizza hut is still alive and well post-rebellion
* Space Dandy has risen from the dead
* Don't know why the fuck these guys haven't been executed if it has been a year since then
* I would rather not keep them alive in case they come back round to bite you in the ass
* Ms.fanservice is on a roll
* Nice to see that even though they have long since been crushed the rebellion still has seemingly unlimited resources
* And their knightmares can take thousands of shots compared to the Britannians
* He ded
* He not ded
* Conveniently placed net is convenient. How come this casino building has such a lavish casino area adjacent to a run down construction site anyway?
* Don't believe her lies Lelouch!
* She ded
* Looks like Britannia-chan is a yandere
* And why would you monologue. That just guarantees that they will both live. This series would have just ended right now if you shot them right away
* Gotta get that kiss in
* JUST SHOOT THEM FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! KESKNGKSEJHGKSEHGSKJDFSKFJSRYJKGKMXHT
* OH LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
* I give up.
* Fuck logic am I right?
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
* Charles is looking like a true deity
* *God speed* Suzaku

Well that was interesting. Animation has been bumped up a notch although it still remains consistent with season 1. I'm already raging at how dumb some of these things can be but I guess that is the nature of the show. 

I'm hoping it doesn't take half a season to find out what happened on the island. You can't just give us a cliffhanger then ignore it right out the gates. I want to know exactly why Lelouch is still breathing when he should be in a hole in the ground like the traitor he is. Likewise I want to know where my precious Viceroy is.

At least it looks like Charles will be coming to the forefront this season so overall it was a 10/10, flawless episode, could not improve. 
>> ARTICLE
> And why would you monologue. That just guarantees that they will both live. This series would have just ended right now if you shot them right away
> 

Look ... if every TV show or movie or piece of fiction was like that then I'd fucking die from boredom so I'm rather glad that shit like this exists. Making comparisons to real life situations is pretty stupid when it comes to most anime and Code Geass is certainly one of those.
>> ARTICLE
Eh...I'd argue that a well written story would prevent scenes like that from coming up altogether. It can be a fictional story and still hold up to real world logic so I'm not sure I agree with you there, although I will agree that most anime lack that consistency. Nothing saying that Code Geass has to like 'most anime' though.
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess I agree but Code Geass is definitely not something you can explain with logic and common sense.
>> ARTICLE
If the people of Code Geass had a bit of common sense, I'm pretty sure they would've installed cameras inside knightmare frames, and locked the more expensive ones with a password at least "coughGawaincough"
>> ARTICLE
It was still operating when Lelouch stole it.

I'm guessing the noble guy was not shooting him because he wasnt expecting Lelouch to remember anything and was being arrogant.

Ah yes logic, the true enemy of Code Geass

>> ARTICLE
Now that I'm actually watching these again instead of just joining in on the conversation, I guess I'll start making bulleted lists, too.

Turn 1

* Wow, I forgot how high-pitched Johnny Yong Bosch can get when he's not doing maniacal, rebel Lelouch.

* I really wish there were like a spin-off series of this, with Lelouch and pals just screwing around at Ashford Academy. It seems so natural and real, and Viletta is actually pretty funny as a gym teacher.

* Does Lelouch just like have a wig on standby for whenever he needs to escape being chased? Does it really happen to him that much? (Then again, considering how many girls in the school are shown to be majorly crushing on Lelouch, maybe this makes sense.)

* Seeing their logo at the end of the OP makes memi wonder. Anyone else impressed at the variety Sunrise is able to put into their work? First the mostly serious and kick-ass Code Geass, then a few years later they put out something as silly and nonsensical as Good Luck Girl Wait.

* And here we have the introduction of the fandoms most split character, Rolo (*Insert joke about chocolate candy here*). I personally dont mind him that much, but the way he always refers to Lelouch as big brother can get pretty tiresome (Though, that seems to pretty much be a trend with all younger siblings in anime).

* Big corporations and the nobility would still be above me. A structured, mature world. I think I hear /u/Rascorpia muttering to himself something about Lelouch being okay this time.

* The Elevens revealed themselves to be a dangerous, belligerent race. Something tells me /u/Rascorpia is going to like most of this episode.

* No matter what you try, the world is just a Couldn't get the rights to finish the Death Note quote, eh, Lelouch?

* What exactly is the purpose of those [sunglasses](http://i.imgur.com/ULaiDSz.jpg)? If you could call them sunglasses.

* Lelouch seems to be having a real problem with not finishing thoughts That or hes really good at dramatic pauses.

* Which sibling will win? The older one or the younger? This guy might as well be yelling, Geez, what Im saying sure is ironic if you happen to be an informed viewer of this show!

* Lets just go ahead and get the Kallen/Misty May comparison out of the way. She really does look better with her hair down.

* You should know by now losers dont have any rights. Im just gonna stop with the /u/Rascorpia referencing now, otherwise wed be here all day.

* Yeah, Lelouch, we could play chess. Or I could just shove those chess pieces so far up your nose you switch your royal background to Egyptian.

* [Its on a billboard.](http://i.imgur.com/hPjglLk.jpg) They literally just went and stuck it on a billboard. At least theyre not even bothering pretending to be subtle anymore.

* Geez, Lelouch, you've got your Black Knights (or at least the one most males in the audience care about) pretty pissed at you. Maybe if you had ATTEMPTED to give an excuse before just leaving them to die, huh?

* Ah, Tohdoh, its nice to hear that voice again. Its like Spike if he had joined the military instead of a crime syndicate.

* What the hell, Oghi? How long have you been here and youre JUST starting to think Zero may be dead? I mean Hes not, but still.

* Sure, you can cheat at chess. I always keep seven queens up my sleeve and just hope no one notices that I havent sacrificed any pawns.

* You filthy, lying adult! Yeah, I got nothing on that one. Hes an adult alright.

* I wonder what guy at Sunrise said, Look, we need an excuse for Kallen to fight in a playgirl outfit. Dont question it! Just make it happen!

* Oh, look, its that guy /u/Neawia thought was Lelouchs mom.

* And that guys voice is why mimes never talk.

* Antique weapon? How about I call up my pal, Troy Baker, and he shows you what a ninja swo I cant even finish it. Just fuck Kai Leng.

* How tight is that corset that she manages to keep that key/flash drive unmoving between her breasts?

* Don't these guys know to use the stairs in an emergency anyway?

* [Thats right, guys. Just hold on that scene I SAID HOLD ON IT!](http://i.imgur.com/dPlG2qE.jpg)

* You two just dont have the insane love to be able to complete the [Future Diary hand-grab](http://i.imgur.com/MCpLsAV.jpg). [Minor Spoiler](/s "Well, maybe Rolo.")

* Lelouch managing to pull a Temple of Doom on that landing.

* [So, does C.C. just like carry her own spotlight around with her?](http://i.imgur.com/0Y7hcIP.jpg)

* What, did those guys just silently creep up on them and wait for her to start lowering before firing a single shot into her?

* Those flames are purple. You know what fuel burns purple? NOT JETFUEL!

* The guy with the journal has a voice that makes him sound like he could be a narrator on National Geographic.

* Im not sure if Lelouch can do his internal monologue really fast, or if the baron is just *really* savoring the moment.

* That must have been one heck of a kiss she gave him the first time to be able to use it to unlock his memories. What, is C.C. related to Clark Kent?

* Finally able to finish a sentence, eh, Lelouch? You get your ability to dramatically monologue taken away as well?

* Okay, I can buy that the Britannian guards weren't informed that C.C. is immortal (though, if thats the case Im not sure why they still refer to her as a witch), but could they have at least been told to just shoot her like fifty times just to be safe? I mean, she took one shot to the chest. Even in a non-immortal, that may not put them down for the count. And, how the fuck do you know she got shot through the heart? You got an x-ray in those goggles? And, why are you STILL not just shooting the guy?

* Lelouch is once again somehow able to look everyone in the eye all at the same time. And, we get an updated version of the projection of a persons mind locking. Anyone else think it kind of looks like a circuit board?

* *Now* Lelouch is sounding badass again.

* [Lelouch with those dramatic hand-swipes.](http://webm.land/media/IbSp.webm)

* And, we end it with Suzaku whining on about some emo bullshit while [Charles is busy looking boss.](http://i.imgur.com/2gxyTzf.jpg)

Wow, that took a while. Major props to /u/Durinthal, /u/Neawia, and /u/Rascorpia for doing this every day; I had no idea how time exhaustive it is. But, I had fun doing it, so Ill probably keep it up for future episodes.

I personally dont mind him that much, but the way he always refers to Lelouch as big brother can get pretty tiresome (Though, that seems to pretty much be a trend with all younger siblings in anime).

That's because in far eastern languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean, there are honorifics to pretty much everything when it comes to talking to other people. That is not only limited to things like "mister".

For instance, if a Japanese person is talking to his older brother, he/she'd usually address him by "nii-san" or something equivalent. 

This is an everyday language formality that doesn't translate **at all** into Latin-based languages so as a translator you can only either leave those in or cut those out and just use names instead.

This is actually one of my biggest gripes with a lot of dubs because whenever someone gets called "big brother" or "big sister" in a English or (since I live in Germany) German dubbed anime all I can hear is "here was something too Japanese but we translated it into cringe-worthy English / German instead"

> Anyone else impressed at the variety Sunrise is able to put into their work?

They have [nearly a dozen studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(company\)#Studios) so I'm not surprised. Studio 5's my favorite for Crest of the Stars and Gintama.

There is an official anthology manga series called Code Geass Knights (for girls) and Code Geass Queen (for boys) which - as far as I know, because I haven't read any of those purely because I was too lazy to look for them - are essentially SoL doujins (non-H, though I wouldn't be surprised if those had lots of homoerotic undertones).

I've been watching Code Geass dubbed this whole time and when I realized that best bro Role was voiced by Spike Spencer I was even more ecstatic about how the episode was playing out. I enjoyed Spike's Shinji and his Rolo doesn't seem that shabby either, so thats a definite plus for me.

This OP song actually reminds me of a couple from Gintama, but I haven't bothered looking up who the artist is.

Half a kilometer? Should be fun. Though always listening would definitely drive me crazy, so I can see why he's off his rocker and relies on that recording of CC. Lelouch has a camera pointed at where Nunnally sits in the dining room? That's a bit creepy. *Now* he asks what the terms of the contract are? And don't go blaming CC for what happened to Shirley, that's all on you.

Aww, Suzaku's trying to get Nina a meeting with the princess. Good for him.

Marriage interview? Ah, the fun of the aristocracy. And of course Lelouch's mind wipe begins backfiring on him. Unless it somehow gets reversed I'm not forgiving him for that, and even if that happens I'm still going to be angry with him.

I want to say Villetta's faking memory loss given that he has a gun in hand, but who knows? If she could be convinced to join the Black Knights that could be a nice gain for them though. I guess that's what her sudden change in the OP is.

CC's walking off into the sunset and the Geass doesn't work on her, dumbass. He's... starting to slip. She'll be back later, obviously.

Todo's about to be out of the picture by the look of things. Wonder what Diethard's angle is still, but that's one of the side plotlines that I'm okay with taking time.

So... why did CC give the Geass power to a kid? Good choice on the house in Australia, bad decision to chop CC up to transport her there. I unintentionally had great timing on my chainsaw analogy yesterday and I'm sure /u/The-Sublime-One got a laugh from it.

/u/Neawia called it with Lelouch being the only one to know CC's real name, and now he uses it as a weapon. I briefly wondered if that was a recording on the screen since his timing seemed to be a little off but didn't give it much though. ~~For once he lets other people help too!~~ Okay, I should have expected that he used the Geass on them to make them shoot Mao whenever he started to say something about Lelouch's identity.

---
Huh, Diethard's taking over logistics for Zero. Seems like he's good at it too. Development team and Rakshata, wasn't she the one behind the radiation wave move on the Guren? Upgrades for everyone! I honestly didn't recognize that it was CC leaving to visit the Chinese Federation until I finished the episode and read the description.

Mao's still alive? Damn. Ooooh heh Milly and Lloyd now. I don't imagine anything coming of this but who knows?

Well time for Suzaku to get involved and find Nunnally. I'm guessing he won't find out about Zero just yet though.

Huh.. either Villetta's more patient than I thought or she really did lose her memory.

Euphemia brought up the paintings I mentioned a while ago! And as far as they know Lelouch and Nunnally are dead.. which is weird as you'd think information would have leaked from the student council before now about how there are two siblings named Lelouch and Nunnally and the latter's blind and in a wheelchair and all...

I was wondering if it was possible for Lelouch to Geass himself, and now I know. And now he can't again, so he'll have to come up with some other trick if he wants to beat Mao in the future.

Oh hey, instead of Suzaku learning about Zero, Lelouch learns about Suzaku. I guess that explains a lot about how he's been acting the entire series.

Aaand Mao's visor's gone. I would say that him being unable to speak would make for an interesting return later, but CC decided to cut him short there. World of C? Maybe CC will reveal more about that to Lelouch in time.

[Wild speculation round 11](/s "Lelouch discovers that World of C is actually "World of Cheese" which is a museum dedicated to Pizza Hut. CC's contracts require the other party to work there for all eternity serving pizza after they die. Meanwhile Lloyd marries Milly, which means he needs to stop seeing Cecile on the side. Cecile is mildly depressed by that until Suzaku comforts her and they start dating.")
>> ARTICLE
First off, yes it did.

Second, your predictions are SO much better than what actually happens. Again.

And (I'm hoping this isn't a spoiler) Viletta isn't faking memory loss. Because that would just make too much damn sense.
>> ARTICLE
I figured as much because it seemed like her entire personality changed. It's just strange and not at all what I expected to happen with her.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much no one saw that ~~extremely cliched~~ brilliant twist coming.

[That's what Ohgi gets for not watching Tom and Jerry when he was younger.](http://i.imgur.com/prYnbI4.png) Otherwise, he could have fixed that problem in no time.

Really ... a museum????

That's what any "World of X" thing immediately makes me think of.
>> ARTICLE
> I want to say Villetta's faking memory loss

That'd be cool, but I wanna say that she's not faking because boobs. At the time she was claiming she lost her memory she didn't even realize she was naked (only topless?). If you don't have the awareness to realize you don't have clothes on, how could you construct a plan to infiltrate the Black Knights? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about it. I think faking memory loss would make for a interesting angle, though.
>> ARTICLE
> If you don't have the awareness to realize you don't have clothes on, how could you construct a plan to infiltrate the Black Knights?

Someone else holding a gun and potentially getting ready to shoot you takes a higher priority than clothes. It was apparent after that she wasn't pretending though, with the remark about him being kind.
>> ARTICLE
You really want Suzaku to date Cecile and have Euphy free for some reason, don't you?
World of C=World of cheese. Absolutely brilliant. Would probably make it more interesting to me tbh.
>> ARTICLE
That's the first time I've paired up Cecile and Suzaku! I'm actually keeping track of these things, as pointless as they are. Milly getting thrown into the mix makes it more interesting but right now I'm expecting Suzaku to become Euphemia's knight and eventually a full [Knight Templar](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar) after things go horribly wrong. No happy ending for him.
>> ARTICLE
Yesterday I was thinking Mao was some sort of shut in when he just has an unfortunate power. Thats what I get for just finishing up Welcome to the NHK.

Nunally talked about one of her other brothers so she definitely knows some of her half-siblings.

Lelouch took those photos with him because he planned on erasing himself from Shirleys memory. So from the start he was going to wipe more than just her memory of Zeros identity. It seemed like more of an in the moment decision after what she went through with Mao. I guess it was because he really does care for her and didnt want to drag her into danger ever again.

CC gave Geass to a child. I wonder if theres a reason to that other than being able to groom him from a young age. It obviously didnt work. I hope they show where Mao went wrong causing CC to leave him. Im still wondering how many other times shes given Geass to someone.

How the hell is Mao not dead? He got lit up. At first I thought since Geass grows in power over time, he would eventually be able to heal himself like CC does. Then I thought maybe CC was once human a long time ago and was given Geass herself, and since shes had it for such a long time she now has the ability to give it to others. So after a long enough time those with Geass would turn into whatever race CC now is. I dont know. That was a short crackpot theory I had before Mao said Britannian medicine is amazing.

Cornelia. Now we know the hate Lelouch has for the royal family may only be one sided. Then again, I guess thats always been the case because what reason would his half-siblings have to actually hate their deceased little brother and sister? I wouldnt be surprised if Cornelia switches sides after a confrontation with Zero/Lelouch. Or at least (maybe just before she dies) shell admit she was wrong in her ways and wish Lelouch luck in accomplishing his goals.

Suzaku. Another troubled past. He thinks he did the right thing killing his father, but I think that it was also sort of an accident. He didnt want to do it, and its been eating at him that in the end he went through with it. Hopefully Lelouch can help him work through this.

Cmon though. How can everyone hate Suzaku? No hesitation to help save Nunally. Runs out into machine gun fire to clear a path. Disables a motion sensitive bomb. Then he busts through a window to stop Mao. He must ruin Zeros plans in a big way in the future if theres still dislike for him after this episode. If thats the case, Im hoping Suzaku can redeem himself at some point. I dont want to go through the second half of this series and see that hes still a thorn in Zeros side.
>> ARTICLE
> Lelouch took those photos with him because he planned on erasing himself from Shirleys memory. ... I guess it was because he really does care for her and didnt want to drag her into danger ever again.

That's a terrible way to go about it since it only leads to *everyone else that knows both of them* to wonder what the hell's going on. Soon enough one of the other student council members will try to get Shirley to drop her "act" only to realize that she legitimately doesn't know who Lelouch is now. They're obviously going to come after him to find out what's going on after that. Not only is he burdening her with these massive gaps in her life, he's dragging everyone else into it now.

> I wouldnt be surprised if Cornelia switches sides after a confrontation with Zero/Lelouch.

Not something I've considered before, but I think it's unlikely. She seems to be more loyal to the crown than her siblingsaside from Euphemia. I think Cornelia would betray the empire for her, but that requires Euphemia to rebel first.

> How can everyone hate Suzaku?

Right now I like him more than Lelouch. I think he's misguided about how to effect change in the empire, but he's not manipulative. I can see him doing things down the road to completely screw up Zero's plans though.
>> ARTICLE
I still can't believe Lelouch just let Shirley come back to the school. I thought for sure he would have sent her away somewhere. You're 100% right though, having her there with gaps in her memory is pure trouble.

Sorry boys, this is the end of the line for Code Ment.

Yea, Code Ment was hilarious! Just watched ep 15 and was sad to find out that there is no more..
>> ARTICLE
At least the guy is uploading again.
>> ARTICLE
I'm back. All the responses yesterday was awesome. Nice to know my ~~Geass~~ comments have made you into such devoted followers. 

**Episode 15**

* My ears are bleeding
* "The manifestation of Geass varies  according to the individual" Does that mean Lelouch has his Geass because he is really into BDSM?
* Looks like Mao is the new [Shinkawa Kyouji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnjvcKGACQM) 
* Glad to see Cheese-kun was more than just a cameo
* I see. I was over thinking the plot to this all along. Creepy green haired girl is just using Lelouch to get back at her ex
* I wish [this was a comment face](http://i.imgur.com/vxYEucB.png)
* Looks like you might just be pushing your own repressed emotions out on Crowd Control there
* I'm really surprised Lelouch even puts up with her shit
* I hope Shirley is the one to kill you Lelouch. Preferably before you topple the Britannian government
* God damn it Lelouch stop doing this shit, you're breaking my heart
* If you're looking for Mao, I think you can find him at MgRonalds
* We all know what you betrayed him for Space Dandy &#3232;_&#3232;
* "It doesn't work on me" *Awkwarrrrd*
* Dude has hella good hearing if he can hear what CC is saying while wearing headphones, talking at a distance and having carousel music in the background
* Needs to brush up on his art though
* Crowd Control must be ancient then if she was an adult when Mao was only a kid
* Also it looked medieval when Mao was a kid, so does the Geass grant agelessness? 
* Damn, I should have saved the Bon Jovi lyrics for today
* CC-SAN CC-SAN CC-SAN
* Reminds me of *[school days](http://i.imgur.com/fniVJAx.png)*
* R.I.P
* How the hell can she stand with bullets in all her limbs? she really does heal fast

**Episode 16**

* Crowd Control is a damn fine cosplayer
* Who was that just then? Looked like Mao
* "We're near a garabage dump" *See* Lelouch gets me. I see nothing but trash. 
* (For real though, that scene was horrific)
* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
* Ain't no party like a Mao party 'cause a Mao party don't stop!
* If you're going to get back at him then just kill Nunnally. Don't wait around and give him an opportunity to save her. I swear, villains these days...
* But if I'm being honest I think you should kill Nunnally now rather than later because Nunnally is the one to be afraid of
* If think when it comes to life and death situations, we should always stop to think things over with a nice slice of delicious Pizza Hut Pepperoni Pizza^^TM , available for as little as just $9.99 at your local Pizza Hut restaurant
* SOMEONE JUST KICK OUT THAT FUCKING CAT ALREADY
* **Hot damn!** Who needs 0.05 seconds when you are Suzaku
* "It's beyond human ability" ... "Alright I'll do it" After what he just did I don't even doubt him
* If Lelouch just wanted to take control of the Britannian government then why didn't he just hypno-toad Clovis from the get go? Am I missing something? Would have saved Shirley a ton of heartbreak at the least
* He can even dodge bullets!
* **WHAT THE FUCK HE MATCHED THE SPEED OF THE PENDULUM?!?**
* **WHO IS THIS GUY?!?**
* Oh but now you can't use your Geass on him again. That is going to screw you over later Lelouch.
* What was even the point of commanding him not to talk if he was just going to get shot by CC? Seems a bit of a contrived way to set up his death scene
* Seems as though superhuman Suzaku will be Shinji from now on. Brain dead girl to the rescue! 

And with that over, I can now get round to watching all the currently airing anime. Interested to see how many people I tagged will show up in the comments now. I am prepared for a sea of colours so give me that full rainbow /r/anime

FYI I'm also going to justify Britannia as the source of Suzaku's power from now on!

The manifestation of Geass is weird. According to an AU manga, it can even vary within the *same* person.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, the more you know. Does that mean that a user can develop more than one Geass ability or that it can fluctuate at any point?
>> ARTICLE
No, the Geass you get is the one you're stuck with. It's more that the Geass you do receive varies based on your mindset at the time. For example, in said AU manga, Lelouch's Geass is super strength rather than mind control.
>> ARTICLE
Woah. Makes me wonder what must have brought about Mao's Geass back when CC gave him it.
>> ARTICLE
He was a little kid, presumably an orphan, so maybe deep down he wanted to know what people were thinking in order to understand the world better.  Just speculation really.

HOLY SHIT. I NEVER SAW THAT. HOLY FUCK

>> ARTICLE
He told him not to talk anymore because he was fucking with Suzakus head.

I know, it just felt like it was more set up for the next part when he finally gets what he wanted from CC when he is no longer able to respond.

It's one of the few times Lelouch just loses it. He cares so much for Suzaku, he makes Mao just stop what he is doing, not logically kill him. CC wasn't actually supposed to be there, Lelouch sent her on a mission.

> I hope Shirley is the one to kill you Lelouch.

I would be perfectly okay with that right now.

> If you're going to get back at him then just kill Nunnally. Don't wait around and give him an opportunity to save her. I swear, villains these days...

He likes the theatricality just as much as Lelouch does. That's why I prefer Cornelia as an opponent, she's more pragmatic.
>> ARTICLE
> That's why I prefer Cornelia as an opponent, she's more pragmatic.

Agreed. As much as I love Britannia there is more to like about her character than just that. I think of all the characters I've seen so far, she is the most honest and upfront in the way that she feels and acts without any of the unnecessary crap. 
>> ARTICLE
Why did Lelouch not just slam his hand down on his side of the scale? I get Mao can hear thoughts and all, but Lelouch has damn good reflexes.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as he thought about doing it Mao would just push his side down.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to scream "just put your hand on the scale omg save her!" eraaaaah!
>> ARTICLE
They're pretty far away from the scale  far enough for Mao to react  and Lelouch has already been established as fairly unfit. Who knows if Lelouch could get there before Mao could? Given how fanatical Lelouch is about Nunnally's wellbeing, I doubt he'd take that risk.
>> ARTICLE
That exact thought did occur to me, but then I figured if Mao was smart he would have rigged it so that either side receiving too much pressure would trigger the bomb. It's not like he was going to have a fair fight, why not win either way?

Edit: hell, I would have just drawn Lelouch in there then triggered the bomb halfway through the match. Rules? What rules?

I understand that Lelouch used geass on himself, but how does it make sense that he remembered he used geass on himself? 
>> ARTICLE
Probably just his assumption. He knows what his power does.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't remember that, he just concluded it.
>> ARTICLE
The real question is that, when he assumed he would need to do that, he had realized he was going to lose to Mao. So after he wiped his own memory, wouldn't he have reached the same conclusion again?
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 15:**

* So &#128167; doesnt choose what the geass does; it manifests differently for each person. So, who will wind up getting to be the leader of the Astonishing G-Men?
* Oof. Mao really *cant* turn his geass off; his eyes are glowing all the time. Yet Lelouch can't understand why Mao would be after &#128167;, when hes obsessed with revenge himself. Not that *I* think that Mao is after revenge, but Id think thatd be on the top of Lelouch's mind.
* Heh, so Mao is from China. What a surprise.
* Aww, Shirleykins. And poor Lelouch is having to lie about their relationship and how she's acting. Thats going to be harder on him than the one-and-done of the erasure or burning her diary.
* boobs!
* &#128167;, I love you and your lies. Lelouch, youre an idiot for thinking the geass will work on her. Although, he was smart not to trust her when she said it wouldnt work on her... Alright, I guess he really should have tried.
* Yes, yes, weve gathered that Suzaku wants to kill his father and have se er, wait, this is just a military psychological profile. Carry on, then.
* Oh, god, an amusement park. *That is never good.*
* It seems we know whos Mao vote for best girl is!
* Jesus. She went after him *young.* Thats the sickest thing Ive seen so far in this series. By the time hed gone crazy from the geass, he was still a little kid! no wonder Mao still acts so childishly, impulsively, and possessively. And why he falls prey so easily to Lelouchs taunts. I'm not sure it explains the "cheering," though.
* Huh, so was &#128167;s goal not actually to have Lelouch take care of her old contracts? What *does* she want him to do?

**Episode 16:**

* Nunnally Held Hostage. So, will this be a subversion like Shirley at Gunpoint?
* Is the infiltrator not a reporter? Why did I think he was a reporter? Though, he *is* currently reporting on stuff, just not to a newspaper. Maybe he just reminds me of Kaji from Evangelion?
* &#128167; in a wig! That is crazypants. No, wait; in this world, people still get to see each other off in an airport! Now *that* is crazypants.
* Im curious about the timeline of Lelouchs life. His parents got killed, his sister got medical attention, and then he, his sister, and Suzaku fled on foot through an active warzone?
* MAO IS ALIVE?!  Huh, does that mean Lelouch now has magical healing abilities, too?
* Hahaha! Milly on an omiai with the crazy engineer earl. I love it!
* Oh, dear. That photo of Nunnally all tied up is going in someones spank bank. :(
* Britannican medical science? Really? He got shot *that full of holes* and hes not only alive but running around and kidnapping people? While Nunnally is paralyzed and blind? This is bizarre.
* Mmm, pizza. I wisely ordered some before starting to watching todays episodes, so I can join in, too.
* Its a surprisingly good thing so many people know that Lelouch is in hiding. It can get him allies in odd situations. It's got to become a drawback at *some* point, though, right?
* SUZAKU YOU BAMF. I love you even more now!
* Oh no! [Anchor](http://i.imgur.com/aan5Jh7.png) [death](http://i.imgur.com/oVEunHo.png)! But in this variant its putting the perpetrator at risk, too. Is Mao betting that the bomb won't actually go off, so he'll be safe?
* Poor Sayoko has to wear her nursemaid outfit to the market as well. Thats sad.
* Cornelia is fighting to avenge Lelouch and Nunnally? Of course she is. Why would I have considered it would be any less complicated than that.
* HAHAHA. That is the most dramatic chess scream Ive ever seen. SO MUCH LOVE.  He used geass on himself?! But. How did he hide the process of giving Suzaku the plans from Mao?! Did they go a third of a mile away? If Mao was focusing on either of them, he would have heard.
* Well, thats some info about Suzaku's troubled past that got missed in the psychological profile.
* I want you to go and wait for me in Cs world. So C2 isnt the only geass-giver, then? Is she a bodhisattva to Cs buddha?

Next time on Code Geass, we learn that Arthur the cat also has a geass and has been using it to create fanatical devotion in all those he bites. The show spins off even more rapidly into the antics of the student council and their feline overlord.
>> ARTICLE
This series has a lot of dramatic screams
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch's dad, the Emperor, ain't dead he's the one who sent him and Nunally to a soon to be active war zone just because Lelouch complained about him not doing anything about his mother's death.
>> ARTICLE
Right! How could I have forgotten about the Emperor? That clears up a lot!

So Lelouch and Nunnally's mother was murdered, but the kids were still officially in fine standing so Nunnally got medical care. Lelouch got angry that his father wasn't being more involved with the situation and got an audience in the throne room, where he learned they were basically disowned. Sometime after that, and *sans* amazing cape, Lelouch, Nunnally, and their similarly-situated friend Suzaku fled on foot.

I suspect we'll learn a little more about how Suzaku's life played out after he killed his father -- err, I mean, "his father nobly committed suicide" -- and that will explain why the three escaped together.
>> ARTICLE
The Emperor sent Leouch and Nunally to live with Suzaku's family when he essentially disowned them so that's why they were together after the invasion.  If you remember the first scene of the series was Lelouch and Suzaku playing right as the invasion began and the show has repeatedly said that they're best friends so it'd only be logical for them to go out together after Genbu's "noble suicide."
>> ARTICLE
I do recall them being friends, but I couldn't remember when that friendship began. It seems like what you're saying is that Britannia and Japan had formal relations before the invasion, so it would have been normal for a young Britannian prince to play with the son of the Japanese prime minister. That clears it up a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah all 3 of the major powers (Brittania, EU, Chinese Federation) had political relations with Japan, despite their neutrality, because they had the largest natural supply of sakuradite, which in the code geass world holds the same value as oil in the real world.


Although it's never explicitly stated Lelouch and Nunally were sent to Japan basically in an effort to get more favorable terms on sakuradite, but Brittania being Brittania decided to invade anyway and take Japan (and its sakuradite) for themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Nunnally and the bomb were more than 500m away from Mao and the chess set, or at least that's what Lelouch was suspecting when they were down with her and Suzaku mentioned how big the explosion would be.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, so Mao was just listening in through a camera, he wasn't actually listening telepathically to Lelouch while he was down with Nunnally. I'd thought it must have been closer, since it seemed like Lelouch was trying so hard to distract Mao while playing chess. I guess he was just trying to distract him in hopes of winning the game!
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch *was* distracting Mao so he wouldn't notice Suzaku approaching and waiting nearby.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking hate Mao.
>> ARTICLE
He wasn't around for very long, and yet he has had quite an impact on the main characters. I want to hate him, but he was so interesting. Given powers as an orphan, and then only being at peace when you're around the person who gave you those powers. Kind of fucked up, but the way he turned out makes sense. He ended up being a dick, but his story was interesting, I thought.
>> ARTICLE
he is important to show us the real suzaku, and why he is so desperate to be a hero.  It also show some light into c.c past. The thing about mao is that he is already past crazy, eazy to be hated.
>> ARTICLE
He's also important for foreshadowing [spoilers](/s "lelouch's Geass going out of control").

Really? It's always one of my favorites. Lelouch's strategy always strikes me as surprising and the interaction with Mao and Suzaku is super important.

I think it isn't that they Mao should have stayed dead, but that they should have just made it more convincing that he survived. At least make him a little injured or something, you know? Or shoot him with fewer bullets in 15.

~~I had to go out today. I'm on mobile, which I never do. I'll be back tonight to post my stuff. Fun episodes to discuss today.~~

**Here we go! Unfortunately I have to leave again, but I will respond/comment/discuss later.**

**EPISODE 21**

Suzakus all, wtf, mate?

Is Kallen going off on her own? Rogueing it to find Lelouch?

Lies, lies, lies. Charles, Lelouch knows hes a liar.

The world will throw away the masks. Possibly literally? The world will physically change?

Collection of minds is God. So is that other dimension theyre in God? God is just that realm of reality? So confused.

Marianne speaks very childishly. Come to think of it, wasnt she going to draw on Suzakus face just before he came to? Whats up with that? Hmmm, they were planning on giving Lelouch Code to begin with or are they saying Hey, if he had Code this would have been totally easy. Why? If he had CCs Code would he inherit CCs mind and be able to link with Marianne like she always did?

I thought too much into that. I thought they needed a way in through the door. Marianne can just go talk to them anyway. In she goes.

OMG emotions. Lelouch is meeting his [mother!](http://www.gfycat.com/UntimelyBaggyBrahmancow) Im a little disappointed he didnt run up and hug her, but its still sweet. And Marianne said this was her original appearance. Wonder if theres more to that.

Charles lost his mother, and then set out to change the world. He and Lelouch are too similar.

So CC and Marianne agreed to help Charles and VV. Guess they were all on good terms once.

So Marianne told everyone to leave so she could talk with VV VV you tiny shit. They were falling in love. Woman has led man astray since the beginning of time. Thats your reason MOTHERFUCKER. Fuck you, VV.

Marianne can enter other peoples minds. Why has her power been dormant? Holy hell, how shocked must Nunnally have been after they just placed her under her mothers dead body?

Charles really hates lies. Still, even ~eight minutes in hes looking like hes a much better person than we thought.

It was necessary. Quote of the show. Fucked up things happened/are happening/will happen. Everyone has to do what they must to achieve their goals.

Ok, so Charles sent Lelouch and Nunnally away so VV wouldnt kill them too, AND he kept Mariannes body safe. I dont know if I like that he turned out to be a pretty good guy, but Im ok with it for now. Lets see if he ends up doing something evil after killing God. Oh and he rewrote their memories to protect them. Makes sense. Turns out hes a pretty decent father, I guess.

Uuuugggghhhh. I have a bad feeling.

Hehe, Lelouch was a chess piece himself.

Suzaku is going to do something stupid here.

Ok, so if all of them now have good intentions, will their plan to kill God backfire in order to cause more problems to solve? Wtf even is God? Still dont know. How were they able to research something like this, yet alone find out about it in the first place?

This is all such a mind fuck. Still have that bad feeling. Charles will kill CC and take her code to finish killing God who is the planet aka everyone on Earths minds. Will everyone die? Or just their consciences?

Suzaku and Lelouch teaming up, sort of. At least they seem to be in agreement about what needs to be done. Guess Suzaku wont do something stupid for now. Lelouch doesnt want this boring stagnant world Charles has planned.

Theres the bad feeling creeping closer. Nooooooooo! Marianne will be Lelouchs enemy. :(

Forcing your good intentions on others is no different than an evil act. Oh, Lelouch. At least you realize it now.

Lelouch is finally coming around. Oh oh, hes going to Geass God holy shit. Oh, and how convenient his [Geass just evolved to full power.](http://www.gfycat.com/CircularNauticalChrysomelid) Unless of course, this is how it evolves. It grows stronger because Lelouch truly desires this. Whatever, Im down. Do it, Lulu.

[Be gone.](http://www.gfycat.com/BrilliantMiserlyGnu)

Well that was all very interesting. I sort of expected something more if Im being honest. Marianne, you broke my heart. Ive been waiting this whole time to meet you, hoping you were going to help Lelouch, and now this.

So Waldstein had some sort of connection with Charles or something. He seemed to know first that Charles had failed. He is the only other Geass user that we know of, correct?

Lelouch is the person who murdered Euphy. What of it? Lelouch doesnt give a shit anymore, Suzaku.

Everyone is missing. In Cambodia.

Oh, hell no. Lelouch is taking the throne? Hes emperor? Baller.

YES! Im the one who took his life. [FUCK YEAH, SUZAKU!](http://www.gfycat.com/DarlingEverlastingGrub) Well this is fucking awesome. OMG Knight of Zero. Love it. Perfect.

Holy fuck. This is amazing. This entire scene may have been my favorite in the series so far. When those guards rushed at Lelouch and he just sits there unfazed as Suzaku drops from the ceiling with his spin kick. Hell yes! Ive always pointed out how I like it when these two work together. Oh man, oh so good. But it is sort of messed up. They want to change the world, and are now doing it by force, technically. Just like Charles and Marianne. Everybody thinks their way of doing things is best.

So Schneizel will be the final boss after all.

That final ED picture makes perfect sense now, and I love it.

**EPISODE 22**

Oh, hey Black Knights. Lelouch did kind of want to destroy Britannia. Hes finally doing it. Then again, hes doing it by ordering these people to be my slaves. Holy hell. Here we go. Looks like CC doesnt like what theyre doing. Jeremiah is the only one who can stop this.

Nina. Please dont screw this up. Please dont.

The problem at hand? And also Schneizels plan?

[Suzaku.](http://www.gfycat.com/PeriodicFancyBasenji) Badass mode activated. This technically fits his character now. Best chance of changing things now is with Lelouch, and he just dgaf anymore. Neither of them do.

Oh yeah. The Zero Requiem. Forgot to mention that.

No! Not at Ashford! Ninas there!

Rakshata is lazy. Shes a genius, but shes lazy. Always laying around.

Advanced Geass counter measures? How did you do that in one month? You should not even have the technology to accomplish that. Zero destroyed pretty much everything Geass.

[Kallen,](http://www.gfycat.com/DeafeningPeskyIndianabat) what could he realistically do? Besides, you know he does care. That music was quite nice.

Tamaki you flip flopper, just shut up.

Hahaha! [Suzaku just busts through the roof.](http://www.gfycat.com/HardtofindCharmingHectorsdolphin) Are you guys trying to fuck with Lelouch? BOOM!

Awwww man, Tianzi is so scared. Kaguya too. She must feel betrayed, but she was always a bit delusional about her relationship with Zero.

Lelouch knows. Good move capturing Nina. Very nice as well to let Rivalz go.

So this is what Lelouch is bringing everyone together for? To defeat Schneizel? That floating castle is the thing Todo flies towards in the OP. Final boss stage.

Nunnally. Great. Now I have to wait to find out what this is all about. Actually, Sayoko is shown in the preview. Guess they didnt actually die.

I think God is an abstract entity with no real form that I guess somehow resides in the collective unconscious.  The show was never too clear about it.

> OMG emotions. Lelouch is meeting his mother! Im a little disappointed he didnt run up and hug her, but its still sweet.

Well he's understandably a little skeptical at first given that in his mind he saw her murdered in front of him.

> Thats your reason MOTHERFUCKER. Fuck you, VV.

Rolo was an eerie echo of VV just as much as Lelouch is of Charles.  Hooray for history repeating itself.

> Will everyone die? Or just their consciences?

Their plan was essentially to go all End of Evangelion on everybody by merging everyone living and dead into one being.  That way there's no more lies because well everyone is the same person.  It's kind of an extreme way of ensuring honesty, to put it mildly.

> Holy fuck. This is amazing. This entire scene may have been my favorite in the series so far. 

I was so psyched for this thread today to see reactions just like yours.  This scene was so surprising the first time I watched because I just kept thinking to myself "what exactly is Lelouch's end goal here," it was so confusing and mind blowing.  Him taking the position that he despised the most.

> Jeremiah is the only one who can stop this.

He is far too loyal to disobey anything Lelouch says unless it involves putting Lelouch himself in harms way.

> Suzaku. Badass mode activated.

I think this part is also part of why people hate Suzaku from earlier in the series because he was so sanctimonious back then about always doing things the right way and following the rules, yet when the chips are down he just ends up punting all that for an ends justify the means philosophy.  People find it really hypocritical.

> Suzaku spin kicks while in mechs too.

Not his first mech spin kick though.  He did it to Lelouch way back in episode 2 when Lelouch was casually orchestrating the Shinjuku resistance from the abandoned building.

> Oh yeah. The Zero Requiem. Forgot to mention that.

Biggest macguffin ever.  Better off forgetting about it.

> No! Not at Ashford! Ninas there!

THe FLEIJA was a real eye opener for her.  Actually seeing the consequences of her actions laid out for her in person gave her some much needed perspective.

> Advanced Geass counter measures? How did you do that in one month?

The only counter measures they really need are visors or other physical barriers to Lelouch making direct eye contact with anyone.  No direct eye contact no geass for Lelouch.

> Kallen, what could he realistically do? Besides, you know he does care. That music was quite nice.

Well think about it this way: Kallen is an 18 year old girl who has had her mind and heart severely fucked with by Lelouch over the last 2 years.  First, she had to deal with the earth shaking reveal that Zero (who she admired greatly and probably had a crush on) and Lelouch Lamperouge (an annoying Britannian classmate who seemingly thought he was above it all) were the same person.  After coming to terms with the fact that those 2 extremely disparate identities were the same person she begins to fall in love with him again only to be taken prisoner by Xingke.  While a prisoner of Britannia she finds out even more about Lelouch that she didn't know before courtesy of Nunnally and if anything this cements the fact the she's fallen for him.  Then right after being successfully rescued Lelouch tells her right to her face that he's been using her the whole time and she was nothing more than an asset to him, but then he tells her that she has to live.  Now at Ashford before she kisses him what she wants from Lelouch is to really know what she means to him.  This time without the complication of him being at gunpoint.  She just finally wants the truth from him.  Lelouch could've been honest with her and told her how he felt, but you'll see (Kallen will too) that there are reasons why he couldn't tell her right in this moment.

> So this is what Lelouch is bringing everyone together for? To defeat Schneizel?

The Black Knights and Schneizel are united in their opposition of Lelouch.  So if anything Lelouch is the final boss stage for the black knights.

Haven't watched Evangelion, but from what I can guess its basically merging everyone's mind to form a single conscious. Like a Reaper from Mass Effect. Right?

That's just fucked up. So technically humanity wouldn't even exist? What's the point? And EoE comparison, I've never seen it. I don't get 90% of the comparisons everyone draws in these threads...yet. Still new, have to keep watching more shows.

> He is far too loyal to disobey anything Lelouch says unless it involves putting Lelouch himself in harms way.

The only way Jeremiah would is if he found out about Marianne. I sort of meant it more like a joke though. Obviously orange is the color of loyalty.

> yet when the chips are down he just ends up punting all that for an ends justify the means philosophy. People find it really hypocritical.

I thought it was good character development. He realized his way wasn't working. Well apparently Lelouch proposed a plan that would easily work given the amount of power his Geass now has. Teaming up with Lelouch is the best way to change things now so Suzaku's finally said "fuck it." He still wants to change things, but is tired of waiting. I mean, realistically Suzaku's plan should've taken a long ass time, even a decade. There's no way he would've climbed the ranks high enough in one year to make a difference in the world.

> Not his first mech spin kick though. He did it to Lelouch way back in episode 2 when Lelouch was casually orchestrating the Shinjuku resistance from the abandoned building.

Haha, did he? That was so long ago. I didn't remember.

> The only counter measures they really need are visors or other physical barriers to Lelouch making direct eye contact with anyone. No direct eye contact no geass for Lelouch.

Yeah, wow. I was curious about the visors, but you laid it out pretty simply for me. All they need is dark enough glasses so he can't see their eyes.
>> ARTICLE
> That's just fucked up. So technically humanity wouldn't even exist? What's the point?

It was a weird metaphysical ideal world in their mind.  They believed that if everyone was the same being with the same mind that there would be no more lies, no more hatred, no more wars, no more poverty, etc.  However, they ignored the downside that there would be no more individuality, no more love, no more friendship, etc.  They believed that by making everyone into one it would solve all humanity's problems, depsite the fact that they were doing it without anyone's consent and essentially would've stripped all people of free will.

> The only way Jeremiah would is if he found out about Marianne.

Even though it's not explicitly stated one way or the other I could see Lelouch having told him about it and I think Jeremiah would probably believe him and understand.  As seen when he spoke about his reticence Cornelia as prisoner Jeremiah is just about loyal to the whole royal family not Marianne exclusively.

> I thought it was good character development. He realized his way wasn't working.

I totally agree I never actually had much of an issue with Suzaku and what he did here.  In a way he and Lelouch met in the middle of their philosophies both giving in a little from their original stances.  I think also a lot of the hate is because he was constantly thwarting Lelouch and people just wanted Lelouch to win all the time always.

**POST EPISODE(S) THOUGHTS**

Ugh, I dont necessarily like that Nunnally and Sayoko werent killed in the FLEIJA, if thats actually the case. I mean, I didnt really expect Nunnally to be dead, I certainly didnt want her dead in the first place, but if they killed her off it wouldve been alright. Lelouch was finally moving forward, and now he has to deal with this. At least it will be interesting to see how he handles it.

I feel like I dont even want to make theories anymore. I mean, there are only three episodes left anyway. All of the mystery of the show for me revolved around Geass and Charles. What was going to happen with killing God? Who is God? Where is Marianne? What happened to her? Forty plus episodes being teased about that stuff. Then in just one single episode almost every question is answered, and it was ultimately barely important. Charles wasnt an evil bastard. I mean, he kind of was, but his motivations and intentions were similar to Lelouch so *I* dont think he was that bad. The consequences definitely wouldve been much worse than anything Lelouch has done though. Anyway, he wasnt that evil. Marianne turned out to be on Charles side. Then theres CC who knew about all of this and never told Lelouch any of it. She was really going along with Charles/Marianne/VV this whole time, but just now decided that their plan was actually wrong? Meh.

There are still unanswered questions. How the hell did Geass originate? Why is there some random ass planet of collective human consciousness? Who are all of those Geass/Code children? Where is Mariannes body? I dont know if all of this will be answered in the following three episodes, but the plot seems to be focusing more on the mundane now. How can Lelouch unite the world? What is his goal once he defeats Schneizel?

Anyway. I do think Kallen will end up fighting on Lelouchs side one more time. I think itd be cool to see her and Suzaku kick some ass together with the two most OP mechs in the show. I mean seriously, Suzaku thrashed the Knights of the Round and their squads by himself with almost no effort. Imagine what the Lancelot and the Guren could do together.

We definitely need to keep an eye on Nina. I really hope she doesnt, but she could still end up causing trouble.

If nothing else I just want Lelouch to tell the truth. For fucks sake. I know the guy is a bit of liar, but this is when you need to tell the truth. Explain what Charles was planning. That you met your long deceased mother. What wouldve happened to the world if you werent there to stop them. At least tell Schneizel, Cornelia, and especially Nunnally. Lelouch has some big plans in the works, so Im not sure if those would give everyone a reason to still hate him. He seems like hes doing some good, and since Suzaku is in on it Ill buy what theyre selling for now.

[Fug it, thoughts on the future](/s "Lelouch is just trying to piss off as many people as possible so that the entire world rallies against him. They need a common enemy. He has nothing left to live for anyway (except maybe Nunnally now), but if everyone else can band together against him, then maybe when hes captured/dies the world will be at peace. Also Nunnally becomes Empress because Charles was 98th Emperor, Lelouch is 99th, and so 100 is a nice number to end the show on.")

Oh. And when is Nunnally going to open her eyes?

Oh ho.

[crazier future thoughts](/s "Actually, crap this might not work. Well maybe. Lelouch kills CC so she can be at peace. He now has Code. He gives Nunnally Geass so that she can make the world a better place. Then Lelouch somehow dies, though I dont know how he would so I guess he just wanders off and becomes a lumberjack.")

[crazier future thoughts](/s "Then Lelouch wanders off and becomes a lumberjack.")

A lot of folks seem to want a slice of life high school comedy, but *this* is the show that I actually want.

Although, I've slowly been won over by the slice of life high school comedy, so I suppose I could settle for a high school comedy with omake of [cft](/s "lumberjack Lelouch") at the end of each episode.

> Marianne speaks very childishly. Come to think of it, wasnt she going to draw on Suzakus face just before he came to? Whats up with that?

I didn't give much thought to that earlier but it makes me wonder how she was as a mother. Was she acting like that because she was stuck in Anya's body for years, or was she always that way?

> Will everyone die? Or just their consciences?

I think Charles and Marianne were going for the Tang ending there.

> Jeremiah is the only one who can stop this.

[Here's the twist ending I'd like to see now](/s "Suzaku learns that Jeremiah was wholly dedicated to Marianne and that's why he serves Lelouch now, so Suzaku tells him about how Marianne was still alive and Lelouch killed her. Jeremiah then goes berserk and de-Geasses everyone, including Suzaku who then proceeds to take out Lelouch and himself together.")

> All of the mystery of the show for me revolved around Geass and Charles. What was going to happen with killing God? Who is God? Where is Marianne? What happened to her? Forty plus episodes being teased about that stuff. Then in just one single episode almost every question is answered, and it was ultimately barely important.

Yeah, for all of the Marianne stuff building up it ended really damn quickly.

> Marianne: Your father wanted to protect you, join us!

> Charles: We shall all be together, even your beloved Euphie!

> Lelouch: No thanks.

And... that's about it. And CC was just kind of *there* for it, she didn't seem inclined to help one way or the other or even try to defend herself.

> How the hell did Geass originate? Why is there some random ass planet of collective human consciousness? Who are all of those Geass/Code children? Where is Mariannes body?

I'm willing to bet that *none* of those get answered as the show returns to the mundane worldly affairs for the remainder of the series, aside from handling CC's fate.

[Thoughts on the future](/s "That seems to be the common theory now, Lelouch unites the world by being the biggest asshole ever. Of course, if that happens and he dies, that leaves CC alone yet again. Not counting that out, but it seems unlikely.")

That's why I don't think they will. Who could stand against them?

On the other hand, the two most advanced Knightmares in the series fighting *against* each other...

It'll be the first time in the whole series I can think of that Kallen and Suzaku would have been on equal footing, technologically speaking. Suzaku had flight when Kallen didn't, then Kallen had a 9th-generation mecha and Suzaku didn't, now they'll finally both have equal power underneath their belt.

> That's why I don't think they will. Who could stand against them?

There's also the small matter of Lelouch having broken Kallen's heart.  The biggest barrier to her teaming up with Lelouch and Suzaku isn't their ideology or methods it's the fact that Lelouch has made this extremely personal now by seemingly toying with her feelings for the better part of 2 years.  She was ready to take a bullet for him and then he told her that she was essentially a chess piece to him.  Everyone knows the old saying *Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned*, well that's Kallen now.

You'll see that not killing them has it's advantages, but so did the appearance of them being dead.  Essentially Code Geass wanted to have it's cake and eat it too with this situation.

>  She was really going along with Charles/Marianne/VV this whole time, but just now decided that their plan was actually wrong?

I think CC decided a while ago that their plan was wrong.  I think the latest point she was considering going along with it was right before she sealed off her code.  CC realized over time that what Charles and Marianne were trying to do was weirdly selfish and shortsighted given that making everyone living and dead into one being isn't right since it robs everyone of their individuality and free will.

> We definitely need to keep an eye on Nina. I really hope she doesnt, but she could still end up causing trouble.

Keeping an eye on Nina is smart.  She's still hanging around for a reason other than giving Pizza Hut an easy path to product placement.

> If nothing else I just want Lelouch to tell the truth. For fucks sake. I know the guy is a bit of liar, but this is when you need to tell the truth.

Lelouch has never been interested in the truth unless it served the end he was trying to accomplish.  Why would he change now?  Anyway absolutely no one would believe him at this point.  He's destroyed all trust that anybody outside of Suzaku, CC, and Jeremiah had in him.

I agree completely.  I always enjoy the anticipation of a character finding out what we already know as an audience much more than the reveal of something that's supposed to shock us.  It's always more fun being in on the surprise than being the one surprised.

**Episode 21: The Ragnarok Connection**

- We open with Mariannya about to draw on an unconscious Suzaku. That's kind of adorable.     
- Suzaku's reaction to that is pretty much what mine is. Glad you're so open about it, Marianne.    
- I'm not sure what Kallen's so conflicted about. Lelouch made it pretty clear to her back in episode 19. The curse of rank 100 loyalty, it seems.     
- So Lelouch and Charles, separated from the world and isolated, the two mortal enemies... sit down to chat.       
- Well this show just turned all Evangelion on us. Did the writers feel like philosophizing all of a sudden?            
- Answers. Answers, at last!     
- And Marianne's murderer is.... VV. Huh. Because the contract with Charles was in jeopardy. Wait, didn't one of the past episodes say VV loved Marianne? I don't know anymore.     
- Holy shit, Marianne put her mind inside Anya. /u/Durinthal was RIGHT.       
- Schneizel and the Black Knights working together is never not going to be weird.     
- Suzaku says CC and he aren't alike because she has no regrets. Meanwhile, his life IS regret.      
- Whoa, Lelouch and Nunnally were exiled to *protect* them? And Marianne, hate to break it to you, but your body probably isn't in the best shape after all this time.     
- I just noticed that even Charles calls her Euphy. That's kind of cute.      
- OK, so I know WHY Charles is doing this, but I still dont know WHAT it is. What will it even do?     
- So Jupiter is God? Man, I have no fucking idea anymore.     
- Not gonna lie, I have no idea what just happened in like the last four minutes. So... Lelouch Geassed the will of humanity to not freeze time. That's what I'm getting.     
- Well that sure was a thing.       
- Aaaaaand sudden timeskip!       
- And now Lelouch is Emperor.        
- And he and Suzaku are on the same side now. All craziness of that aside, I do like the wordplay of "Knight of Zero." I wonder if that was planned from the moment the show directors decided to call Lelouch's alter ego Zero?     
- And Lelouch forces the rest of the royals to obey him with Geass. Well done.       
- Schneizel, on the other hand, doesn't seem too perturbed. And there he is holding the White King. Symbolism~~~     

**Episode 22: Emperor Lelouch**

- It strikes me that I could have learned a lot about where this show was heading if I'd just read all of the episode titles ahead of time.      
- My god Lelouch what the fuck is that outfit.       
- On the good side, he's liberated the Numbers and abolished the aristocracy. On the bad side, he's now a slave-ordering dictator. On the ugly side, *oh my god Lelouch what the fuck is that outfit*     
- I wonder what Nina is working on. Super-FLEIJA?      
- Oh, she's just hiding out from countries that either want her for themselves, or want her dead. Nina's probably Redditing.       
- "I'm totally going to improve the world by killing everyone and taking it over!" Er, Lelouch....       
- Zero Requiem. Now there's an interesting name. I wonder if we'll find out about that or Schneizel's "Damocles" plan first.       
- Whoa Suzaku looks buff as fuck. But his outfit also looks stupid as fuck too. Even worse than Lelouch's, now that we see it up close.      
- And the Knights of the Rounds are making a counter-rebellion! ...with a black lady who hasn't been seen in the show before to my knowledge!      
- There's Suzaku's answer to the Guren SEITEN. Code Geass SEED Destiny, here we go. If Kallen's Guren is the Destiny, does that make this new Lancelot the Strike Freedom?     
- I mean, it sure has the unnecessary gold trim to be the Strike Freedom.      
- And there goes the Knight of the Round who we just met.     
- And there goes Bismarck's Geass. We saw him using it in person against Suzaku, though, so does unsealing it actually make a difference?      
- I'm not sure how "live!" supersedes seeing the future, but at this point I'm just gonna roll with it.      
- Speaking of Gundam SEED, Gino's despair there sure did sound a lot like Kira Yamato. I'm onto you, Soichiro Hoshi.       
- Lelouch orders the site of negotiations to be Ashford Academy! I smell wacky high school reunion hijinx!     
- Can we please have wacky high school reunion hijinx? I'd watch that show.       
- Lelouch, you may have turned people into slaves, but giving Rivalz the cold shoulder like that? That's *low.*      
- This conversation between Kallen and Lelouch is sad, but I'm really distracted by her walking animation. Is she in heels?      
- And now that finally makes three kisses. Shirley, CC, Kallen.      
- Nobody trusts Lelouch's apparent goodwill! And good, with good reason.      
- With very good reason.        
- Okay, assuming that Nina *was* working on something, and it's important to the plot... is Rivalz about to do something important? Holy shit.      
- LOL NOPE he just got caught. But now Lelouch has Nina. Oops.      
- Oh. Wow, I wasn't expecting that. So Pendragon got FLEIJA'd?       
- And this floating, FLEIJA-armed fortress is Damocles. That answers my question from earlier in this episode.      
- HAHAHA OH SHIT NUNNALLY        
- Well fucking played, Schneizel.              

Thought: It seems like my prediction that Schneizel will be the Final Boss is coming true, except... only from the perspective of Lelouch. Schneizel may be Lelouch's final boss, but from the perspective of literally everyone else, the Final Boss is... Lelouch himself. And that's hilarious. 

Edit: I just had an idea based on my references to Gundam SEED about what Nina is actually working on. This is like... 30% serious: Nina, in her guilt over FLEIJA, is developing a technology based on the Gefjun Disturbers to cancel all Sakuradite operation in a given wide area: FLEIJA, Knightmares, anything else. It's called the S-Jammer, and it's introduced in episode 23. In Episode 24, Schneizel reveals that he anticipated this and reveals that he'd had his own scientists develop the S-Jammer Canceler, which allows Sakuradite to work. In episode 25, Lelouch reveals that he anticipated the anticipation and reveals Nina's S-Jammer Canceler Inhibitor, which prevents Sakuradite from functioning. Again. 

Okay, the FIRST part was serious. The rest was just silly.

> This conversation between Kallen and Lelouch is sad, but I'm really distracted by her walking animation. Is she in heels?

I was distracted by that animation, too. Kallen's always worn heels in her uniforms, though. You'd think that stability would be important for a pilot, but it seems Kallen having a perky butt trumps all in this show.

No, those heels mesh with the foot pedals inside the mech.  Like special bicycle shoes.

I could totally see Nina and Rakshata being hardcore redditors.

The 10-year reunion.  Rivalz be all like "So yeah, next month I'm being promoted to *District Manager* for all the Pizza Huts in the prefecture!  How about you, Lelouch?  Er uh, never mind.  *[sips beer]*".

>And now that finally makes three kisses. Shirley, CC, Kallen.

Poor Lady Kaguya.

I think the idea behind 'live' beating future sight is that with the geass, Suzaku is operating at 'peak efficiency' or something to that effect, so even if you can see what he's doing, if you can't react to it, it doesn't matter.

I forgot about that, but yeah I think someone asked if VV loved Marianne. CC, maybe? 

> Holy shit, Marianne put her mind inside Anya. /u/Durinthal was RIGHT.

Small victories, just seemed to be the most probable mechanic. You were effectively right about Bismarck's which makes much less sense to me.

> Not gonna lie, I have no idea what just happened in like the last four minutes. So... Lelouch Geassed the will of humanity to not freeze time. That's what I'm getting.

Yeah, that's all I really got from that too.

> It strikes me that I could have learned a lot about where this show was heading if I'd just read all of the episode titles ahead of time.

I made a point of avoiding them after noticing the first several were pretty blunt.

> Schneizel may be Lelouch's final boss, but from the perspective of literally everyone else, the Final Boss is... Lelouch himself. And that's hilarious. 

Lelouch is embracing his evil villain side, and I can accept that.


>> ARTICLE
> I'm not sure what Kallen's so conflicted about. Lelouch made it pretty clear to her back in episode 19.

Kallen knows by now that grandstanding big proclamation Lelouch is the least honest Lelouch there is.  Plus there's the whole fact that he told her that she had to live, which went against everything he had just said.

> Well this show just turned all Evangelion on us.

At least it was still animated instead of weird napkin drawings...

> Schneizel and the Black Knights working together is never not going to be weird.

The more I see it the weirder it gets.

> Wait, didn't one of the past episodes say VV loved Marianne? I don't know anymore.

CC asked him that but never got an answer.  I think VV was just catty and possessive like Rolo.  He knew that three's a crowd so the bitch had to go.

> OK, so I know WHY Charles is doing this, but I still dont know WHAT it is. What will it even do?

The gist that I've gotten from reading explanation elsewhere was that he basically wanted to merge everyone living and dead into one being...which is very Evangelion-esque.

> And now Lelouch is Emperor.

I love that Lelouch didn't have the decency to dress up a bit for his first appearance as emperor because anime loves school uniforms.

> My god Lelouch what the fuck is that outfit.

Seriously he looks a retarded sailor.  At least Charles outfit was bad ass.  Maybe he would've been better off wearing his zero outfit without the mask.

> Nina's probably Redditing.

/u/rascorpia confirmed as Nina.  It all makes sense.  The xenophobic hatred of numbers.  Proclaiming all things Britannian as the best and even the obsession with Cornelia.  Euphy's dead and gone so why not move on to the other li Britannia sister.  I am so smart.

> But his outfit also looks stupid as fuck too.

What do you really expect when they have [CC](http://i29.tinypic.com/30sd4r9.jpg) as their main fashion advisor?

> Zero Requiem. Now there's an interesting name.

It's the password to their pizza hut account.

> Can we please have wacky high school reunion hijinx? I'd watch that show.

Yes.  This a million times yes.

> but I'm really distracted by her walking animation.

I've always felt the same thing.  I guess they were running low on budget at this point and how to skimp on stuff like normal walking for more Knightmare battles.

> So Pendragon got FLEIJA'd?

Yup they're all dead.

> Well fucking played, Schneizel.

But...but...I think the Emperor outfit is fabulous. I mean, I've seen criticism of Lelouch, but never on his fashion sense.

Suzaku's outfit is terrible no doubts about that. Somehow makes me think he's a knight by day and stripper by night.

> I've seen criticism of Lelouch, but never on his fashion sense

Lelouch nailed it with the Zero outfit, but that hat as emperor is god awful.  Especially with the little hanging jewel thingmabob.  I'd find that incredibly distracting and probably be playing with it all day long.
>> ARTICLE
>distracting and probably be playing with it all day long.

See? That outfit was designed with the practicality of boredom in mind. Plus, a guy that can type with both hands at once, and come up with 16 different possible identities for Mao in a second, won't be distracted by such a small jewel.

Oh, the memories. I hated the idea of Nunnally surviving at first, until I read this:

Turn 21

* Here starts the beginning of the end.

* [Marianne:](http://i.imgur.com/GkumCMq.jpg) The first time Ive been able to interact with someone in years, and you dont even let me do my Jigglypuff routine.

* This episodes version of Ragnarok is gonna end up being better than the Thor version.

* Lol. [Tamakis still upset about Zero.](http://i.imgur.com/07y7cnN.jpg) His loyalty grade should have been higher. Maybe Lelouch was rating him in comparison to Jeremiah.

* [Cool how the Sword begins taking the form of a double-helix DNA strand.](http://webm.land/media/58Kh.webm) Really solidifies the idea that God is what we make of Him.

* Lelouch and Charles have both good points but on opposite ends of the spectrum: Lelouch argues that deception is necessary as long as it makes peoples lives better in the long run, while Charles believes that lies, no matter how noble their intention, will ultimately end in ruin. Considering how the BK (I cant stop thinking of Burger King when I write it that way) have all completely turned their backs on Lelouch, due in part to his lies, Im more inclined to believe the latter as of now.

* So, from what I gather from C.C., Charles plan is not so much to kill God as it is to kill the concept of lying from peoples minds altogether, and in doing so he will become the worlds new God. Getting a real Light Yagami vibe from this guy.

* [Marianne is starting to sound pretty callous.](http://webm.land/media/bF7H.webm) Completely disregarding C.C.s life for her own wants? I mean, I know C.C. wants to die, but you dont need to say it like that. Speaking of which, is it possible for a person to have more than one Code? It sure sounds like it. I guess it makes sense, but considering that just one Code by itself gives you immortality, agelessness, mind-fuckery abilities, and the power to bestow Geass, most people never really need more than one.

* C.C. finally points out the obvious parallel between Suzaku and herself.

* [Girl, even Nina would say youre trying too hard.](http://i.imgur.com/pHq3tEU.jpg)

* Charles is so charismatic that while telling his side of the story, I actually sort of started rooting for him. I blame that majestic voice. Its like just below Crispin Freemans in terms of badassery.

* Im kind of jumping the gun here, but these are two points that can pretty much only be addressed at the same time. So, remember when /u/Neawia said: The murder was staged, maybe? Oh man, if Lelouchs mother ends up being a bad guy Im gonna be disappointed. Absolutely brilliant call, man. It sucks the second part ended up being true.

* From the beginning of time, its always been the woman whos led the man astray. If youre referring to Eve tempting Adam to eat the fruit in the Garden, its pretty much been accepted by most theology scholars that Adam was there watching the whole thing from the beginning. She didnt tempt him as much as just pass it to him.

* But, who cares? [V.V.s got shit to fuck up!](http://webm.land/media/D0qK.webm)

* [What the hell is it with the Britannian royal family and mind-altering Geasses?](http://webm.land/media/N2qG.webm) Speaking of which, what would happen if *her* Geass overloaded? Would she just keep collapsing, accidentally overshadowing any random person in a crowd? Unless they had those special contacts back then, too.

* [V.V. must absolutely suck at picking up on peoples body language. Or angered growls.](http://webm.land/media/tLnw.webm)

* I wanna get a shot with Ground Zero in the background. I dont know if that was meant to be a pun, but Im taking it as one.

* Get off the screen, Nina.

* I gave up my humanity long ago. Speaking of lies, C.C. needs to stop lying to herself. She knows she cares about Lelouch and what might happen to him.

* Ah, Charles did care. Doesnt make him any less megalomaniacal nor make upset when he gets axed off in a few minutes, but at least he sort of tried.

* I wanna know how that rewriting of Nunnallys memories went down. Did Charles just do it, then run and hide behind the staircase before they fired the bullets and Lelouch came down?

* You guys were close with your theory that Charles needed Geass-users to power the Sword. Its powered by Code, not merely Geass. So thats why they needed as many Code-bearers as possible.

* It kind of runs in Lelouchs blood to use people as chess pieces.

* [Lelouch has damn good hearing to have been able to pick up on two pairs of barely audible footsteps.](http://webm.land/media/RfRt.webm)

* How about we tack a how onto that that why regarding Charles use of the Sword?

* Charles using Lelouchs own love for his sisters against him. Nice.

* For anyone wondering what [this](http://i.imgur.com/Br4FkaG.jpg) means, lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate is Italian for abandon all hope, ye who enter, referencing the inscription above the gates of hell in Italian author, Dante Alighieris, epic poem *Inferno*.

* Aww. [Anya was using Cheese-kun as a pillow.](http://i.imgur.com/OC9XZ5e.jpg)

* Although the sense of politics will have changed greatly. Is it even possible to have politics without the ability to lie?

* [Marianne looks like a cat that got hit the face with a frying pan.](http://i.imgur.com/4uuroRM.jpg)

* Nice that Lelouch is pretty much just flat-out admitting that he has more of a reason for his actions than just Nunnally.

* Sorry, hon, but Ive learned from Future Diary that even God cant bring back the dead. Then again, the Bible said He can, so Lets just call it a toss-up and go home. The fact that a world without lies would be boring as fuck is a good enough reason. (Imagine if you had to make your Reddit username your real name? How dull would that be? Unless your NSA. But would that still even be a thing in a world without lies?)

* Forcing your good intentions on others is no different from an evil act. Thats why the Synthesis ending is bullshit. Control all the way, bitches.

* [Im sure the Lelouch-haters out there are all busy calling Lelouch out as a hypocrite, but Im just having fun enjoying JYBs badass speech.](http://webm.land/media/GwM3.webm)

* You dont give a damn about the future! Third fucking time Ive made a Great Gatsby comparison with this show. What the fuck?

* Lelouch is right. While lies can be used to harm, they can also be used to help, like how Suzaku thinks to himself about how Euphie and Shirley lied about knowing who Zero was in order to protect Lelouch.

* [This scene is so fucking epic. Lelouch fucking Geassing God (well, more pleading with Him, but whatever) and hes actually winning. Plus the music and everything Damn, I love this show.](http://webm.land/media/vHKL.webm)

* [Fuck. Yes.](http://webm.land/media/A2Mu.webm)

* Realitys own response to Charles and Marianne attempting to kill it is to just subvert the Code and fuck them both. Holy shit, I love this show. (RIP /u/rascorpias dream, though.)

* [And so, it ends.](http://webm.land/media/5IZ1.webm) (I feel like Im just posting the entire end sequence at this point.)

* When death comes, you want to at least be smiling, right? Yes, you do, my dear. Yes, you do.

* Lelouch is just like, Dude, we literally *just* made the choice to reject reuniting with Euphie and all the others. After giving up an opportunity like that, you have no place to talk.

* [Fuckin time skips.]( http://i.imgur.com/CgGB4L0.png) This is what happens when your airing schedule gets fucked up. /s

* [Guinevere still looks like a damn meth addict.](http://i.imgur.com/Je37TFZ.jpg)

* Wheres his majesty? Bitch, youre looking at him. Better kneel if you know whats good for you.

* Odysseus seemed pretty genuinely happy to see Lelouch again. Too bad for him that Lulu isnt exactly in a forgiving mood.

* [THERE IT IS! THERES THE SPINZAKU WE HAVENT SEEN IN SO LONG!](http://webm.land/media/VxNI.webm)

* I grant him the title Knight of Zero. Did you seriously pick the name Zero all the way back just so you could make that pun?

* [Theres something so hilariously cathartic about seeing Lelouchs bitchy sisters just worshipping him as lord.](http://webm.land/media/HOG0.webm) Kind of feel for Odysseus, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Im mostly impressed that he was able to get that whole room all in one go. And how he was able to remove those contacts in one, swift motion.

* So, since Lelouch is emperor now and technically leading Britannia, does this mean /u/rascorpia likes him now? Or are we going more for a [False God](http://i.imgur.com/nKD3JAh.jpg) angle?

* Why is Suzaku helping him, you ask? Because he finally understands who the one, true emperor of Britannia really is. And he doesnt need to be Geassed to acknowledge it.

* Will it be Lelouchs Geass power or will it be my ability to dramatically pause?

* Lelouch says it best in the preview: There is nothing that is unforgivable. Its only the willingness not to forgive. It was true was Shirley said it, and its still true now. And I am certainly willing.

What else can you say but, ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA! ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA! ALL HAIL LELOUCH! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

I took "target me" to mean they wanted to persuade/capture her to work for them, so they could get FLEIJAs too.

Say what you want about Nina, but she invented FLEIJA.  She's no dummy.

I dunno about that.  If it did, then it could be recorded, or even synthesized.

Haha.  I have to recuse myself, because one of the things I do remember from my first watch was that Nunally does come back, and in opposition to Lelouch.  Not this exact reveal or in what capacity, but still.  Have no idea what my prediction would have been back then.

Wait a sec.  Either he's with Lelouch because he's Emperor of Brittania now, or else he's with Nunally because she's the best weapon on the side of the remnants of the prior order that he's still loyal to.  Right?

Yeah, I do. This is a direct parallel to when Euphemia stepped up to stop Nina from being beaten, even though Nina is legitimately a crazy person. Rivalz is Lelouch's loyal friend, even having helped him break the law and escape punishment at the beginning of the series. Lelouch could have at least said "Leave him be" before stalking imperiously away. It would have still stung Rivalz emotionally, but leaving him to get beaten was *cold.*

You get me. For a brief moment I had no idea what Schneizel was gonna say. "There's someone better suited than you." Then it just clicked. Oh, they're gonna show Nunnally now. And then I said in my post: Lelouch was finally moving forward, and now he has to deal with this.

Close, I suppose. When we first came up with the theory I don't think we really knew anything about Code as a thing, just that CC was immortal and gave out Geass to folks. Never revised it after that, though.

> I grant him the title Knight of Zero. Did you seriously pick the name Zero all the way back just so you could make that pun?

Forget ruling the world, that was his master plan all along.

> He at least let Odysseus get a job as a soldier. You know, considering how the Geass order still lets them keep their personalities (all Lelouch made them do was believe him to be the true emperor), do you ever wonder if during break-time they both go out back and smoke while grumbling about how lame it is that Lelouch became emperor? I like to think they do.

Thinking about the command he issued: would that even have an effect on someone like Schneizel? He would acknowledge Lelouch as the emperor, sure, but what if he simply wants to dethrone the emperor? It wouldn't make much of a difference *who* was on the throne at that point.

Schneizel threw the Black Knights a lot of information about it before they tried to off Lelouch, they could probably piece things together from that.

I don't know how you came up with my imagined reactions but they're great. And not far off.

Not necessarily.  If what's really being foreseen is not "the future" but the intended movements of people before they carry them out (like mind-reading, but in just the motor cortex), then it does fit.

As I mentioned elsewhere, that *at best* would cover up to someone's reaction time, which would be well under 300ms. Still useful but not like what we saw from his apparent point of view.

>Some weird shit about all of everyone's consciousnesses (dead or alive) merging into one unchanging thing where there is no individuality (or humanity for that matter). In essence, the perception of time would cease to exist. Charles thinks that by merging everyone there will be peace and nobody can lie to anyone because it would be impossible to conceal any thought nor would it be even possible to think anything for yourself. Lelouch argues that forcing a good intention on the world and undermining their free will is an evil act in of itself, which Charles points out is ironic because Lelouch has only become what he is because of controlling people's minds against their will. Still, there is a difference in evils between temporarily altering the minds of a few individuals versus permanently altering the minds of the entire world.

It's basically Evangelion.

This last five episodes are some of my favorites. This is the point when everything just goes full overdrive, when Code Geass just embraces all of the ridiculous things that make it so awesome, and to great dramatic effect. So much that we have been waiting for finally happens, such as Lelouch and Suzaku working together, Lelouch becoming Emperor, etc. 

Also I like both Lelouch and Suzaku's outfits. I only regret C.C. doesn't have any sort of Empress outfit. Jeremiah would look nice in a Rounds uniform too.

And the paradigm shift in alliances and all that is just so interesting.

So I have a few questions:

What exactly was the world Chalres proposing? A fake reality with people that died previously?

Why did both Charles and Marianne die? By LeLouch destryoing the raganarock thing?

Suzaku is now best friends LeLouch and drops everything just because LeLouch didn't agree with Charles proposal?
>> ARTICLE
Something like that. It would make life or death pointless since they would all live together either way. The same basic idea as Evangelion but with different symbols. 

They were in a metaphysical realm where Lelouch asked a higher power to stop their plan from working. And said higher power responded by erasing them from existence. 

Think about why Suzaku and Lelouch were always in opposition. They had a disagreement over using the correct methods. Suzaku no longer cares about that.

Another day, another geass thread. Third to last one if I am correct. Then we get the overall season discussion which should be fun, especially since users (me included) have already started giving out our thoughts. 

You can find my comment in [here](http://pastebin.com/yJQbYjw8) if you haven't already seen it. I've gotten some counter-points spoken to me through PMs and replies, although I haven't seen any compelling reasons so far. I don't know whether I've just seen more shows and I'm less tolerent of these things or if people don't expect more from this show?  Not going to say that mine is the only 'valid' interpretation though, that is just silly. I'll go more into that in the final thread anyway since I don't want dicussion to turn into a roundabout arguement. I will say that if you do love this season then that is cool with me, I just don't share the feeling.

Also shoutout to /u/Durinthal for the gold. Didn't expect to see that when I went online today. I have now made a weeb avatar to fit the ocassion.

[^^Durinthal](#nico-heart)

**Episode 21**

* Lelouch embracing his hypocrisy. I think he is one of the few characters left now that has complexity. Not a perfectly written character but compared to the rest of the cast he feels more human that any of them.
* So from what C.C is telling me this 'God' is a hivemind of individual and collective thoughts. Similar to reddit then
* "Oh hey Lelouch, it's me, your dead mom!"
* Now we can find out what she has been up to the past two seasons outside of making C.C look crazy
* "It's as if you both enjoy learning more and more about each other" WE CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW CAN WE O_O
* Onii-chan complex
* Where was he hiding that gun all this time? I don't think I want to know...
* I also love how he didn't even need to bother sneaking a gun in if he just had goons that could shoot a million rounds through the windows anyway
* I do wonder about this 'warp into other peoples minds thing'. Did she loose the ability to do it again without her original body, or could she potentially use it again on someone?
* ***See*** Charles is not only best God he is best Dad too
* They kept her body? Better hope it was cryogenically frozen right away. Don't want zombie mum on the loose
* Nunnally only believes she is blind because her memories were altered? I'm no expert on being blind but wouldn't you get the impulse to open your eyelids at some point?
* Slaying god to create a new world #justcharlesthings
* *You just don't understand me dad*
* I'm loving how much the story is embracing lies Lelouch built his power on
* Although he is giving me serious Dark Flame Master vibes again. 
* Looks like you should have thrown Lelouch off the edge while you still had the chance
* Listen, if you are going to overthrow God, don't bring your angsty chuunibyou with you
* I think you skipped over a few family members to take the throne there
* No doubt he managed to get Schneze under his control during the past month
* Suzaku x Lelouch ship, Suzaku's 'sword' is his (   )
* Well that was surprisingly easy
* Schneze isn't under his control- trouble is round the corner. He better not kill Cornelia, even if he is emperor

**Episode 22**

* Wonder if Lelouch will use his new found power to wipe out the Black Knights like I predicted. It would clear up a lot of 'loose ends' for him
* I see Xing trying to get in on the hestia string hype
* Lelouch can change his contacts really quickly now it seems
* Just realised I have been watching in english. Was staring at the bottom of the screen wondering where the subs were. It seems even during the day I'm half asleep
* Woah...those Britannian uniforms Suza x Lulu are amazing
* So...Lelouch is going to become the bad guy in order to give the people a common enemy? 
* You can see the future? Pah, Suzaku is the future!
* "Everyone loves democracy" Not in Britain(nia)
* WOAH
* YOU DID NOT JUST TURN YOUR EYES FROM RIVALZ 
* BASTARD
* "What am I to you!" A member of his harem of course
* Nothing like a good absolutist monarch
* And Kallen is on the enemy side! She's going die! WOOOOOO
* HOT DAMN
* Schneze blowing up capitals like it's just another sunday
* Best guy better win- Lelouch has a death wish anyway
* Nunnally is officially immune to nukes
* (Fuck this show)
* It better give a perfectly plausible explanation for that or else I will write angry words on an internet forum. Don't say I didn't warn you Sunrise.
* I guess Lelouch was happy to die when no one would miss him but his siscon side is probably in overdrive now

Surprising that I had less to complain about these two episodes. Nice to have a break and give my voice a rest from all this shouting. I have a pretty clear view as to what direction this show is going in now. 

It seems Lelouch and Suzaku have agreed to work together in order to create this new world that they both talked about back in season 1. To do that they are wiping out Britannian culture and heritage so that the only thing remaining is Lelouch. Then they are going to tarnish the Britannian royalty for good by having Lelouch commit some variety of atrocity. He will then have to die to pave the way for a new generation to rise up and take over, now with the ideals that oppose everything Britannia has stood for over the past century or so. Nunnally coming back does put a spanner in the works but I think it will turn out more or less the same. It might even be that Nunnally is the one to kill Lelouch. 

I could be wrong but I felt it was rather blatant what it is doing. Not a terrible end, although I have seen it done before in media outside of anime so it will have to add a special twist in order to really blow me away. It is kind of like the trope where someone has to die in order for the world to continue on to a better place. Will see how well the show can execute it.

Anime *does* love psychosomatic blindness, but there are cases of people being [unable to consciously see even though their eyes are functional](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/health/23blin.html?_r=0). I suppose if Charles convinced someone strongly enough that they couldn't see, they would actually not see.

It might even be the opposite of a [phantom limb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb), where someone has strong memories of having a body part, so they keep trying to use it even though it's been removed.

Welp, that's more fanfiction I need to go find next week.

I'm so glad I'm watching the dub. I have enough trouble following this philosophical nonsense in English; if I were simultaneously trying to decode two languages, there's no way I'd have parsed it. (Although at least there's the comfort that Lelouch kept yelling that it's all nonsense.)

So, much like Charles, Lelouch is going to destroy the world in order to make what he thinks is a "better" one. This is pretty much the opposite of what Nunnally *actually* wanted, though I guess he could ask her about that now. Not the worst ending I can imagine, but we'll see how it goes.

If you missed it earlier, go read [this exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/35bqfr/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cr388pm?context=1) from yesterday's thread between /u/rascorpia and /u/souther1983 about issues with the show. They both put a lot of effort into it and I think it's worth reading regardless of what side you fall on.

---
...Marianne was about to draw on Suzaku's face? I love her already. And she just outright admitted her identity to Suzaku! She's not messing around.

Charles is pretty serious about getting rid of lies. It probably would be easier to just kill a deity instead of casting a worldwide zone of truth kind of spell.

C's World is a sort of collective consciousness? Weird. *That's* God? Welp, there goes Marianne, that should be fun. CC points out the same thing I did in the last few days: both of them want to die but can't.

Ah yeah, a giant war of succession would be brutal. Imagine all of Charles's children turning on each other instead of just them vs. Lelouch.

VV's the one behind the assassination, and the first thing that came to mind was Rolo, with neither of them wanting someone to get between them and their brother. Aaand there's Anya, with my guess yesterday about Marianne transferring her mind being true. One-time use thing, I suppose. And that explains how she could talk to CC and why the latter left.

> Anyone you really don't want to lose should be kept at a distance.

Hey Lelouch. Remember Shirley? That wasn't far enough. Charles sent Lelouch and Nunnally away to protect them from VV?! I know I speculated about a kinder Charles [a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34z86r/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqzfrw1) but didn't think he would have cared about them *that* much. And that's also a good reason for having Marianne's body taken away. Called Nunnally as having her memories of the incident altered though!

Needing a second Code for research, hm.. Ah, so that's why Charles was so happy with Lelouch losing control of his Geass, it meant he was getting closer to taking over from CC.

Come on Suzaku, this is a family affair, no need to for you to butt in. Charles thinks this will lead to the gentler world that Euphie, Nunnally, Lelouch, and even Suzaku wanted... but will it?

Bismarck has a good point about politics being *very* different in a world without lies. I don't even know what that would be like.

All things considered I definitely did not expect that Marianne would be on Charles's side in all of this. Lelouch, you're one to talk about enforcing intentions upon others. That's *all you've done* this entire series.

Neat, there's the other eye. And somehow Lelouch can even command God. Well, I guess it was more of a request? Either way, he just told God to stuff it and keep things the way they are. That's the end of Charles and Marianne, I suppose.

And Suzaku's not going to forgive Lelouch for killing Euphie, so I'm guessing the conflict between them will continue.

Was gonna say, I don't think Charles is coming back after a month. Oh come on Lelouch, you could have chosen a better outfit for that. Suzaku too, though I'm not sure why he's helping Lelouch now. Does Britannia really go by those rules for succession? I guess if no one stops him...

This whole series had been building up to that single "Knight of Zero" pun, hasn't it?

Now *that* is a good Geass to use. CC doesn't seem to be amused by his actions though, I wonder what his ploy is in all of this.

Convenient that Schneizel, Cornelia, and Diethard are working independently and weren't around for that gathering. Still have their own plans going on, I suppose. Also noting that Suzaku advances through betrayal, but is that really the case?

An eventful episode, to say the least. And with Charles out of the way, that does leave Schneizel as the remaining big bad... kind of. Lelouch might turn out to be his own worst enemy here.

---
That's a lot of reforms in a few days, but when you have absolute control of the majority of the government like that...

Note that Lelouch is effecting the change he wanted from *inside* the system. He could have done this ages ago if he had focused on getting Charles out of the way first.

Yep, CC's not happy about all of this. Neither are the remaining Black Knights, understandably.

Aww, Nina's hiding out with Milly and Rivalz. Not surprised that she's being targeted though.

Lelouch really is going for the rest of the world now. I think it's a little strange that he's keeping Lloyd around, but it means we get more Lloyd so I'm okay with that. And whatever his plans are include Schneizel acting on his own, so there's that old "playing right into his hands" trope.

Ah yes, here's the Lancelot Albion, hopefully the final mech upgrade of the series. Let's see what Bismarck's Geass is! ...see the future? Well, there goes any semblance of rationality behind how Geass works. *Unless* it's really just reading minds to gauge someone's intended movements or actions, but even so that would only work at a reflexive distance into the future at best, anything beyond that isn't guaranteed.

I forgot that Damocles was still something Schneizel had up his sleeve, whatever that is. Lelouch's snide "we know how everyone loves democracy" goes right back to Schneizel's remark on how people want to be controlled as well. Here comes another liberal use of Geass to "win" the UFN over, I bet.

Severing all connections he had with his past there, at least as far as the public goes.

Kallen.. he's just trouble, you know that. Good, she's smart enough to just walk away for once.

I'm amused by the Geass countermeasures they've thought up for all of this. They have a very good point about Britannia as a whole swinging the majority vote but... nope, here comes the threat of a bloodbath.

Nina was a priority target? Yet another pawn for Lelouch to play with, I can't think he would have any other use for her.

Well, there's Damocles. An entire city wiped off the planet.

Aaand Nunnally's still alive. Somehow. /u/rascorpia is rolling in their grave (I'm assuming they wanted to stop living in a world where Lelouch is Emperor of Britannia).

[](#kyon-facepalm)

Mmm, institutional racism at the museum.

It's good that Todo's still alive, means he can cause more trouble for Britannia later.

Lelouch is still trying to turn Suzaku but I highly doubt that's going to happen. Nunnally as bait is rather low, but at least he's looking out for her.

Oh hey, Shirley had that one letter that she was writing about how her father died. I don't remember if that had anything about Lulu in it.

And Rakshata finally makes an appearance! Curious to see what part she'll play later on.

Cornelia's making Suzaku the executioner? Harsh but a clever move. He can prove his loyalty or be outed as a traitor. Even if he's still sympathetic to Japanese resistance afterward they'll hate him for the act.

Never mind that execution, they're breaking him out. I like the design on Todo's mech. Naturally, Suzaku comes to interfere with things. And everyone *finally* sees that it's him piloting it.

It took a few episodes but we got Euphemia's knight.

---
No surprises with the reorganization. Also no surprises that Lloyd is the only one happy with the knighting.

So despite deliberately using his Geass to wipe out a significant part of a civilian girl's life, Lelouch isn't willing to use it *at all* on a military target and one of the largest obstacles to his goal? I hope Suzaku kicks his ass every time they meet.

Yay, Euphemia's not a terrible human. I'd vote for her to be empress. Oooh, looks like Lloyd's going to have a new assistant in his lab soon.

I hadn't considered how Kallen feels about all of this. I didn't think she would be so dedicated to Zero that she'd try to assassinate Suzaku outright and sacrifice herself in the process. She's still best girl for now but I wish she'd go for a better guy.

Oh huh, didn't realize Milly actually went ahead with the engagement. Poor Rivalz. Lloyd seems to be much more interested in Nina though... this is probably going to get complicated.

Diethard has a fair point about recording history, I like his motivation. Meanwhile Rakshata looks to be Lloyd's rival in technology. Looking forward to the arms race there.

Well, time to use Suzaku's guilt against him, though that turned sour quickly. Hm.. an order that Euphemia herself can't override? Sounds like the Emperor's coming to visit.

Aaaaaah so much going down at once. Kallen and Euphemia both try to charge in in their own ways and some flying ship intervenes to stop the missiles. Schneizel? I forget who that is, another royal sibling? And it looks like that ship's going to fry Suzaku/Zero anyway. I don't think any Geass is gonna save your ass now, Zero.

Mmm, pretty flashy lights. Zero and Todo are dead along with one princess, the rebellion's over and Japan gets crushed even further. Unless...

[Wild speculation round 12](/s "Zero's command to Suzaku is a simple "Protect me!" so Lancelot throws up its shield. Kallen manages to dive under it as well and gets saved, and the other named characters are too far away to be harmed. As a result of the Geass, Suzaku can never again actively attempt to bring down Zero and instead is forced to go after anyone that attempts to, unintentionally becoming a Black Knight. Lloyd is mildly depressed by that until Nina comforts him and they start dating.")

---
My own speculation makes me wonder: what happens if you unknowingly break the Geass? Using my own example, what if Suzaku goes after a different mech that Zero's in, hurts him, and finds out after that? And what if CC dressed up as Zero, could Suzaku not hurt her either?

>> ARTICLE
We sure are getting through these episodes fast. Just another 7 or so episodes until Lelouch is killed by the Britannian empire in preparation for season two (in which glorious Britannia hunts down the surviving remnants of the rebellion).

**Episode 17**

* I thought the models were supposed to be nude in these sorts of art classes
* There is clearly not enough fanservice in this show already damn it!
* Space Dandy you better get rid of that woman before she fucks your shit up
* Someone needs to explain to me why that guy has a micro penis on his head
* Suzaku does a killer frog impression
*  Lelouch wanted that "I love you" so bad. Confirmed Sis-con
* Ah Lelouch, you may be a chess master but why oh why did you not nuke Shirley's room to be sure that there wouldn't be any notes left about you
* Suppose I should have expected that Suzaku and Keanu Reeves would have history
* Why is it that in some scenes it takes a billion shots to take down a mech but in others they blow up like they just got shot by Tom Hanks pistol
* Just pick the painting that is at the centre of the camera frame like everyone wants you to! No need to make this more complicated than it has to be!
* "T'was nothing sir" how can someone so completely Japanese talk like a classic Britannian? please tell me that is just the subs being shitty
* Why exactly are they broadcasting this battle to the press? It's in a private government compound so it's not exactly like the press would have found out about it anyway?
* Come on Britannian, you are supposed to only show the good news when it comes to this sort of stuff
* Whatcha gonna do now Lelouch?
* 100 on 1 is too easy for the demi-god Suzaku
* She chooses him as her knight?!? You guys should have warned me, I was not prepared for that shocking twist
* Time to take your pills now 'Griffbat Zorlight West'
* Creepy green haired girl being creepy *yet again*

**Episode 18**

* Oh it's a school
* Lelouch has a dream
* UH OH...traitor Space Dandy is now the second in command...
* Suzaku gettin' all dressed up, he's almost ready to be a character in LotGH
* Oh I know what you're thinking Yuri girl. You want to be the one kneeling at the feet of little miss princess
* Don't stab yourself, brain dead girl!
* Are they trying to start some sort of acapella? 
* I thought he already used his Geass on Suzaku?
* "Discrimination against numbers is Britannian nation policy" God I love you Viceory, you have the best lines
* Don't forget, Pizza Hut will also supply great meals for any ocassion; be it for a wedding, graduation or promotion! **BUY NOW-BUY NOW-BUY NOW*
* Nunnally also happens to be the CEO of Pizza Hut by the sounds of it
* Guess that means she also knows about CC getting all those deliverys while Lelouch is out
* Could Mad Scientist be in love? All we seeing a love...square(?)
* OOOOOOOOOOH If you want to kill Suzaku just lace the Pizza with poison
* Ehhh, scrap that, it would be bad PR for Pizza Hut (much more important than any rebellion)
* Oh forgot about the engagement
* That makes it a love...pentagon(?)
* This show is a nightmare for shipping
* Nice boat though
* Please tell me we are about to see Suzaku go **Super Saiyan**
* Nope. He went full Princess-brain-dead. You never go full princess-brain-dead.
* You're an embarassment to Britannia
* Lelouch you bastard
* [Dat ass tho](http://i.imgur.com/CdalLbF.png) 
* YES THIS IS WHERE ZERO DIES!!!
* They literally just told you that would happen Kallen -_-
*  I WONDER WHAT ZERO WILL DO. I HEARD HE HAS THIS GEASS THING? NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS ABOUT...
* Price who now?
* Clearly wanted the glory of the kill

So now that Lelouch is dead and the rebellion is crushed, I wonder what they will do for the last remaining episodes? Personally I'm hoping for a nice Propaganda documentary piece. Something along the lines of 'this is what happens when you go against Britannia'. 
I of course expect a meuseum and art gallery dedicated to this mystery prince who so valliant crushed these traitors.

hehe, you can clearly see in the episode, that lelouch cast his geass on suzaku, but it don't show the order, why do u want lelouch dead so fast, he is best guy, best guys are forever ^(at least in our heart)

Nope, it's just that sub. Never says it in the dub, which I use as the official translation. Speaking of which, the dub has Steve Blum as Tohdoh. So, you know. In case you're interested.

And, no, he never used his Geass on Suzaku until now.

Lelouch said killing Clovis was tough enough to do its going to be an interesting confrontation hell have with his father. Errr, well, he probably hates his father more so it might not be as tough, but still interesting.

It seems like most of the pictures in the ED are from the past, so Ill say that Rakshata *worked* with Lloyd and Cecile. Possibly a romantic relationship that ended poorly caused them to part ways.

Loved the music when they were bringing Todo out to his badass mech. Im glad hes finally getting quality screen time.

[Jeremiah?](http://i.imgur.com/pjob906.jpg) Hes been absent for a while. Wonder what has been happening to him to make him look this villainous. That eye glimmer too. Maybe hell have Geass now.

Thought elevator. Sounds transcendental. I still think CC gave the Emperor Geass, and now Im thinking that he is the one she has been talking to (when it seems like shes talking to herself). The Emperor was doing the same thing, and his tone sounded like conversation, not just thinking out loud. Could CC still be working with him? Perhaps to get back to her home planet or something? I dont know. Its so frustrating/exciting when shows give you these tiny pieces of information that youve been waiting for yet you still know nothing and are forced to wait longer. And Schneizel that was the name Nunally spoke of a few episode ago. More half-siblings. Probably the one the Emperor trusts the most.

Is Lloyd going to recruit Nina? He was intrigued with her research.

Of course theyre serving pizza. What the hell else did I think theyd serve? Im definitely going to have to eat Pizza Hut before this series is over.

Kallen did what I thought Zero would do: reveal herself to Suzaku. I was expecting Zero to take off the mask and show Suzaku that hed be killing himself *and* his best friend, leaving Nunally alone in the process. I knew he could still used Geass on Suzaku, but I just didnt think hed do it. Wonder what the order was or if it will even matter since they got bombarded. Damn it cliffhangers! Damn it two episodes per day!

At this point Im half expecting Lelouchs confrontation with his father to reveal something we havent even heard of in the slightest yet. Some kind of major revelation (probably involving CC) that will make Lelouchs revenge quest seem trivial. I mean, weve seen there are more people like CC as well as those two giant planets. Now were shown the Emperor has some crazy ass elevator to the heavens. What the hell is really going on?

But no. I'm not. I promise, I've never seen this show before. Just don't give even the slightest hint as to what I got right. It's kind fun knowing I'm on the right track with some stuff, but I have to wait and find out what it was.

I don't think suzaku heared kallen, there was no reaction showed and she was pretty far.

Still a fantastic moment. Nothing quite like one of the characters running toward another who's set on doing something terrible, screaming "Look at me!" at the top of their voice.
>> ARTICLE
You're right. I meant more that she actually outted herself regardless if Suzaku was able to hear her.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, we can clearly see by now that kallen has some strong feelings for zero, she was up to any deal that could save him, even revealing herself
>> ARTICLE
Really good point. I think I keep ignoring the fact that Kallen has  feelings for Zero because it just seems so odd since she really knows nothing about him. It would make sense if it was based on admiration, but yeah, it's definitely romantic.
>> ARTICLE
It is kinda both, The pace doens't show the growth of their relationship very well, but he is like a hero to her, and we can see that she is like his personal guard and stuff, its not a complete romance story, but she has strong feelings for him, both as a soldier, and as a person.

**Episode 17:**

* Logically, the students should be taking turns being the model, but I bet Lelouch is the only one getting drawn. If he werent the obsession of the entire school, what kind of MC would he be?
* Life continues to be less than fair for the Elevens, even when it comes to art competitions. The fact that there are 1/4 Elevens is another good sign that Britannia and Japan had fine relations up until the war, to have had that much intermarriage. Thanks to /u/SeanyMac23 in the previous thread for helping me understand that timeline!
* Hopefully Suzaku isnt having to wash graffiti out of his shirt again. Isnt he still the hero of the school for saving Lelouch and Arthur the Geass Cat? Perhaps his repeated slips into Japanese  err, Elevenese  are damaging his social status.
* Thanks to Rakshata, the Black Knights now have Eva plug suits. Very nice!
* Wait, Lelouch didnt know that it was Suzaku piloting the Lancelot?! How did I not realize that? Well, were having quite a reunion all around, then.
* Oh, good; the Britannian reinforcements are providing cover for why Zero doesnt want to go for the kill with Suzaku. It seems he just got lucky, though His crazed laughter more than demonstrates that he didnt think that order through.

**Episode 18:**

* Diethard is gaining even more power within the Black Knights now. Does Lelouch actually trust him? I suppose he has no reason to be actively suspicious, but I havent seen any reason for active trust, either.
* Kallen is way too excited by being Lelouchs personal guardian. Being part of an elite squad seems like a higher honor than guard, but it seems she really just wants to be with him.
* That is an excellently formal knighting ceremony for Suzaku. Both he and Euphemia look the part. I would be quite honored to be Suzaku despite the glares from everyone there but Lloyd and Darlton.
* Im glad the Black Knights arent in agreement about assassinating Suzaku. Sure, having him dead would be great, but martyrs are dangerous as well. I hope by assassinate they actually mean kill in honorable battle.
* Pizza party at the school! Is the orange soda product placement, too?
* Is Lloyd going to wind up marrying Milly and inviting Nina to work for him? Along with Suzaku working alongside him, it seems like the entire student council will soon be moving their antics to his lab. Well, unless Arthur the Geass Cat puts a stop to it, since I can't picture Lloyd falling prey to his mind control.
* Euphemia, Suzaku is going to be a lousy personal guard if you keep sending him off into battle. I guess it will at least raise the standing of honorary Britannians if he dies honorably in battle. At least the Black Knights are even more idiotic by having their strategist and researcher both chill on the front lines, outside mechs and within reach of Suzaku and his insane reaction time.
* EVERYONE IS GIVING UP THEIR IDENTITIES?! Well, I guess youll all be dying in the next minute or so anyway
* Lelouch, what order did you just give? I bet it was something stupid! :D

Next time on Code Geass, Lelouch probably continues to flip out and do all sorts of things he'll regret.

Just as a heads up for first time watchers, the first episode of R2 is really confusing. It makes more sense as it goes on, and episode 2 clears it all up, but just remember these two things: 

1) Yes, you are watching the correct episode. I've heard of people thinking they started the wrong episode or something and search for the right one, but this is it, it's just a bit confusing at first.

2) It'll help to just relax and go along with what's happening, rather than constantly questioning what's going on.

I only started this post a few hours ago so it's rather disjointed. I was thinking of how to best give a brief overview of how I see the series so far and figured a character rundown would be useful, but this ballooned as I remembered how many characters there are. Anyone that I haven't included here is mostly forgettable and not really relevant to the larger plot so far as a result (or I have a big hole in my memory, one of the two).

# Students

* **Milly** - Student A.
* **Rivalz** - Student B.
* **Shirley** - Student C who was unfortunately dragged into the conflict. I don't mind her struggling with the issue of Lelouch/Zero but I want to hear more of her inner dialogue for it.
* **Nina** - Though she's turned out to be rather unstable I really like her development as a character. She might die, might be redeemed, or might fall even further and I'm curious to see what happens.

# Britannian Forces

* **Villetta** - Lost her memories then regained them for an unknown reason and reverted back to her old self. No real character progression *yet* due to the reversion but there's potential if she struggles with her amnesiac personality later.
* **Jeremiah** - Orange; was defeated, demoted, considered dead and experimented on. Now a cyborg obsessed with Zero? Controls weird ship with his mind, it seems. More of a chaotic force of nature than character in the future, I'm guessing.
* **Cecile** - We have a *small* hint at her past with Lloyd's remark about her using Suzaku as a replacement for... something. Hopefully we get more of her.
* **Lloyd** - We see bits of him here and there but he seems pretty straightforward in his desires. Not a bad thing since I find him entertaining as he is.
* **Suzaku** - In my opinion, the best character in the series so far but it's hard to put into words why. I'll think about it some more and maybe update later.

# Black Knights

* **Ogi** - I liked the small window on his life that we got when Villetta was a different person. Unfortunately not much beyond that, and he may be dead too.
* **Nunnally's maid** - What's up with her? Why is she actively helping the Black Knights? We have almost no info on her right now and I'll be disappointed if we don't find out anything about her, because on the surface she has no good reason to assist with the rebellion.
* **Todo** - The grizzled old warrior who keeps fighting for his country. Hasn't gotten much extra development after he joined the Black Knights but I think everything up to that point is sufficient for him.
* **Rakshata** - Like her rival Lloyd her motivations are pretty clear. They provide a balance to the conflict arms race though she doesn't have as much of a personality yet.
* **Diethard** - One of my favorite characters because I don't think I've ever seen anyone like him before. He wants to document the birth of a new nation and he's willing to get his hands dirty for it.
* **Kallen** - Also straightforward in that she wants a free nation for her people, we just get to see a lot of her. I'm curious how she'll reconcile Lelouchwho for the most part was just another annoying Britannian student to herwith Zero, the charismatic leader of the rebellion who she had likely developed something of an obsession with.

# Royalty

* ~~**Marianne**~~ - Set up as death via background for Lelouch but there's more to her than that. Hopefully we'll find out what that is and how she's connected to CC.
* ~~**Clovis**~~ - His death kicked off the whole thing so he obviously didn't get a lot of screen time to develop. I like that the research into the artifacts and Geass in general is tied back to him though.
* ~~**Euphemia**~~ - Euphie was Euphie before anything else and her personality shined. Unfortunately that was one of the worst ways imaginable for her to go.
* **Cornelia** - Strategist and warrior, a solid rival to Zero. Cared for her little sister and her army as well and I like her for that. May be dead.
* **Schneizel** - Little development so far but one of the major royal figures remaining that we *have* seen something of.
* **Charles** - #1 target, still mostly a mystery.

# Miscellaneous

* **Kyoto Six** - Pretty much powerless in the larger scheme of things so minor players. Kaguya has a good amount of character to her for low little we've seen.
* ~~**Mao**~~ - Helped reveal some of Suzaku's and CC's pasts but was a rather short diversion from the main story otherwise. May *not* be dead.
* **VV** - We know nothing about him aside from being connected to the whole Geass thing and presumably CC. I'm guessing we'll see more of that later.
* **CC** - So much mystery, so much pizza. Every revealed detail of her past only raises more questions, so I'm not sure what to think of her yet.
* **Nunnally** - More of a device to pull at Lelouch's strings than a character in her own right.
* **Lelouch** - Our flawed protagonist, caring so much for his little sister that he wants to bring down an entire empire for her.

---
Yes, Suzaku and Lelouch are two that I wrote the least about. It's hard to sum up everything about them in a paragraph so I didn't bother (partially for the sake of getting this out in time).

One interesting argument that came from yesterday's thread is about [Lelouch abandoning the fight in Tokyo to go after Nunnally.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33ieum/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion/cqlcjum?context=1) It got me thinking more about Lelouch's character and how Nunnally's his anchor point right now. Does it make sense for him to charge off after her? Sure. Do I like him for it? Surely not. He's ditching the responsibility *that he claimed* to lead the rebellion.

There are a number of things that bothered me about this season. Hopefully they're justified later on but for now they detract from my overall enjoyment of the show.

* Villetta abruptly regains her memories for no apparent reason. Worse, she turns right back to her old personality.
* VV appears out of nowhere to explain the Geass ability to Suzaku before kidnapping Nunnally.
* A lot of the vague information from CC, and to be honest most of the Geass-related stuff. I said some time ago that I thought the show could either be a good power-related mystery with the Geass thing or a political thriller with the rebellion. This season focused heavily on the latter and *almost* pulled it off. However, I'm afraid it will shift to the former next season and abandon the rebellion plot entirely.

So while I'm continuing with the series and the discussion, I'm not particularly happy with the direction I believe it's headed right now.
>> ARTICLE
What about Tamaki? Don't you know he's Zero's main man whose been there since the start!
>> ARTICLE
Someone else who likes Suzaku?  (One of us... one of us...)

Personally, I find that Suzaku is a relatively unique and interesting perspective for a character.  Lelouch is the "rebel" archetype, he's (stop me if you've heard this one before) a gifted individual who for a mix of both selfless and selfish reasons fights against a corrupt and broken system through violent methods.  There's nothing wrong with that archetype, but it's a dime a dozen.  V for Vendetta, Death Note, Fight Club, The Hunger Games, etc.  

Usually these characters are opposed by someone fighting for the status quo; L from Death Note, for example; but Suzaku is something different.  He's someone who's *also* fighting against the status quo; but one whose doing it by working within the system, rather than trying to overturn it.  

And, personally, that's an approach I sympathize with.  For all that we glorify rebellions (or at least, one in particular, speaking as an American), they tend to cause a lot of additional pain and suffering for people who didn't ask for it, and have this annoying tendency to fail and leave everyone worse off.  So I like Suzaku's idea, at least in theory.  And like I said, it's not one we see a whole lot of in fiction.
>> ARTICLE
While I always understood people's problems with Suzaku, I always liked him as well. His ideas, while perhaps a little naiive, were an interesting (and I believe needed) anithesis to Lelouch's. It made for one of my favorite scenes in the show where in episode 5, Lelouch says, "Is it good to be strong?" and Suzaku says, "Is it bad to be weak?" Their conflicting views are a joy to watch, but it's also so cool that they simultaneously work so well together. Like Lelouch says at the end of season 1, "There is nothing that we can not accomplish when you and I work together." Suzaku is an important component of the story and continues to be so in R2.
>> ARTICLE
> Suzaku - In my opinion, the best character in the series so far but it's hard to put into words why. I'll think about it some more and maybe update later.

What? You really think so? Throughout watching this anime,I found this character annoying because he is just stupidly broken. One man vs a whole army? No problem,Suzaku can do it.I guess the same goes for Lelouch,but at least he uses tactics and Geass which is more interesting than an overpowered mecha killing machine.
>> ARTICLE
Suzaku is very annoying at first. But I also think he is surprisingly interesting, when considered as a whole, and the show would not work without him.
>> ARTICLE
That's on the mech, not the character. And a problem I see in basically every mecha series.
>> ARTICLE
> Charles - #1 target, still mostly a mystery.

Best guy. Is a mystery because he surpasses our limited human understanding.

> Cornelia -  May be dead.

Don't say that, it might come true ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Whoo, finally finished work. And, all I can really say is best guy, best guy.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your write-up on Diethard. I think hes a really good character and his motivations and methods are a breath of fresh air. i just find him really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> Lelouch - Our flawed protagonist, caring so much for his little sister that he wants to bring down an entire empire for her.

Honestly I think it just one of his reasons. I think he has a lot of selfish reasons. He wants to punish the empire, that banished him and his sister. He seeking revenge for his tarnished pride. Lelouch is proud and arrogant. He wants to change the world also for his sake.

If his sisters happiness is his only goal, then he is doing it totally wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely think Nunnally is the majority factor as to why Lelouch wants to create a better world. I agree, Lelouch is proud and arrogant, and definitely wants revenge against the empire, but recreating the world for Nunnally is his ultimate goal for sure.

I don't even think Lelouch is taking the wrong approach for Nunnally either. Nunnally's happiness isn't his exact goal, it's creating a better world for Nunnally, and there's no other way to do it than to crush the cruel empire of Brittania. This just shows the extent of Lelouch's love for Nunnally.
>> ARTICLE
> Nunnally's happiness isn't his exact goal, it's creating a better world for Nunnally

Her happiness should be his major goal. A good world with an unhappy Nunally does not help her at all. Creating a new world should just be one way to make Nunnally happy.

> and there's no other way to do it than to crush the cruel empire of Brittania. 

really? Can you not imagine a safer or better way to do it? Nunnally wants a peaceful  live together with Lelouch. With Lelouchs power this should be easily obtainable. Find a peaceful place to live outside the reach of the empire, Geass  your way in and you can have a nice life for Nunnally. It would only change her world, but it should be enough. 

Lelouch actual plan is way to risky. He could die. Britain could find out, that he is Zero and this would risk Nunallies life. His plans could end in a giant war without gaining anything. 

If his goals are based around Nunally, then he should not take this huge risks.
>> ARTICLE
>Her happiness should be his major goal. A good world with an unhappy Nunally does not help her at all. Creating a new world should just be one way to make Nunnally happy.

Objectively he's not concerned about her future as much, Ideally he wants a world without any of his siblings/family as a threat, and Nunnally married to / in care of Suzaku, the only person he trusts. 

>Nunnally wants a peaceful live together with Lelouch.

Ironically, it doesn't matter to him what Nana wants. He wants a world where the weak/frail like himself and Nunnally aren't preyed upon and abused by the powerful. He was weak, but he was given the Power of Kings so now he has the opportunity to actually do something. It's somewhat selfish due to the extreme situation, but if you removed the danger it's like a sister that would be happy if you just spent time with her on her birthday, but instead you buy her a country or whatever.

>Find a peaceful place to live outside the reach of the empire, Geass your way in and you can have a nice life for Nunnally. It would only change her world, but it should be enough.

You have to remember that Lelouch believes that someone in the Empire sent assassins to wipe out himself, Nunnally, and Marianne. The children managed to escape, and were thought to be killed, however they're obviously still alive. This whole time the 2 have been living very low key, because if it were revealed to the public then they would be in danger. 

>Lelouch actual plan is way to risky. He could die. Britain could find out, that he is Zero and this would risk Nunallies life.

All Lelouch wants is a world where they are not constantly in danger, and ironically he's willing to stick his neck out in her place to make that change. 

>His plans could end in a giant war without gaining anything.

That is the point of Stage 25 :P
>> ARTICLE
I think you're really just thinking way too into it honestly.

> Find a peaceful place to live outside the reach of the empire, Geass your way in and you can have a nice life for Nunally. It would only change her world, but it should be enough.

And waste the opportunity he was given? Lelouch was given power and the ultimate opportunity to completely change the world for Nunnally. Changing the world just for Nunnally is pretty much the ultimate gesture of love Lelouch could've possibly given to her, instead of just giving her the illusion that she was living in a peaceful world. 

> His plans could end in a giant war without gaining anything.

I guess it could, but Lelouch is confident in his own abilities and knows that he's a far better tactician than anyone in the Brittanian empire.

> If his goals are based around Nunally, then he should not take this huge risks.

I already admitted that Lelouch has his own personal agenda, and wanted to punish the Brittanian empire, but a greater world for Nunnally is his ultimate objective.
>> ARTICLE
I am not denying the fact, that he wants a better world for Nunally. I am just saying, that this is in fact not his only motivation. He wants a better world for himself. Maybe he even wants to change the world for the sake of the world and he wants to change the world, because he got humiliated by his father.

He chooses the most drastic ways, because Nunallies sake is not the only thing he cares about. His reasons for the war are imo not as pure as you think.
>> ARTICLE
Yes I've said multiple times that Nunnally is not the only reason he's doing this. I am saying, however, that it is his ultimate objective, and I think we're agreeing on the same point.
>> ARTICLE
He is a character divided by two objectives, He wants a world where nunnaly can live happy, and he wants revenge for his mother death. This is stated and narrated by c.c in a lot. Remember when she asked him which where more important?

Remember what the emperor said when lelouch went to him wanting answer for his mother attack, the emperor and britania itself is a world where the weak (like nunnaly) have no place, and the weaker will be subjugated by the strong. 

So while he wants a world of peace for nunnaly, he also wants to destroy britania and fulfill his wish for revenge.

Yes, I agree, while he wants the best for nunnaly, he is not able to refuse the path of revenge. Think about in real life, if someone hurted your sister like nunnaly was, and I gave you a gun, most of the people would kill for revenge and go to jail, instead, they could choose to live with their sister. Thats your argument, and its correct, but this is how lelouch feels.
>> ARTICLE
> He is a character divided by two objectives, He wants a world where nunnaly can live happy, and he wants revenge for his mother death. This is stated and narrated by c.c in a lot. Remember when she asked him which where more important?

Did this already happen? I am not re watching the show and I have problems to divide between season 1 and 2. I am not sure, what we already now about the incident around Marianne.

> Yes, I agree, while he wants the best for nunnaly, he is not able to refuse the path of revenge.

This is basically the point I tried to make. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't remember the exactly episode of R1, but its a quick line, she asks him which is more important and he doesn't give a proper answer, he avoid the question.

Thanks to /u/angel10701 for organising this rewatch its been a real blast for me to see the reaktions of the first timers.

Aswell as picking up on stuff i didnt notice the first time i watched it.So yeah thanks alot its been real fun.

Special shout out to /u/Durinthal , /u/rascorpia and /u/Neawia you guys are fucking awesome, and your pretty much the sole reasone for me to stick around in the reddit threads instead of just watching the series.

Also nice to see a TTGL rewatch its been about 2 years since i saw it last so i hope its as good as i remember it, in any case it'l be a blast.

PS: /u/rascorpia i changed your tag from "tinfoil master" to "BRITANNIAN MASTERRACE"

I can accept that. The tinfoil will never be forgotten, even if I haven't had the time to do it for this series.
>> ARTICLE
R1 done! R2 here we come! I'm glad everyone has been enjoying my posts. I never thought I'd end up going as in depth as I have, but I guess I was inspired by /u/rascorpia and /u/Durinthal to work harder. Everyone else has been fantastic as well, and thanks to those who have helped clear up all the questions I've had along the way. This rewatch has been great (good work /u/angel10701), and I'm looking forward to the TTGL rewatch since that's one I've already seen. It'll be fun to be on the other side!

I'll keep this short and sweet because I tried writing some sort of cohesive "review," but it wasn't very good. Doing reactions was simple enough, but the whole analytical aspect is new to me. I usually just watch shows for the fun of it like a lot of people do.

Anyway...

- Pacing was excellent, even the slow moments were fun to watch.
- Rather large cast of quite interesting characters.
- Mechs kept getting more badass.
- Story was good and has definitely left me wanting more.

I'm excited to watch R2 and see where the story goes. I've tried my hand at some crazy theories, but I really have no clue where things could go from here. A few users have mentioned in previous threads that I've predicted a few things correctly so It's good to know I'm on the right track even just a little.

Giving it a rating is tough since I haven't seen the entire series yet. Though R1 had a pretty defined ending, so I do have the option to rate the first half on its own. If I had to give it a number I'd likely say 85/100, something like that (gave it a 9 on MAL if that actually means anything to anyone). There were some flaws that other users have touched upon better than I could, but overall it was entirely enjoyable to watch. I'm glad I joined in on this rewatch because I'm not sure when I would've gotten to it otherwise.

Final verdict from /u/Neawia... WATCH IT. No real disappointments, no regrets. Let's go R2!

Oh and everyone has been saying they love the ending to this series. "One of the best endings in anime" has been thrown around a little, and I had no idea people considered it that good. In fact it made me quite excited to start watching through R2. So being relatively new to anime, and sorry if this goes off topic a little, what are other opinions on shows with endings that are considered some of the best in the medium? No need to go into crazy detail or anything, but I am curious. 
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy geass, another masterpiece always compared to geass, and which you can draw some parallels between the mcs, is death note. The ending of death note, for me, has a beauty of art, Also don't forget to read the last manga chapter that goes after the end of the anime. The last page is beautiful crafted.

Angel Beats, AnoHana, Has some strong tear-factory finals. Preparation = towel.

Mirain Nikki has for me one of the saddest end ever, it was so sad, the author forced a happy end. But you need to take mirai nikki more serious and extract the deep. The end left me in a void mood for weeks.

I have watched some good animes, all of them has satisfying ends, beautiful ends, but nothing ever left me like geass end did. Be Ready.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, curious about mirai nikki. Was watching it when it was airing I believe, but I got to some filler-esque episodes and the show dropped a bit in popularity, and I stopped watching (not because of the popularity, of course).

Is it good now that it finished?
>> ARTICLE
> but nothing ever left me like geass end did. Be Ready.

Oh man. I am ready. I'm SO ready. Mmmmm, 17 days though... the wait will take its toll on my psyche.

And thanks for the other recommendations. I knew of Death Note and that's pretty high up on my 'to watch' list. If the others weren't on there, they are now. I'll probably check them out sooner rather than later.
>> ARTICLE
If I was you, I would binge watch death note to satiate your wish to complete geass. :).
>> ARTICLE
You know, I was going to wait to watch Death Note. You said it had some parallels with Geass so I didn't want to watch both at the same time. I have plenty of other stuff to watch anyway. Now, I don't know. I can definitely pick something else up right now, so I just might have to do Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess I was inspired by /u/rascorpia and /u/Durinthal to work harder. 

Woo, positive influence with my weird rambling. I have to say you've been good at picking out things I've missed and helping spur on some of my (not intentionally ridiculous) speculations. Always better to have someone else to toss around theories with.

And for other anime with great endings...

* [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) has, well, one of the more famous endings. And then another one after that in [End of Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion:_The_End_of_Evangelion).
* If you can consider an entire movie to be the ending, [The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu) is a fantastic cap to the series ([The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu)). The movie itself has a good ending too.
* [Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) has a great ending but it's a different atmosphere from the rest of the series.
* If you don't mind the dramatic presentation style of the series, [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso) has a great ending.
>> ARTICLE
> Always better to have someone else to toss around theories with

Agreed! I'm glad there are a bunch of us watching this for the first together. You as well have talked about stuff I didn't see at first. Gonna be a wild ride, I'm sure, from here on out.

And thanks for your opinions on the good ending shows. I'm surprised I haven't watched Evangelion yet as it's probably one of the few anime I knew of before I really started watching anime. Bonus thanks for linking to MAL! I've added the ones I didn't already have.

First time watching the series and really enjoying it so far.

One thing is bugging me though: every fight so far seems just too one sided. I mean whichever side has the advantage at any given moment just seems to stomp through their opponent until unforeseen weapon or plan turns the advantage against them then its their turn to be stomped.

I mean the Knightmares are supposed to be this super weapon that helping the Brits conquer large parts of the world - so much so that the Arabic guys were trying to make their own copies yet they just seem to go down in seconds against the same or even weaker models.

Most fights in real life are pretty lopsided.

I feel you, you notice that sunrise kinda wants to sell(they actually sold some knightmare figures) the main knightmares, so they're extremely overpowered in comparison.

Concerning the TTGL re-watch, how about this:

 | Start Date | End Date
---|---|----
Main Series | 18/05/2015 | 14/06/2015
Movie 1 | 16/06/2015 | 16/06/2015
Movie 2 | 18/06/2015 | 18/06/2015

The 2 movies are pretty much just recaps with 20~30 minutes of extra content. There's no real need to watch them but they might be a nice thing to watch if you liked the series. If you want to only watch the extra scenes then just go for the prologue of the first movie and the last fight as well as the last fight of the second movie, that should be more than enough.

Also there are 2 OVAs which I didn't include in the schedule: [Episode 5.5](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10622/) and [Episode 6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3352/) (Which is an uncensored and uncut version of the 6th episode that aired on TV). Episode 5.5 doesn't add much and can be skipped while Episode 6 is fanservice which was pretty nice (   )
>> ARTICLE
I was think of doing two episodes after the [TTGL spoilers](/s "timeskip"), that way people won't get worked up on just watching one episode a day for this kind of show. As for the movies, I'll have to ask the people if they want to watch it or not. Personally, I don't want to watch the first one but I definitely want to rewatch the second one.

How's that?

Edit: Also, we are replacing the 6th episode for the fan service one because the broadcast one is just a recap as well.
>> ARTICLE
In that case, how about using the recap episode (16) as a break and ask people whether or not they want to switch to 2 episodes a day? 

>Also, we are replacing the 6th episode for the fan service one because the broadcast one is just a recap as well.

Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, that's a good idea.
>> ARTICLE
Even though the season ended on a massive cliffhanger, this first season of Code Geass is probably my second favourite anime. I think its a fantastic show with a number of different things and subplots going for it that ends up succeeding in most areas. The show is only 25 episodes but when you reflect on it so much happened during those 25 episodes. The show manages to effortlessly move forward between events while also managing to keep up subplots and involve secondary characters. In my opinion Code Geass has some of the best pacing in anime. The cast is gigantic, but still fairly easy to keep track of. I love how the show manages to keep us up to date on everyone without it feeling overly forced or unnecessary. The plot is pretty good and complex without being overly convoluted

The first season of Code Geass has its flaws, quite a lot of flaws in fact. First of all, as many probably have already noticed Code Geass has quite a lot of plotholes. Especially concerning the usage of Lelouchs Geass. Without spoiling anything I will say that this particular issue of gaping plotholes with Lelouchs Geass does not disappear in the second season, in fact [minor spoiler](/s "this becomes an even bigger issue in r2 and is one of the reason albeit a minor one why I dont think the second season is on the same level. The biggest one is probably why Lelouch doesnt simply Geass everyone with the command Do as I say which is a command he actually uses in r2. The command become my slave is even more direct and raises the question of why he didnt Geass others the same way before. However there is some consistency here. Thing is in the start he was uncertain about his own power and had to learn how to use it to its full potential, gradually learning along the way. He doesnt suddenly become worse at using Geass it seems, only better. However all in all it only slightly covers the plot holes, not closing them")

Second flaw for me is some of the secondary main characters. After rewatching the entire series (sorry, but I lack self-discipline) Ive concluded that there is only one core character that I flat-out dislike. During my first watch approximately a year ago I hated Suzaku with a passion throughout the whole series. However now during this rewatch I noticed that objectively I dont particularly hate suzaku. In fact I dont think hes a bad character at all. I realized that the main reason I hated him so much in the past was that he always got in Lelouchs way and ruined his plans. Im a big sucker for clever character and winning against the odds by outsmarting your enemies. I simply love it when a clever plan comes together. So watching Zero repeatedly getting denied by Suzaku made me irrationally hate him. When I reflect on Suzaku as a character I find him quite interesting. Although he may not have gone the direction that you wanted him to go he has pretty good character development throughout the show. I feel the show does a good job of showing us him growing as a person. Watching the show I can see him growing up.  He has his flaws sure. Hes nave, Idealistic and the probably the shows biggest hypocrite facing competition from Lelouch. However despite this he is not contrary to popular criticism an idiot.  Quite the opposite actually, hes no Lelouch but hes actually fairly smart. His intelligence however is overshadowed by his Naivety and increasingly questionable morals. Suzaku has an interesting backstory and his morals and deathwish makes him very interesting if you actually try to focus on him as a protagonist rather than Lelouchs enemy. Personally I feel he couldve been executed better, but I also feel hes not a bad character, even though he can be extremely annoying at times. 

Tldr; Suzaku used to be one of my most hated characters. This rewatch changed my opinion a lot and I now think Suzaku receives way too much unnecessary hate

Now the character I really dislike in this show is Kallen. She wouldve been fine playing a minor role but having her as a central piece in both the black knights organization as well as in Lelouchs personal life is stupid imo. Firstly her backstory doesnt make a lot of sense. She chose this life over an easy life as an aristocrat but we are never given a proper explanation of why. Sure her brother is frequently mentioned as the previous leader of their small scale resistance movement, but that alone doesnt explain much. However this is a very minor issue. My real problems with Kallen lie in that she doesnt deserve the screen time she gets. It seems to me that the show portrays her as a knightmare prodigy simply because its the only way she could stay relevant to the plot. So everytime she fights I end up cheering against her. Why? Simply because she has no reason to be that skilled and powerful compared to everyone else. She wins almost every fight even when using inferior technology. Furthermore she is entrusted with their most powerful knightmare the Gundam ( I think?) I know shes an ace pilot for whatever reason but it seems to convenient to allow her to maintain a central role. Her sole existence seems to be to make it more difficult for Lelouch to separate his two lives of Lelouch and Zero by creating a third connection between the academy and the ongoing conflict against the black knights. There is also the unnecessary nudity. I dont mind the fanservice that much Im just annoyed that the show seems to exploit her. Honestly feel there arent many reasons for her to exist. I get that zero needs a bodyguard/sidekick and although idk who else than Kallen would fill it I think it couldve been written another way and simply removed her from the show. 

Tldr; Karen is unnecessary, annoying and overly skilled/powerful simply to stay relevant. I think show would be better without her

We will now be moving onto the second season of Code Geass, R2. The ending gets a ton of praise and is by many considered one of, if not the best ending in all of anime. Many people dont make a distinction between r1 and r2 and just think of Code Geass as one 50-hour episode ride rather than two individual seasons. I dont usually use MAL ratings in arguments but the site ranks Code Geass quite highly. The second season boasts an average rating of 9.0/10 while the first season is slightly lower with an 8.87/10 rating.  These ratings as well as the highly acclaimed ending often lure people who havent seen the anime into thinking Code Geass is all about the journey to the end, rather than the journey itself. Something that I think is completely false and wildly misleading. People are led into thinking that the entire series is building up to the finale, and while there is some truth to it especially in r2, the first season should in no way be seen as build up to the second. Code Geass is all about the present plot, as well as I think the characters plans for the future rather than the actual direction the show is going. I think it ruins a bit of the experience if you go into this show having a mindset of enjoying the show but at the same time thinking the ending will triumph everything else. The ending alone tricked many people into giving the second season a 10/10. Im by no means saying that R2 is downright bad, but expecting it to build on r1 and transcend it will probably leave you disappointed. Explaining why the second season isnt on par with the first would go a little into spoiler territory however I think its explainable without revealing anything or ruining the experience however maybe its best if you enter the second cour without knowing anything at all.

Tldr; R1>>R2 dont expect R2 to be the best thing ever just because everyone always talks about how the ending is fantastic 

All in all I love Code Geass, especially the first season.  I rate it between 9/10 and 9.5/10 depending on how critical I am that day. The show is in a weird spot where you both have to pay attention to make sense of it and enjoy it, but at the same time simply go with it and enjoy it for what it is to fully enjoy it. R2 I rated an 8/10 but ill probably touch more upon that after we are done with the second season. This 1500 word+ comment is an attempt to promote discussion but also a way for me to fill the void that i honestly didn't think would resurface considering this is the second time i've watched the show

Lastly it seems Im one of the few who really like some of the SOL scenes and dont find them tedious or out of place. Even though the festivals are kinda ridicules for a normal school I cant help but love the dynamic between Zero and Lulu. Im a sucker for all the weird encounters resulting from multiple people having two lives. It may be extremely cheesy but take as an example episode 21? The one with the massive clusterfuck at the festival that ends with euphy announcing the special zone of Japan.  I cant help but love those interactions between characters trying to hide their true intentions. Sure its filler-ish and made possible by coincidences and whatnot but I at least enjoy it. 10/10 would watch Student-council SOL spinoff

>During my first watch approximately a year ago I hated Suzaku with a passion throughout the whole series. 

Bit late to the rewatch, good to hear this though. I despise Suzaku so much he makes me knock CG from 9 to 8 out of 10 on the scale. Maybe that'll change on a rewatch, but as it is I find the guy so unbelievably stupid, yet he's constantly given so much power/attention during the course of the show. It's been incredibly frustrating to watch, feels like they dropped a shounen character in a seinen and let him thrive, when the guy should've been shot dead in the first episode.

Explain your r1 hate. R2 made much more sense on the grand scheme of things. 
[Spoiler ](/s "Spoiler from this point forward be warned. Lelouch finally manned up and admitted the fallacies in his philosophy but explained why he does the stuff he does still. Then Nunally was developed in this part. She no longer is this plot device to make the older brother feel bad. She has a actual role. She blows things up. Then Suzaku confronted reality in this part. Lastly we see Lelouch for the first time truly lose everything. He even lost his identity of zero. I will always love R2 over R1 because of the last 10 episodes. Those last 10 episodes are just on a whole other level.

Imagine someone asserting that half of you is trash. How would you feel? She is Japanese, and she claims it.

>It seems to me that the show portrays her as a knightmare prodigy simply because its the only way she could stay relevant to the plot....Simply because she has no reason to be that skilled and powerful compared to everyone else. 

Lelouch has absolutely no "reason" to be smarter than every other character in the series either. As a main character you just have skills that help you stand out.

>She wins almost every fight even when using inferior technology. 

Guren Nishiki is actually far superior to all the mooks she obliterates. The only Knightmares on par with it are Gawain (which is actually superior but they never fight) and the Lancelot, which is superior and she frequently draws or outright loses against. No coincidence that those are both Britannian developed.

>Furthermore she is entrusted with their most powerful knightmare the Gundam I know shes an ace pilot for whatever reason but it seems to convenient to allow her to maintain a central role. 

Again, actually the weakest of the relevant Knightmares, but her pilot skill allows her to make up the deficiency.

>Her sole existence seems to be to make it more difficult for Lelouch to separate his two lives of Lelouch and Zero by creating a third connection between the academy and the ongoing conflict against the black knights. 

What's wrong with adding another dimension of depth to the characters? Is she JUST the pilot, or JUST the foil make up your mind.

>There is also the unnecessary nudity. I dont mind the fanservice that much Im just annoyed that the show seems to exploit her. Honestly feel there arent many reasons for her to exist. I get that zero needs a bodyguard/sidekick and although idk who else than Kallen would fill it I think it couldve been written another way and simply removed her from the show.

I don't think she detracts from the show, and in fact she does a lot more than C.C. or Shirley does. One could argue that C.C. could have disappeared after she died the 1st time to reappear at a later time.

>Why? Simply because she has no reason to be that skilled and powerful compared to everyone else. 

Forgive me for asking this, but how much mecha anime have you seen? Natural talent is the single most common explanation for piloting ability in this entire genre. 

>She wins almost every fight even when using inferior technology. 

That's not quite true. Suzaku has been the only technologically equivalent or superior opponent she has faced and those fights have been mostly tied, with Lancelot occasionally having an edge.

>Furthermore she is entrusted with their most powerful knightmare the Gundam ( I think?)

You might have crossed some cables there. But again, her robot isn't really the strongest one at this point in the show. It is quite weak at long and medium range, while the Lancelot is more versatile.

>Her sole existence seems to be to make it more difficult for Lelouch to separate his two lives of Lelouch and Zero by creating a third connection between the academy and the ongoing conflict against the black knights. 

That is part of it, but I would say she provides an additional perspective on the actions of Zero and her personal situation also contrasts with Suzaku's predicament. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are people who think "plotholes" include even cases where the characters are not making the "best" or most "effective" choices in the eyes of a particular kind of audience reasoning...regardless of the fact many of these characters have very different ways of thinking, personal biases and emotional scars that the average viewer does not share.

Even Lelouch is only supposed to be about 17-18 and most of us are getting way older than that by now. How reasonable were we back at that age? This fellow is absolutely immature despite his potential for intelligence and often gets intensely Mercurial rather than remaining coldly efficient. He is a creature of Romanticism, so to speak, not of the Enlightenment, thus irrationality and emotion govern his behavior a lot of the time. 

Then there is the purely mechanical narrative-related stuff like "how exactly did X escape from Y and survive" or "why did C end up at D rather than E" and so forth. My answer is that Code Geass is a operatic soap opera (the expression is fully intended) at heart. It doesn't want to concern itself with realistic attention to detail, but with sweeping up its characters and throwing them against the world with a mix of winking and spectacle.
>> ARTICLE
Yep i mostly agree, but saying Lelouch it makes bad decisions because he's immature undermines his intellect to some extent. However i think youre spot on with that Code Geass delibirately ignores plot-holes rather than bother making up excuses. Which i approve of for the most part. However that said, plot holes is still a pretty valid criticism i think.
>> ARTICLE
I love the fact that you acknowledged that Suzaku was a good character. I personally really like Suzaku, despite the fact that he's an idiot. The character has a lot of redeeming literary qualities and provides a good example of how.. just good Lelouch was. Suzaku's method of saving Japan is terrible, and just goes to show that Lelouch's idea of bloody revolution was the only way to save it. 

> She wouldve been fine playing a minor role but having her as a central piece in both the black knights organization as well as in Lelouchs personal life is stupid imo.

I thought this was an interesting connection that the show put in place. By having Kallen as a central figure in both the Black Knights and Lelouch's personal life, in some way she serves as a bridge between Lelouch and Zero. It's really interesting during Season 1 to see the Black Knights occupy Ashford Academy, and the way Kallen treats everyone in the academy. She's a terrorist yet she cares deeply for the people in the academy. It's a good snap back to reality that these terrorists are also just ordinary people who have loved ones and live regular lives, and that they have sacrificed everything for their cause.

As for Kallen joining the resistance movement, it's because she doesn't want her brothers life to go to waste. Her battle is originally for her brother, similar to how Lelouch fights for Nunnally. 

> It seems to me that the show portrays her as a knightmare prodigy simply because its the only way she could stay relevant to the plot. 

I'm not agreeing with you, but even if what you said was true, why does it matter? If that's the case, then Suzaku doesn't deserve any screen time either. Take away Suzaku's abilities as a pilot and he's nothing. Each character in every show has some sort of purpose.. and I don't see an issue with Kallen's being an ace pilot of the Guren Nishiki. She's also a very great romantic interest =). 

> Her sole existence seems to be to make it more difficult for Lelouch to separate his two lives of Lelouch and Zero by creating a third connection between the academy and the ongoing conflict against the black knights. 

You kind of contradicted yourself just now by saying that her only role was a pilot and now that her role was just a plot device. But again I fail to see how Kallen providing an extra dynamic to Lelouch/Zero was a bad thing. I thought it was actually really interesting and I'm starting to believe you just dislike Kallen for some strange reason.

> R1>>R2 dont expect R2 to be the best thing ever just because everyone always talks about how the ending is fantastic

I completely disagree. In my opinion R2 was the better of the shows but that's really just personal opinion. Everyone be very hyped for Season 2 because season 2 is amazing, just like the first season, and maybe for some people, you'll enjoy it even more than the first like I did.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm ill try to explain why i think R1>>R2 since a lot of people seem to disagree. The main things i loved about the first season were  firstly the pacing. Secondly it was Lelouch scheming and outsmarting Britannia. Im not particularly fond of Mechs, but i enjoyed the battles in R1 quite a lot because the focus was on strategy and Lelouch orchestrating the battle from afar. Personally i also liked the way Code Geass maintaining Lelouch's two lives without raising suspicion. I also simply liked seeing Lelouchs rise to power. He starts out with nothing except his intellect in ep 1 and with the help of Geass builds an enormous network over the first season. 

Now there are a few main reasons why i think r2 isnt on the same level. [minor spoiler](/s "firstly the Mecha battles which i appreciated i R1 have pretty much been changed for the worse. You can say that every high ranked character (knight of rounds, royals, important black knights mebers etc) has their own personalized powerful Knightmare. But when the fighting turns into an arms race where 1 unit destroys every weaker Mech with the blink of an eye im not impressed. I Understand that when you introduce multiple new high ranked characters, those characters will have their own Op Mechs, but it gets pretty stale i think when the battles swing depending on the actions of the Op mechs rather than from overall strategy. I got tired of someone seemingly winning easily until the latest model shows up and everyone else gasps and says something like "what power" "no its the strength of the pilot" "only 60% charged unreal potential" and whatnot. However on the other side ill give some credit to the show here. The show does a very good job of explaining and introducing new mechs by referring to increased funding, as well as mentioning new models before they see action so we know new models are coming. Secondary they explain how some mechs are high-end fairly old models but they lacked an appropriate pilot. The problem isn't really powerful mechs but i want battles that revolve around strategy like season one rather than individual actions of powerful knightmares. I would not have nearly as many problems with the increased power if they were utilized in a grander strategy.

Secondly and probably my biggest problem with r2 is how rushed it seems. some critics think R2 is a train wreck, and while i dont agree with them i think its easy to feel that way if you dont pay attention. The pacing of r1 was one of its greatest strengths but it was pushing the limit of how much content you can put into 25 eps without ruining the flow of the plot. R2, especially in the second half of the show ends up doing exactly that, pushing even more content into a limited amount of episodes. To clarify i'm not saying its bad, i'm actually extremely impressed how they managed to push so much action into 10-15 eps and having it still turn out pretty good. However i think the show would've benefitted from at least 5 eps more. Because of how fast things are progressing in the second half, explaining a few more things and fleshing it out would've made it better. The show often avoids explaining a lot of core elements, and seems of have an attitude of things being the way they are because thats how they are, without explaining why or how. Unless you are completely engaged to the show you WILL start to question the show on some occasions. [fairly hefty spoilers](/s "take as an example Marianne suddenly developing a geass letting her survive inside other peoples soul. I dont mind not explaining these things all the time but the show manages to pull it of juuust a little bit to much") This attitude of not explaining only expecting watchers to go with it allows the show to move forward without spending time explaining. allowing it to fit into 25 eps. Also the whole [spoilers](/s "thought elevator sword of akasha, slay the gods business felt awfully convoluted and need more time to explain how it all made sense. It wasn't terrible but it really should've been explained. We got a few glimpses into wtf was going on but i found it lacking. We got some pretty good pieces of dialogue between Lelouch and his parents but t felt like a cop-out in the way that they first tried to make the show more than necessary and later realized they didn't know which direction to go and decided to simply kill of Marianne and Charles. Again not an issue but should've been fleshed out and thoroughly explain wtf was going on. Also not sure how i felt about using Geass on the gods/subconscious being. Think that was a little too convenient.")

There are also some minor problems like the one i touched on in my original comment about plot-holes escalating. And Lack of character development on Kallen. but those are very minor. A lot of people criticize the show for character inconstancy [Spoilers](/s "Suzaku is a big one deciding to work with Lelouch still believing he intentionally gave euphy the command to kill the japanese. I like Suzaku and him growing up, evolving and gaining rank was a interesting , however him suddenly saying "the results are more important than the means" right after firing the fleija in tokyo after preaching the exact opposite statement previously. I dont think its that big of an issue overall though, since he has changed a ton since we got to know him in the first season. However its not entirely unforgivable")

Thanks for the offer, but money's not the issue for me.

The biggest obstacle is actually no soundproof room to do recordings from. The acoustics of my apartment are really weird and I can clearly hear conversations happening in even the room the farthest away from me, so finding a time when none of my roommates are active in the house so I could actually do a recording is a pain (and even impossible some nights if I'm on a schedule like for rewatches). Also of a lack of time to invest into getting everything set up properly and then editing videos, but that's me being lazy more than anything.

You did make me just think of a few potential solutions though. Nothing in time to do all of R2 but I'll look into it.

Season 1 of Code Geass is easily the better season of the show. It managed to retain its charm through all of its asspulls and unexplained plot points via pure entertainment factor. Season 2, however, amplifies those problems to the point that they really become indefensible.
>> ARTICLE
Season one is certainly better. But I tend to disagree with the conclusion, because Code Geass as a whole is meant to be a show about entertainment, emotion and character rather than about realism, rationality and plot.

I think both seasons can be defended in terms of providing a lot of entertainment value, which is their chief mission statement. The fact you label that a "mistake" or a "problem" appears to suggest that wasn't the point, when I can literally cite early interviews where the staff pretty much admits that was their goal. 

Despite the insanity of the plot twists, there is a method to the madness involved. Basically, you can complain about certain narrative events being unrealistic or impossible in the real world, but I find it quite possible to explain why the main characters take certain actions all the way through, even when they are not acting in the smartest manner.  I can easily defend Lelouch's character progression, for instance, even though I don't share his twisted way of thinking at all (nobody should be using him as an example to follow).


>> ARTICLE
From a critical standpoint, I think S1 is objectively better than S2, however, I feel like S2 has a better entertainment value and personally like S2 more. I don't think season one is easily the better season, lots o people liked S2 better
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I definitely think Season 2 is better than Season 1. 

A lot of people will argue that Code Geass R1 has better writing than R2. It's important to note that R1 had a lot more to work with than Code Geass R2, as the second season was continuing a story whereas the first season was establishing it. R2 is also a lot more emotionally compelling than the first season. It also redeems a lot of the characters in the series. And finally, the ending is easily one of, if not the best endings in anime history.

The cart driver at the end was suspicious, and CC's monologue at the very end pretty much says that Lelouch is the cart driver or still exists.

The opening narration was interesting, ending with CC saying, At the very least, that was the truth as it seemed to Lelouch at the time. So maybe we can finally start getting to the meat of things.

Ok, so it looks like they know its Rolo flying Lelouch.

Black Knights might have to turn on Zero. Well see. Zero always has a plan, and youve been following him this entire time. Have a little faith.

They just want Nunnally to do what they tell her to. I dont like this new woman.

So the live order definitely gave Suzaku the ability to do things he couldnt previously do. Not that he couldnt have disarmed one guy with a knife otherwise. What if the guy snuck up on Suzaku? Would the live order give him eyes in the back of his head?

Diethard loves history, and gets to be a big player in shaping it. Then his idol/hero compliments his hard work. The man is just living his dream at this point. And how far ahead have he and Lelouch planned things out?

Possibility of Villetta fully changing sides to be with Ohgi? Maybe?

Ninas back for a moment with a new big hairstyle. I hope her crazy died down a bit if shes still making bombs. We meet Kanon, and Schneizel is back for a brief moment, like always. I wonder if he was in EU to look for artifacts.

Euphy not Euphie. Been spelling it wrong this whole time. Maybe Cornelias sneaking around and she made the other candle.

Wait, Lelouch is actually going to leave?

A new character from China and Uncle is sick! No!

Awesome! So many Zeros! What a crazy cool plan. Im impressed they made that many uniforms (and in different colors) in such a short amount of time.

This is just such a bold strategy, and Suzakus being incredibly smart about the whole situation. New bitch came close to messing everything up. Shes going to keep causing problems, I bet.

Sayokos surprised, almost proud that Lelouch is Zero. Sorry /u/Durinthal, [but](/s "I don't think Sayoko is Marianne.")

Oh wow. Did Lelouch make the [Euphemia candle?](http://i.imgur.com/q9tO3b3.jpg) Thats really sweet.

**Post Episode Thoughts**

I want to see more interactions with Li, and hopefully well get some now that his time is limited and The Black Knights are going to China.

I guess Villetta will remain in Britannia and work as a spy for Lelouch. Maybe she will report to Ohgi for old times sake.

No more theories for now. Yesterdays speculation was enough for now. I need to see how things play out for an episode or two before trying to guess whats going to happen.

I have to wonder about that. Does the Geass only compel you to obey an order as far as you're aware or is there some extracorporeal element to it? Would it force him to visit a doctor if he got cancer or something? Would it stop him from smoking if he knows it has the potential to reduce his lifespan, even though it won't have an immediate effect?

> New bitch came close to messing everything up. Shes going to keep causing problems, I bet.

Yep, new antagonist for a few episodes after Villetta and Rolo swapped over.

> Sayokos surprised, almost proud that Lelouch is Zero. Sorry /u/Durinthal

Honestly I would have expected her to be *more* surprised to discover that Lelouch is Zero after all the destruction he's caused. I can also keep making things up to support my theory until explicitly proven otherwise. ^(Just like the writers.) [For example](/s "Sayoko was merely surprised that Zero would be willing to reveal his identity to Nunnally's maid. Or for the asspull kind of theory, CC never told Marianne/Sayoko that Lelouch was Zero, just that it would help him and Nunnally if she joined the Black Knights.")

~~Edit: no clue why my formatting is all weird, trying to fix.~~

Edit 2: apparently something really weird is going on with my phone, as using a browser to edit and post the same thing fixes it.

[I'm in disagreement](/s "If Marianne went through all that trouble to look over her children she would know Lelouch is Zero. She'd either figure it out on her own or CC would tell her. Being surprised he'd reveal himself to his maid isn't enough for me.")

I don't think it's a bad theory, and there's still a small chance it turns out to be correct. However, I've been convinced otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sort of in your camp reading the discussion here. It's a shame, because it was a theory that provided A.) an explanation for Sayoko B.) how Marianne could still be around. Now we need to resolve both independently! 
>> ARTICLE
She joined the Black Knights because she's Japanese and she still has her pride as a Japanese, even though it seems muted in her role as a Maid for Britannians. 

Somewhat ironically, revealing to her that Zero is a Britannian Prince gives her the opposite reaction than Lelouch expects if he were ever to have that knowledge go public. But then again that's because she knows his intimately, and that he *really* hates Britannia *really* wants to make Japan a safe place if only for selfish reasons. 

But it's entirely possible that Sayoko is Marianne. Never seen em' in the same place! Also, C.C. does appear to be talking to Marianne, and it's possible that Sayoko is off camera since she's a Black Knight.
>> ARTICLE
>So the live order definitely gave Suzaku the ability to do things he couldnt previously do. Not that he couldnt have disarmed one guy with a knife otherwise. What if the guy snuck up on Suzaku? Would the live order give him eyes in the back of his head?

I mean, didn't Suzaku pull that exact same JUDO THROW against a charging Kallen in R1? Though, it was after the "live" Geass. 

Presumably it only works if he's aware of impending death, and say a sniper's bullet from a mile away wouldn't work? 
>> ARTICLE
It's mainly about counteracting his deathwish.
>> ARTICLE
He did judo throw Kallen, but I don't remember his eyes turning red indicating the Geass was active. 

Let's say he does get shot from a sniper's bullet. Nobody is around to save him, and he's bleeding out. What would happen to him now that he can't obey the live order? I wonder if we'll get to see an example of someone not being able to obey Lelouch's Geass order before the series is over.
>> ARTICLE
From the comments yesterday (or was it the day before?) someone was talking about how the girl who has to mark the Ashford wall was taken home to Britannia / the USA and gets up in the middle of the night to go mark it. I imagine she has to be physically restrained somehow? 

Like, I imagine it's like Death Note, where if it's physically impossible for you to obey you just can't. He can't say "go to the Eiffel Tower in the next ten minutes," it's not a Fate/Stay Night Command Seal. Remember how after Geassing Cornelia to answer him, he asked a question she didn't know the answer to and it just fizzled out? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it showed the wall with crosses and there's a halfway finished cross, implying the Geass ran out or something
>> ARTICLE
No, the last cross was half finished because it  was made during the Black Rebellion when they placed everyone on lockdown. After that she moved away and spends time everyday trying to get back to that wall before the effect ends and she wakes up in a random place along her commute.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of your comments in this thread, while they aren't explicitly plot-relevant spoilers, are detailing information we aren't privy to in the show right now.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you're trying to say, but I haven't said anything that wasn't available to the public by the time X episode aired. I did follow this while it was airing originally, and there was a lot of information available. Furthermore, actually most of the information I talk about comes from old episodes and points that people gloss over. Since we're on a tight schedule, you guys don't have time to really go back and dig into the material. This comment you replied to is just like that.

There are some great questions in these threads that I can't say anything about yet, do believe I'm not trying to ruin anything for anyone.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious where you got this from then:

> After that she moved away and spends time everyday trying to get back to that wall before the effect ends and she wakes up in a random place along her commute.


>> ARTICLE
That could be something I made up for all you know. I just corrected someone who said something that was false. You can arrive there just from putting together pieces. We already knew that the students were seized [Stage 25] (/s "during the Black Rebellion" ), and we also know what happened to them after [Turn 3] (/s "They were brought back to Britannia and Geassed" )

Something I posted about the Vincent is directly from geass.jp. I'm obviously going to advise you not go to that site because it's full of landmines if you can read japanese.


>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen either Death Note or Fate/Stay Night, but...

> Remember how after Geassing Cornelia to answer him, he asked a question she didn't know the answer to and it just fizzled out? 

... that definitely helps explain it. I guess I was expecting a more serious consequence.
>> ARTICLE
The Geass is supposed to have certain limitations and idiosyncrasies. Also, the powers that was used on Suzaku only affects his own judgment, not the absolute state of him living through a crisis. It's just that Suzaku is so keenly perceptive, it may seem like he is aided by some form of Geass omniscience, but it's just his own exceptional senses aiding him.

>> ARTICLE
>Oh wow. Did Lelouch make the Euphemia candle? Thats really sweet.

Yeah, Lelouch still hasn't forgiven himself for what happened to Euphemia.
>> ARTICLE
Nor should he, really.
>> ARTICLE
> So the live order definitely gave Suzaku the ability to do things he couldnt previously do. Not that he couldnt have disarmed one guy with a knife otherwise. What if the guy snuck up on Suzaku? Would the live order give him eyes in the back of his head?

Actually, you missed the point of that scene.
Suzaku WANT to die. He is not interested in saving Japan. He is not interested in saving anyone. Suzaku just wanted to LOOK like a hero, and then get killed so he doesn't have to deliver on his hollow promises. His Geass control activated because he was going to let himself be stabbed, but the Live command forced him to defend himself. Suzaku has a death wish and Lulu had put a stop to it. And since Suzaku is effectively superhuman it is nearly impossible for him to die if he couldn't allow it.

The scene is important to reveal that Suzaku is NOT a hero at all.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Suzaku's actions at the end of the episode totally disprove this. He risked his own reputation letting people go. He's not the cold blooded calculating type, that's Lelouch.
>> ARTICLE
I never said Suzaku was cold or calculating. He isn't that complicated. He wants to rise up the ranks until someone kills him off, from either the Britannian side or the Japanese side. It doesn't matter which. This is why he freely piss off people on both factions.
There is nothing to calculate; his life's goal is to die.

You should have realised that at the beginning when he was framed for a murder he didn't commit. If he works for justice he would have protested his innocence. But no, he happily accepted the execution. There is no long term goal. There is no freeing Japan. There is no reforming Britannia from the inside. The only goal is to find someone willing to murder him. Avenging his girlfriend's death is just a side quest.
>> ARTICLE
I don't deny he has a death wish, but I think it's absolutely incorrect to think he has no plan to save people. You think he was lying about his plan to become the Knight of One?

Not to mention that we HEARD his inner monologue and what he was weighing. He was thinking to himself about how to save people. 
>> ARTICLE
You can't decide to save people while trying to die at the first opportunity you get.

Rising up the ranks is a good way to get killed. The higher the rank, the more enemies you make. The more reason someone wants him dead.
>> ARTICLE
Truly good point. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. I had forgotten he wants to die.

I was also curious though as to if the order would give him a superhuman awareness to impeding death, but we already discussed that a bit in other comments.
>> ARTICLE
> Oh wow. Did Lelouch make the Euphemia candle? Thats really sweet.

Yeah it's not a terribly big surprise that he would do it.  He genuinely did care for Euphemia, he was willing to throw away his entire rebellion for the SAZ because it would allow them to be together.  Plus he did say that she was the first girl he ever loved (right before shooting her I know, but still).  Also if you look into some if the audio dramas (after finishing the series ofc) you can see that as kids that Euphy, Lelouch, and Nunnally were inseparable as children.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he really did like her.

I'm going to save your comment so I don't forget to listen to those audio dramas. Thanks for the tip!

Yeah, I've hardly even realised that they count as OVAs. There's also Nunnaly in Wonderland (joke OVA, still has spoilers), and Akito the Exiled (story OVA, still has spoilers)

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 8: One Million Miracles**

- I don't recall what promise Lelouch made to Rolo? Was it offscreen?   
- Suzaku has a point. Even if Zero does agree to the SAZ, he's still a criminal. I suppose Nunnally could offer blanket amnesty, though?   
- Villetta's being properly paranoid, I think. The Britannians have to recognize the Vincent as the Knightmare formerly on their side that saved Zero during the execution debacle. If Rolo's discovered, she will be too. And "they blackmailed me" doesn't seem like a defense Chuck would accept.    
- Dissension in the ranks of the Black Knights? There's always been some grumbling, but Ohgi and Tohdoh were his most important allies in the BKs. If THEY'RE starting to get nervous, that doesn't bode well for Lelouch.   
- I still don't think Lelouch ever actually married Kaguya.   
- Is Lelouch actually going to go through with the SAZ? Why would he be alienating his BK allies?   
- The Japanese aren't going for it either. Can you blame them?    
- Aw, it's kind of sweet that the student council people still care about Kallen.   
- Suzaku really just wants answers about Euphy. He knows that Lelouch Geassed her, but not that it was an accident; as far as he knows Lelouch mind controlled his sweet-hearted sister into committing mass murder. I don't blame him for not trusting Lelouch anymore, either.   
- Can't die yet, Suzaku. Nice judo toss. Interesting that it seemed to be an honorary Britannian soldier, though.    
- Diethard is like a puppy. Lelouch praises him and he just smiles.    
- Okay, Lelouch clearly isn't planning to join the SAZ. There's something on the table.    
- Is Lelouch's promise then to protect Ashford? For Rolo? Interesting.    
- Villetta really doesn't seem happy with this arrangement. Can't blame her.    
- Nina being all sciencey and stuff! And here's Schneizel, who I really, really want to see more of. And... some guy. Canon? Kanon? Have we met him before, since I don't remember him at all.   
- They're apparently negotiating peace with the EU, or working towards it? Schneizel sounds extremely sensible here. This also frees him up to deal with Area Eleven.     
- Interesting cut on the "everyone has something they yearn for" to Anya. I wonder what hers is?   
- Aw, Arthur.   
- You're all Japanese'd up, Suzaku. An interesting dichotomy, what with you being the Japanese to progress the highest in the Britannian ranks.    
- And he has to sign the order to kill the Eleven who attacked him. Interesting that it cuts away before we learn what his choice was.   
- Horse and buggy? Really, Schneizel? This is your big research institute and you can't set up a fucking light rail?    
- Wow, so Nina actually pushed the button but it didn't work. It would have been a very different series if that'd gone off, I imagine.    
- Schneizel is saying all the right things and seems like an eminently reasonable person. I don't trust it at all.    
- Anya bailed Suzaku out, it feels like.    
- And she asks an important question: Knowing that he's so hated by his people, why does he come back? Is it really all just for the plan he told Lelouch about being the Knight of One?   
- Daaaaaaamn, Cecile. You rock that dress.    
- Whoa, what? There has to be something more here. I think it's completely in-character for Lelouch to screw over the BKs for himself/Nunnally, but to be so direct/blunt about it? He's got something planned.    
- Suzaku is clearly operating under the assumption that this Zero is Lelouch, no matter what his own observations tell. Why else would be so insistent that he face justice? I mean, I guess the current Zero did kill the previous Viceroy and attack Nunnally, so that could be it too.   
- Aw, the candle thing with Euphy's name was sweet. Lelouch really does regret what happened, doesn't he? I wonder if he just feels he's come too far at this point.   
- And then I guess Lelouch is making plans to abandon Ashford for good?   
- OK, getting some sense that Gino's got a little darkness to him, what with talking about a good excuse for a crackdown and all. Sad, I was liking him. I still do, but I was hoping he'd just be a straight-up good guy on the other side of things.    
- Captain China has a lady friend! No idea what's up with her.   
- And Captain China is dying. Of course he is.   
- Nunnally seems way too happy that Zero just showed up. Oh Nunnally. You precious child.    
- I do not understand what Lelouch is getting at with the "What does 'Japanese' mean?" line of questioning.   
- And of course there was something planned. Good job holding off on attacking, Suzaku.    
- Whoa.   
- How the fuck did he get a million Zero outfits with nobody knowing?    
- Kaguya you make a terrible Zero.   
- Wait wtf an iceberg ship? How does that even work? Why not just build a ship?   
- So Nunnally and Suzaku can't recognize Lelouch's voice from inside the Zero helmet, but Villetta recognizes Ohgi within seconds. Of course. Maybe Lelouch's is the only helmet with a voice modulator?   
- Quite the ethical and political dilemma for Suzaku here.    
- And he made the right choice, I think.    
- Nunnally's guardian lady, not liking you so much.   
- It feels like Suzaku and Lelouch actually just came to some kind of understanding. I wonder if that will persist?   
- The glance Sayoko just gave Lelouch and the way the camera focused on it made me definitely wonder if /u/Durinthal's [speculation](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34ftcq/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cquag6s?context=2) is onto something.    
- So the Black Knights are going to China. Whoo! ROAD TRIP!!    
- Suzaku makes a good point: This whole operation DEPENDED on the idea that Suzaku would hold fire, that he wouldn't give into his desire for revenge. Lelouch recognized what Suzaku's real desires were and played on it spectacularly.    
- Aw, the candles :(     

I wonder where it's going from here. Clearly there's going to be a detour into China for a while, but what exactly that entails I have no idea. (Also obviously why Lelouch said his goodbyes to Ashford the place, since he wasn't planning on coming back). It almost makes me wonder if the end result won't have the liberation of Japan but instead Nunnally leading it? Could the BKs even possibly accept that? I don't think that they could, which means that however long we take on our Black Knights World Tour, we'll be coming back here for the final arc at least.
>> ARTICLE

JYB tries to do it to a certain extent in the School Lelouch vs Zero Lelouch, but he just sounds angry. There's actually 3 distinct Lelouch tones in the original, and only 2 in the dub (not for lack of effort, JYB does sound more canned as Zero he just lacks the range). Fukuyama Jun really puts on a super theatrical voice for Zero, whereas Ohgi was just speaking normally because he doesn't know how to be Zero.

I agree, she's getting that character development that seemed to be delayed at the end of last season. Not one of my favorite characters yet but she's climbing the ranks.

> Interesting cut on the "everyone has something they yearn for" to Anya. I wonder what hers is?

That's a good catch, I didn't think about it. Yet another character that we know very little about right now.

> OK, getting some sense that Gino's got a little darkness to him, what with talking about a good excuse for a crackdown and all. Sad, I was liking him. I still do, but I was hoping he'd just be a straight-up good guy on the other side of things.

The straight-up good guy working for Britannia? That's Suzaku.

> And Captain China is dying. Of course he is.

I love your name for him. And do we have any idea *why* he's dying or is it just some incurable disease?

> Wait wtf an iceberg ship? How does that even work? Why not just build a ship?

Presumably the ship would take longer to build, attract the attention of the Britannian military, and not hold as many people. Icebergs can be *massive*.

> The glance Sayoko just gave Lelouch and the way the camera focused on it made me definitely wonder if /u/Durinthal's speculation is onto something.

My first thought at that moment: "Holy shit, was I actually right about that?" I'm still skeptical but the theory's not dead yet!

> Suzaku makes a good point: This whole operation DEPENDED on the idea that Suzaku would hold fire, that he wouldn't give into his desire for revenge. Lelouch recognized what Suzaku's real desires were and played on it spectacularly.

For once Suzaku acted like Lelouch wanted, and that was by Lelouch going for the non-violent plan. The system works!

Pretty sure this was the first time.

> I do not understand what Lelouch is getting at with the "What does 'Japanese' mean?" line of questioning.

I took it as no matter where they go or what they do, they are Japanese. It's in their blood and their hearts. Just because Britannian mistreated them and called them elevens, they are still, and always will be, Japanese. That can't be taken away from them.

I hope now that they realize that and have given up the fight against Britannia, Lelouch/Zero will start planning towards the bigger end game. He needs to find out more about Charles/VV's plans and put an end to them if he truly wants to make the world a safer place, not just for Nunnally, but the Black Knights and everyone else as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I understood at what he was getting at by the episode's end. I literally just write stream-of-consciousness so, didn't understand it then, understood now. :P

And yeah, that promise makes sense. Of course, that one Lelouch clearly has no intentions of keeping. 
>> ARTICLE
That's how I do my write ups too. I just thought answering it segued nicely into that last little part I wrote.

And yeah, he's not keeping that promise. I kind of wish he comes around to liking Rolo, but I'm ready for him to kill him too. Unless Rolo beats him to it and sacrifices himself so Lelouch can live.

  I noticed a lot of people mentioning how weird the ice burg ship is so I thought I'd chime in on this one.  Even if it doesn't always make the most logical sense to the plot, Code Geass has a phenomenal number of what I'd call "Easter Eggs" relating to World War II and generally the Pacific War as a whole.  Sure this one doesn't make a lot of sense, but I love the show for these little nods.

  The ship in this episode is just one of those things and was actually a real concept the British attempted produce during World War II.

  As a bit of a Pacific War buff I've noticed that the list of references is rather extensive.  My personal favorite is referencing Jeremiah as "Orange".  Fun Fact:  Prior to the war, Code Orange or War Plan Orange was a hypothetical plan to fight the Japanese.  And during the War, it was going to be one of the key operations for a land assault on Japanese soil before the U.S. decided to drop the atomic bomb.  Fun Fact.

#***THE MORE YOU KNOW***

The Marianas Islands also played a role in the Pacific War.  But I think  perhaps waiting until a later episode would be more appropriate before getting into that...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think the way Code Geass mixes WW2 and Cold War technology and infuses it with mecha-anime hyper futuristic technology is really interesting. In fact, even the way the Knightmares are utilized as the extension of the infantry and mobile armor vehicles is cool as well, and we get to see its increasing utility in both aerial and naval combat. While Lancelot's evolution to becoming a flying Knightmare and using personalized launchpads reminds me of the evolution of aircraft carriers in WW2.

> Kallen: I am *not* letting you relive that time you saw me in the shower.

---
So Rolo's officially gone rogue now and even the Black Knights are questioning Zero.

"You think you can change Britannia from within?" Clearly not, otherwise Suzaku wouldn't have to kick his ass this regularly.

This regent woman's sketchy. Anyone read braille and can tell us what the transcript says? Not that there's much in that little bit we saw.

Aww, Shirley still cares about Kallen. I'm confused as to why Suzaku hasn't done anything to Rolo yet though, they clearly identified his mech carrying Zero there.

"Why did you kill Euphy? Surely you could have thought of some other way." Yet one more thing to add to his list of fuckups. Live Geass still active! And a flash of Schneizel there.

Diethard already sent Sayoko... where, exactly? *I must know what's going on with her.*

Oooh, Lelouch poking at Villetta now with gi.

Nina! About damn time, I missed her. Schneizel! And I don't know or remember who Kannon is. Oooh we finally see what happened with her during the Black Rebellion. Easy to guess that the bomb failed considering the school wasn't in pieces, but still. Wonder what Schneizel's doing with her.

[Ccile, that's not a dress, that's lingerie.](http://i.imgur.com/wYvLu2V.png) ^(Please report to my bedroom after this meeting.) Lloyd asks the smart question but of course Zero dodges it, though they did the same with Nunnally. They're trying to use her as a figurehead but run everything without her.

The hell? Zero wants let off? Wonder what he's scheming at right now. [Kallen and the Black Knights waiting.](http://i.imgur.com/N4BuGJW.png) And then something with Li Xingke dying? Yeah, I'm clueless about what's going on.

Ah, the army of Zeros, makes perfect sense. ^(Ignore the fact that not a single guard noticed even *one* person carrying a bulky mask, cloak, and outfit on them.) And Sayoko's on an iceberg. Why not?

So.. he basically just got away with emigrating a million people? I'll take it.

[LOOK AT THAT SMILE.](http://i.imgur.com/SdIaJrW.png) I know it's totally not proof for [my most recent tinfoil](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34ftcq/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cquag6s?context=1) and she's probably just smiling because Lelouch is still looking out for his little sister (and she had no idea where he's been for the last year) but come on.

[Wild speculation turn 08](/s "The iceberg drifts off course and they end up in Australia, which was never colonized by Britannia but rather the Dutch. There they find a secret base, codename Orange, where Jeremiah had been experimented on. Villetta decides she can't live without gi and defects, following him south. Shirley is mildly depressed by that until Gino comforts her and they start dating.")

Next-day thoughts:

1. **An iceberg.** Seriously? A million people on a floating block of ice. Oh, and it won't melt because ~~magic~~ technology.

2. **A million people.** How did he still have that much influence over that many people? How did they make and distribute a million Zero uniforms without *anyone* (including those million participants) noticing and reporting it to Britannia?

That ending is the dumbest thing I've seen from this show yet. There's no buildup outside of this episode, just *boom* here's Zero's floating colony.

The thing is, this episode had to be redone entirely because a Sunrise employee leaked the entire episode to internet when it was about to air, so they had to go with an entirely different episode.
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a source for that? I'm curious.

Also that's a really strange reason to change the entire plot of a show, if true.

I don't think that's true. The episode that was leaked, and even then only in part, was R2 episode 3 (from the part where Shirley is on a date with Lelouch to the end of the episode).

This one? Nah, not really.

It really is.

>> ARTICLE
IMO this is probably the single most ridiculous thing in the show, and every other thing in Code Geass can be explained just fine with less of a suspension in disbelief.  Other than the logistics which is a huge issue, Zero has just reappeared with Ohgi's group and Tohdoh's group being the only remmants of the Black Knights. I don't think Zero even commanded one million people during the Black Rebellion which was the peak of his political and military power. 

I just replace every instance of "1 million" with "10 thousand" in my head-canon for this episode, and everything works better. Though it's pretty obvious the show-makers went this way because all the previous episodes have been recaps (every episode in S2 up to this one mimic in some way the first eight episodes of S1), and now they needed to continue from where they left off and have Zero get his independent nation (even if it's just a Miliaries Sans Frontiers/Outer Haven MGS type of deal) from where he can stage his world revolution.

Eh.  If we can let Kallen's midair mecha upgrade slide, we can let that slide.
>> ARTICLE
It's silly and unrealistic, but only "dumb" if you think it's bad for the show to do silly and impossible things...in which case I'd point out this is hardly the first -and certainly not the last- time the show embraces its craziness. 


>> ARTICLE
I'm not even bothering to keep track of how many unbelievable things have happened.

My main issue here is that there's no hint for the viewer as to what's going on with his plan. All we got prior to this episode was that Diethard/Sayoko/etc. were working with the Chinese Federationwith no details on what their discussions wereand that Zero was going to go along with the SAZ plan. The million people following him came out of nowhere and we only knew about the iceberg when it showed up to carry those million people away.

Even a single hint on each of those in a previous episode would have made this more palatable. Maybe I missed him talking to Diethard about these things, I dunno. "How many units [of the Zero outfit] have you shipped out so far?" "Three hundred thousand, with more coming every day," would be great.
>> ARTICLE
> Aww, Shirley still cares about Kallen. I'm confused as to why Suzaku hasn't done anything to Rolo yet though, they clearly identified his mech carrying Zero there.

They assumed that, during the incident in the Chinese consulate, the Vincent had been stolen by Zero. Officially the O.S.I. gave the Vincent back to Guilford's main force.

> Ah, the army of Zeros, makes perfect sense. Ignore the fact that not a single guard noticed even one person carrying a bulky mask, cloak, and outfit on them. And Sayoko's on an iceberg. Why not?

Bags are an amazing invention. It's funny how Lelouch probably had to secretly conquer the textile industry first before carrying out this plan.

> LOOK AT THAT SMILE. I know it's totally not proof for my most recent tinfoil and she's probably just smiling because Lelouch is still looking out for his little sister (and she had no idea where he's been for the last year) but come on.

OR Sayoko simply learned that Zero is someone she can put her trust in. Case Closed. But please continue speculating, some of your (and with you I also include /u/editorialcomplex , /u/rascorpia and /u/neawia) past speculations are hilariously on point in regards to the rest of the series.

> "Why did you kill Euphy? Surely you could have thought of some other way."

Pretty much the only other option would have been to imprison her so she couldn't keep killing the Japanese, though she would try her darndest from wherever she was being kept.  So basically it was a choice between keeping her captive for the rest of her life (this would be highly improbable under the circumstances) or killing her to stop the bleeding from his own fuck up.

There was no stopping Euphy's compulsion to kill the Japanese once the order was given.  So their options were extremely limited and Lelouch took the quickest fix.
>> ARTICLE
He's all about the quick fixes, isn't he? First Shirley, then Euphemia...
>> ARTICLE
In the moment it's tough to be really rational.  In Euphy's situation I honestly think he fucked up so egregiously with his godawful example that there were no good options available to him.  In a way killing Euphy was merciful since there was no cure for her compulsion to kill Japanese and even if there was having knowledge of what she did, even if it was under the influence of Geass, would've destroyed her.

> Aww, Shirley still cares about Kallen. I'm confused as to why Suzaku hasn't done anything to Rolo yet though, they clearly identified his mech carrying Zero there.

They don't know who's piloting it. Remember in the execution episode? Rolo killed (? knocked out?) the guy who was supposed to pilot the Vincent and stole it. 

>Ah, the army of Zeros, makes perfect sense. Ignore the fact that not a single guard noticed even one person carrying a bulky mask, cloak, and outfit on them. And Sayoko's on an iceberg. Why not?

Also presumably they all had the Zero outfit in the bags they were carrying. Which, considering that this was for them to immigrate into the new SAZ, seems plausible, of course they'd have to bring items with them.

I just want to know how the hell he got a million perfectly tailored Zero outfits in time. 
>> ARTICLE
The bags make sense, but no guards bothered to check even one of them, despite the princess making a public speech right in front of all these people that probably had friends or family slaughtered by her sister? Apparently they had no concern for Nunnally's well-being.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing he geassed a whole bunch of factories and had them tailor Zero suits?
>> ARTICLE
And yet no managers noticed, anyone that was off shift at the time, etc? You can't make and ship a million outfits in a few hours.
>> ARTICLE
We weren't really giving a timeframe between Lelouch deciding this plan and SAZ actually happening. It could've been weeks for all we know.
>> ARTICLE
True, but then that gives an even larger window for his plan to be discovered.
>> ARTICLE
But how could it even be discovered? Probably seeing that entire militaries are made out of giant robots, It wouldn't be abnormal for entire textile factories to be made out of machines. All he needs to do is to Geass the engineers and the factory managers and done. He can probably also just tell managers to restrain anyone that gets too suspicious.

Although yeah giant iceberg ship is pretty stupid.

>> ARTICLE
It just seems to me like somewhere in the supply chain someone not under Lelouch's control would have noticed an anomaly, like a retailer that would have expected a shipment of whatever the factory would have made instead of the Zero outfits. Maybe that happened and they were killed, maybe Lelouch made use of an abandoned factory and no one else found out about it that way.

That's ignoring any logistics issues with distributing these to everyone. Britannia seems to crack down hard enough that anything sent through the postal system would be scanned, and making hand deliveries without being interrupted by some Britannian thug (who could notice the outfit and report to the police) seems improbable.

All I'm seeing here is that a million outfits show up without any explanation. Even a line or two of dialogue would make it a lot easier to accept.

Turn 8

* Blah, blah, blah, intros. C.C. really likes to hear herself talk, huh?

* Did Suzaku just blank on that being Rolos Knightmare, or was he just not told for some reason?

* I love how fast Viletta is able to go from sounding compassionate to selfish. Be careful Rolo if they catch you, theyll catch me in the same net.

* Im glad that Lelouch actually treated Kaguya with some decency and respect when she rushed to him.

* What is Japanese?

* * I dont know. Honestly, Im not even really Japanese. None of us are. I mean, do any of us look even remotely Japanese in the slightest?

* * Alright, enough with the [Medium Awareness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness), smart-ass.

* Please consult with me on such matter before hand.

* * Yeah, yeah kiss-ass.

* Millys Priorities: Fanservice, gardening, more fanservice, act quirky, student council randomness, let Suzaku actually do his job of defending Britannia.

* That conversation about Lelouch talking to Nunnally was all sorts of irony. Even Caboose wouldnt be able to tell whats really made of iron or not.

* Surely you could have found another way. Oh, of COURSE he could have! Why didnt he think of it before?! He could have just sent you up to win her over with your AMAZING personality, then watch while you got your head blown off!

* I think random assassin guy was really only there to remind people the Live! order is still in effect.

* [Diethard just turned into Aaron Eckhart.](http://i.imgur.com/ThePcH0.jpg)

* I wonder if V.V. and C.C.s hair can be cut. Does it even grow? Having long, fabulous hair doesnt seem that hard to believe a prince would do.

* Lelouch knows how desperate these people are to have loved ones. Maybe the Britannian government should have done a little more psychological research into these people they hire, especially the only two people who know about Geass.

* Holy shit, Schneizel is tall.

* Never have I heard someone so calmly say how they plan to destroy all hope in the world.

* Heh, Arthur really does only hate Suzaku.

* [More horses!](http://i.imgur.com/J74DRCg.jpg)

* [If only that had worked.](http://webm.land/media/lFq2.webm) Would have saved us a fuckload of headache from her this season.

* At least Schneizel knows how to honor someones memory without being a total fuckwit about it.

* Cornelia confirmed alive. I think I heard /u/rascorpias cheer of joy from here.

* Im a Round could be easily turned into a Whos on First? scenario.

* Gino exposition-blocking.

* [At least someones finally pointing out the gratuitous fanservice.](http://webm.land/media/OjTl.webm)

* Zeros truth is not based on how is within; its the actions that measure the man.

* * Oh, so really are Batman, arent you?

* * Shut up, snarky comic relief!

* If the big terrorist runs away, the little terrorists will shake and quake and disappear. Clearly this man has not seen Zero Dark Thirty.

* Okay, Im just gonna say it. [This transition card](http://webm.land/media/JRZh.webm) looks lamer than something out of Windows Movie Maker.

* I wrote Euphies name right, didnt I?

* * Bitch, how should I know? Im just a dirty, uneducated Eleven, remember?

* So, Lelouch just silently snuck in, grabbed a candle, etched Euphies name into it, and then silently snuck back out with anyone noticing? Tell me he Geassed people all you want; there are really no cameras in there?

* Yes, my lord! Havent heard you in a while. Like, a good twenty minutes.

* [What the fuck is up with this chicks hair?](http://i.imgur.com/rGNnpdt.jpg)

* And, of course he has tuberculosis. Because why not?

* Hell only show up when he thinks we cant get to him. I wouldnt call that cowardice so much as strategy.

* Carales. Because fuck Clovis and Euphemia, right? Then again, they would probably all cheer at being reminded that he killed Euphie.

* Sucks that theyre gonna have to tell Nunnally her plan failed. Or maybe they could just tell her it was a great success, and everybody is just so joyous about it that they forgot to come and thank her. Shes already in the dark about so much else.

* Do I even want to know how long it took them to acquire that many helmets and outfits?

* Iceberg ship: Because Al Gore needed someone to listen to him.

* But, how do we know which one is him? Try starting by looking at the ones not wearing different shades of his outfit?

* This is an act of rebellion! Oh, so thats why they call it that.

* [Why is Lelouch bothering to wear his contact while in the suit?](http://i.imgur.com/icrfifT.jpg)

* [I think /u/rascorpias found a new candidate for best girl.](http://webm.land/media/8u2S.webm)

Couldn't he just do that as Lelouch without sneaking? She's still a princess, plenty of people would mourn her regardless of what she did. If anyone could even notice the name he was carving, that is.

Okay, question that just occurred to me while rereading past posts:

If VV is really Charles' older brother, wouldn't he have been in line for the throne ahead of ol' Chuck? I wonder if, like Lelouch and Nunnally, everyone considered him dead or not.

He probably did pass himself off as a dead prince after gaining immortality. People hate it when they are ruled by something that doesn't age like a normal human.

Specially when that something looks like a seven year old.

Good question. Maybe they're not blood related, but VV found Charles when he was still young. He gave him Geass and sort of raised him, taking on the role of a brother.

Or yeah, maybe the people don't know about VV at all or just think he's dead.

I was tired and stupid, and also stupid. I just clicked the wrong episode and didnt even realize it. Now Im either super dumb or I didnt even need to watch episode 12 because 13 seemed like a decent continuation of 11. Maybe a bit of both, but probably just dumb.

Anyway, I wasnt going to be able to do much discussing today anyway as I have to post this and run (hopefully Ill have some time later to join in on the discussion). So I am sorry for there only being one episode from me today, but I will be back tomorrow with episode 13 and 14 reactions! I will not make this mistake again!

**Episode 11**

Who the hell Sayoko! Wtf! Theres fancy new tech every episode.

Gino! Save Kallen!

Ok so Britannia is just attacking everyone now.

Oh boy, this fightXingke with the spinning blade shield!

Zeros new Knightmare is awesome. Rakshatas the best. Theyd be toast without her. [And what an overpowered attack.](http://www.gfycat.com/OrganicEachKob) It was like Tonys lasers from the end of Iron Man 2. Still awesome though.

Riot! Riot! Riot! Good plan Zero. Quite brilliant. I guess this explains the stupidity that was the last episode, but it was still a risky plan.

What the heck with CC and Anya? What did she do!?!

Xingke slaughtering the eunuchs. So satisfying.

I shall protect you in the future as well, until the very end of *[my]* time. Tianzi is super cute when shes happy, but awww man, shes gonna be crushed when Li dies from his disease.

Shirley, love counselor.

Thank god Lelouch and Li are seeing eye to eye now.

SAYOKO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?!?!?!

Who is the order? Is this the first time they are mentioned? VV and CC are leaders, what is going on? I guess this is why Lelouch ultimately went to China, to find the Geass people.

Did anything change while I was away Nah, nothing major. I totally made out with Shirley though, but thats not that bad, right? I did you a solid. Go have fun.

Anya still taking pictures. Are they enrolling to get closer/spy on Lelouch?


**PSA**

Apologies in advance if I sound like an ass. Im not trying to come across as agitated because really, Im not. I just want to get this out there.

Lets try and be good about these spoiler teases. Saying things like you wont hate character x for long or this episode coming up is one of my favorites doesnt necessarily spoil *details* for us newcomers, but it definitely ruins some of the excitement. Theres nothing to be gained from saying things like that. Discuss those things when the time comes. Youll get better reactions from us if we know nothing.

I know this is a *rewatch* thread, and people who have seen Code Geass before are participating too. I understand theres a small risk involved by joining in with people who have already seen the show. Im just kindly asking that from here on out that everyone try their best to not hype us up on purpose. Use spoiler tags if you must. Youve all expressed how much you love this show, and that the ending is one of the best in anime. So if only for amazing shows like this, let us newcomers experience it with as little knowledge as possible.

Thanks for reading. [Whos awesome?](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130723043308/deadliestfiction/images/6/65/Dexter_is_pointing_at_you.gif) ^Dont ^worry ^Im ^not ^planning ^on ^killing ^you.

**Edit ~5 hours later**

I **AM** going to watch episode 12. Why would I just not watch it? I'll still do a write up as well and post it when it's done. Not sure when that will be (definitely by tomorrow), but I will post it here so everything is organized. In tomorrow's thread I'll post a link back to this comment for easy viewing.

Today ended up being a busier day than normal. The rest of the week looks good though so as long as nothing unexpected comes up (or I don't skip episodes again) I should be good here on out.

**Edit ~8 hours later**

I did it!

**Episode 12**


Sayoko just wanted to kiss Shirley. Cant blame her. Shirleys cute.

Hey everyone, Sayokos a ninja. Oh, but you all knew that already because you watched the correct episodes.

What the heck!?! Three hours of sleep? 108 girls? Why? How could Sayoko think Lelouch has the time to, or could even normally, handle that?

All the nude schoolgirls have crushes on Lulu. They probably have crushes when theyre not nude, but right now, theyre nude.

Sayoko should do these dates with her Lelouch disguise. Its her fault.

Same Lelouch? OMG! The phrasing, the way Anya asked it perfect.

[Hahaha! What the heck?](http://www.gfycat.com/MajorBoldEnglishpointer) How did this happen? This is fantastic. What a [huge group of girls ^technically ^nsfw ^I ^guess.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRMmHbHxBY0)

Odysseus is such a nice guy. Are we to assume all of the people there with him are also princes/princesses?

Uh oh. Cornelia found out about Geass.

Lelouch, you dumbass. You cant dump them all on cupid day.

[Good to see plenty of girls getting ready to jump Gino.](http://i.imgur.com/YmBGkYS.jpg)

Rolo has been hiding his true power perhaps? [Oops. Sorry about that. Then faceplant.](http://www.gfycat.com/GargantuanGreenJohndory) How awkward would it have been if one of them opened that locker? Also, can you imagine seeing a person standing in front of you and in a split second he disappears? Holy hell, that would be freaky.

All the dialogue this episode is fantastic, both the lines and delivery. That girl who took Lelouchs hat, Now Im more confused than usual. What am I doing here? If I was cool like /u/The-Sublimer-One I would make Webms so you all could hear it.

[Fare thee well!](http://www.gfycat.com/FlakyRecklessAyeaye)

Suck it, scantily clad ladies! [Using your bodies against me is useless!](http://www.gfycat.com/DismalTenderBovine)

More funny dialogue, She can take my place in phys ed from here on!

Enough horses for everybody or what?

Seriously, the dub this episode is gold. Anya in her Knightmare. Rivalz goes, Whoa! That cant be for real. Emotionless Anya, It is.

Lol. A riot in the school district.

Anya is always snooping, and now she sees twin Lelouchs. She and Gino probably went to Ashford just so she could investigate Lelouch further. Gino just gets to mess around.

[Anya This is wrong? Villetta Yes. Very wrong.](http://www.gfycat.com/ContentReflectingDaddylonglegs) I cant take it. The freaking Knightmare has its arm stuck in the wall, and then it turns to ask if what its doing is wrong. Anya wins this episode.

Whoa ho, Shirley! More than kiss? Even if Lelouch isnt serious. Dirty girl.

A weather reporter? Really? Alright, if thats what you want, Prez. Also no engagement. Lloyd DGAF. Cecile likes Lloyd.

It's unfortunate that you have to write this still. I was cringing reading all the shenanigans leading up to S1E22 for you first timers. I still cringe when people mention the ending, or pairings, or whatever.  

I mean, spoilers are too be expected this long after the show aired, and in a thread with people who have seen it. But people should be able to wait a day to talk about the next big reveal. Not only is it so much more raw and interesting to see your reactions unfettered, it's a courtesy to you. If you wanted spoilers, you would read them all across the net. 

I hope you all can just enjoy each episode as it airs and make your own judgments based on your experience and suspend your expectations.

For the record, the order was mentioned before by Rolo and Villetta at least.

It's definitely not been a focus so far, and for that matter I don't really dig that part of the series to be honest.

You... You... You... What the fucking fucking fucker-fuck? I... I have no words. Go to your room and watch episode 12 now, you son of a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Man im so sorry you mixed up the eps i would still strongly suggest you check out ep 12 tho, its kinda SOL-ish but i personally actually like most of the SOL moments in Code Geass and think they're often a breath of fresh air, without feeling out of place. + theres also quite a bit of important stuff going down. especially building up to the ep you just watched [ Ep. 13 major spoilers DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED](/s "Im sad that you watched it out of order because i think that will make one of the saddest scenes in the entire series seem very rushed. Im probably the biggest Shirley lover out there, but i think even the viewers who see Shirley as nothing but a distraction from Lelouch's shenanigans will be affected by this ep. You were kinda lucky in that the episode you missed was one of the least eventful episodes plotwise atleast but you still lost quite a bit, especially concerning the buildup to this ep. Personally after you watch episode 12 i would recommend you rewatch episode 13, you probably wont bother and i completely understand why, but i think rewatching, atleast the last 5 min after you watch ep 12 will leave a bigger impact on you.")

Wow I am so blow away by these redditors doing writeups and the sheer amount of work they put into writing these things. Following these threads I was sure the length of the show and the amount of content in each episode would make some of you stop or at least not write as much as the time went on. But man even with 2eps/day you fellas still post the second these threads go up. I am relatively new to r/anime but man these threads are fun. 

I also have to congratulate you all for making me kinda relieve the glory days of Code;Geass discussions on /a/ back when it was first airing (for those of you who weren't there at the time those threads were the best and most fun thing that happened in an anime related community, hoping I'm not the only person here who has a fond memory of those). I will love reading your future opinions and what your outlook on Lelouch & Co. is. 

All in all I am simply trying to thank you for making this an even better experience than it already is and want you to know that your theories and predictions are SUPER fun to read and boy do I have to restrain myself from spoiling half the show at some occasions. 
In hindsight I should have done a write like this at he end of the show to thank you but alas I think you deserve one already as the show is reaching its boiling point so some encouragement to keep being awesome can never go to waste. 

@ /u/Durinthal  /u/Neawia  /u/EditorialComplex  /u/The-Sublimer-One /u/rascopia  and also everyone in these threads :)

Thank you.

Yeah, these guys are really fucking awesome at what they do. I mean, come on. We get like 30 comments in an hour and the amount of upvotes we get is half of what the comments are. 

Honestly, I never knew that we get this consistency in terms of comments this far into the show. I mean, sure, after the first episode it goes downhill as to how many people pay attention to the rewatch, then some people lose interest altogether. But these guys are just a step up from the rest, and are the ones that continue to make this rewatch as popular as it is now.

#**It ain't me, dawg, it's the other people who keep on watching.**

If I'm joining a show's rewatch as a first-time viewer I'm sticking with it. Gintama, Kimi ni Todoke, Sakurasou, Sakura Trick, Shinsekai Yori, So Ra No Wo To, and now Code Geass. 

I'm just glad other people are crazy enough to join me, though there hasn't been much overlap between most of those shows.

[This is an interesting conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34qvyw/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqy0uct?context=7) in yesterday's thread continuing to a few hours ago and part of it is leading me to think in new and weird directions.I need to consider it some more before coming up with a new theory, which might be my biggest crackpot idea yet.

Aside from that, I'm now firmly in the "Lelouch is a villain" camp. Thanks /u/VallenValiantfor the counterargument and thanks /u/EditorialComplexfor putting it into words before I fully could.

---
Can't be Rolo in disguise as he was at the table. He's either in on it or very confused right now. Okay, he's in on it. ... *Sayoko?* ^(This *almost* supports my glamour theory.)

Okay, so between being able to **perfectly copy another person's face and voice** and **rewrite people's memories** I'm surprised Charles hasn't *already* conquered the entire world. Though honestly the memory thing alone should probably be enough.

Well, that answers my question about using the empress as leverage, High Eunuchs don't care.

I don't really think Kallen needs to be [strapped in that much.](http://i.imgur.com/EZUg4CT.png) Now's the time for Ikaruga to live up to its name and start eating those bullets.

CC with the ass-shot this time, and Anya with all the firepower in the world.

I do feel bad for the poor little girl in the middle of all of this.

Yet another new Knightmare. I'm not even going to bother learning the name of this one as it'll be outclassed in a few episodes.

Yep, kinda dumb to broadcast that you're evil to your enemy. Diethard's again in his element.

...what the hell just happened with Anya? I remember CC doing something like that to Suzaku while he was inside Lancelot but this seemed very unintentional. [Nunnally and Lelouch pre-assassination, huh.](http://i.imgur.com/hAqwkks.png) I'm just going to assume she's a princess that Charles mind-wiped and move on.

Hey, Schneizel's not an asshole. I can respect that. Damn, Kallen's still with Britannia though. At least that could prove more interesting than everything else that's been happening recently.

[Huh.](http://i.imgur.com/SA4ezhH.png) So they messed with Jeremiah in one of those Geass locales trying to make him like CC, I'm sure that will turn out great.

Lelouch once again shows his lack of empathy for others. "I could just Geass them and make them agree to whatever I want!" I'm surprised he didn't take Shirley's answer completely the wrong way, but either way it still feels hollow coming from him.

Lelouch's "main goal" is tracking down an entire organization that's barely been mentioned before this episode? If it's come up at all; I'm giving the show the benefit of the doubt. I'm going to guess that's the group of people all with the Geass symbol on their foreheads that we've seen flashes of before. Oh, and both CC and VV were members of this organization. [That's an interesting look on her face.](http://i.imgur.com/RT9swNb.png)

"Nothing of immediate concern," Sayoko? Something went on with Shirley there for sure. Welcome to school, Gino and Anya. Join the student council next and you'll be full cast members.

---
That was quick. So out of... I think it's now ten current and former student council members, only three of them are normal students. And that's stretching it for Milly, given her social status.

Yep, Sayoko kissed Shirley. ^(Never thought I'd get to type that.) Gonna be fun to clean up after that. And by "fun" I'm guessing Lelouch will crush Shirley's soul. Again.

[Too bad this is gibberish.](http://i.imgur.com/tQaJ4m9.png) Note that Anya's file is a lot more censored.

[Train wreck of an episode inbound.](http://i.imgur.com/5nRU4p8.png) Props to Sayoko for managing to fit 108 girls into one day anyway, I'm sure that had to be a scheduling nightmare. Meanwhile, Kallen's still being held prisoner by Schneizel.

Yes Shirley, tear him a new one. Come on Milly, it was just about to get good. Don't interrupt with your [asshats](http://i.imgur.com/M8hrpHw.png) right now.

Ooh, insight on Britannia's small council. I'm wondering if all of them are royalty, wouldn't be surprised. And even they don't know where Cornelia is? Now I'm excited to see what happens with her. [Knight of One](http://i.imgur.com/cgfaWlo.png) lost his eye, interesting... wonder if Geass had anything to do with that, maybe he also lost control and chose to sacrifice the eye instead.

[*HELL YES CORNELIA.*](http://i.imgur.com/KYwVI55.png) And /u/EditorialComplex [was right](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34bak8/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqt3gsa?context=3), she's trying to clear Euphemia's name!

I was anticipating another ridiculous chase for the Cupid Day thing, but nice job Rolo. Didn't know his Geass hit that wide of a radius, interesting that he can control it. Takes more power of course.

More sweet Cornelia action. Interesting that Bartley said something about them being the worst criminals in history right before that...

Lelouch, you can't just Geass every single student here. Eventually you'll hit someone that you already used it on for some other dumb reason. Ah, here's the chase scene. [I love Sayoko.](http://i.imgur.com/O0YUMdn.png) This is silly, the herd of horses just sealed it. I hope someone has a clip of that. Anya goes for the overkill option on top of everything else.

Shirley nearly took off Sayoko's mask there. I'm glad she isn't heartbroken about the whole thing.

That was a really sudden shift for Milly. One second she's wrapping up her silly school event, the next she's reporting the weather and called off her engagement with Lloyd. Couldn't they have at least spaced that out by an episode?

[Damn it, Jeremiah.](http://i.imgur.com/K51wHIW.png) Just when I started to hope we could avoid more Geass bullshit for the rest of the series. Worse, there goes Shirley. **ALL OF THAT MAKING HER FORGET WAS USELESS, LELOUCH.**

[Wild speculation turn 11](/s "Jeremiah goes to Ashford Academy and uses his Geass Canceler there; half of the student body realizes Lelouch has issued them a trivial command at one point in time. Another mob forms to capture him, but this one is much less cheerful. Meanwhile Anya remembers that she used to be a princess and joins Lelouch in his attempt to bring down Charles. Gino is mildly depressed by that until Milly comforts him and they start dating.")

Welcome to the club... and here's your literal club to defend yourself against the more ravenous elements of his fanbase.
>> ARTICLE
I see you misspelled "correct members of his fanbase"

Just thought I'd point it out.
>> ARTICLE
The big question, of course, is whether or not a villain can be interesting. My answer is yes, and even villainy does not necessarily mean pure evil. Those are often rather incorrectly confused. Whether or not you will give Lelouch at least some consideration for his non-villainous traits, they do exist alongside his more outright "evil" ones. 

As for the "organization" in question...I believe the specific term used for it, at least in the Japanese version, was previously brought up in some conversations between Rolo and Villetta. It isn't entirely new. Not a whole lot, admittedly, and I don't care much for that part of the series myself.

>> ARTICLE
> The big question, of course, is whether or not a villain can be interesting.

Not much of a question, *of course* villains can be interesting. Just look at the popularity of shows like Dexter and Game of Thrones. There's also the beast that is Star Wars after you take the prequels into account.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, when a certain part of the audience hates a villain too much, they tend to only wish for his horrible and painful defeat without accepting anything else as a viable alternative. Why? Because they are already too angry to find any value in his or her continued existence. I do not feel that strongly against villainy myself, but others do.

Eh?  Sayoko's not in the Emperor's employ

>...what the hell just happened with Anya? I remember CC doing something like that to Suzaku while he was inside Lancelot but this seemed very unintentional.

Yep.  CC seems to have only loose control of this Vulcan Mind Meld thingie at best.

> [Nunnally and Lelouch pre-assassination, huh.](http://i.imgur.com/hAqwkks.png) I'm just going to assume she's a princess that Charles mind-wiped and move on.

There's nothing that says she has to be mind-wiped.  (Is there?)

>Lelouch once again shows his lack of empathy for others. "I could just Geass them and make them agree to whatever I want!"

You'll note that he was saying that in wonder at why he couldn't bring himself do it.  It might have been a good chess move, but the fact that he has empathy is exactly why he couldn't take it.

>I'm surprised he didn't take Shirley's answer completely the wrong way, but either way it still feels hollow coming from him.

I just want to note the pinky-swear echo being made explicit here  Lelouch/Nunally and Xingke/Tianzi.

Er.  That was the real Lelouch, not Sayoko.  She expertly leapt away when Anya went all Kool-Aid Man.

>Just when I started to hope we could avoid more Geass bullshit for the rest of the series.

You do remember the title, right?

>**ALL OF THAT MAKING HER FORGET WAS USELESS, LELOUCH.**

Well, *now* it is.  Who knew un-Geassing would be a thing?  And I have a feeling she's not gonna be super happy she has those memories back.
>> ARTICLE
> Sayoko's not in the Emperor's employ 

The mask seemed like a high-tech device when I first saw it, which could be copied. That was before I was aware of Sayoko's awesome ninja skills.

> There's nothing that says she has to be mind-wiped. (Is there?)

True. I just assumed that she would have remembered him if she wasn't. Even if she assumed that he died years ago, the sudden reappearance of Nunnally should have raised some questions beyond "you look like this kid" for her.

> It might have been a good chess move, but the fact that he has empathy is exactly why he couldn't take it.

Or it would be a waste of a Geass on those important figures if he could find other ways to manipulate them.

> Am I the only one who finds these horseplay shenanigans fun?

Depends on the context and my mood.

Thank you! Fun things to note in that:

* There's a lacrosse player *that looks male* [wearing a pink hat](http://i.imgur.com/zS23ZFV.png) and the girl running with him is holding onto his stick.
* I don't even have a clue what [this guy's carrying.](http://i.imgur.com/kRfIJBb.png)

* So does [this guy in the background](http://i.imgur.com/HgWV5N8.png) who hasn't moved the entire time. The girl next to him looks anxious though.

> Er. That was the real Lelouch, not Sayoko. She expertly leapt away when Anya went all Kool-Aid Man.

I wasn't sure if that was the case, I wasn't keeping close track of the two.

> You do remember the title, right?

*Lelouch Lamperouge Must Die* is just asking to be used in my recaps at some point. Also it could easily remain titled *Code Geass* with Lelouch being the only one possessing it as the show's gimmick.

> And I have a feeling she's not gonna be super happy she has those memories back.

The question is does she *know* that he wiped her memories? I'd almost be angrier at him for covering it up.

To be honest it does make me wonder if Lelouch can now use his Geass on these people again after RoboJere cancels them. If that is the case I can see this plan backfiring so hard. 
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering that too, can only guess at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, admittedly this is just going on the animations they use, but I'd guess so? Because we see that Geass changes the neurons inside a person's brain, and the Geass canceler changes them back.

So like... imagine the brain has two states: 0 (Ungeassed) and 1 (Geassed). If a Geass sets the position to 1, it can't be re-set to 1 with new commands, unless someone sets it back to 0.

But then again, Charles could Geass people Lelouch already Geassed, so I have no idea. 
>> ARTICLE
If the geass affects different neurons, analogy still can work. 
Lulu geass works in the ones column, 0 for ungeassed, 1 for geassed. 

Charlie could work in then tens column, x0 for un, x1 for geassed. 

Rolo might affect the hundreds for xx0 or xx1 for a few seconds. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought you would have been excited about Shirley getting her memories back. How the hell could Lelouch have known De-Geassing someone was possible? Besides, Lelouch's Geass got overwritten by Charles' anyway.

**Episode 11: Power of Passion**

- So Milly's all right. But this Lelouch... isn't Lelouch. What the hell is going on?    
- Oh. It was Sayoko. Damn, that's... huh. I do like Rolo's admonishing her to stop being so nice, though. That's pretty funny.   
- "They can't just start shooting at us!" And then they start shooting at them. The Eunuchs don't care about the Empress or about the tombs. Dicks.    
- "Her Imperial Empress" seems a bit redundant. Surely "Her Imperial Majesty" or "Her Imperial Excellency" would have been a better title?    
- I wonder who the 'replacement empress' is. Surely not Xiang-Lin despite the camera being on her? That would be super random.    
- Good to know that even when she's a prisoner of war, Code Geass finds a way to emphasize Kallen's boobs. Funny that it's something Gino's annoyed with the Chinese over; HE wanted to be the one to beat Kallen.    
- But not just Kallen. CC can get in on the Kallen-cam action, too!    
- Super-gun, super-shield. The Mordred really is Gundam Virtue 2.0, isn't it? Only with a more manly pilot.    
- Conversation aside, this is a pretty neat fight scene. Tohdoh and Gino/Suzaku look to be evenly matched.    
- Haha, the Eunuchs' final laugh at the end of the conversation is a pretty classic Beijing Opera villain laugh. Nice touch.      
- Awwww, Tianzi :(     
- That was like the death-flaggiest of death-flag actions and yet Captain China didn't die. Huh.     
- Seriously, that was Mwu la Flaga levels right there.     
- New Knightmare, though? Interesting.      
- So Lelouch has a new unbreakable shield. Cool scatter-shot weapon, too.    
- Was this really all done to convince Xing-Ke to join forces with him? Kind of a convoluted way of doing it, don't you think? Why not "Hey, Xing-Ke, let's save the Empress together since we have similar goals"? Doing it the roundabout Lelouch Way lost him his best pilot and most advanced Knightmare.     
- Ah, the good ol' Engineered Public Confession. High Eunuchs fail.     
- And Captain China was also planning a rebellion at the same time. So is that why Lelouch felt he had to wait? To get evidence of the High Eunuchs' betrayal? But he STILL didn't have to fight Xing-Ke and the Shen Hu for that.     
- Okay wait, what just happened with CC and Anya?    
- Rewatching it, we see in quick succession: Lelouch, Marianne, Lelouch and Nunnally. And CC says "so that's what you did," when she talks out loud to Marianne?      
- ...please tell me my "Anya is a clone of Marianne" joke isn't actually true.     
- OK, the fall impact alone should have killed her. But it's anime, so probably not.      
- And Schneizel continues to be a calculating motherfucker. Who apparently has ambitions of being Emperor?     
- Bye, Eunuchs. Can't say you didn't deserve it.     
- But Kallen's been taken by Britannia. What's the point of giving her food if you cover her mouth?       
- I feel like Bartley has been in over his head since literally the beginning of the series.      
- Still want to hug poor Tianzi.      
- Lelouch, I'm beginning to think that you don't understand what Tianzi and Captain China's expressions mean towards your idea of putting her into ANOTHER arranged marriage.     
- Man, Lelouch, keep blowing off Deithard like that... he has a point. But it would probably ALSO ruin your new bond with Captain China's faction.     
- As much as it blows my mind to say it, Tamaki has a point. The veteran BKs probably DO need to make sure they're respected by the newbies.     
- I sort of love the idea that Lelouch is getting critical strategic advice from Shirley's thoughts on love.     
- Lelouch and Shirley do have a really cute relationship. Outside of, you know, him wiping her mind and everything.     
- Tianzi's dress makes her look like she has a huge ass.     
- And now Lelouch is returning to Japan right after Sayoko probably just made Shirley think Lelouch loves her. Welp.     
- That was a shorter tour into China than I'd anticipated.     
- ...is this the first we've heard of this religious order? Because I don't remember it at all.     
- It does, however, explain where the hell VV, Bartley and Jeremiah et al are.     
- What is Sayoko's deal???     
- And now Anya and Gino are students. Excellent. The potential for shenanigans has just gone up immeasurably.      
- That last shot of Lelouch rejecting Gino's buddy-buddy was hilarious.      

**Episode 12: Love Attack**

- You fucked up when you kissed Shirley, Sayoko.     
- Interesting detail I noticed: While Gino's file has some redacting when Villetta looks at it, Anya's has WAY more. Is my clone theory really coming true?    
- Oh. Sayoko's a ninja secret service agent. Well, I can honestly say that that was a detail I never saw coming.      
- A ninja secret service agent who has way more game than Lelouch ever could, yet no concept of how personal relationships actually work.    
- Fanservice. Yay for convenient steam.      
- Poor, poor Shirley.      
- I like that Sayoko planned a day giving equal importance to signing a trade treaty as well as his various dates. Also, the Shinkiro has a sweet-ass water mode.     
- Anya wonders if the picture is of Lelouch. It obviously is. Gino wants to go to black market chess games. Gino is hilarious. And NOT being bit by Arthur.     
- Shirley is upset, and deservedly so.    
- Good timing on the interruption, Milly. And she's choosing to graduate now? Huh.     
- Milly, I'm... not sure you can just order that sort of thing. I don't think it works that way...     
- It probably does in Code Geass-land.      
- Odysseus seems like a good, gentle person. He is clearly not cut out for the Game of Geasses.     
- On the other hand, Schneizel is a calculating motherfucker. Reasonable, too. Don't declare war, but get what you want by posturing.    
- I like the look of the Bismarck guy.    
- And apparently he's the Knight of One. But he doesn't think war is the best option? I suppose to know peace you must be a great warrior or some shit like that.    
- Is his eye sewn shut???     
- Calling it now, he has a Geass hidden behind that shit. And it'll be a King Bradley-style "haha I've lifted my eyepatch and now I'ma kick your ass" moment when he busts it out.     
- Though if he was going to do that, surely an actual eyepatch would be less painful than sewing your damn eye shut.      
- Cornelia!! I missed you.    
- Wow, so my prediction about Cornelia wanting to clear Euphy's name actually... seems pretty spot-on.    
- "Why do you have to do things like meet with the Viceroy and have important political meetings? Come to school for a silly graduation dating game!" - Gino, probably.    
- Aw, Guilford. You're a good guy, Guilford. Offering to be Suzaku's senpai like that.     
- Kallen was expecting to be executed, but instead, surprise Nunnally! What she doesn't know is that she WILL be executed. Executed by love from a blind girl.    
- To Lelouch's credit, he's at least trying to get Shirley out of the game.    
- Here's how I know Code Geass is fictional: Arthur is tolerating wearing those hearts on his head.    
- Lelouch is like a cornered animal here.     
- Gino and Anya have their share of admirerers too, it seems.     
- Is that guy going to try to catch Anya in a fucking NET???     
- Wow, Milly. How cruel of you. Poor Rivalz.     
- Rolo bumping Lelouch's head on the side of the cabinet is pretty hilarious.     
- Interesting. So why is Bartley's team the "worst criminals in history"? Curious.     
- Here's Cornelia...!    
- Aw, there's a couple on the bench when the girls are chasing Gino. That's cute. He's having a blast with this.    
- Good thing that girl didn't take his hat where there were others around to see him.    
- And Sayoko is unable to not be a ninja. That's fucking hilarious.     
- Did Sayoko just say she wants Milly to catch her? Sayoko x Milly confirmed OTP?     
- Sayoko as Lelouch is amazingly ridiculous.     
- And now everyone will think Lelouch is gay.     
- Oh, there go all the horses from the OP riding together.     
- And there's the Mordred. Of course.    
- Anya's voice actor nails the monotone "it is." I smiled.     
- Aw, and the "I shouldn't? ...I shouldn't" was cute, too.    
- This is a cute scene with Lelouch and Shirley. It's really sweet.    
- Rolo looks pissed that Lelouch ended up with anyone.     
- Aw, Milly did it for Lelouch and Shirley. That's so cute.     
- Milly the weatherwoman! That job suits her.     
- And the wedding's off. For the best, really.     
- So what Nina said the other episode really did get to her.      
- Jeremiah has reverse upside-down blue artificial Geass now. Okay.     
- Oh shit, it's a Geass Canceler. And it got Shirley.    
- Oh, SHIT.      


Episode 11 was a neat action episode with Captain China and Tianzi both being endearing. 

Episode 12 was adorable until the very end where it suddenly got horrible. Oh god. This can't be good.

> Was this really all done to convince Xing-Ke to join forces with him? Kind of a convoluted way of doing it, don't you think? Why not "Hey, Xing-Ke, let's save the Empress together since we have similar goals"? Doing it the roundabout Lelouch Way lost him his best pilot and most advanced Knightmare.

I think at that point it's just making the best of a bad situation. Still, it would have been better for them to work together in the first place.

> ...please tell me my "Anya is a clone of Marianne" joke isn't actually true.

That wouldn't surprise me. Throw in all the sci-fi!

> Man, Lelouch, keep blowing off Deithard like that... he has a point.

I expect Diethard to attempt to take over the Black Knights the next time Lelouch runs off on his own.

> ...is this the first we've heard of this religious order? Because I don't remember it at all.

We're all clueless here.

> A ninja secret service agent who has way more game than Lelouch ever could, yet no concept of how personal relationships actually work.

And this is why I love Sayoko.

> Milly, I'm... not sure you can just order that sort of thing. I don't think it works that way...

Her family owns the school and she's the president of the student council. Why not?

> Odysseus seems like a good, gentle person. He is clearly not cut out for the Game of Geasses.

You know what happens if you refuse to play the game...

> Calling it now, he has a Geass hidden behind that shit. And it'll be a King Bradley-style "haha I've lifted my eyepatch and now I'ma kick your ass" moment when he busts it out.

My theory is that he deliberately had his eye removed because he had it and wanted to get rid of it, but I like your idea too.

> Aw, Guilford. You're a good guy, Guilford. Offering to be Suzaku's senpai like that.

Forgot to mention that in my post but it's a sweet little moment. Guilford's climbing my ranks of favorite characters.

> Did Sayoko just say she wants Milly to catch her? Sayoko x Milly confirmed OTP?

She's been around Milly for years, I have to wonder.

He's the Knight of One, and he meets Charles alone in some secret room. They're tight. Pretty good chance that he had Geass. Perhaps it become uncontrollable like Lelouch's, and so in order to not be a menace (or just so he could be around people) he removed his own eye.

>But Kallen's been taken by Britannia. What's the point of giving her food if you cover her mouth?

I *think*(but don't quote me on this) it's just done as a form of torment to try and get her to be willing to give up information.  Just along the lines of "You want food?  It's right here.  You can have it whenever you feel like talking."

>The **Eunuchs** don't care about the Empress or about the tombs. **Dicks.**

Lots of things the Knightmares do should kill their pilots, rattling around in those little boxes.  Something something advanced anti-shock technology mumble mumble.

>I sort of love the idea that Lelouch is getting critical strategic advice from Shirley's thoughts on love.     

Right?  Shirley best girl.

>Odysseus seems like a good, gentle person. He is clearly not cut out for the Game of Geasses.

Definitely get that feeling, yeah.  How do the apples keep falling so far from the tree?

>Kallen was expecting to be executed, but instead, surprise Nunnally! What she doesn't know is that she WILL be executed. Executed by love from a blind girl.

*Hnggggg*ed to death.  What a way to go.

Oh, boy. Two at a time. Guess Ill have to start splitting these into multiple comments.

Turn 11

* No intro this time. Just starting *in media res* it appears. (I can be fancy and Britannian, too.)

* Theyre so concerned about Milly. They need their resident genki girl!

* The lack of contractions from Lelouch is suspicious. If Psych has taught me anything, its that pineapples are the greatest, and Sayoko is a middle child.

* Also, Sayoko is Lelouchs stand-in. Let your perverted fantasies run wild with that.

* Ohgi: We still have the Chinese empress as a captive! They cant just start shooting at us!

* Eunuch: Start shooting at them!

* *Laugh track and roll opening credits*

* As for the empress, they want her to die. No shit, dumbass.

* I want to know who this puppet bride is. My money is on an actual, fuckable android. Wait. Is this turning into Ghost in the Shell?

* Wow, Gino sounds fucking ruthless right now. Scary how can just switch like that.

* [That line plus that shot equals rape.](http://webm.land/media/ZIIG.webm) Theres just no way around it. Kallens gonna get [Berserk Spoiler](/s "the Casca treatment.")

* Lelouch: C.C., if we lose have an escape route.

* C.C.: If you come up with a smart trick, I wont need one.

* Lelouch: Bitch, I didnt ask to be patronized!

* Stand aside! I am the greatest dub VA of all time, and you fuckers aint got shit! Not even Troy or David!

* [C.C. graciously filling the role of fanservice pilot with Kallen out of commission.](http://i.imgur.com/zhbH7E6.jpg)

* [For how complicated these Knightmares are said to be, it never seems to be harder than playing Top Gun with a joystick.](http://webm.land/media/0r9X.webm)

* Nina seems surprisingly calm for Zero being only a few hundred meters away. Surprised she didnt wrestle the controls away from the pilot in an attempt to kamikaze the mountain.

* [Now, this is just fuckin gross.](http://i.imgur.com/Lb7Oey4.jpg)

* Maybe now that finally understands (though he should have understood a lot earlier) how few balls those Eunuchs actually have (teehee), Li will put aside his grief with Zero (at least for the time being).

* Did Code Geass inspire Joss Whedon to write The Avengers?

* Noblemen? Youre bureaucrats! [Hey!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljjuy3fJM21qzf45i.jpg)

* I cant tell if the empress is stupid for going out there, or smart for knowing it would inspire Li. Ill just go with strategically nave.

* [Okay, admit it. That line was fucking badass.](http://webm.land/media/Cae2.webm)

* Finally! Lelouch showing these motherfucks how shit is done! Redeeming himself from last episode! And thats not all, Meredith! He also did it in a braaaaand neeeeeeew Knightmare!!

* [Is Lelouch starting up the Knightmare or Windows 98?](http://webm.land/media/QODT.webm)

* Im not even gonna ask how Rakshata builds this crap, for fear of post-knowledge death.

* [I find it interesting how the Enter key opens down here.](http://i.imgur.com/TfZpLAj.png)

* OH! So, all you wanted to do was prove to him that he needed you? Well, you wanna know an easier way you could have done that? NOT DOUBLE-CROSS HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE!

* As I have recently been informed, strategy is actually what occurs around a battle while tactics is what occurs during a battle. Yeah, so that line actually makes sense.

* Mass riots? Thats gonna cloud everyones hue. Hope they bought some helmets.

* So Lelouch pulled the equivalent of that guy who caught footage of the cop planting the Taser on the guy he shot, but on a way bigger scale. How long until that city from Hairspray gets involved?

* You planned on their betrayal? What, you didnt? Youre way too trusting, man.

* How did Lelouch hear Schneizel? This mothers got microphones planted fucking *everywhere*.

* [C.C. pulling the same trick she did on Suzaku, but this time on Anya, and it appears very unintentional.](http://webm.land/media/thdM.webm) Guess well just have to wait and see that this person did

* Asahina (Yes, glasses-boy has a name) making quick work of Anyas temporary distraction, so it looks like C.C. succeeded, just in a different way than she thought she would.

* Schneizel drawing back, not because he actually cares about the people, but because he wants to protect Britannias reputation. Sneaky.

* Yes, your Highness. What the fuck? Not  my lord?

* Li: Im here to do two this: Chew bubblegum and kick ass. And thanks to my consumption, I can no longer chew bubblegum.

* I promised that Id come for her, and I will. *Sigh*

* How is Baldy McMustache not dead yet? Oh, well. At least Jeremiah is still around, being badass. Again, not hard when youre Alucard. (I did not mean for that to rhyme.)

* How is it strange that youre happy? Id say it makes perfect sense, considering whats happened.

* At first I was like, What the fuck, Lelouch? Theres no way Tohdoh or even Tamaki would be that low. And using Geass on them would totally make you irredeemable. Then, I realized it was just a set-up for a gag, and was happy again. Still an asshole move, Lelouch. Youre supposed to be better than the people youre fighting.

* Lelouch like, I aint arguing with the lady that have me my magic eye shit.

* What the fuck, Lelouch? Youd actually waste your Geass and betray so many of your allies just for one political marriage? I feel like Im watching Future Diary, with the MC acting so stupid for the middle act.

* Lelouch stopping to take personal phone calls whiles in the middle of his Zero operation, on the extremely slim chance it ends with sex. Good man.

* When you love someone, that has incredible power. Is Shirley Anne Hathaway in Interstellar? At least she made Lulu come to his senses.

* Poor Shirley. At least she still has Table-kun.

* Im starting to think the only reason they had Lelouch act so fucking retarded for a few minutes was just to remind people that Shirley has a crush on him.

* [This should have happened two episodes ago, had Lelouch not thought almost getting killed was a good strategy.](http://i.imgur.com/56NskV8.jpg)

* I love how Lelouch is normally so egoistical that him being really nice is actually a turn off for Shirley.

* If shes pretending to be Lelouch, does this still count as yuri? Cause Im saying it does.

* [Just keep telling yourself](http://i.imgur.com/EUqWRte.jpg) Shes technically hundreds of years old Shes technically hundreds of years old Shes technically hundreds of years old Oh, its making it worse!

* Not sure if Id call wanting to use Geass as a weapon a religious movement. Then again, the Silence is also technically a religious movement, so what do I know?

* I feel like I should have something to say about Lelouch using the entirety of China to find the Order, but eh.

* [Id pay to hear Johnny Yong Bosch have a conversation with himself for a few minutes.](http://webm.land/media/Qj3E.webm)

* Why is she still wearing her maid hat under the wig?

* Lol. Lelouch getting so tired of Rolos Yuno-ing.

* Rolos like, Filthy whores stealing my man!

* And now we have even *more* love triangles. I think at this point its more like a love dodecahedron.

* How lenient are these anime schools enrollment policies? Normally, you start at the beginning of a semester, not whenever you want. I dont care how high up you are in the noble chain; this is a place of learning, damn it!

* Rivalzs Guide to Talking Normal: Step 1  Be annoying comic relief. Step 2  Rinse and repeat.

* Old man. Is Gino secretly Jay Gatsby?

* Next episode preview: Blah, blah, blah, Lelouch is dramatic and serious. LOOK, BOOBIES!

> Just keep telling yourself  Shes technically hundreds of years old Shes technically hundreds of years old Shes technically hundreds of years old Oh, its making it worse!

Turn 12

* The Knights of the Round have become members of the student council. Why does this sound like the set-up for a whimsical, slice-of-life show about Lelouch having to constantly hide behind corners to avoid getting caught while whacky music plays? Oh, right. Because it is.

* Sayoko: I wasnt wrong in doing that was I?

* Lelouch: Only in that you were wearing my face at the time! And not filming!

* [Can Vilettas expression here be a new emote?](http://i.imgur.com/6OURKHa.jpg) Maybe "(#wuh)"?

* [Lulu, you suave son of a bitch.](http://webm.land/media/pNP6.webm) How is this guy a genius, rebel leader, have an awesome voice, AND get all the ladies?!

* [Cant talk right now, Shirley. Busy showing off the kittens to the fans.](http://i.imgur.com/Xvt1Ppz.jpg)

* [Whats with these trick-shots that only show like one or two distant pairs of breasts?](http://i.imgur.com/hfu9GoD.jpg) Im not some boob-hound, but this show has proven it has no problems showing off full-female nipples in close-up, so why even bother? Its like Future Diary in the first four episodes.

* Shirleys not into harem? Whats her problem?

* Well, that was a long prologue.

* Sayoko is such a playa. Doesnt even leave the man a moment to breath.

* Come on, Lulu. You go on all your other dates but stiff Shirl-Girl?

* Gino is so nice and sociable when hes not busy attempting to commit cold-blooded murder. #GinoBestYandere

* I fucking love it. If Britannia really wants to beat Lelouch, they just need to get a bunch of desperate, hot chicks to fawn over him. Go the Austin Powers route.

* [I wish I was one of those girls.](http://i.imgur.com/kxs3UHA.jpg)

* [This whole scene is dating in a nutshell.](http://webm.land/media/GQm3.webm)

* Gino: Milly, my dear

* Suzaku: Madam President!

* Gino: Jealous.

* I would just not go to school that day if that shit was mandatory. I almost never participated in School Spirit Week, and the one day I did I got sick.

* Milly Ashford went on to rule the dating world with an iron and bloody fist, where she eventually gained the infamous title Blonde Euphie.

* [That just looks all kinds of painful.](http://i.imgur.com/6s9wQFJ.jpg) Why not just do what badass chicks in anime do and get an eyepatch? Are you not pretty enough?  Yes, Rikka counts as badass. /u/BanjoTheBear, back me up on this.

* I see [somebody](http://i.imgur.com/bPBI2Ky.jpg) took fashion advice from C.C. when she was going through her [tiny hat phase.](http://i.imgur.com/3BURPg6.jpg)

* [Guinevere looks like Cornelia if she was addicted to crystal meth.](http://i.imgur.com/H4g7qZt.jpg)

* At least Odysseus is keeping his cool. Finally, a bro worthy of being called a bro.

* Of course Schneizel is taking charge. Hes already sort of established himself as secondary antagonist.

* Did I just hear Charles agree with someone that war isnt always the answer? What the fuck?

* [I feel a massive vibration from the east.](http://i.imgur.com/tjKbaRJ.jpg) As if, somewhere in Britain a person let out a massive fangasm all at once, and then was silenced by his own petard.

* So, Cornelia knows about Geass now. Just because. And she at least plans on clearing Euphies name rather than just flailing wildly with a butter knife.

* Aww. Lloyd remembers that hes engaged.

* Yes, Kallen, be sure to keep your head down and eyes shut on the off-chance the person who opened the door happened to be of some dramatic importance.

* Weird misunderstandings? Viletta, this is an anime. If people of significantly different ages *arent* banging something is wrong.

* Lol, Viletta just casually mentioning how Shirley almost killed her.

* [Arthur with those ear-hats is fucking adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/3uLnQPV.jpg)

* [I cant tell if that one guy in the back is upset he has to participate, or just jealous that all the girls are staring at Lelouch.](http://i.imgur.com/ChI0g9q.jpg)

* Rivalz, give it up. Nobody likes you. Nina has more fans that you.

* [I cant tell if Anya is nervous or bored.](http://i.imgur.com/H5Tsksu.jpg)

* Fuckin troll Milly. She knows shes the biggest threat Lelouch could ever face, and shes taking full advantage of it.

* [Now we finally see just how big of a radius Rolo can get his Geass.](http://webm.land/media/Psax.webm)

* What Lelouch is thinking: Whoa, thanks for saving me, Rolo.

* What Rolos thinking: Fuck, it wore off before I could exchange our hats!

* Mega-cool of Cornelia to actually give Bartley a chance to explain himself instead of just immediately running him through the back. I can see why shes /u/rascorpias best girl.

* [THIS is the kind of shit I want to see a spin-off show about!](http://webm.land/media/RiDK.webm) Lelouch just fucking around, using his Geass to give innocent and humorous commands, actually *enjoying* life.

* [This shot of these guys in these hats is almost too much to bear.](http://i.imgur.com/8gvUwLf.jpg)

* How is fare-thee-well mental? I say it all the time, and Im totally sane!... What?

* [THERE IT IS!](http://webm.land/media/B6s4.webm) Theres the arms-behind-your-back anime run weve all been waiting for!

* Lol. Lelouch just casually deciding hell let her take his place in P.E.

* [Sayoko just voiced what everyone whos been noticing Kallen the past few episodes has been thinking.](http://webm.land/media/vrzL.webm)

* [This short clip basically sums up the pacing of all of R2.](http://webm.land/media/Dj9z.webm) Also, for those Knightmares apparently having such good microphones, its still a shock Lelouch couldnt recognize Suzakus voice for so long.

* Anya getting the might of the entire districts military behind her.

* Anya dont give a fuck. Twin Lelouches? Well, I watched Another, so I guess stranger things have happened. Oh, Im not supposed to destroy private property with a giant fucking robot? Kay.

* Shirley is so fucking cute and understanding. It almost makes me regret being an L.C. shipper. Almost.

* Thank God that was the real Lelouch that time. If she had pinched Sayoko s cheeks while wearing the Lelouch mask

* Gino just assuming that commoner schools always have giant robots smashing through the grounds is just the best.

* Ninja Sayoko just dropping a one-liner than booking it.

* Whoo! Weathergirl Milly! You know she just fought to wear a white dress whenever they film on location in the rain.

* Hahah. Lloyd is so cool that Milly rejecting him just makes him like her more.

* Here it comes

* [And there it goes!](http://webm.land/media/80yF.webm)

* Well, /u/Durinthal, I guess youre finally getting your wish. Jeremiah has a Geass Canceller, and now Shirleys mind is unlocked, allowing her to face what Charles and Lelouch (though, mainly Lelouch) did to her. Interesting how V.V. and Jerimiah seem to be going against Charles wishes of keeping the Ashford student council brainwashed.

* Lol. Lelouch in the preview sounds more concerned about his date with Shirley than rescuing Kallen. A man of priorities, I see.

And thats the end of my first two-parter! Wow, that took a while, but I had fun!

And yay another out of nowhere superweapon/upgrade. Can we get a "3 days without incident" style counter for these?

So that's the Knight of One? looks pretty badass and more importantly it's good to know there is at least 1 knight of the round old enough to be legally allowed to drink.

Britannia army following the trope of appointing teenagers into important government positions i see...

http://gyazo.com/2f70b19950f42aa08fa50700fcef4188

really tho i don't have any qualms with 17 on Gino considering his family is pretty far up the Britannia aristocracy (also i like him a lot but no favouritism obviously), however Anya at 15 years doesn't make a lot of sense. Not that i really mind, this is an anime after all. Putting the fate of the world into the hands of kids is all the rage it seems.

> i don't have any qualms with 17 on Gino considering his family is pretty far up the Britannia aristocracy (also i like him a lot but no favouritism obviously)

Yeah, even with having only known him for a few days, it makes perfect sense to me that there's a whole swarm of girls after him.

> Putting the fate of the world into the hands of kids is all the rage it seems.

?? \*goes back and actually loads that image* Ahh. Yeah, that one is just anime logic.

Huh. With all the arranged marriages going around, I'm suddenly surprised that the Knights of the Round and the hoards of princes and princesses aren't all hitched already. I guess Charles likes military conquest far, *far* more than diplomacy.

The knights of the round are the best knightmare pilots in britannia, age has no real bearing on whether or not they are one. Anya definitely deserves to be there.

Yes ofc, but the question then is why are the best knightmare pilots in the world all teenagers?

Alright since the next episode changes the OP/ED I just wanna say that the OP is the best thing since Jibun Wo and the ED is horrible. No spoilers, but I think the only bad thing about the final episode of the series is that they kept the same ED, even though it doesn't fit at all. When the final episode thread goes up I might post an edit I did that replaced the ED with Jibun Wo at the end of the last episode, since imo it makes the ending that much better hearing that favourite again.

Ghibli month continues! This time I watched "From up on Poppy Hill" and "Ocean Waves" which I both gave a 8/10 and 7/10 respectively.

From up on Poppy Hill was a really charming film. The 'Latin quarter' stuff was great and gave the film quite a lot of personality. The animation felt quite stiff though, it made the movements of the characters lack fluidity which reminded me that I was watching an animation. It just took me out the experience that I kept noticing the characters bodies skipping entire frames. Still a really nice story if predictable.

Ocean waves took a much more adult look at things. I loved how the film portrayed the little interactions between the characters in realistic way. Nothing felt contrived or cheap when it happened. [Minor Spoilers](/s "I also liked how both on the trip to Tokyo segment and the graduation it didn't go for a fairy-tale romance plot line. The main character is disgruntled and he graduates with unresolved issues which is certainly different.") [Major Spoilers](/s "The thing dragging it down for me was mainly the ending. It felt odd how they portrayed Rikako's school life as really bleak but then transitioned to her adult life with no scars to show for it. It also would have been better if they had spared the time inbetween the trip and graduation to explore the divide growing between the main characters. As it stands, Taku just gets hit around a bit then it goes 'now they are adults'.") Since the film is so short I don't see why that wasn't a possibility.

One thing I am finding is that the Ghibli films I have seen so far all seem to have some degree of predictability to them. Oddly enough this doesn't bother me and I believe that speaks to how well executed these films are that I can be unbothered by it. 

I think Grave of the Fireflies has been the only film so far that has been hurt by this predictability (In my opinion) and the reason for this, as far as I can tell, is because it is the only one of those films that was more focused on the destination rather than the journey. For Arriety the hook was the well imagined world, with When Marine was there it is the personal & human growth, for Poppy Hill it is the loud and vibrant cast but for Grave of the Fireflies it is "the climax". When the film gets talked about that is what people discuss the most and if anything the journey is the part that gets criticized. Maybe watching more Ghibli films will prove me wrong but for now this is just some food for thought. 

**Oh..yes..Code Geass...**

I talked about that for a lot longer than I expected. Hopefully you guys don't mind. I usually bold the episode start so there is no reason why someone couldn't skip that wall of text if they wanted to. Now to switch my brain off and my patriotism on!

* Handing that handkerchief to Shirley makes sense now. Only a woman could understand another woman's needs in Code Geass.
* They have abandoned the empress?!? Thank you! Why they didn't do that before hurts my brain (yet again), plot convenience for the win!
* I love how China is basically parroting me from last thread this episode
* What pisses me off is that they could have done that without giving the angry Chinese man the most uber-powered mech yet
* Todoh is another character that needs to die soon
* Zero calling people out on morality
* Stripping peoples free will from them is all well and good but killing a political pawn? You monsters...
* R.I.P Lolicon Xing
* **OH FOR FUCKS SAKE**
* Time for more completely overpowered mech bullshit
* It's like every problem in this show is solved by throwing an unbeatable mech into the mix
* Fuck I hate lazy writing more than anything
* Just look at that bullshit. It happened last season as well but there is only so many times you can use the same gimmick before I want to punch the screen.
* Also China and Britannia have apparently never heard of jamming technology
* Godlike mechs? YEP. 21st century technology? NOPE. 
* Where is the Emperor anyway. He would win these fights without even lifting his hands.
* KILL KALLEN
* JUST DO IT AND DON'T LEAVE ANY POSSIBLE CHANCE OF HER COMING BACK
* WHY KEEP HER ALIVE
* I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE OF THIS "I'M THE ACE OF BLACK KNIGHTZ GUISE" BULLSHIT. IT IS JUST AS BAD AS THE 'LETS MAKE AN EVEN MORE POWERFUL MECH' STUFF. ASSPULL AFTER ASSPULL.
* This ending you talk about better be the best thing I have ever witnessed in my life or I will hold you all accountable for the suffering you have put me through.
* "Marry for love" Fuck off. This is war, bitch.
* What?!? Why is Diethard the only one talking logic here?
* [My face right now](http://i.imgur.com/g5JxzTa.png)
* Lelouch listen: If you want to split Xing and Loli princess up, just explain to everyone THAT SHE IS LIKE 5 YEARS OLD!?! YOU FUCKING CREEPS ACTUALLY THINK IT IS OKAY FOR THESE TWO TO HOOK UP?!? DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE AGE GAP HERE?!? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
* ["The power of the Heart"](http://i.imgur.com/Gk6R0XG.png) I bet the only reason Diethard hasn't already jumped ship is because he is smart enough to know the writers stopped caring about silly things such as 'well written' stories. I can imagine he is thinking he should stick with the side that takes the rulebook and shits all over it. 
* Dat kiss tho
* This episode is alright I suppose'
* Indirect Lelouch x Shirely ship (Yessssssssssssssssssss)
* Is there a single good Britannian mech pilot that isn't a student?
* That makes me think of Cornelia and now I am sad ;_;

**Episode 12**

* 108 dates? This lady is a player
* Nothing like a slice of life episode to lower the blood pressure
* I swear season 2 should have been like five episodes to wrap up the story and then 20 episodes of this. 
* Cupid day is at least a better idea than dedicating a festival to an evil cat
* Bismark, knight of one, the most powerful knight in the empire. Cool. Will be fun to see him die instantly to Kallen/Lelouch/Xing because reasons.
* WOAH
* WOOOOOOOOOOAH
* **CORNELLLLLLLLLLLLLLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
* PLAYER 1 HAS ENTERED THE GAME
* FUCK YEAH
* 10/10
* THIS SEASON IS THE BOMB
* Rolo be cheating and I love it
* Geass just to get a love heart back. Never could I have imagined that this day would come.
* Sayako taking on the rugby team solo. Nice to see that Britannia play *Rugby* not 'foot'ball so they aren't truly  yanks. 
* Who let the horses out? Neigh, Neigh, Neigh
* Only award winning comedy from /u/rascorpia
* Two Lelouches? Guess that means absolutely nothing and that we should definitely not think about it ever again
* Lelouch x Shirley ship is going into space

How could I have know so much would happen in just two episodes. We got Cornellia, RoboJere anti-geass, Shirley on the warpath and...lets just forget episode 11 even happened.
'Eleven' is a bad number...

> It's like you don't know how royal political marriages work or something.

I thought the whole point of that scene was to say they can marry for love, so it wouldn't be political nor would they gain anything from it. 

> You turn on a dime, you know that?

I meant more the part about introducing ever-newer, ever-better, ever-improved models (or add-ons) to trump the previous ones.  Admittedly, _NGE_ didn't do as much of that as this does, but then again that was a different beast.

> I thought the whole point of that scene was to say they can marry for love, so it wouldn't be political nor would they gain anything from it. 

It was, but they arrived there by starting at a standard "what can we accomplish politically" mentality, same as Brittania and the Eunuchs had been doing.  Then Shirley straightened him out and all was well.

To be honest I had way more problems with episode 10 than eleven.  If you listen to the dialogue in 10, in the dub at least, it is God awful.  So forced and exposotiony plus half the time it's them literally just narrating what they're either doing or about to do.  It's incredibly difficult to listen to.  I liked that 11 at least tried to swing for big things even if it didn't necessarily pull them off.

Also it becomes very apparent how everyone perceives the show and its characters on a micro scale since usually you don't focus on it as much.

**EPISODE 17**

Guilford, its a trap!

So *all* of Britannias armies are led by royal family members. Charles sure has enough kids to accomplish that.

Their base is a floating pyramid. I dont why? Why a pyramid? Why not some sort of battleship?

Damn. Suzaku hated Britannians.

Knight Bradley has a [pretty awesome weapon.](http://www.gfycat.com/DiscreteFineLacewing) Hes a freaking psychopath though.

I wonder what Schneizels original reaction was when he was told that his little sister Nunnally was still alive. Did he care at all or was he just glad he had someone he could manipulate to further his goals?

Tell Suzaku. Lelouch, just tell him Euphy was an accident. Please do this for me.

Oh god. The ring. [The band-aid ring.](http://i.imgur.com/sbGsJHk.jpg) This cant lead anywhere good or can it?

Yes, Suzaku asks and Lelouch is answering and hes lying. Hes just accepting that its all his fault even if it was an accident. Its admirable in a weird way, but stupid. Hes just pissing Suzaku off even more.

Fool! Makes sense the [Knight of One would have Excalibur.](http://www.gfycat.com/QuaintFrequentFlamingo) Pretty cool.

Lelouch is trying to save the world, but his intentions werent malicious, even if they seem so to others. This is why he needs to tell more people the truth.

Interesting proposition. Lelouch could stop the war. Japan could be a special administrative zone like Euphy and Nunnally proposed. Even Zero himself said that it doesnt matter the circumstances, they cant take away the fact that they are Japanese. Its in their hearts. He could start, and probably shouldve started, a better war against Geass to stop Charles.

Lelouch is pissed. I dont think Suzaku set him up, but Lelouch thinks people keep betraying him.

Yeah. Yeeeeaaaah. [Bradley is a maniac.](http://www.gfycat.com/FortunateVagueArcticduck) /u/SeanyMac23, you were right. I was far too kind calling him just a dick.

Schneizels a weasel. Smart move following Suzaku though.

Guilford. Whats he gonna do? Oh snap. Lelouch still plans ahead. Brilliant. He needs to set up more sleeper agents like this.

Ragnarok? This likely has something to do with all of the artifacts. [All of those Geass symbols were spread out all over the map.](http://i.imgur.com/WoiBNWF.jpg)

Good thing they reinforced the ground. Fool me twice. Doesnt matter. The Black Knights have the disturber train. Great strategy.

So Schneizel didnt really know much about Geass at all. Hes just been operating independent from Charles, sort of. I wonder what he plans to do now that he knows about Geass.

**EPISODE 18**

OMG Nina. Get down. Calm down. Suzaku showing some wisdom. Not firing that weapon is the tougher choice.

[Storm of loyalty!](http://www.gfycat.com/ReliableTepidCormorant)

This was a good Geass order to get Guilford.

Rolo, ugh. I dont know if I trust him here Aaaaaaand there it fucking is. Ill kill her with my own hangs. You little shit. Im not really sure why Lelouch entrusted Rolo to go on this mission. Shouldve put Sayoko on that job.

Everyones whipping out crazy weapons. And Anya just [slaughtered a whole bunch of people](http://www.gfycat.com/RepulsiveSnivelingDegu) when she attacked Zero. It *was* kind of an accident though.

Alright, good work on your mission, Sayoko. Lets see what the new Guren can do. Go save Zero, Kallen.

Tamaki. I still like him, but recently hes just been a useless lump. I mean, really? Really? You and Zero are best buds? Stop kidding around.

Some strange Anya rainbow attack again. Whats going on with her? She didnt touch CC or anyone. This one was random.

Holy hell, the Guren is OP. Super fast. Like a pink Sonic the Hedgehog bouncing from enemy to enemy. [In all its glory.](http://www.gfycat.com/GaseousHeartyAmericanwarmblood)

So how did Charles manage to escape? And Schneizel mundane? A huge war is mundane?

The scientists are great. They just care about their work.

Hell yes! [Way to go, Kallen.](http://www.gfycat.com/PhysicalLittleBengaltiger) Knight Bradley was a lunatic.

No not now. Trust Zero a little longer. Well, at least they can try and stop Rolo.

Suzaku dont. You know better than to Whaaaaat? He was obeying the live order but he still shoots the nuke?!?!?!

Fuck.

Me.



Denial mode, activated.

**POST EPISODE(S) THOUGHTS**

This cant be. I dont believe it. Nunnally isnt dead. For fucks sake. Marianne is supposed to be dead, and yet we know CC was talking with her. So even if she is technically dead, theres still a way to communicate with her, maybe even bring her back. Theres hope for Nunnally. And Sayoko too. Lelouch good lord. Lelouch is broken. At this point in time, from his point of view, the suffering hes been through in his short life is absolutely horrible. Hes done some questionable things, but you have to feel for him, even if its just a little.

Where the hell did Rolo go? He was the one who was supposed to retrieve Nunnally, and yet he didnt get caught in the nuke blast. Sayoko was with Nunnally, and that wasnt even her mission. So what is up with Rolo?

What the hell is Charles doing with his days that this huge battle is mundane? He has something huge planned. Kill god my ass. What else is going on? What happens after you kill god? Something crazy is about to happen. [future thoughts](/s "Charles will use all of the artifacts to channel immeasurable power into his body. This is how he will be able to kill god, and then ultimately take his place.")

Anya got another dose of rainbow. When this first happened CC said so thats what you did or something like that, right? Is it possible Marianne is connected to Anya or something? I still think CC has her powers, theyre just dormant for now. Im surprised they didnt cut to a shot of her freaking out when Anya was having the rainbow attack to show their connection.

Suzaku. Unforgivable. Did he shoot off the nuke because it was the only way to distract Kallen so he could make his escape? If thats the case, Im sure Lelouch haters will throw the blame at him for giving Suzaku the order in the first place, which in my opinion would be unfair. I now wonder what Suzakus reaction to his actions is going to be.

No thoughts on the future today. For any other first time watchers: have any of you been able to come up with some reasonable speculation as to what Charles is talking about with all the lying stuff? Ive been stuck trying to work that into a prediction, but its probably going to be an important reason as to why hes doing what hes doing. I cant tell if hes grouping all of mankind into it, saying were all liars in general or if he came to that philosophy because something happened in his personal life.
>> ARTICLE
> Suzaku. Unforgivable. Did he shoot off the nuke because it was the only way to distract Kallen so he could make his escape?

It was the only way for him to live, which he has to do from Lelouch's Geass.

Yeah, Suzaku cannot be held 100% accountable for what went down there.

Still dumb as fuck of him to go into battle with it strapped to him when he fully knows that his geass command could force him to use it as a last resort, though.

Not just going into a battle where he could be forced to use it, but a battle in his faction's own city. If it's reasonable to nuke your city instead of having it fall to the enemy, just leave.

> I wonder what Schneizels original reaction was when he was told that his little sister Nunnally was still alive. Did he care at all or was he just glad he had someone he could manipulate to further his goals?

I'm guessing the latter, particularly if he knew that Lelouch was also still alive and was Zero.

> So Schneizel didnt really know much about Geass at all. Hes just been operating independent from Charles, sort of. I wonder what he plans to do now that he knows about Geass.

I wouldn't be surprised if he *knew* but just didn't really care, instead concerning himself with the more practical matter of taking over the world.

> Storm of loyalty!

Jeremiah's loyalty is impressive if a little disturbing.

> Im not really sure why Lelouch entrusted Rolo to go on this mission.

ESPECIALLY AFTER HE KILLED SHIRLEY. Why does Lelouch have a giant blind spot for Rolo?

> What the hell is Charles doing with his days that this huge battle is mundane? He has something huge planned. Kill god my ass. What else is going on? What happens after you kill god?

Ragnarok in Norse mythology (and Britannia loves its mythology) involves gods dying, so I foresee impending doom. [future thoughts](/s "What's more impressive than killing a god? Becoming one.")

> Anya got another dose of rainbow. When this first happened CC said so thats what you did or something like that, right? Is it possible Marianne is connected to Anya or something?

...yeah, I still don't know. I remember someone casually suggested that Anya was a clone of Marianne a few episodes ago and now I'm thinking they might be onto something.

> For any other first time watchers: have any of you been able to come up with some reasonable speculation as to what Charles is talking about with all the lying stuff?

Spitballing here, though I think I mentioned part of it earlier. You know how CC was evasive about her contract with Lelouch and the nun also lied to her, leading her to be cursed with immortality? I think the same thing happened with VV and whoever gave him Geass. VV finds himself immortal, that sucks, the brothers make a pact to smash the world of lies that got VV into it. They find it goes all the way back to some deific character that first handed out the power and plan to kill *them* to end Geass and the immortal Code.

What I don't get: there are *at least* two Code bearers (maybe many more, given that shot of the large group of people bearing the mark that we keep seeing) and I'm not sure how CC figures into Charles's plan. Maybe if Charles was the sole bearer he could activate all of the artifacts without others interfering or something.

As Schneizel said, Charles doesn't really seem to be concerned about the world all that much, so he's very obviously targeted at a higher power than man already.
>> ARTICLE
> ESPECIALLY AFTER HE KILLED SHIRLEY. Why does Lelouch have a giant blind spot for Rolo?

I think Lelouch may have the misconception that if he's extremely explicit in his orders, nothing will go wrong. He's used to it working with his geass, so perhaps he thought if he was utterly explicit about Nunnally needing to stay alive, Rolo would know he had to make it happen. He was even careful enough to just say "Nunnally" instead of "the viceroy," so that his command wouldn't become obsolete by Nunnally resigning.

It's just too bad for him that he wasn't actually using his geass on Rolo.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for answering my lies question.

> They find it goes all the way back to some deific character that first handed out the power and plan to kill them to end Geass and the immortal Code.

I think we discussed this once. How Charles wouldn't end up being the big bad, and he's been collecting power to try and kill the real final boss. I don't think you liked that idea, and yet we've found you with speculation that sort of supports it. Not that you'd think Charles is actually a good guy or would team up with Lelouch or anything. At this point, and pretty much every other point, it's clear he's on the evil side of things.

This scenario would also add another parallel between Charles and Lelouch. Doing morally questionable things just to make their sibling's life better which would sort of be the ultimate thing the two have in common.

I think I'll come back and look over these comments a little tomorrow to help with some theories. I've just finished watching the next two episodes so I can't really write anything else for now.


>> ARTICLE
That's right! My stance hasn't really changed on that though, for a couple of reasons:

1. As you said, there's no way I think Lelouch and Charles will be on the same side of things regardless of what happens.
2. This deity that Charles is attempting to slay isn't necessarily a greater evil, or even something that could be considered a threat to the rest of the world. He's trying to upset a force of nature, and that's something that no other character cares about. He's still the big bad even if he's tackling a higher power.

That's a good parallel to draw though, both are trying to look out for their sibling.

That said, we have the *other* side of Britannia to look at with Schneizel, who's definitely maneuvering on his own. Like I've said a few times, Charles is unconcerned with earthly affairs, leaving Schneizel as his effective [Dragon](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon), but one that likely has plans to overthrow the Emperor as well and might become the big bad on his own.

It's like both Kallen and Suzaku have told him at separate times this season: sometimes the truth isn't good enough.  Sometimes the world needs a lie instead of knowing the ugly truth.

> you were right. I was far too kind calling him just a dick.

Damn straight.

> recently hes just been a useless lump

Recently?

> And Schneizel mundane? A huge war is mundane?

He's saying that Charles finds it mundane.  Schneizel doesn't.

> So what is up with Rolo?

Rolo is a male Yuno Gasai, that pretty much sums him up.

> Did he shoot off the nuke because it was the only way to distract Kallen so he could make his escape?

He shot it off because it was his only way to live.  Without the order he would've let Kallen kill him, though it stands to reason if the Guren blew up the Lancelot it would've set off the FLEIJA anyway.
>> ARTICLE
> Sometimes the world needs a lie instead of knowing the ugly truth.

Meanwhile Charles hates lies and has pretty much been lying to everyone in the world. Unless he doesn't believe omission of truth is a form of lying. Wonder what the real secret behind all this Geass and god stuff is.

Anyway, I still think Lelouch could have been sincere in saying the Euphy situation was an accident while taking full blame. Something like, "It was all a mistake, but that doesn't matter. It was me. I still did it. It was all my fault."

> Recently?

Eh, in R1 Tamaki seemed alright. Kind of still useless. Recently all he does is complain he has nothing to do and is best buds with Zero. So more of a useless lump than normal.

> He's saying that Charles finds it mundane. Schneizel doesn't.

Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. I should've worded that better. I knew he was talking about Charles.

> He shot it off because it was his only way to live. Without the order he would've let Kallen kill him, though it stands to reason if the Guren blew up the Lancelot it would've set off the FLEIJA anyway.

Yeah. Got that now. Still, Suzaku managed to slip away long enough to be able to fire the FLEIJA. He could have shot it straight up into the air. It still would've been the distraction he needed. Maybe then it wouldn't have annihilated most of the city. I guess with the Geass order active he didn't have much control over what he did, causing him to just shoot it at Kallen and hope it hit her.

The live geass forces him to find a path to stay alive, not necessarily randomly choosing an outcome. His mind was the one that provided that solution. As you noted, he could have fired it in a different direction. More reasonably, he could have done what he notes earlier in using it at a deterrent, informing Kallen of what he was aiming at her. He had the time.

Been really enjoying reading everyone's thoughts throughout the series, I finished it about a month before the re-watch was announced.

Just something I noticed while in my Japanese lit class. Early in R1 Nunnally made the quote about folding 1000 paper cranes to make a wish come true. Lelouch made the Black Knights to fulfill her wish. The symbol of the [Black Knights](http://iwatcher.net/shot/014f36c412b27c81eb8af27508e3040e-640x960.png) looks awfully similar to an origami crane.

It's amazing that the table-lover Nina was able to make warhead FLEIJA that's 40% the power of Tsar Bomba, the most powerful hydrogen bomb in our reality. The explosion is a lot more fearsome than previously feared. 

Kallen kicking ass with her newly superpowered Guren was quite a sight to see. Unfortunately, her being so powerful is what led to the desperate situation at the end of the episode with the FLEIJA being put into play.

Also, it is sad to see Suzaku pretty much railroaded into a direct confrontation with Lelouch multiple times thsee  episodes. You could tell he was about to ease off on Lelouch after stomping his head a bit and he might have listened to a lot more had he not been interrupted by the British military trailing him and apprehending Lelouch. This is pretty much the tragic downward spiral and it was so close for the friends to possibly start a healing process too.

I've spent the past hour literally doing nothing but refreshing the New page. Now that I know it was a family emergency I feel like a dick.

Turn 17

* Im writing these *during* school, because I want to watch Kill la Kill when I get home, but I know Im not gonna be close to being done by then. Fuck.

* Lelouch is still the narrator. And he never actually refers to himself as Lelouch. Just Zero. Interesting.

* One, Guilford youre dumb for actually coming alone. Two, because youre Cornelias most loyal subject. Of course he can trust you to not blow it.

* But we dont have time for that right now. OP!

* I taste humiliation all the time. In fact, I eat so much that its gotten pretty hard to scrub the taste out of my mouth.

* Fighting, fighting, fighting. Boring.

* Fourth fucking time you guys have done the finish each others sentences thing.

* How do you like *that*, you stupid Brit?! Do I hear /u/rascorpia rescinding some of his love for Suzaku?

* [BRADLEY KILL!](http://i.imgur.com/EizRmfI.jpg)

* Six-way charge attack? That sounds awfully similar to a [TEAM DEATH MATCH!](https://youtu.be/3KsATmF77BY?t=1m6s)

* Still so close yet so far from my lord.

* This attack is far too weak for one of Zeros trademark strategies. Oh, so you finally figured out that shit always gonna work out in his favor in the end?

* [Well, that was a random cutaway.](http://webm.land/media/CWXv.webm)

* Im sure several people are screaming in joy at Suzaku forcing Lelouch to confront all his mistakes.

* Tohdoh seems to know Lelouch is falling apart as a leader, but still acknowledges that they need Zeros charisma to lead the masses.

* [I love amnesiac C.C.s theme music.](http://webm.land/media/MK2h.webm)

* Some of you may be wondering why Lelouch isnt attempting to defend himself or explain the Euphies order was an accident. One, obviously, he knows Suzaku would never believe him. Two, hes taking full responsibly. He acknowledges that he *did* plan on Geassing her, even if it wasnt that order, and that if he had just left well enough alone and stayed away he could have saved countless lives. He even takes full responsibility for Shirleys death, just as /u/Durinthal says. Rolo may have pulled the trigger, but Lelouch might as well have loaded the gun.

* He even fucking lied about them just being pawns just to let Suzaku hear what he wants to hear. Ffffffffffffuuuuuuuuu

* He would even play Santa Claus for me. Lelouch confirmed as [Miria Harvent.](http://i.imgur.com/N4oMtj2.jpg)

* After finally having started watching the Kill la Kill dub, I can no longer hear Lis voice without imagining him as a bloodthirsty sailor suit/bikini.

* [More catharsis for certain folks.](http://webm.land/media/wgaF.webm) (I wonder if /u/Durinthal would hate Lelouch as much as he does had he not wiped Shirleys memories, and it resulting in her getting axed off early.)

* The more Lelouch explains who Zero really is, the more of a Batman rip-off he becomes.

* I wonder if Suzaku would accept letting Jeremiah De-Geass him now that he has the choice. He seems like hes at the point where he would rather keep his curse out of spite than let Lelouch relieve him of it.

* Lelouch is taking all the selfish parts of all his good deeds and just making them the only parts, because he knows thats all Suzaku wants to hear. At this point, hes willing to make Suzaku hate him as much as possible as long as it satisfies him enough to protect Nunnally.

* FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. The *one* time after so long that Suzaku finally tries to work together with Lelouch, for the greater good, Schneizel just has to come in and fucking fuck shit up like a fucking fuck! FUCK!

* Britannian-Eleven Half-Breed just sounds so fucked.

* Gino, stop wasting your breath. Theres no damn way Sawa-chan is gonna just come over to your side like that.

* Holy fuck, Schneizel is such a magnificent bastard. Even after having gone against Lelouch at every turn, he still tries to smooth-talk him into thinking he cares.

* So, Lelouch turned Guilford into /u/rascorpia. And he actually had the sense to do it in a way so that he doesnt lose his free will indefinitely. Clever.

* How awkward would it be to constantly be referred to as Princess?

* The entirety of the next few minutes (and next one for that matter) is so hard for me to watch. Seeing everything just turn against Lelouch all at once after all he worked for just hurts me to my soul. Though, I guess Im in a minority on that, at least in these threads.

* Ragnarok? Is Thor showing up later?

* Oh, right, Lelouch still has that thing on the train cars. Forgot due to the whole Shirley getting butchered thing happening immediately after.

* Now, I shall prove my loyalty, for Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally! I wonder if Jeremiahs blue hair shows that hes related to someone.

* [Oh, this poor guy.](http://i.imgur.com/CTdBifm.jpg) Hes trying so hard to rationalize to himself that being cold and calculating is how he has to think, and so obviously failing at it.

* [Suzaku looks like he has a mustache in this shot.](http://i.imgur.com/rqxMRuc.jpg)

* Holy shit, Lelouch sounds so desperate in the preview. This really is the hardest its ever been for me to get through these episodes. Like, even more than Euphie and Shirleys deaths.

Turn 18

* Narrator Lelouch still refusing to refer to himself by his own name.

* Damn, Gino is so sleazy when hes not playing high-schooler.

* Yes, please. Let Nina fly it. Shell crash it in like ten seconds, and we can be rid of this stupid character.

* I dont blame Lelouch for not believing Suzaku. Schneizel saw to it that Lelouch would never trust Suzaku again.

* Fuck, Jeremiah is awesome. And dat ~~voice~~ loyalty.

* Very interesting how the Geass command on Guilford doesnt just force him into blind obedience. Hes still himself; hes just as loyal to Cornelia as Jeremiah is to Marianne.

* Yeah, Nina, you keep screaming that for now, you hypocritical bitch.

* Cant you look a bit happier when someone saves your life? Even when hes being ruthless, Gino can still slip in a quick quip.

* Jeremiah: Hey, Suzaku. Orange you glad I didnt say loyalty?

* Lelouch, why the fuck did you send Rolo to get Nunnally? Hes already killed Shirley in cold blood, and you somehow think that he wont just turn around and flay the next person who gets between him and you? Yeesh, man. I know it would mean losing a good fighter, but send Jeremiah or Guilford to do that shit.

* Heh. Asahina already calling their little love-fest.

* Watching Guilford fight these guys who are fighting in Cornelias honor is just like irony to the nth degree.

* [Are these guys just hanging around a few hundred meters away just waiting for a dramatic moment to hop into the fight?](http://webm.land/media/YWx8.webm)

* Lelouch is even losing the trust of his own commanders. Fuck, I hate watching these episodes. *THIS* is why you start off just telling the truth, man!

* Cornelia is apparently bored of being a living pin-up girl and deciding to actually get out of there.

* Shut up, Nina.

* Lloyd is actually showing concern for another human being. This shit is serious. Or maybe hes just afraid the  F.L.E.I.J.A. will go off if he goes down.

Yes. Yes. Yes. More people need to know the truth. I wonder what information they have on Lelouch. I'm guessing that it's just the fact that he's a Britannian prince. What else could they realistically dig up that would cause them to lose faith. Hopefully if they confront Lelouch about that he'll have to tell the truth.
>> ARTICLE
> I wonder what information they have on Lelouch.

They have Kinoshida's testimony about the wholesale slaughter of the people at the Geass place, which included children.  While they don't know what the Geass place was they know it was not Brittanian and possessed no strategic value to justify killing all those non-combatants.  Part of Zero's selling point is that he's not your average terrorist who will bring civilians into the conflict yet he seemingly did so there.

But didn't most of the Black Knights know about that? A lot of them participated in it. It's definitely something that would shake their confidence in their leader, but it seemed like there's something else that will put the final nail in the coffin.

The Black Knights knew he went on a mission that he swore all participants on to secrecy, which isn't how he typically operates.  Plus right afterwards Jeremiah and Rolo showed up out of nowhere which raised some red flags given that they're Brittanian.  All of this is compounded by some of the lingering doubts that they had after his disappearance at the Black Rebellion.

Becoming a symbol that people can look up or hate to isn't an idea that's exclusive to batman.  Pretty much any masked hero embodies that idea.

He never said too heavy he said it was too hard to fly that no one was capable of piloting it.  Just like the lancelot pre-Suzaku.  Or the Siegfried for anyone besides VV or Jeremiah.  It's just the show's excuse for having certain mechs only piloted by the same person.

Jeremiah's ratting out the Black Knights! I was wondering if that was the case earlier when he contacted Guilford.

Waldstein's the Knight of One, I wasn't sure if that was his name last episode. Don't think that's a name related to anyone else we've seen before. Are there any Black Knight forces in the rest of the UFN? I see this ending very poorly for them if not, regardless of what happens in Japan. I don't expect Lelouch to really care for them though.

Suzaku is rightfully distrustful of anything Lelouch says after everything that's gone on.

Huh, I guess Diethard had Sayoko capture Villetta after the fight at the falls? And he's using her as leverage against gi.

[Ring symbolism.](http://i.imgur.com/RvQS34n.png) I don't like the implications.

Good that Lelouch doesn't even try to claim that Euphie was an accident or that someone else is responsible Shirley's death.

Excalibur? I'm not up on my Arthurian legend, did Galahad wield it for a time?

[**YES SUZAKU!**](http://i.imgur.com/06pzRp9.png) I've been wanting a scene like that for a long time, forcing Lelouch to look back at all the horrors he's behind. ...Lelouch didn't accidentally give Suzaku immortality, did he? Parallels with CC there either way. Both of them wanted to die, Lelouch wouldn't let them. A beautiful scene with more things coming out into the open here. Again with the lying motif carrying over from Charles as well.

And just when it seemed like they could have accomplished something together for good, once and for all, out comes Britannia to capture Lelouch.

[Kallen with a sandwich in her mouth!](http://i.imgur.com/35pDc6v.png) That's funny because [this](http://i.imgur.com/FGSEK13.png) is the first screencap I have from the series and I keep seeing it whenever I go to upload new ones. Gino's just trying to casually convince her to switch sides, I kinda like him.

And Schneizel! Oooh, he has plans aside from whatever Charles wanted. Shit, the Orange thing was a trap all along? And Lelouch got Guilford *good* with that Geass, making him think he's Cornelia.

Either Schneizel doesn't know about Lelouch's Geass specifically or he's only testing Suzaku there. If it's the former, it means Charles doesn't trust him either. I didn't expect Suzaku to deflect the question, he doesn't trust *anybody* right now.

["Ragnarok backup"](http://i.imgur.com/2FOdjNd.png) sounds bad. I would like to say those map locations represent Twilight Gates but there isn't one in China. Either way, Charles is advancing his plans as well.

The Gefjun Disturber comes back into play and Tokyo is defenseless, good chance for them to rescue Nunnally but Schneizel and Suzaku aren't that far. [Poor Cornelia just hanging here.](http://i.imgur.com/mbRbYgh.png)

---
The F.L.E.I.J.A. comes up explicitly in the opening. I don't expect it to be used this episode, but it's definitely a Chekhov's Nuke at this point.

Ah, so any advanced Knightmares are still operational, makes sense. And Gino *is* there already.

No, do not let the mentally disturbed woman pilot the weapon of mass destruction. Jeremiah is almost hilariously insanely devoted to Lelouch now. I feel really bad for Guilford in all of this though. He just thinks he's following his princess.

Rolo's out to find Nunnally? This *will not* go well. ~~Lelouch is going to demand her captured unharmed~~ I wrote that just before Rolo said he'll kill her. That simplifies things quite a bit. Oh no, Sayoko's with him? That's probably just going to get *her* killed.

Anya enters the battle! We still don't know what her deal is either. Huh, she gets that weird mind-warp thing again. Does that mean Lelouch has the Code now?

About time for Kallen to get out of that prison. And she gets a powered-up mech as a consolation gift.

Yep, Schneizel has something against his father, presumably because he was always obsessed with Geass and the Thought Elevator and such.

Ah, here comes the splintering of the Black Knights right in the middle of the battle. That's convenient.

[Paused right there.](http://i.imgur.com/ntPhRhH.png) Suzaku's Geass is going to kick in and force him to use the WMD so he won't die to Kallen. ...and that's exactly what happens in the next few seconds.

There goes everything Lelouch had been fighting for. And somehow Rolo is still alive despite that.

I like that the preview has no voiceover, it's effective.

[Wild speculation turn 14](/s "With no goal in sight, Lelouch quietly surrenders to Schneizel. The Second Prince attempts to turn the Black Knights against Charles directly via Zero, but Td and Diethard realize what's happening and retreat to regroup. An ostracized Lelouch leaves on a soul-searching journey, looking for a way to bring Nunnally back. CC is mildly depressed by that until Kallen comforts her and they start dating.")

---
**Next day thoughts**

The show being what it is, I'm skeptical that Nunnally is truly dead. Part of me wants it to be true just so I can see Lelouch fall even further. Aside from that it doesn't seem like the Black Knights had the upper hand even with Kallen's return, so I'm not sure they'll win that battle.

Suzaku is going to be a broken man now, but he still has one person to blame for all of this and I can see him crossing lines he hasn't before in an attempt to kill Lelouch.

A couple of things in these episodes are hinting at my [worst case scenario](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34z86r/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqzi9w4?context=1), but maybe I'm just reading into them too much.

This was truly a tragic episode for Suzaku. If he had some more moments to talk to Lelouch, he might even have started to forgive him or at least understand Lelouch's situation was even more complex than Suzaku suspected. I am so angry at he was forced into a confrontation with Lelouch this way, and the situation did make it seem like Suzaku betrayed Lelouch. Definitely not something the pair needed and it implanted some sense of distrust in Lelouch as well. That really was low of Schneizel. 

Loved seeing more of the Black Knights pilots in action in these episodes. [Nagisa Chiba looks amazing in the pilot suit.](http://randomc.maximum7.net/image/CODE%20GEASS/CODE%20GEASS%20R2%20-%2017%20-%20Large%2008.jpg)

Yeah, I definitely loved seeing Sayoko, the Ninja Maid in action. She is just so capable, almost too capable even. I feel that as Nunnally's maid, she will play an important role as Lelouch's informer too. Speaking of Sayoko, Sayoko's Diary is a really fun disc extra series that shows her side of the story from her limited perspective of the overall plot. 

>> ARTICLE
Agreed. If Schneizel hadn't arranged for Lelouch's capture this would have gone wildly one way, and if Guilford hadn't been there to set him free it would have gone wildly another.
>> ARTICLE
> And Schneizel! Oooh, he has plans aside from whatever Charles wanted.

This is something that really stuck with me. Schneizel has seemed like a bad guy all along, but now that he has information about Geass I'm curious as to what he's going to do. He may fight Charles. I doubt he'll straight up help Lelouch, but they'll both be fighting towards the same goal: destroy Charles. At the end of it, Schneizel will try to take power for himself.

> I feel really bad for Guilford in all of this though. He just thinks he's following his princess.

As did I. He's always been a respectable man. That final scene where he pushes Lelouch out of the blast radius was quite sad.

> Anya enters the battle! We still don't know what her deal is either. Huh, she gets that weird mind-warp thing again. Does that mean Lelouch has the Code now?

You think he could? I guess it's possible if he doesn't choose where the symbol appears on his body. It could pop up on his back or something.

> Suzaku is going to be a broken man now, but he still has one person to blame for all of this and I can see him crossing lines he hasn't before in an attempt to kill Lelouch.

So is Lelouch, but he's just going to lose all hope. Everything he was fighting for is lost. If Suzaku confronts Lelouch, I wonder if Lulu will tell him there's a way to undo the order or if he'll let Suzaku live out the rest of days with that curse.

He's unrelated to everyone.  AFAIK there are none, which is part of Brittania's plan.  Hold out in Japan and the rest of the UFN collapses.

**Episode 17: The Taste of Humiliation**

- Guilford meeting Jeremiah re: Cornelia? Maybe he hasn't turned fully after all, or maybe his loyalty extends to ALL members of the royal family.   
- I'm gonna be honest, I think I might like this OP more than the first one. I know that's heresy.     
- Bismarck seems to be out-strategizing the Black Knights here, if they're leaving everything else unattended.      
- Holy shit, the Galahad has a huge fucking sword and I love it.       
- Suzaku really DOESN'T have any reason to trust a single one of Lelouch's promises. I think the idea that he's becoming like Lelouch is the most frustrating thing for him.     
- Interesting that Tohdoh doesn't say what will happen after Japan is saved. Meanwhile, Deithard is blackmailing Ohgi.     
- Of course Nunnally didn't have anything to do with it. But taking all the blame is still *lying*. Lelouch keeps trying to change the world with dishonesty, and I don't think that's stable.     
- Bismarck Waldstein, summoned to battle as the Saber Class.      
- "I want to see you save the world with all your malice" sort of sums up the problem with Lelouch's motivations and actions.     
- And Suzaku delivers the one challenge to Lelouch that could actually fix it: Change the word for the better like you said you would.     
- I can't tell if Suzaku actually meant to do that or not.       
- And Gino tries to win Kallen over to his side with charm.     
- So Schneizel was the one who ordered it, not Suzaku. Schneizel is moving into checkmate. But I wouldn't trust him, either.      
- That's a very interesting Geass order. A useful one, too.       
- Oh shit, Suzaku recorded Lelouch's confession about Euphy. That's *huge.*       
- Schneizel asking the hard-hitting questions to Suzaku. With all of his conflicting identities, where DOES his loyalty really lie?      
- And there go the Gefjun Disturber trains.        
- Why is the Shinkiro not turning off, though?      
- And despite claiming to be asking Suzaku for help, Lelouch had a massive elaborate plan in place to capture Nunnally. Okay then.      
- Schneizel now understands all of Lelouch's capabilities, but Lelouch doesn't know about FLEIJA. And Suzaku might have to use it.      


**Episode 18: Final Battle Tokyo II**

- Oh, that's why the Vincent and Shinkiro weren't effected, more recent Knightmares are immune. Huh.     
- Nina piloting the Lancelot would be a terrible idea. Glad Suzaku showed up in time. There's no way the bomb doesn't get used, though; narratively it wouldn't make sense. But I don't see him firing it? That's totally out of character for him.     
- Suzaku makes a valiant attempt at pursuing peace through superior firepower. Lelouch doesn't believe him. Oh, the irony.      
- Aw, Guilford. This is such a shitty situation to put you in :(     
- Two Knights against Zero's army! Meanwhile, Rolo and Lelouch plot to backstab the other.       
- I feel bad for Kallen. All alone, unable to join the fight. Of course, there IS that souped-up Guren in the hangar that supposedly nobody can pilot. But surely nobody would ever steal an advanced mecha in a Sunrise series, right?       
- "All we have to send Zero is Tamaki? That's WORSE than sending nobody!"      
- Kallen is annoyed that her precious robot has been tampered with.      
- Were there people on those trains....?       
- And Anya has another episode, letting Lelouch get away. But there's a fourth Knight on the battlefield. Luckily, he prefers to give speeches before he kills people.   
- S.E.I.T.E.N: Superlative - Extruder - Interlocked - Technology - Exclusive - Nexus? My god, we're reaching Gundam SEED levels of acronym silliness here.      
- Sorry, with those energy wings I should have said SEED Destiny.       
- And Schneizel seems to be pretty dismissive of his father all of a sudden. But if Chuck isn't going to the battlefield, then what's he doing?       
- I kind of love that both Cecile/Lloyd and Rakshata are both so offended by this for different reasons. Either way, Kallen has the new biggest stick on the playground.       
- Maybe shouldn't have threatened to rape her, Bradley. Also, "send a postcard" is a tremendously hilarious one-liner to me for reasons I can't describe.     
- Ohgi shouldn't you have learned Villetta's ACTUAL name by now? Also, why did Cornelia wait so long before freeing herself?      
- Suzaku understands the rules of nuclear warfare better than Nina does, and she built the damn thing.        
- Welp, I was wondering how the show would make him do something Suzaku clearly had no intention of doing. That was really a shitty Geass idea, Lelouch.       
- That's a bit of a game-changer, then.      
- Awwww, Guilford no. Fuck you, Lelouch. Guilford was such a stand-up guy. :(       
- I shouldn't be glad at Lelouch's misery because Nunnally was sweet and didn't deserve that, but he gave Suzaku a command that he hated, and it... feels a little good having him face the consequences from it.     
- Oh jesus that's a big crater. Was it all civilian buildings?      
- Come to think of it, the visual representation of the Tokyo Settlement doesn't make much sense. It always looks like a big solid slab, but everything we've seen of it has buildings and streets and parks and stuff. I have no idea just how much has actually been destroyed here.      
- But that's still a big fucking crater. OOPS.       

I've been talking on and off with a friend of mine who's a big fan of the series as I watch R2 for the first time. Earlier on in the season, I confessed to her that I didn't understand the hate for Suzaku, since he seemed to me to clearly be someone who was trying to do the morally right thing more than the other main characters. She said it was because the rewatchers know a specific thing he does later in the season. 

I'd thought it was the whole Refrain thing on the other day's rewatch, but she said that wasn't the Thing he did that she was thinking of.

I just messaged her: "I think Suzaku did the Thing."      

(But realistically, he wouldn't have done it if not for Geass, right? How much responsibility does he legitimately bear for it? Compared to say, Nina who invented it or Schneizel who prompted her to do so?)
>> ARTICLE
> But realistically, he wouldn't have done it if not for Geass, right? How much responsibility does he legitimately bear for it?

Suzaku's Geass compels him to choose a path of action that will keep him alive. It *doesn't* compel him to act randomly. It's true that if he wasn't under the effects of Geass, he would've let Kallen kill him, but all the Geass does is remove that option. He could've fired the bomb off into the sky or out over the water as a distraction, or tried to explain what it was to Kallen to make her back down. He was forced to live, but destroying Tokyo was the way he *chose* to do that.

I'm freely admitting my bias here, but I'm not putting a lot of the blame on Suzaku for this. I don't think Schneizel and Nina were aware of the Geass he's under, so while they *prepped* him for using it I don't think they expected him to use it in a civilian area unless directly ordered. I don't think even Schneizel could order that either; didn't he say he couldn't discipline Suzaku earlier or something like that?

This may be my favorite thing that I've read in any of these rewatch threads.  The music is just about on par with Jibun Woo, but the visuals (which some people seem to not factor into an OP) are such a huge upgrade over the first OP.  They really move to the beat of the song and are much more kinetic.

> But taking all the blame is still lying.

I honestly don't think Suzaku or anyone (except maybe CC) for that matter would have accepted the truth.  Think about how it would sound to you if someone forced the love of your life to commit an atrocity and said that it was an accident.

> So Schneizel was the one who ordered it, not Suzaku.

He's a crafty one that Schneizel.

> And despite claiming to be asking Suzaku for help, Lelouch had a massive elaborate plan in place to capture Nunnally.

I think it was more of a back up/fail safe.  Also it definitely wasn't well thought out sending in Rolo.

> That's totally out of character for him.

That's why he loathes the Geass command that lelouch gave him.  He said so himself that it warps his values.

> Lelouch doesn't believe him.

Liars are generally the least trusting people because they think everyone is just like them.

> Rolo and Lelouch plot to backstab the other.

Rolo legit thinks that Lelouch is better off with just him.  If he could he'd probably kill everyone else alive just to have Lelouch to himself.  He's a little clingy.

> Were there people on those trains....?

I hope not, because it would make sense to evacuate civilians beforehand, but then again why else would the trains be running?

> I kind of love that both Cecile/Lloyd and Rakshata are both so offended by this for different reasons.

It's really the best that they honestly don't care about the human element or the consequences of the battle, Lloyd and Rakshata that ism but rather their mechs are the be all end all.  I think they're secretly Sunrise employees.

> That was really a shitty Geass idea, Lelouch.

Lelouch wasn't really considering the potential consequences when Schneizel was about to blow him to hell with the Gawain's hadron cannons.  He pretty much said what he needed to in order to survive.

> Ohgi shouldn't you have learned Villetta's ACTUAL name by now?

He called her Viletta Nu last episode, but I just think he still thinks of her as Chigusa.

> I don't know, I think Lelouch could have proven it? I think there's a big difference between "I lost control at that moment, it was an accident but I take all the responsibility" and outright lying.

I think if Suzaku didn't know Lelouch as well as he does he would've been more inclined to believe him.  However he knows that Lelouch is a natural liar and is generally more inclined to lie than to be forthright and honest.  Lelouch probably realized this and decided just to fully heap the blame on himself as he thought that was what Suzaku wanted to hear.  

Lelouch clearly still hates himself for what happened with that command so in a way he probably feels like he would be diminishing his sin by claiming it was an accident so the rationalization could also be that he's telling *his* truth if that makes any sense.

At the end of the day though I think Lelouch was willing to say anything to convince Suzaku to protect Nunnally that was the only thing that mattered in the moment.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think Lelouch took the better course of action by placing all the blame to himself. Suzaku is the person who knows him best-but even he wouldn't believe him if he told the truth it- its that bizarre. I mean, come on, I geassed her accidentally? However, because he lied and followed up with other lies about which Suzaku probably had some guess of the truth(like the hoteljacking incident) Suzaku got some rudimentary idea that Lelouch didn't kill Shirley and Euphy out of pure malice; that there were other factors likely involved. 

But then again I doubt he really thought himself through in this situation-he likely would've confessed to killing Marianne if that meant saving Nunnally.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm gonna be honest, I think I might like this OP more than the first one. I know that's heresy.

It's not heresy. I think musically it fits in quite well. It's keeping me hopeful even though in the show it seems like everything is falling apart. We're getting closer and closer to seeing everything come together at the end of a long journey.

> And Suzaku delivers the one challenge to Lelouch that could actually fix it: Change the word for the better like you said you would.

I think Lelouch has been trying to do this. It's just that the world is already so messed up thanks to Britannia. Lelouch himself has also made some questionable decisions, but he's mainly done what he's had to given the circumstances.

> But realistically, he wouldn't have done it if not for Geass, right? How much responsibility does he legitimately bear for it?

I hate that it happened, but it really wasn't his fault. You could absolutely place blame on him, but like you said, also Nina and Schneizel. Even Lelouch gets some of the blame for the order. Personally, I'd say Schneizel then Nina are the most to blame. Nina made it, but Schneizel would likely have found a way to make it even if she wasn't the one to do it.
>> ARTICLE
> I think Lelouch has been trying to do this. It's just that the world is already so messed up thanks to Britannia. Lelouch himself has also made some questionable decisions, but he's mainly done what he's had to given the circumstances.

I think Lelouch's motives have been twofold: Protect Nunnally and avenge his mother by killing Charles. I think the benefit of literally everyone else in the world is completely secondary to these two. I saw Suzaku's challenge as making Lelouch see if he could put the world ahead of his personal selfish goals. 

Speaking of the OP, I noticed that the Lancelot has its own set of energy wings, but the one that Kallen just trashed doesn't. Unless the OP is severely lying, I think Suzaku still gets at least one final upgrade in the last 7 episodes of the show. 

And then perhaps one more winner-takes-all duel between the two, with them finally on equal footing for once. 
>> ARTICLE
> I saw Suzaku's challenge as making Lelouch see if he could put the world ahead of his personal selfish goals. 

Yeah, you know what, you're right in that.

I just always thought of as if he was able to accomplish his goals, even if they were selfish, the world would end up a better place as a side effect. Those being oppressed by Charles and Britannia now had someone fighting to make things better. Why should they care if Zero/Leouch was doing that because his father pissed him off?

I really don't know what I think of Suzaku and Lelouch and who holds the blame for what happened.

* **Blaming neither:** Lelouch gave Suzaku the "Live!" order in a panic to save his own life, so how can I blame him? Suzaku would have gladly died instead of firing that bomb if he had been allowed, so that isn't his fault either.

* **Blaming Lelouch:** Lelouch started this whole mess, and he's been given plenty of opportunities to stop it. He should have realized that the "Live!" order is messing everything up and gotten Jeremiah to fix it. He should also have backed off from this war already and let Nunnally live in peace and happiness even if he wasn't able to be by her side.

* **Blaming Suzaku:** That "Live!" command is the sweetest order that Lelouch ever gave. It didn't guarantee his own life in any way; it was just to save the life of his best friend and keep him from making a sacrifice that he truly thought Suzaku shouldn't make. What Suzaku has done since then is entirely on him. Why was pulling that trigger even on his list of options? If he were truly so opposed to it, it wouldn't have ever crossed his mind!

* **Blaming both:** They both made really stupid calls on instinct, in situations where they should have been able to plan out their actions. Lelouch knew he was caught in a death trap and had plenty of time (for a genius like him) to figure out a better solution than a generic, unending "Live!" Suzaku was forced to try to live in this battle, but he is well aware of that and everyone was telling him to get out of there because his life was in danger, so he couldn't have been surprised when his hand was forced.

I really don't know. I sympathize with every viewpoint about that pair.

Upcoming Schneizel vs Lelouch game of the generals! It's about to get epic

Whoa, Gino x Kallen?

Also Chiba, you better tell Tohdoh your feelings before the series ends
>> ARTICLE
And here we arrive on one of the bigger debate points for this series: who gets blamed for Episode 18's ending?  

There's a number of answers to that, Lelouch, Suzaku, Nina, the Emperor, nobody... though it probably most obviously breaks down into two camps: "Lelouch" and "Not Lelouch". 

And I'm pretty solidly in the "Lelouch is largely responsible" camp.  

I mean, sure the Emperor and Britannia as a whole deserve some of the blame, as well as Nina (or rather whoever decided to take an angry unstable teenager and put her as head of a nuclear weapons research lab), but really most of the events that lead up to the FLEIJA are instigated by Lelouch.

In the big picture, this conflict is something that was instigated by him.  Sure, the Britannian mistreatment of the Japanese sucks and was a large part of the cause of the conflict, but the exact same argument could be made about WWII; just because the terrible terms imposed on the Germans by the Treaty of Versaille made the second war nearly inevitable doesn't make the Germans blameless for instigating WWII.

And, of course, in the specifics, its Suzaku's Geass that is the direct cause (there's no way Suzaku would have fired, otherwise).  And while you can argue that Lelouch didn't know that would be the result of that Geass... but with a power like Geass, you need to know there are going to be unforeseen consequences.  You don't get to go around mind controlling people, then take no responsibility for any unforeseen consequences.  

You can't start a war, or take away people's free will, and say "oops, I didn't intend for anything bad to happen".  People give Suzaku shit for working with Britannia... but the point of Suzaku's character is that he's trying to improve things for the Britannians *without* starting a war that might, say, kill millions and millions of people.  Sure, the exact chain of events that led up to this moment wasn't probable or predictable... but then when you're talking about a war, killing lots and lots of people is hardly the least probable outcome.  
>> ARTICLE
I'd say in the order of things Schneizel is probably the most responsible, for directing Nina in the development of FLEIJA, for moving the chess pieces to where it would be used. Look at the way he smiled when Suzaku fired. 

After that probably Lelouch for most of the reasons you mentioned, plus assuming Suzaku was bluffing about possessing this terrifying new weapon.

After that, there's a ways between the top two and the next one, Nina. She's the scientist who invented it, true, but we don't weigh the deaths at Nagasaki and Hiroshima on the shoulders of Oppenheimer and his team. On the other hand, Nina was a lot more aggressive and insistent on its military use than Oppenheimer was, so she bears SOME of the blame.

I really don't... see how anyone can blame Suzaku at all? He A.) didn't want to be equipped with it in the first place, B.) informed Lelouch of its existence to avoid a battle before anyone started fighting, C.) ultimately would have rather accepted his death than use it, were it not for Geass. Like, he did everything he should have *except* for have been Geassed into living by Lelouch. 
>> ARTICLE
All the same, FLIEJA is something completely new.  Lelouch couldn't have known any possible action to protect oneself (or even a war) would ever result in a city being wiped out in a blink.
>> ARTICLE
In a blink?  Perhaps not; but war wiping entire cities off the map is not anything new.  Would it have been any less tragic if 10 million people died in the war Lelouch started but it took several years, rather than instantly?  

And new technological developments (i.e. more deadly weapons), is a normal part of war as well (e.g. the invention of Knightmare Frames in the previous war).  It'd be nave to expect otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
Presumably, if wiping out a city takes a nontrivial amount of time, he'd have time to try doing something about it, at least.
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand, Suzaku *literally warned him.* 

Suzaku said that they had a terrifying new weapon, more powerful than anything seen before. He could have taken out all of the Black Knights right there (presumably being informed of its blast radius to avoid hitting civilian structures by aiming it properly) but offered Lelouch a chance to *leave*. Lelouch thought it was a bluff.
>> ARTICLE
One of the more interesting situations concerning this particular set of episodes is how, upon rewatch, you tend to notice certain details. For instance, Schneizel is actually up to more than what it seems at first glance. 

There were a few folks who did notice some odd or suspicious things even back during the original broadcast, but I hope at least a handful of those who are experiencing the show for the very first time will also be willing to go over the events of these episodes after a while. I would like to be more specific, but I definitely can't.

We need more formal dances in anime. No particular reason, I just like watching them.

Conveniently-timed arrival there. Rolo's weakness is a handgun outside of a 20-foot radius; he can stop people but he can't stop a bullet. He's pretty broken emotionally and I feel bad for him as I see things ending poorly whenever Lelouch decides he's done with him.

[This is a weird-ass aircraft.](http://i.imgur.com/ViYYUKV.png) Whoever this jerk talking to Guilford is, he needs to respect the man. Probably going to be wiped out pretty quickly just like Calares. Lloyd's back! And I love that he just called the Emperor Charlie.

[Chinese force?](http://i.imgur.com/UrzwtNW.png) And I'm wondering [who this is.](http://i.imgur.com/QOgrmiR.png) Schneizel? Looks like he has something over the left side of his face too. Well, that answers one of my questions about the OP right away. Chinese Empress it is!

Charles and VV made a contract **to kill God**. Now that's hardcore. I guess VV's been around for while a long time as well.

*Of course they're landing on you* idiot. Did you really expect ground-based mechs to just float there? I'm enjoying Guilford now, he doesn't completely underestimate Zero.

Ooh, odds on Lelouch taking off his mask and accidentally Geassing Nunnally? Probably not yet, but I bet it'll happen eventually. Nice that she just told him that she disapproved of his entire scheme.

So Anya has the single massive cannon, gotcha. Oooh, apparently Gino knew Td before. Maybe that was the miracle of someplace-I-can't-remember from the conquest of Japan.

And here Nunnally is trying to undo Zero's work again. I'd like to think that she would make him rethink his plans but I doubt he's going to even consider *her* thoughts on the whole thing. Lelouch claims he's doing all of this for her but it's really what he wants instead.

Kouzuki Kallen, killed by poor Knightmare maintenance. Or not, Rakshata happens to be there. All these mech upgrade scenes are the equivalent of a magical girl transformation sequence.

I'm amused that Jeremiah's legacy is "orange guy" even among the famous Knights.

[Wild speculation turn 06](/s "Zero decides to show his identity to the Black Knights, and Sayoko reveals that she's actually Marianne and had been watching over Lelouch and Nunnally the whole time. Meanwhile, Suzaku pledges to become Nunnally's Knight and she decides to marry him. Anya is mildly depressed by that until Guilford comforts her and they start dating.")

Notice he keeps saying he wants to reshape the world into one where she can be happy.  Not that he wants to make her happy directly nor to follow her wishes
>> ARTICLE
Something I just noticed... Lelouch keeps claiming he is doing everything for Nunally, but he has never asked her ONCE what would actually make her happy.
>> ARTICLE
This is because he had never been willing to be honest with her since they went to Japan. This is not in the anime but in the side material CD; when they were given their accommodation which was of horrible quality, she asked him how was the house. He lied to her and said they were given a very good home. And during the invasion, when he carried her across a recent battlefield, he didn't tell her what she is smelling was of the human corpses they were moving through. Ever since she went blind, Lulu had stopped telling his sister the truth. He only ever tell her what he thinks she needs to hear.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah Lelouch definitely operates on what he thinks is right for others and just assumes that they'll be all right with it ultimately because the end result is at least in his mind supposed to be for their benefit. It's a mindset that a friend brought up recently in a discussion as being childlike in not fully considering others' feelings, which could be due to his emotional growth being stunted by the trauma of his mother's assassination and having to quickly jump into a guardian role that he honestly was nowhere near prepared for.

Not that it's a perfect explanation, but it did make some level of sense.

That would be the most fantastic character death in any series.

Well, Lelouch was just as stupid in this episode, and Guilford + the KotRs had pretty good showings. More to the point, Nunnally choosing to go with Suzaku has to be a serious emotional blow to Lelouch so I don't think there's any question that Lulu lost this one. 
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 6: Surprise Attack over the Pacific**

- I can't get over how magnificent a trap this is. Lelouch can't say anything or else he instantly gives himself away. More to the point, even if he DOES beat Suzaku here, he has to deal with the very real fact that his rebellion against Britannia is now against the sister he claims to be doing it all for, to the point of abandoning his allies last time around. Well fucking played, Suzaku (and/or Chuck.)  
- Bailed out by Rolo, seriously. Guess he really has changed sides.   
- Oh, so that's where Guilford went, to escort Nunnally?   
- And Guilford is the only person with a head on his shoulders.   
- Awww yeah, Lloyd and Cecile. And he's calling the emperor Charlie. Never change Lloyd.    
- Poor Nunnally doesn't understand. From her point of view, that has to be crazy confusing.   
- Interesting that the Chinese capital is in Luoyang! I wonder what changed in their history.    
- Wow, the dub fucking mangles that name. Between this and Xing-KAYYY, they really needed to get someone who spoke Chinese on staff....   
- oh man the empress is kawaii as hell. isolated, probably at the mercy of the eunuchs who rule in her stead. Wondering now if this is the source of Captain China's beef with them?   
- I wanna take her home with me.    
- I like that they repurposed the OSI secret room for Lelouch. What happened to all of the other agents? hell, what happened to Suzaku? It'd be really bad if he walked in and saw Lelouch talking to CC, right?   
- so CC (says she) doesn't know much about VV. Interesting. Also interesting is that he's Chuck's first ally, so VV's definitely older than he looks.   
- And the contract VV and Chuck have is to kill god. Of course.    
- BIG BROTHER???     
- ???????????????   
- That's definitely 'niisan' in the original Japanese, so it's not like a Kamina-esque 'aniki' either.   
- Okay, this changes everything. So VV is literally Charles' older brother, who looks like a kid because.... Geass? That's all I can think of. Does he reverse age like that girl from Darker Than Black, maybe?     
- I really like the Knights of the Round uniforms. Snazzy capes, guys. Of course the girl gotta get the pink one, though.    
- Quit texting, Anya.    
- Black knights gave the Round Knights the slip.    
- ...hanging Knightmares from planes looks so silly, guys. Really?   
- Nice booby trap, though. Bet you're wishing Guilford had come, eh?   
- Aw, those Britannians Zero just killed seemed somewhat decent.   
- Did he just name his attack which is literally just jumping between ships        
- Guilford DID come. Well done, Guilford. Britannia thanks your competency.   
- Haha Lloyd didn't tell Schneizel about the budget.   
- Not being able to fly is really hurting Kallen in these fights.    
- Dude, your ass got saved. Why worry about the credit?    
- Lelouch meeting Nunnally again feels pretty climactic. And taking out the command crew, well played.    
- Man, from Nunnally's POV she has every reason to expect she's about to die. All she knows is that Zero has killed two members of her family up until now, one Viceroy and one sub-Viceroy.   
- Curious that she doesn't mention Cornelia, though. Indicating she's still alive?    
- Damn, Kallen just played that Final Fantasy X style, skating along the cord. That was pretty cool. I love seeing her as a badass pilot and not just T&A.   
- Watch out, Black Knights, because the White Knights are here.   
- Oh, I see Anya is piloting the Gundam Virtue.   
- Wow, this General is a fucking dumbass.    
- iiiiinteresting. Nunnally requested the post herself? She's clearly not just a passive player like everyone (Lelouch included) assumed.   
- Goodbye, grandpa Four Swords. This really is a silly tactic, not having flying units. What an ill-advised attack, just so Lelouch can get his sister back.    
- And she doesn't even want to come with him. She wants to do Euphy's plan right.   
- I loved that shot of Nunnally and Euphy reaching out to him together. That'll fuck with your head, Lelouch.      
- Kallen, that was stupid of you.    
- And now she can't eject. Way to go, Kallen.   
- Hello, Gundam SEED Destiny.    
- No seriously, I'm pretty sure Shinn Asuka did this exact same thing with the replacing-damaged-parts-on-the-go. An homage?      
- Kallen can fly now too. Still, it's 1v3. Not great odds.    
- Interesting, so her new arm does the same thing as her old one, but at range? That's pretty fucking lethal.   
- ...did Kallen just 2v1 the Knights of the Round? She didn't WIN per se, but she avoided losing, which is the same thing.    
- Oh man, that has to seriously sting Lelouch, being so close to Nunnally and seeing her choose to go with Suzaku over him.   
- Good thing Kallen was right there or that would have been the end of the series.     

I'm all for Nunnally being an active player in the political games now after just being a pawn. She's joined the Game of Thrones, just... a really nice, cuddly version. And now that Kallen has a flying Knightmare, she's clearly the combat equal of any of the Knights of the Round. Still, I think Lelouch came out the loser overall in this episode, and I won't be surprised if losing Nunnally to Suzaku's care seriously fucks with his head.

I can't remember nor imagine what they told Nunnally regarding Lelouch

And it's a bit of a reversal of the whole "play by rules/break rules" dichotomy for Suzaku to be lying to Nunnally about everything, and Lelouch to be unable to, even for her own sake.
>> ARTICLE
> Goodbye, grandpa Four Swords. This really is a silly tactic, not having flying units. What an ill-advised attack, just so Lelouch can get his sister back.

Why did they not just wait until she was on the ground in area 11? They know the enemy has flying Knightmares, and even with Rakshata meeting them there, the Black Knights only have one. Wasn't the best plan.
>> ARTICLE
I guess PRESUMABLY, because then there would be the full military strength of the Area 11 Britannian forces to protect her as opposed to a simple escort. I dunno, Nunnally makes Lelouch do very stupid things.

Did he not know Rakshata was on her way with the new Float system for the Guren? Because waiting an extra half hour to have his best pilot in his most powerful Knightmare with full aerial capacity would have been wise. 
>> ARTICLE
> Nunnally makes Lelouch do very stupid things.

Agreed.

I have to think that Lelouch knew Rakshata was coming. Wasn't CC with her on the submarine/boat? How else would Rakshata have known she'd have to be there to help them? Still, like you said, they probably could have waited a bit longer, met up, and equipped the Guren with it's flight pack beforehand.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, CC was there so he definitely knew Rakshata was coming.

Having a fully-aerial Guren would have like solved almost all of the problems with the plan. Stupid hasty Lelouch. 

Unless maybe they COULDN'T wait, since they had to get out of the Chinese consulate before Suzaku, Gino and Anya came calling? 

Edit: Ohgi was there too, but he was flying one of the planes, wasn't he? So I guess they landed or something? Maybe they met up on the way? Am I overthinking this???
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they couldn't wait. They had to get out of there before Suzaku and co. came looking for them, and then figured they'd have a chance to get to Nunnally before Suzaku realized what they were going to do.

> So I guess they landed or something?

Yeah, Ohgi was flying. Are you saying he and the other planes/choppers landed after dropping off the mechs on the Britannian ship?

I figure the Black Knights just left the consulate, Zero met up with them, and then they flew out the to ship?
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, Ohgi was flying. Are you saying he and the other planes/choppers landed after dropping off the mechs on the Britannian ship?

Maybe, but I just checked and there aren't any aircraft on the top so... they landed on land, parked and got in the sub? The logistics don't make much sense.

Alright, I see what you're saying now. I had to go back and rewatch to be sure. I didn't realize Oghi was with Rakshata and CC.

Maybe they all went out to lunch together and Lelouch is just borrowing it. Really though, it makes no sense to me.

> Okay, this changes everything. So VV is literally Charles' older brother, who looks like a kid because.... Geass? That's all I can think of.

I skipped over that part in writing my own reactions because I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. What can we infer from that? Is VV literally Charles' older brother? If so, what makes VV so different?

I also just realized that this busts my theory that VV is Charles's son. I need to go collect all my theories and organize/revise them...

> Man, from Nunnally's POV she has every reason to expect she's about to die. All she knows is that Zero has killed two members of her family up until now, one Viceroy and one sub-Viceroy.

And despite that, she still tries to convince Zero to help her. Nunnally has my respect after this episode, she's not just a weak pawn even if Lelouch thinks of her that way (weak and a pawn of Britannia).

> Curious that she doesn't mention Cornelia, though. Indicating she's still alive?

Between that and Guilford's comments before I believe so. I don't think anyone really knows what she's up to though, which I'm suspecting means something Geass-related like those artifacts.

Lelouch has control over Viletta now.  Probably made her get rid of them.

Well, CC is immortal and gives out Geasses. Presumably VV is the same, and in this case "immortality" literally means "you stop aging at this exact point"? Which would have meant that he got his power when he was seriously a little kid. 

I mean, that's the reading from what we know in the series thus far, but if they got Geass powers THAT young? IDK. I'm half leaning towards "aging in reverse" myself. 

>And despite that, she still tries to convince Zero to help her. Nunnally has my respect after this episode, she's not just a weak pawn even if Lelouch thinks of her that way (weak and a pawn of Britannia).

Man, for as much as Lelouch apparently loves Nunnally, he doesn't think very highly of her, does she? I think she's going to be a way more important active player in the whole thing by series' end. 

>Between that and Guilford's comments before I believe so. I don't think anyone really knows what she's up to though, which I'm suspecting means something Geass-related like those artifacts.

Speculation time: Cornelia somehow (?? VV??) found out about Geass after she was rescued after the big battle in the Tokyo Settlement in R1 Ep25. Like Suzaku, she put two and two together and realized that Euphy had been Geassed into the massacre. And now she.... I don't know what, maybe she's learning more about Geass? She wants to destroy the source of Geass? She wants to gather proof to clear Euphemia's name? Something like that. Either way, she struck out on her own and the rest of the royal family has no idea where she is. 
>> ARTICLE
> She wants to gather proof to clear Euphemia's name?

Ooh, I like that idea. Not really for or against Lelouch at this point but still looking out for her sister.
>> ARTICLE
>Presumably VV is the same, and in this case "immortality" literally means "you stop aging at this exact point"?

Remember flashbacks of C.C.'s past? She was alive during the Middle Ages, and looked exactly the same.

Right, but in a bunch of other series, immortality means you roughly reach adulthood before stopping aging. Clearly not here.

> I also just realized that this busts my theory that VV is Charles's son. I need to go collect all my theories and organize/revise them...

Crap, I thought that too. Reorganizing theories sounds like quite a task, good luck. At this point I don't know if I could even come up with a solid prediction as to what's going to happen.

And Nunnally, idk. She's still a kid. She's got heart, but she's also being used by VV/Charles, and she wants to put Euphie's plan into effect. A plan which would probably greatly piss off all of the remaining Japanese. They're not going to want to fall into a trap like that again. I do think she'll come into her own, and probably end up doing something relatively important that will cause problems for Lelouch. [or something crazy like](/s "Lelouch tells her he's Zero. Nunnally goes crazy. Turns out she does have Geass, and she becomes uncontrollable and Lelouch has to kill his sister to save everyone.") But that theory's pretty stupid. It's 80% joke.
>> ARTICLE

Rolos the best! I wonder if the countdown he was doing was his Geass achilles heel or if theres something more.

I hope when Cornelia comes back she helps out Lelouch somehow. Maybe Nunnally will persuade her.

Little Charlie, lol.

Doesnt look like Nunnally was Geassed. Theyre just trying to manipulate her. I wonder if shell turn on Suzaku for being a part of it.

Hmmm, so Diethard and co. were in China? And Kaguya still wants Zero. I wonder if she has an idea who Zero is since she probably spent some time with Lelouch when they were kids.

Big brother? Whaaaaat?

They cant shoot out through the shield? Thats kind of a cool detail. But arent the Nightmares just jumping onto the ship? The shield is up to keep stuff out, and it also keeps stuff in? What exactly can and cant pass through that shield?

Lloyd is pretty funny this episode. Spending Schneizels money without his consent.

I'm still wondering what they need CC for. It seems the only reason Charles has allowed Lelouch to live is to find CC. Nunnally is probably alive only to try and cause Lelouch to slip up trying to rescue her, thus making it easier to get to CC.

Also waiting on more info for both Marianne and Charles. They're still shrouded in a bit of mystery. I still think Marianne is alive. CC hasn't been "talking to herself" anymore, but I'll wait and see if that comes back into play again. She must have been talking to one of them... or both.

I actually don't think it's a Hadron cannon, I think that's her Radiant Wave whatsis. aka, her former touch-based-only instant kill is now at range. It did the same "everything puffs up" effect to Guilford's Knightmare as her death palm does.

Plausible if it gets revealed to her. *Or* she could stick to her guns and shun Lelouch for being Zero. Maybe both.

Lelouch seriously just needs to explain to those close to him what happened in his past. Nunnally doesn't exactly know what happened, Suzaku, if he does know, is being a jerk siding with Charles, and Kallen would potentially be more sympathetic towards Lelouch.

> Whenever I think about problems like that.

How hard is to just say something like, "people and mechs can pass through the shield, but bullets can't." Whatever, man. I should just relax.

> on your thoughts on the future

[speculation](/s "I'll be disappointed as well. It's just that we're now 31 episodes in and we know jack about CC's/VV's race, those planets, those people with the face markings. They need to get that stuff soon. Maybe in the next ~10 episodes we'll have some solid info on that, and hopefully Marianne/Charles as well. Thinking of Charles as the big bad, well, I mean he's been set up for that, yes. The show has been leading to Lelouch vs. Charles, but why? Because Charles ruined Lelouch's life? There's just so much more going on now besides Lelouch's stupid problems.")

Just gonna have to wait it all out and see what happens.

My theory about final bosses:

[Geass Big Bad will be...](/s "Schneizel. We've seen only a little of him thus far, but we know he's both effective (kicking the EU ass as Tohdoh said last episode) and ruthless (was willing to kill Euphy's personal knight and destroy the experimental Lancelot just to take out Zero in R1). If Lelouch does kill Charles before the end, Schneizel dispatches the oldest brother to make sure he ascends to the throne, and Lelouch realized he's created an even greater nemesis for himself. I think that would create a great opportunity for a 'we're not so different' if Schneizel offs his brother, since Lulu killed both Clovis and Euphemia. They'd both have family blood on their hands. Hell, maybe Schneizel kills Charles himself. ")
>> ARTICLE
That I'd be okay with and actually sounds plausible. He's been out of the picture for a while but still gets mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
Well that'd be interesting. Hadn't thought of that happening. Definitely need to see more of Schneizel. He seemed interesting, but has had barely any screen time.
>> ARTICLE
they toss a lot of foreshadowing. The only one Lelouche has never won against in chess. Funds a ton of cutting edge research that is a direct threat to Lelouche. Only one in Brittania that appears to have a brain. Been ongoing since S1.
>> ARTICLE
I guess they do, yeah. Thanks for the examples. I forgot about the chess one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just trying to think what would make the most sense narratively. Schneizel has been involved behind the scenes a ton, he's apparently currently winning the war in EU presumably as a strategist/tactician (making him a threat to Lelouch's skill), he backed Suzaku and has been behind many if not most of the technological advancements we've seen thus far (the Lancelot, the Float systems, the Avalon). We know he's ambitious, from that scene last season where the oldest brother had no idea how to handle Japan and Schneizel volunteered to go himself. 

Aside from Marianne (who may or may not be dead, depending on how we interpret CC's conversations with her), he's been the most influential character who hasn't shown up much yet. Also, I just went back and checked, and he gets solo appearances in all four OPs thus far. 

And there's also the whole chess motif thing, with Lelouch as the "Black King" and Schneizel's color scheme matching up perfectly as the "White King." 

He has to be a more major player before the end of the season, I'm sure of it. I guess he could always play the Dragon role to Charles, though. Like a Clovis -> Cornelia -> Schneizel -> Charles progression of villains.

Edit: Jeez, I rewatched their confrontations and BOTH Clovis and Cornelia indicate to Lelouch that Schneizel had some involvement with Marianne's death. Yeah, this guy's going to be a major player in the Game of Geasses. He HAS to be.

* So, thats what Suzaku was thinking while Lelouch was busy narrating the preview last episode.

* The fact that Lelouch didnt immediately go, What do you mean brother? Do you have me confused for some other Lelouch? should have been a tip-off to Suzaku that something was up. Call it being surprised by being called brother I suppose, but the way Lelouch just stands there, continually looking back at him should have been a little suspicious.

* Rolos idea of how long seconds are must be based on that five minute fight in DBZ.

* Nunnallys good at ad-libbing.

* Being called your Highness by your brother must feel all sorts of wrong.

* [/u/rascporia currently wondering why California hasnt yet been nuked off the map.](http://i.imgur.com/UjOyV8X.png)

* Princess Cornelia would regret seeing your contemptible fear for this cheap imposter. Id say she would be disappointed seeing him show fear even toward the real Zero.

* [I like to imagine Lloyd was just hiding behind a wall waiting to something to be said that he could make a witty comeback to.](http://webm.land/media/jA15.webm) Also, the way he refers to Charles as Little Charlie without even batting an eye is freaking hilarious. How he hasnt gotten himself killed yet is beyond me.

* I wonder what V.V. told Nunnally that she just willingly left with him and hasnt been questioning shit about why Lelouch hasnt contacted her in the past year.

* Another sheltered princess wants more character, eh? Well, at least now she actually has reason to know whats going on, what with them being involved in a war and all.

* My husband is waiting for me.

* * Really? When did he propose?

* * He hasnt yet.

* * Oh, so is it currently just courting?


* * No, he actually is not yet aware that were going to be married.

* * Are you in any way related to-

* * No, I am not related to Yuno Gaisi! Why do people always say that?!

* [OOH! FINALLY SOMETHING ELSE FROM THE OP!](http://i.imgur.com/YTXdqaI.jpg)

* [My heart](http://i.imgur.com/y3BHmpX.jpg)

* Do they plan to use her as a pawn, then throw her away? C.C. practically calling out Lelouch on what hes doing to Rolo.

* I am going to create a world where Nunnally can live happily. You know, dude, she seemed pretty damn happy to begin with whenever we saw her. Sure youre not projecting just a *teeny* bit?

* It wasnt necessary for her to know. I dont know, man. Id say telling Nunnally that her brother is some super-powered, mind-controlling, murdering bastard would have helped win her over to your side (at least until Lelouch convinced her that you, too, have Geass).

* Oh, and V.V. is Charles older brother. Apparently he obtained Code at quite an early age, which explains why Charles was able to rise to power so quickly. Who wouldnt want to immediately contract their little bro and best friend with super powers should they ever have the chance?

* They wouldnt attack Nunnally. That was Lelouch Zero, dude. For all you know, this is a completely different guy.

* Its so satisfying to just see the comradery and loyalty the Black Knights have toward Zero and each other during the air raid. We need more stories with characters like that.

* If Id known this was possible, Id have brought Lord Guilford along. Nice to see the man knows where his superiors outshine him.

* How exactly does Lelouch open and close that visor? Is it some sort of mental synchronization, or is there like a secret button hidden somewhere on that outfit?

* [Rolo seems to have forgotten to put his contacts in this morning.](http://i.imgur.com/lyMhcYy.jpg) Or his mouth, for that matter.

* Was Guilford just following them from like half a mile back or what?

* Lloyd doesnt need to tell people shit. He knows his quirky sociopathy is enough to make people forgive him almost instantly.

* Dude, who gives a fuck if he takes all the credit? Youll be alive. Unless youre one of those rather die than risk my reputation kind of assholes.

* I think that what youre doing is wrong.

* * Well, I can fix that; just FUCK! Hey, do you think this shit would work if I just forced your eyelid open?

* Gino finally attacking someone who doesnt work for him.

* [Why does getting ejected cause you to grow breasts?](http://i.imgur.com/SZvrgih.jpg)

* We dont wanna kill the Viceroy now, do we?

* * Its the only excitement I get in my miserable existence.

* I love how the General is so obsessed with his rank that when Suzaku, the guy with literally the most powerful Knightmare in the entire Britannian fleet, shows up to save him, he has to go and do something stupid. /u/rascorpia must be face-palming so hard right now.

* Lelouch give me the courage I need.

* * *Thinking* Man, I hope shes stupid enough to have not developed acute hearing to compensate for her blindness and paralysis. Might as well give it a shot

* * Well

* * *Thinking* Phew! Thank God shes just an archetypal plot device.

* Speaking of plot devices, now Nunnally just so happened to ask to be made Viceroy after Lelouch killed the last one because she wants to make the world a gentler place?  

* [Hey, buddy, Ive been meaning to tell you. Youve got Youve got something on your Oh, never mind.](http://i.imgur.com/QERNy83.jpg)

* Dont like picking on those who are weaker than me, but Unless those people are on your side, apparently.

* NO! SIMBA! WHO WILL RULE THE PRIDELANDS, NOW?!

* Thats why I want to carry out Euphies plan: To create the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan.

* * *Thinking* Bitch, did you not hear what happened to Euphie when she tried that? Are *deaf* too?

* Whenever Suzaku gets super-serious and badass like this, I like to think back last episode when he meowed at the top of his lungs.

* Wheelchair beacon. I just find that funny for some reason.

* Does he seriously think Kallen wants to hurt Nunnally or something? He does remember they were classmates as well as close friends, right? He must still be jaded from Lelouchs betrayal.

* *Hair dryer canon gets blown up*

* * Rakshata: Ah, man, now I have to build an even bigger and more ridiculously OP one.

* Tag. Youre dead. No, not her. I care so much about her. She had such memorable traits like being a woman and holding a grudge against Zero and having boobs

* [Just Just close your eyes and listen.](http://webm.land/media/1plK.webm)

* Do I even want to know what all these [pop-ups](http://i.imgur.com/8yIZNcf.jpg) say?

* See? Whatd I just say literally five bullet points ago?

* If this Gurren doesnt work perfectly, Im finished. Dont worry; Rakshata borrowed some of Suzakus plot armor to build it with.

* What kind heat ray is that where its enough force to crack his glasses but leave him unscathed?

* Damn. Even when he's gone Jeremiah cant catch a break.

* Dirty shoes. I think you mean marketable.

* Held back my ass, Giro. You take your lumps like a man.

* Youd think Lloyd would have found a way to counteract that drive-impairment field Lelouch keeps dropping on the Lancelot.

* [The best part is you know Lloyd only cares about the Lancelot.](http://webm.land/media/dkHu.webm) He couldnt give a shit about Suzaku.

* The longer the confrontation between Lelouch and Nunnally goes on, the stupider I think it is that she cant recognize his voice. Kallen I can get because she didnt talk to him much at school, and even then he needed to trick her to keep her from finding out, and Euphemia realized it in two seconds after being away from him for years. Nunnallys just dense.

* And, Lelouch then died after crashing hard into the incredibly dense metal that made up the Gurrens hands. No, wait, were operating under Michael Bay Transformers logic.

Goodnight, everybody!

Minor, but plot-relevant.

Sort of a last episode thing.

Lelouche's mask has a voice changer.

Euphy guessed that it's Lelouch from his actions, not voice.

I assume those are airbags or similiar safety precautions.

As for Nunnally, shes very sheltered, I just attribute all plot holes related to her as her being very naive.
>> ARTICLE
> The fact that Lelouch didnt immediately go, What do you mean brother? Do you have me confused for some other Lelouch? should have been a tip-off to Suzaku that something was up. Call it being surprised by being called brother I suppose, but the way Lelouch just stands there, continually looking back at him should have been a little suspicious.

To an even larger degree than talking, inner monologues in this series don't happen in real time.

> Id say she would be disappointed seeing him show fear even toward the real Zero.

Disappointed over fear, maybe, but I think she's wise enough to respect him as an enemy.

> I wonder what V.V. told Nunnally that she just willingly left with him and hasnt been questioning shit about why Lelouch hasnt contacted her in the past year.

Memory-rewriting Geass, could be anything. It's a convenient plot hole eraser. Maybe Chuck made her think she was with Lelouch for the last year and she took a temporary trip (well, maybe not that extreme, I don't remember if her dialog could rule that out).

> You know, dude, she seemed pretty damn happy to begin with whenever we saw her. Sure youre not projecting just a teeny bit?

Said more on that in my post but yeah, this isn't about Nunnally any more.
>> ARTICLE
>Said more on that in my post but yeah, this isn't about Nunnally any more.

On a subconscious level, Lelouch is probably aware of that fact. Genius just has to stop keeping himself handicapped on that vital piece of info.
>> ARTICLE
*Can* Nunnally be Geassed? Specifically, Geassed by Charles or Lelouch, both of whom seem to need eye contact. 
>> ARTICLE
Unsure at this time, really.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Charles is a majestic man beast. Or V.V is bloody tiny, hopefully the former. 

Good to have Lloyd back though, I've missed his almost lack of sanity.

The Guren pulling some Iron Man shit there. Anyway at this rate I'm predicting at least 4 more out of nowhere super upgrades to the Knightmares to turn the tables before the series is over.

Goddammit Lelouch I would have thought you'd have figured out what you were going to do to get Nunally out of there before you got there rather than spending valuable kidnap-and-run-away time having a moral dilemma ten feet away from her. 
>> ARTICLE
It's both. V.V. is really damn short, but most of the Britannians are fucking *tall* for some crazy reason. According to the wiki, Charles is 6'6", and Schneizel is 6'7", although I'm too lazy to check their sources, and this craziness is present for just about everyone on the side of Britannia. Seriously, look at Lloyd stand next to Guilford and the knights when he first shows up. He's the short one there at 6'1". Lelouch is only 5'10", but I suspect that's just because he'd tower over most of the Japanese if they had his height match his family.
>> ARTICLE
God, I love the Mordred. I know it's pretty much the Gundam Virtue with a different paintjob, but I just love the fact that when all the other knightmares are focused on being light (probably because the weapons on the battlefields of Code Geass are *terrifying*), the Mordred just strolls the hell in like a walking death star, armed to the teeth. Battleship? Hit it with a gargantuan cannon blast. Someone's trying to dodge around and be crafty? Fuck it, homing missiles. Hit with a sword that can slice just about any other knightmare in half? Shrug it off and crush the thing's head.  
  
I almost feel bad for Gino. His mech was probably the best thing on the planet until everyone and their mother got float units. It's still badass, don't get me wrong, but I feel like the gimmick gets wasted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Mordred's the Virtue. Tristan's the Kirios. Lancelot is like Dynames and Exia having a child, and that child being piloted by an even bigger idiot than Lockon and Setsuna.
>> ARTICLE
Man I love Llyods entrance and I'm so glad he's back

On another note, why do people say Kallen is just there for fan service? I really like her and her relationship with Lelouch/Zero. I do think the fan service is unnecessary but she is the OP pilot to match up against Suzaku  
>> ARTICLE
A significant number of shots of her this season have been focused on her ass. They could have drawn her from any other angle.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that there's a lot of fan service focused around her, but some people just don't like her because of that

>> ARTICLE
I don't, because I've never had this sort of immediate allergy towards fanservice that some folks seem to experience.

I'd have to hate everyone in Godannar and Yoko in Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
That implies that she wasn't already a fanservice character in R1, where we had an entire conversation while she was in the shower and actually saw full uncensored breasts when Suzaku judo flipped her on the island. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between providing fanservice, even lots of it, and being a "fanservice character" though. Otherwise, you would need to complain about every time C.C. gets the same treatment.

Especially since the conversation you have pointed out from earlier in the show was relevant, precisely because there was an actual conversation. Same with Suzaku during the island episode.

>> ARTICLE
And in this episode Kallen took on three Knights of the Round and came out even at worst while getting a significant mech upgrade. I don't think that's being "a fanservice character."

---
Diethard wants to join the Black Knights, eh? Noticed him with the Black Knights in the altered OP yesterday but didn't mention it then. Sounds like it might be a spy position though, if he's looking into things like with what Jeremiah/Villetta want.

New mechs! You can't have a mecha series without upgrades. And Diethard's leaking out that the military's aiming for the JLF headquarters... good way to win over Zero's favor I'm guessing. Still don't trust him though.

CC randomly shows up again once they're in the mountains and I was briefly considering that she's all in Lelouch's mind, except that she interacts with Nunnally and the Pizza Hut delivery guy. Maybe Pizza Hut's imaginary too.

[Need to practice those speeches.](http://i.imgur.com/m8Wjmt3.png) It's a nice little touch showing that everyone needs to rehearse. Or he's looking at some strategic information, but I like to think it's the former. That look on CC when he mentions that her name's not even human.

Yep, Nina's definitely obsessed with Euphemia now. Wasn't the 2nd prince the one that knows about the assassination of Lelouch's mother? And he's the one authorizing Suzaku's continued use of Lancelot. I really want Euphemia to turn against the rest of the royal family.

Interesting moment of leadership by Zero. Of course everyone knows that they aren't getting out without his help, so it almost seems a moot point to offer himself to them. But if someone believed it to be a completely lost cause they might have taken him up on the offer.

[Thanks, translator.](http://i.imgur.com/BJM9QZ1.png) Todo's not there for the start of the battle so I expect him to be one of those late-coming tide turners. Just like Suzaku! [Well](http://i.imgur.com/VpJvps4.png) [that's](http://i.imgur.com/CmHIOFD.png) [interesting.](http://i.imgur.com/KD0WG77.png) Some secret project hidden from most of the military, sounds familiar.

So Kallen brings down the mountain on the enemy force to isolate Cornelia. Too bad Jeremiah has to stick his perfect hair into the picture. [Thanks again, translator.](http://i.imgur.com/7s5QHT8.png) As far as I can tell [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention&oldid=380267360) is the latest version of the page that has a section named "Recovery of Han" which appears to be replaced with [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention#Northern_front). I didn't actually read to learn about the tactics though, I'll wait until the battle's over.

[Ah, the original Orange.](http://i.imgur.com/4evPQU3.png) Nice job Kallen... [well damn, did she kill him?](http://i.imgur.com/wJGpHiV.png) Not calling it until I see a body, but she deserves the [awesome pose](http://i.imgur.com/Xph6a1B.png) anyway.

[Wild speculation round 8](/s "Villetta attempts to counterattack but Kallen easily dispatches her as well. Suzaku comes in and rescues Villetta before she's killed but she's still severely injured. Suzaku begins looking after her and they eventually become lovers. Euphemia is mildly depressed by that until Suzaku comforts her and they *also* start dating. Turns out polyamory is common in Britannia.")

7 Years ago, when I was watching Code Geass for the first time, I completely flipped my shit when the Guren MK-II fried Jeremiah like a fucking potato. That sound of Kallen cocking the control handle and then activating the radiation wave surger, then the shot of the gauge which goes completely nuts and finally the empty energy shell that ejects from the arm, that whole sequence is just so cool.

Up to this day, it's still one of my favorite mechs in existence (weirdly enough, I'm not really digging Gundam designs at all, but I haven't watched that many Gundams yet so that's that).

Oh man, the battle of Narita. This will mark the point from which on shit will hit the fan on an even more consistent basis than up until now. I gotta say though, that landslide was a tad bit too large for my taste. Half the fucking town was destroyed by that shit ... you'd think Zero, the ally of the weak would take care to not harm civilians. But I guess miscalculations do happen.
>> ARTICLE
Diethard! I love Diethard and his philosophy.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Code Geass, its cool seeing the people in here who get to experience it the first time. I'm jealous :)
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. It went by too fast. Thankfully we begin watching two per day now.

Lelouch is still too trusting of CC just because she gave him Geass. I cant help but feel like this is going to bite him in the ass later on. We finally got some info on her though! Its not a human name. Geass is a strange power so its not that far-fetched that shes otherworldly. I guess its still a possibility she was created in a lab or heavily tested on or something.

I know weve seen it before, but that cape on her mech Cornelia you majestic bitch. So stylish. So unnecessary.

Lastly, Im wondering how Jeremiahs story will play out. I still think hell ending up joining The Black Knights, but I knew he wouldnt have an easy time forgiving Zero. He really freaked out trying to get to him. Acting like a child at Zeros name calling, and refusing to eject. Either hes not as smart as he first came across or he hates Zero more than I realized.
>> ARTICLE
He might be thinking:  she gave me this power, she might be able to take it away too.
>> ARTICLE
Good point. I wonder if she'll actually threaten him with that at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Well if CC wanted to betray Lelouch she could've done it earlier at much easier times
>> ARTICLE
True. She could just be biding her time though. Maybe she's using Lelouch to accomplish something she couldn't on her own.
>> ARTICLE
You're not wrong...just you probably aren't exactly expecting what she needs him for. 
>> ARTICLE
That has already been stated. She wants him to grant her one wish, remember?

In Jeremiah's defense, if you previously held a high-standing, respected position, only to have it stripped away and become a pariah for something you don't even remember doing, you'd hold quite a grudge against the person who caused it as well.

Yeah, I can understand that. This is a rewatch for me, Code Geass was actually my first anime. And the Code Ment episodes are spoiler loaded.
>> ARTICLE
A slower paced ride this week, but with a much broader lens so we can see more of the society our Actors live in. Let's see how they did:

**Zero**: It looks like the Black Knights are going well. They even have Knightmares again, which is a huge coup. They have a lot of public goodwill, too, so they must be almost ready for something bigger. Small hiccup when his minion (Tamaki) fails to do proper recon, but the problem is solved by Kallen being an absurdly good pilot. This will be a recurring theme, if it's not already.

**Lelouche**: "*Is that where you really belong?*" "*It's easy to live by lowering your head to the Brittanians.*" He learned a lot about his classmate and fellow conspirator this episode, all while simultaneously reducing her suspicion of him. [Best sleeping pose ever, btw](http://puu.sh/hesTU/ec49f52d6a.png).

**Kallen**: "*I'm... the idiot...*" "*I'll change the world before you're released. We'll live together in a normal world, so...*" The star of this episode, Kallen has a tumultuous time today. She's proud she saved people from harm, but notices the increasingly obvious tension between Japanese who admire Zero, and Elevens who struggle to find Brittanian favour. For her personally, between learning her Mother is a selfless masochist *and* a Refrain addict, having her heritage discovered by Milly and the school, and barely winning a Knightmare battle (that was wicked brutal btw), it's been rough. 

Most interestingly from my view is her impromptu date with Lelouche, wherein he shows her a little more about the total domination Brittania exerts over its non-citizens. She gets super defensive, but it also helps her resolve to keep supporting the Black Knights. It's an example of characterisation for the whole of Area 11, and I love it.

**Cornelia**: "*We can't always be held up by Area 11.*" She's being pulled in all directions, because it turns out that governing a newly conquered territory full of insurrection while the Empire is simultaneously waging war against the EU is difficult. Cornelia agree to let her little sister's saviours roam free, which will not only make Euphie happy, but let the Black Knights work on the Refrain issue, *and* make them an easier target to strike at when she gets back. It's a very clever, if risky move.

**Euphemia**: "*Suzaku... how would you feel about Zero's actions?*" Euphemia's confidence seems shaky. Her Sister is going off to wage war, and the province she's meant to be governing in Cornelia's absence is showing serious cracks. Her monologue reveals that not only does she respect Pvt. Kururugi's behaviour and ideals as an activist, she's also interested in his opinion of her. It works as characterisation for Euphie too - her ideals are similar to Suzaku's, and we learn that by knowing that she's thinking about him. This also keeps the thread of their connection alive despite them not meeting for a few episodes; it'll come back to the fore a bit later. Sensible writing to keep it mentioned.

**Student Council**: Broadly, they're still having a gay ol' time, throwing parties for cats. They seem carefree, but... maybe not...

**Rivalz**: "*You're not hanging out with us as much, you know?*" Through Rivalz, you can see that the Council is noticing Lelouche's odd hours and distant behaviour, even moreso than his usual. Nothing bad happens, though, which is nice.

**Suzaku**: "*Well, I've got to return to the army.*" Bit by cat. Again. Softie at heart. Again. Had an eludicating discussion with Lelouche about the Hoteljacking / Black Knights incident. Still supports the State, even where they're known to be ineffective... It's hard to agree with you here, Suzaku. Side effect: managed to cause Lelouche to wonder about the effect the military is having on him... subtle character development is something this series is pretty okay at.

**Shirley**: "*Hey, Lulu... sometime... when you're free, how about going with me-*" Denied. No asking out for you, missy. NTR'd by a no homo bro? You're never going to get Lulu like that. Nice to see she's confident enough to ask, though. Again, subtle growth, if uninteresting and unsurprising here.

**Nina**: "*mmh...*" Still on that computer. I wonder what's she's doing? Still thinking about the beautiful pink-haired princess who saved her from the brutish terrorist Eleven. Not much else to say, really.

**Milly**: "*While I like to know people's secrets, I don't like to leak them.*" You'd make a good politician, Milly Ashford. Thankfully, you're happy dressing up in costumes and tormenting your vice president. This series could have been quite different if Milly diligently investigated Zero... speaking of which...

**Jeremiah and Viletta**: "About the Orange incident-pardon me-the Kururugi Suzaku Escape Incident... Is it true that you have no recollection of that time?*" Unbelievably, they're starting to compare notes and put pieces together. They know to suspect a Brittanian highschool student, and that memory loss precedes abberant behaviour and Zero doing something spectacularly improbable. Though their Purist faction has been heavily discredited, to say nothing of Orange-kun himself, they're not through. Watch for these guys making moves.

**Todo**: "*...*" His advisors mention something about Kyoto and something called the Guren. His resistance is almost crumbling, and still, he's not acting. For a legendary general, "The Miracle", this temperance is both promising and troubling. He's either *really* good, or he's *really* fucked, or both.

**Tamaki**: "*I was sure when I investigated...*" You suck, Tamaki, and you will always suck.

**C.C.**: "*False tears are capable of hurting other people. False smiles are capable of hurting yourself.*" Why were you even there, except to point the moral out to the audience? Go home and eat some pizza, you voyeur.

And more Britannians contemplating genocide, but the Black Knights work late. Really Kallen, *anyone at the school should be able to recognize you in that outfit.*

Cornelia's out of the picture for the moment, it seems. Wonder what this drug is. Heh, Euphemia thinking about Zero and Suzaku.

Cat festival! And Kallen and Lelouch sniping at each other. I'm enjoying that this is from Kallen's perspective and [she likes being a hero.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBK6c104SHQ) Take the rest of the lyrics to that song as you will.

Nina... has a thing for Euphemia now that the princess saved her, doesn't she? [Probable spoilers for a later episode](/s "I'm guessing the table thing somehow stems from this. At least the memes have mostly died down for now.")

Oh, so it's Kallen's *stepmother* who's the racist bitch? I can see why she would moonlight as a rebel now. [Well that's horrible.](http://i.imgur.com/akuwaW8.png) And her mom's taking drugs.

Damn it Lulu, you were just about to have a girl ask you out and all you can think about is Suzaku. Fortunately he does stop Kallen before she does something stupid. I thought she was about to catch on that he hated Britannia as well, but nope she misinterprets him.

Time for Villetta and Jeremiah to do some side work, as I expected.

Aww, Kallen's mother stayed there to be with her. And she had a brother, wonder if he was killed or something. I like Kallen, so going by my previous experience with these kinds of things (Shigatsu and Sakurasou among others) this means things will go horribly for her.

[Wild speculation round 7](/s "Kallen's brother Naoto is still alive, albeit fighting in the Britannian forces. She's forced to confront him but Suzaku swoops in and stops them from fighting. We don't hear about him again until the season finale, where he shows up only to be squashed by a rampaging mecha-Rivalz. Kallen is mildly depressed by that until Lelouch comforts her and they start dating.")

Hey.

**Episode 9**

* [Lewd](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/905/295/193.png)
* Damn that bitch is cold
* Seems as though she has mommy issues
* [It's night raid!](http://i.imgur.com/VKByo4L.png)
* Or dream raid as it turns out
* THEY'VE GIVEN ASSHOLE CAT A NAME?
* AND THEY DRESS UP AS CATS?
* ...
* I'm keeping an eye out for the green haired cat that gave him those powers
* I really love the facial expressions the characters have in this show
* That mother knows what's up. Elevens should learn their place.
* Could that be a yuri relationship blossoming between glasses-kun and brain dead girl?
* You mean an honorable Britannian man meddled with a being of lesser status? Where is his shame? No wonder his new (and better) Britannian wife is mocking [these mongrels](http://hiphotos.baidu.com/kanonehilbert/pic/item/0c15f42309f790520729b3740cf3d7ca7acbd5fc.jpg)
* Asshole cat has got back to biting people
* Oh I can hear the jazzy saxophone playing
* Rejected!
* Yes...he decided on his own to be a slave...he has accepted that he is worthless beneath the feet of Britannians
* Ah, I'll never get sick of this
* **See** Britannia has made ~~Japan~~ Area Eleven a much better place
* Ooooh, they are on to him. Things are spicing up.
* Mobile police patlabor showing up to save the day
* If it takes that many shots to destroy the knightmare frame you might just need a better gun
* Wait she only just realized her mother was working there to be close to her? Maybe I labeled the wrong person "brain dead girl"
* Wouldn't be Code Geass without creepy green haired girl being ominous again

I must say a lot of the characters are a bit 'slow' in this series. Makes for amusing entertainment though. I'm also reveling in how much they are pushing the Britannian superiority episode after episode. I don't want it to end but Griffbat Zorlight West is going to have to start fucking shit up sometime soon. I shall continue to wave my non-existent Britannia flag until then. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt so sorry for Kallen's mom. Her daughter treated her like such a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Could you elaborate on the 'slow' part? I mean Kallen was clearly just in denial and both Euphemia and Suzaku are just hopeless idealists from what we've seen so far. But I think they, along with the rest of the cast, are pretty much exactly where they need to be.

I actually like Code Geass a lot for its world that feels alive even outside of the MCs immediate environment. People have their own agendas and don't just tag along with either of the major players because they're friends'n'shit.

On a side note: Maybe, if you keep waving that Britannian Flag long enough, a miracle will occur and it will **not** ultimately and inevitably fall by the hands of Zero.

>People have their own agendas

That's why I've started doing writeups for each character. It's nice to see Todo and Jeremiah dealing with the cards they're being dealt.

I dont like Kallen. I dont dislike Kallen. Shes always angry and serious. I think I might start enjoying her more if her attitude warms up a little now that she realizes her mother demeaned herself to be close to her daughter. Seems like that was something that was bothering her, and I'm surprised they brought it up and resolved it in just one episode.

Anyway, Kallen is the red haired child from the ED who got a 100 on their test? Ok. I thought that was a young boy, but it makes sense now. The two boys in the background are Naoto (her deceased brother) and Kaname (the resistance leader)?

Why the heck were all those people (Kallens mother, hot dog vendor) in the back of the warehouse? They were using drugs, but why did they group together like that at the location where all the drugs are being shipped from? Why not take the drugs home like one normally would?

And of course, CC still being mysterious.

But why a festival for that jerk cat? That's really happening? Alright then, at least [Cat Lulu](http://i.imgur.com/5O12PSv.jpg) is sort of adorable and makes snarky comments. And don't think we didn't see your [wink,](http://i.imgur.com/xBcQ6oU.jpg) Suzaku, you sly dog.

That's something I could never exactly put my finger on as well.
 
I guess one explanation would be that they had to go to the warehouse district to buy the drug anyway so why not directly take a little shot while they're there. They are massive junkies after all, so this kind of  behavior might be in the realm of possibilities.

It's like an opium den or heroin house. You can do the drug safely there and hide the habit from anyone in your household, away from kids/spouse/family.

Britain is too evil. Clovis destroyed a huge part of the town and killed thousands of civilians to get CC back. Cornelia did the same think to replicate the situation. What is wrong with them? They do not seem to care at all about civilian causalities. Suzaku might be a better person than Lelouch, but he is on the wrong side.

Turn 5 (I have homework, and Im doing this shit first. Clearly, my priorities are in the right order.)

* Before anything else, I just want to say that this episode solidified my eternal wish for them to make a lighthearted spin-off show with all of them just goofing around at the Academy; heck, even let Lelouch keep his Geass and use it for a bunch of goofy antics. I just want to see these characters having fun.

* Long live the Black Knights! Lets all celebrate with a group orgy! With only like five women!

* Youll keep the pilot a secret from me?! Yes, Kallen, because Lelouch has clearly shown in the past how much it hurts him to keep secrets from you.

* Stop saying weird stuff like that, alright?! Shes just missing a b-baka!

* Do you still want me to be the captain of Zeros personal force, like I have been? Well, Kallen, youre clearly the one the animators feel the need to shove your boobs and ass into every shot, so who am I to deny them?

* Well talk about Geass later. What made you think he was gonna ask about it? Is another one of the advantages of Code the ability to read ahead in the script?

* [She is literally just missing a baka here.](http://webm.land/media/yCrj.webm)

* Okay, go on. If I hadnt saved you, you would all be rotting in a landfill by now, so who gives a fuck if I left before? Be grateful, ya dicks.

* At least Tohdoh has some common sense and respect. GG, Military Spike. And Ohgi.

* Long time until opening credits this time around.

* [Excuse me, teacher, why is the Knight of Seven just happening to be transferred into our class with no explanation after a year of personally serving the Emperor?](http://webm.land/media/zMVD.webm)

* Actually, Lelouch, it wasnt so much the war that tore you two apart as it was Suzakus hypocritical thick-headedness, but I guess if you want to see it that way.

* Youd think such enemies and allies would have been able to recognize each other by their voices that they yell at each other at the top of their lungs, speaker interference be damned.

* I wonder how often people who are in conflict with each other happen to think the exact same things at the exact same time.

* So, Charles left peoples memories of Suzaku as a student intact. I guess they always had him returning as a back-up plan.

* When you heard the name Lelouch you just walked right to my side. This is right up there with the American vs German three from Inglorious Basterds.

* [Who drinks coffee through a straw?](http://i.imgur.com/tpq3XSH.jpg)

* Lelouch is a better actor than Light [Death Note](/s "unless you count when Light lost his memory, but even then L was suspicious.")

* [Arthur still fucking hates Suzaku.](http://webm.land/media/9slD.webm) Maybe he can smell the hypocrisy on him.

* Suzaku just wants an excuse to be able to kill Lelouch at this point. Are we sure /u/rascorpias British?

* It seems the student council is planning on throwing you a welcoming party. The last time there was a school festival we noticed a certain green-haired girl in an abnormally cute outfit appeared, so we need to find out what about that attracted her. Im guessing it was the pasta.

* Could Lelouch teach me how to take a contact in and out in one fluid motion like that? I dont actually wear contacts, but it would make for a cool trick.

* Why do locations inside Area 11 still have Japanese names?

* Im Gino Weinberg, the Knight of Three. Among other things I like to attack my own battle stations without warning, possibly cause harm to my own men, and destroy expensive government Knightmares for no other reason than Im cool. Now, bow, peasants.

* Gino, I know I have to exposition your background, but could you please not grope me while I do it?

* Anya: Because pretty much every anime needs an emotionless girl.

* Im not sure if Suzaku is keeping up an act, or if hes really just that bad in front of crowds.

* [Lelouch should have just recorded this and threated to air it publicly should Suzaku ever attempt to fight Zero again.](http://webm.land/media/alRk.webm)

* Holy shit! [More real horses!](http://i.imgur.com/kVBAVAU.jpg)

* Lelouch, I was trying to hold my knife so I could stab myself in the chest! I told you Suzakus death wish passed to me after you Geassed him.

* [Royalty attempting to pass herself off as a commoner.](http://webm.land/media/pxGC.webm)

* [Poor girl must have had to have been forcibly dragged away from the wall, mid-carve.](http://i.imgur.com/dNCHi0R.jpg) Probably spent the next several hours carving crosses on the foreheads of everyone within arms length.

* [Have you ever actually tasted pizza, Lelouch?](http://webm.land/media/ZeRg.webm) Its worth getting captured for.

* [Somewhere Ohgi just got boner that hes not sure where it came from.](http://i.imgur.com/P8bLPeO.jpg)

* Notice how Charles didnt make them forget Kallen. He was fine just letting them believe her to be a terrorist.

* [Just Just watch this a few times](http://webm.land/media/zdxq.webm)

* Has Earl Asplund happened to mention me? Oh, yeah, forgot they were engaged.

* Man, Arthur just loves making Suzakus life a living hell. He cant even hold on to Euphies keepsake with this cat around.

* And they finally confirm what many people have already figured out by now: V.V. gave Charles his Geass.

* [Too cute My heart cant take it](http://webm.land/media/SFLG.webm) I feel like Rolo throughout this whole scene. C.C. getting into shenanigans is just almost too much for me to bear. Of course, her being a Big Sister helps make the scene funny and adorable instead of painful and tragic.

* Dont worry, I came here to take Pizza Girl back. I have nothing for this. I just adore how theyre acknowledging it.

* [Obligatory.](http://i.imgur.com/rXCmahr.jpg)

* Gino is fucking great at the rich kid trying to fit in with the commoners guy.

* [Someone had to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hoSIPvYgQ8)

* So, somehow Xi knew about Viletta and Ohgi? And he only told C.C.? Ah, who cares? Now Lelouch has got Viletta fully on his side, as well (Even if much more openly dickish about it than with Rolo).

* Have I mentioned [hnnnnnnnng!](http://i.imgur.com/17fsuG4.jpg)

* [Poor Rivalz.](http://webm.land/media/oFK7.webm) #ForeverBadComicRelief

* Because of course the Emperor is just gonna give Japan, no questions asked. Im sure hell believe that request is totally arbitrary and not at all influenced on personal bias.

* By acquiring power, I will never again lose anyone else I care about. You should have learned from Lelouch by now, dude. Power wont save you from loss. In fact, it normally summons it.

* Im going to use my Geass of archetype reading to guess what runs through /u/rascorpias head here.
* * The new Viceroy whos coming to take charge of Area 11 next week.

* * YESYESYES PleaseCorneliapleaseCorneliapleaseCorneliapleaseCornelia

* * Hello, big brother?

* * OH, FUCK ME SIDEWAYS!!!!

* I wonder what Suzaku and Nunnally are thinking while Lelouch just stands there, narrating the next episodes preview.

Well, I adored that episode, and the cliffhanger is leaving us for quite the interesting situation next episode. Hope you all liked my Benny Hill crossover. I put a whole two seconds of effort into it!

I forgot what a major Pizza Hut episode this was. There has been Pizza Hut episodes in Geass before, but this was THE Pizza Hut episode!

And yeah, Kallen and Shirley really pushed the sexiness meter to maximum. The Dat Ass shot of Kallen is still remembered so many years later even from old time viewers!

Gino was fun as he always is. He's so unpredictable and it's funny seeing Lelouch constantly get surprised by him.

Really nice episode where Suzaku drops the bomb at Lelouch with a phone call to Nunnally as well. This really has implications to the rest of the series, without spoiling much.

Perfect.

I was also prepared for Cornelia's voice to come out of that phone, but getting Nunnally's is a big surprise.  Lelouch got shrekt and I have no idea how he gets out of this (although I'm sure it'll involve hurting the ones he loves).

>Why do locations inside Area 11 still have Japanese names?

Crushing the pride of the conquered is all well and dandy, but making up new names for everything in the country would be an administrative nightmare. And getting the locals to use all the new names would require a level of brutality and terror that even the Britannians would find excessive, not to mention how it would cut down the workforce.

>Im not sure if Suzaku is keeping up an act, or if hes really just that bad in front of crowds.

Yes.

> Poor girl must have had to have been forcibly dragged away from the wall, mid-carve.   Probably spent the next several hours carving crosses on the foreheads of everyone within arms length.

An interview stated that Carve-tan's family was amongst the people who left Area 11 after the Black Rebellion and returned to Britannia. Oh, and it confirmed that she's still under the effects of Lelouch's Geass, waking up every night in order to carve a mark into the wall of Ashford Academy. Of course, there is now an ocean between them.

>Too cute My heart cant take it   I feel like Rolo throughout this whole scene. C.C. getting into shenanigans is just almost too much for me to bear. Of course, her being a Big Sister helps make the scene funny and adorable instead of painful and tragic.

I just love how Lelouch doesn't miss a beat between noticing Shirley and shoving C.C. into the tomatoes. No hesitation.

>Someone had to do it.

Lelouch getting outrun by everyone - including Kallen in her costume and Milly in her dress - will never cease to amuse me.

>Because of course the Emperor is just gonna give Japan, no questions asked. Im sure hell believe that request is totally arbitrary and not at all influenced on personal bias.

Ah, but you forget: if there is one thing Charles zi Britannia approves of, it's personal bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Lelouch's utter lack of physicality is quite funny in these school life segments while it has some serious side in that if anyone really wanted to punch Lelouch's lights out or kill him, they can do it quite easily if he doesn't have a contingency ready for that. Which is why Suzaku is such a worthy foe to him, because Suzaku is so much more athletic and physically powerful than Lelouch and Lelouch does realize he has no chance in a realistic 1 vs 1 fight. 

But I love seeing him get foiled by Arthur at every turn. One of the smartest tacticians ever being outsmarted by a cat!

Fun episode that provided a bit of information, but is best summed up by a quote from Milly: Well, sometimes you just get these little filler incidents in life and thats fine!

**R2 Episode 5**

Its not just Kallen. Everyones taking their clothes off errr, well, just down to their underwear. Close enough.

Zero asks, Its not as if everyone knows about our relationship, do they? Kallen blushes Stop saying weird stuff like that, alright?" Just tell the guy already.

Ooooooh. Does CC have *new* Geass info or just a desire to talk about Rolo or something?

Todo and Ohgi standing by Zeros side. Nice. Glad Todo realizes the leader might have to withhold information at times, and even though Zero left them to be captured, hes still their best shot at restoring Japan. Also, Schneizel is in Europe? Wonder if Charles will eventually have to call everyone back to Japan in order to fight Zero.

Suzaku. The White Death. Cool name. Still likely a jerk. Im assuming hes not there to kill Lelouch, so what the hell do they need him alive for?

So they didnt Geass the entire school, they just replaced everyone (or only just the teachers?) except for Lelouchs close friends, aka the student council.

Same old Arthur.

Rolo asks, Should I kill him? This guy. Yeah, you know what? Do it. Kill Suzaku. It would make things sooooooo much easier in the long run, and you know Rolo could do it without anyone knowing.

[GD](http://www.gfycat.com/IdealisticTidyCrocodileskink) that [is one](http://www.gfycat.com/OptimisticSharpEarwig) cool [knightmare.](http://www.gfycat.com/SpiffyFlakyChamois) Gino really is quite likable.

[This freaking guy.](http://i.imgur.com/bw0IGUs.jpg) Wtf is he, an otter?

Rolo just wants to murder people, and I kind of love him for it. Then you have [Suzaku carrying around Arthur](http://i.imgur.com/fnLSC44.jpg) who is biting him. Why does he keep that cat? And of course, Rolos Geass has a weakness. What is it?

Typical teenage girl taking pictures with her cell phone thing. This show aired in 2008. Thats around the time iPhones became popular. Were they even popular in Japan? Or Japan just knew teenagers would want to record every little part of their day. They can predict the future! This doesnt even matter. Never mind.

This stuff was Ninas? [Who the heck is Beardface?](http://i.imgur.com/zNfcJgu.jpg)

Theres hope yet for the biggest pizza! And CC goes out in the open for it. Worth the risk, imo. And she called Lelouch devilish, and he called her a witch. They had a similar conversation back during the end of R1. I wonder if this will come into play thematically in a big way. The ED pictures have all those angels and fallen angels/demons.

[Well, hellllllloooooooo Coach.](http://i.imgur.com/IioAA6o.png)

You really went back and took her feather pen of all things, Suzaku? Bet you wouldnt like to find out that your dear Euphie used to love Lelouch.

Giant pizza, please. CC deserves some happiness in her long, miserable life.

CC knows VV. And Shirley interrupts any further conversation. Cmon, girl.

[He makes a second appearance!](http://i.imgur.com/B9VAjKB.jpg) And its Kallen. Obligatory [dat ass.](http://i.imgur.com/k001jNB.png) ^Ill ^allow ^it And I love how they [animated the costumes eyes.](http://www.gfycat.com/UnhealthyCarefulArrowana)

CC, in order to create the worlds largest pizza, you must be the main ingredient. Will you sacrifice yourself? [Of course you will.](http://www.gfycat.com/OptimisticDenseCanine)

Rivalz headset is blinking. Why?

Lelouch, your legs are long. Put them to use. Hes been skipping too many gym classes.

Yes! Lelouch planning ahead is the best. Smokescreen!

[Villetta, pull em up.](http://i.imgur.com/nhdhrVv.jpg) Or just let them fall all the way down. I dont care anymore. Ive seen your boobs anyway.

Rivalz got a big dance partner. Gino gets to dance with Milly. Lucky her. The guy seems like a joy to be around. Rivalz is lucky he probably wont be around much longer.

I didnt expect Nunnally to make her return like this. A viceroy?

And from the preview clips, JYB just embraces Lelouchs anger for Suzaku. Hes done a great job at playing a pissed off Lelouch the whole series.

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Heavy plot points. Im embracing it now.

Lelouchs not going to just kill Villetta, is he? He said Happy Birthday, so she would die on the same day she was born. But he also told Villetta to be reborn as someone knew. Lelouch cant Geass her, so is he just offering her a position within the Black Knights? Just like that? Hmmm, it didnt seem like Lelouch was going to let Ohgi get away with keeping a secret from him. Maybe hell bring the two together, but ultimately I dont know what hes going to do with these two. 

Uncle Li and Lelouch have been talking? They owe each other debts? For what, picking up CC and Kallen? Ooooh, did Li owe his nephew a debt for Geassing the eunuch? Doing that gave Li justifiable reason to kill him, I bet. Then Li says he doesnt like to be in collusion with Lelouch yet he still said he had an interest in the Black Knights then he attacked them then he was ok with them. This man is confusing me. Regardless, I guess Lelouch wants to set something up with China. Also, the [Beardface box](http://i.imgur.com/5LExQ26.jpg) was in the car with them. Was the box not actually Ninas? Rivalz was just talking about other nearby stuff. Beardface has to to be Diethard.

I think Nunnally might have been Geassed. Theres no way she would forgive her kidnappers, accept the family she ran away from, and then agree to be viceroy of Area 11. I cant remember if its been stated in the show so far, and worse, I cant remember if weve discussed this, so forgive my poor memory, but does Nunnally know everything that happened to her and Lelouch? That her mother was killed, that they were given away, that Lelouch hates most of their family, etc.

Whenever people call him overrated, I point them to his "angry Lelouch" and "laughing Lelouch" moments. The man is incredible.

>does Nunnally know everything that happened to her and Lelouch? That her mother was killed, that they were given away, that Lelouch hates most of their family, etc.

She'd better know her mother was killed, what with being in her arms when it happened, she remembers being sent away, but she doesn't know how much Lelouch despises his father and Britannia for it.

True. I thought maybe being that young and in shock might have caused her to repress/forget it. I wonder if she knows *why* they were sent away. Well, thanks for helping to clear that up.

Nunally is pretty much a saint. She's similar to Euphy in that regard, if not more extreme. Though it has to be said that while she certainly knows *what* happened, Lelouch never let her into the *why* and he was most certainly careful to never mention his hatred of his father or Britannia around her or even bring the topic of their family up at all.

**Episode 5: Knights of the Round**

- Everyone's stripping! Except for the femal  wait, no, there's at least one lady Black Knight in the background. They had undershirts. I'm almost surprised, given some of the other fanservice in the series.   
- Keeping another secret from Kallen, Lelouch? How many times are you going to do that before you worry she's had enough?  
- Lady four swords loves Tohdoh. Of course. But she doesn't love Zero. Can't really blame her.   
- Wow, what an inspiring speech, Lelouch.   
- Tohdoh just bailed your ass out, dude.   
- I just noticed that Kallen is crying in the OP. I wonder if that has any significance? Also, the loli Knights pilot makes this weird "dismayed" pose in her part, I'm wondering if something more is up with her. Probably not part-Japanese since Suzaku seems to be an outlier as a Number Knight, let alone Knight of the Round.   
- WB SUZAKU man Lelouch is not taking this well. Probably because the last time he saw Suzaku he was being betrayed to Emperor Chuck.   
- Oh, interesting. So my previous guess that Suzaku had been wiped from peoples' memories is totally wrong. Everyone remembers him, they probably just assumed he transferred out to go do Knights things.  
- Wait, how is that a screwup, that Suzaku recognized Lelouch? We literally JUST established that one of the memory things that wasn't fucked with was that Suzaku was an Ashford student, and that the Student Council knows him. why WOULDN'T he recognize Lelouch? I don't get this plot point.   
- Oh wow, so it's a completely different student body? This means they don't HAVE to Geass anyone else, and since Milly/Shirley/Rivalz didn't know Lelouch was a prince/was Zero, the only change that had to be made was Nunnally -> Rolo. That's a much more doable feat for Chuck.  
- That Rivalz guessed that Clovis was Zero was hilarious but also really interesting. It would make sense, wouldn't it? It'd explain how easily he 'killed' Clovis, Clovis was pretty theatrical like Zero is... I bet that this theory would pop up all the time on alternate Britannia Reddit /r/conspiracy.   
- Fuck yes, Arthur. Best cat.    
- Rolo's loyalties are really shifting now. He's not sure what to do at all. Makes sense.   
- No Rolo you can't just kill people jesus christ what's wrong with you. You never just want to go get a Blizzard, you always want to kill somebody.     
- Blond Knight seems fun already. I hope he's not a douche. I want to love his Knightmare but the color scheme makes it look like a kid's toy.   
- Gino? His name is Gino. I'm sorry, but this sounds like he should be a heavyset italian man living in New Jersey.   
- Lloyd is coming next week! I'm more excited than I should. Also, I like that Arthur is following Suzaku around like a puppy.   
- Good fucking lord, Gino is tall.   
- Seriously, I can't get a read on Gino. Either this is genuine and he's going to be a good guy on the "villain" side, or he's going to turn out to be terrifyingly ruthless.   
- Why does your loli flightsuit bare your navel, loli Knight?   
- I really liked Lelouch in the potato peeling scene. He is just wrapping Rolo around his fingers. Aww, Arthur sleeping in Suzaku's arms and NOT biting him.  
- I wonder what Rolo's downside is.   
- I would be happy if Gino and loli Knight became more regular characters, they seem fun.  
- Those belong to Nina, there goes my theory that Nina was erased from their minds. I GUESS EVERYONE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING except the stuff they don't.
- CC prioritizes pizza over safety. A girl after my own heart.  
- With all the surveillance around the campus, wouldn't they notice lelouch walking around with a girl with a bag on her head?   
- Good lord, Villetta. One wrong step and you're flashing everyone.    
- Interesting that Milly is sympathizing with Kallen, or at least understanding her. And teasing Arthur with a... riding crop? Kinky.  
- Yep, everyone still remembers Nina. Good for you, Nina.    
- Awww, Arthur.   
- God dammit, Arthur.   
- It's interesting that nobody questions that Suzaku is carrying around a token of affection from the now-surely-disgraced princess who ordered a massacre.   
- So VV gave Chuck his Geass. Rolo too, perhaps?   
- Hi, Kallen.   
- Hi, Kallen's ass.   
- I don't know why, but the line "cats and tomatoes don't mix" had me giggling.   
- Oh, Gino. I like you already.    
- Poor Rivalz. Never gets to do his thing.   
- See CC this is why you should never have come out in the first place.   
- They're never going to get to actually make the pizza, are they?   
- I wonder why loli Knight is recording everything? Does Villetta not recognize Kallen?   
- Yeah you don't like it when YOU'RE the one in the dark, do you Lelouch?    
- Rolo's finally turned, it seems. And now Villetta is the one in a bind.    
- Wasn't Captain China JUST attacking them barely over two episodes ago? Was that all really just a gambit to take down the eunuch?   
- Does it annoy anyone else how the dub pronounces his name Xing-kay? It should be more like Xing-kuh.   
- Gino, you are TALL.   
- Haha Rivalz sucks to be you.    
- Ohhhh, interesting plan, Suzaku. It's nice to finally see where he's coming from instead of just "trying to get power."   
- OH SHIT   
- LELOUCH YOU JUST GOT FUCKING REKT BY SUZAKU     

Man, that ending was super unexpected. Well fucking played, Suzaku. But wait, that makes me wonder about how that even works? Did Charles just announce to the world "and oh right, we had a princess who everyone thought was dead, well she's alive now!" And the other members of the royal family won't even wonder about what happened to Lelouch?

Unless, that is, Charles used Geass on the entire royal family to make them forget Nunnally ever had an older brother. Hmmm.

I'm also really interested by loli Knight, whose name is actually Anya so I should probably start using it. I wonder what her deal is? 

Zany speculation time: Given that she's a Rei Ayanami expy and we already have Spike Spencer as Rolo, I'm going to say that Anya is actually a clone of Marianne the Flash to harness her unparalleled Knightmare piloting abilities, and Charles and Schneizel are working together to turn the world into tang.

Slightly more grounded speculation: Could Anya be a Gundam-esque tykebomb character, raised in a lab from a young age to be a super soldier? (Think Lalah, the Extended, Soma and Hallelujah, etc) And all of her diary-making is her trying to make sense of the world around her because she grew in a laboratory.

Milly used to know Lelouch and Nunally were Royals, it was the Ashfords who gave them asylum and helped them hid their identities after the Second Pacific War.


>> ARTICLE

Also Clovis "died" just before Zero announced himself so it makes a lot of sense in-universe.

Sadist in hiding, maybe?

> Those belong to Nina, there goes my theory that Nina was erased from their minds. I GUESS EVERYONE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING except the stuff they don't.

I was a little disappointed by that. So is Nunnally-Rolo the only thing altered for everyone?

> Does Villetta not recognize Kallen?

Did they ever run into each other outside of their Knightmares? After Villetta lost her memory, gi kept her away from the Black Knights.

> Could Anya be a Gundam-esque tykebomb character, raised in a lab from a young age to be a super soldier?

I'll buy that. Not so much the tang theory.
>> ARTICLE
I really do love the Zero-is-Clovis theory, I can see it making PERFECT sense in-universe. I wonder what alternate universe Britannian reddit is like. 

As /u/Arcvalons pointed out below, Milly knew Lelouch and Nunnally were royal, so that was wiped from her mind at least. It does make sense though, logically; you'd want to change as few things as possible so that there are as few points of failure as possible. Think of how Lelouch Geass'd Shirley; if he'd only removed the night where she found out he was Zero he'd have been scot free, but he took way more than that. 

Good point about Villetta.

I don't know why but this made me chuckle for some unknown reason D: 

Now all we need is Charles striking the Gendo pose.

I think that royal family members may be unknown, especially those under 18.

How old was Clovis when he died? He had a grand state funeral, presumably televised through all of Britannia.
>> ARTICLE
I'd give him 30-35 maybe?
>> ARTICLE
a quick glance at the wiki shows him as 24 and Schneizel 28. Oh, Sunrise ages.

Still, you could be right, which would explain why the Ashford kids didn't recognize two royal children at their school. But Euphy was only 16 and sub-viceroy, wasn't she?

I could definitely imagine that the royal kids are kept from the wider public until 12, 13 though. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember Euphy was getting ready to present herself to society, and she did that after finishing schoolbor something.

The Emperor has more important things to do than Geass that many people. Makes things easier to redo a few people's memories. I wonder what the hell happened to all the people they replaced. Dead? Did they have to redo their memories anyway? And where did they get the new people from? Their memories would likely have to be altered too. Maybe he did Geass a whole bunch of people.

> Blond Knight seems fun already. I hope he's not a douche. I want to love his Knightmare but the color scheme makes it look like a kid's toy.

I'm loving Gino. He's always in a good mood. Hopefully he doesn't turn out to be some sort of maniac. And that color scheme, kind of bright and flashy like his personality. It does look like a toy though.

> Aww, Arthur sleeping in Suzaku's arms and NOT biting him.

Idk. Arthur was sleeping in his arms later on, but in that scene it looked like he was [biting him.](http://i.imgur.com/fnLSC44.jpg)

> Did Charles just announce to the world "and oh right, we had a princess who everyone thought was dead, well she's alive now!" And the other members of the royal family won't even wonder about what happened to Lelouch?

Didn't even think of that. I wonder if Nunnally will actually get to be viceroy or if it was just some sort of lie/trap set up by Suzaku/Charles.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so Arthur is, huh. I don't think Arthur dislikes Suzaku at all anymore, I think that biting him is how he shows his love. 

I'm assuming that Nunnally knows she's going to be viceroy, and I see no reason for them to just lie to her like that. I think Chuck/Suzaku correctly see it as a huge trap to Lelouch: Can you keep rebelling against the Britannian leadership of Area Eleven when the Britannian leader is the sister you're doing this all for? 
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Biting is how he expresses his love.

As for Nunnally, I see what you're saying. I guess it goes back to your original question then about how they'll explain a long lost/deceased royal family member is now back and in power. I would think the royal family tree is information that would be available to everyone in the empire. They can't claim she's someone new.
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen how many siblings Lelouch has? Charles could just say he fucked some hot broad on the side and has finally decided to pay alimony.
>> ARTICLE
But Lelouch and Nunnally are known. At least to Euphemia and Cornelia, which probably means Schneizel, Clovis et al. The narrative was that they'd died, wasn't it? Which is why Euphy was so glad to realize Zero was Lelouch. 

Edit: Cornelia was Marianne's bodyguard *the day she was killed* and Nunnally crippled. There's no way the royal family doesn't know Lelouch and Nunnally.

It's an orgy! Or they're just changing into their Black Knight uniforms again. I'm sure there are at least a few disappointed people in the crowd though.

Lelouch and his secret-keeping. Not surprised, but Kallen apparently rolls with it now. Who's the random kid that apparently has a crush on her?

Hey, they're asking the right questions of Zero. And he... doesn't have a good answer. That's too bad, but Td and gi are with him and we're right back to how things were before the rebellion failed horribly. No consequences for Lelouch yet again.

Suzaku's back! And he's just going to sit next to Lelouch, 'kay.

[Maps!](http://i.imgur.com/KxWq4Xd.png) Missing the Great Lakes though. The Second Pacific War? Wonder what the first one was. Despite the Philippines not marked as Britannian they have a base there... and they advanced through the Chinese Federation? I'm guessing that's just an error. Overall it reminds me of World War II to a degree.

Huh, rumors that Zero was Clovis? That's kinda neat. Also amused that he might have been some foreign prince.

Rolo is weirdly attached to Lelouch already. "Suzaku's gonna be a problem, want me to kill him?" Kid, you've got more issues than Weekly Shnen Jump.

Guilford disappeared? Wonder what happened there.

Oooh, that annoying Knight of the Round. He's piloting a Transformer, neat. Gino and Tristan, got it. And Anya with Mordred, like the theme with the mech names. So do their titles reflect their rank? Suzaku's the Knight of Seven, Gino's the Knight of Three. Wonder which one Arya is and what her deal is.

Another random festival. Milly likes her festivals. Anya's recording everything, I wonder why. [Nina's stuff?](http://i.imgur.com/2npyuIC.png) Hm... Beard face? I can't think of anyone there that has a beard.

World's biggest pizza, attempt #2! CC wouldn't miss this for anything.

Gratuitous fanservice! You'd think the swim club would have fewer girls with that much... drag. Ganymede? Nina's working on something fun.

No surprise that VV gave Charles his Geass. There's the slight chance that CC and VV *aren't* immune to powers granted by the other one, but I'm guessing they're both unaffected to all of them.

Dude, you don't just knock a girl into a giant vat of tomatoes. Oh no, poor Shirley. Turn around and walk away before he hurts you again.

Kallen bringing even more gratuitous fanservice, and then everything gets silly. Milly even lampshades it at the end.

Hm.. so the other Black Knights thought that Villetta had been reporting to gi while she had really just lost her memory and he was hiding her. And now Lelouch can use that to blackmail her, so she obviously can't tell anyone that Lelouch has his memory back and Rolo's gone rogue. Not bad.

Was right about the Knights of the Round rankings. And Nunnally's coming back as viceroy! Can't say I was expecting that but I'm all for it. That's a fantastic trap, Suzaku, I approve.

[Wild speculation turn 05](/s "Nina reveals Ganymede, which is actually a time traveling Knightmare. She promptly activates it and vanishes, presumably looking for Euphemia. Meanwhile, Milly is stolen away by Gino as he probably outranks Lloyd, who never cared for her anyway. Rivalz is mildly depressed by that until Anya comforts him and they start dating.")

I'd agree that they're probably fully immune. I'd still love to know just who the hell those two are, but we'll get there. And while it may not have been too surprising, we now know VV can give Geass. I wonder if he was the one to give it to Rolo, perhaps at the request of Charles.
>> ARTICLE
> No consequences for Lelouch **yet again**.

I wouldn't say that. I mean, sure he was extremely lucky that the board had been reset thanks to Charles' desire to draw out C.C., but throughout the entire first season he was facing consequences left and right for pretty much everything he did.

Arguing in the current thread is really eating into my episode-watching time. The one at night and one in the morning thing works decently though.

This should be interesting. Oh right, I forgot about Charles talking about inequalities.Neat mirror trick to Geass him to die but... wait, that *worked*?

Ah, there's Suzaku's conscience. Good, you're better than Lelouch and you need to remember that.

What's with the talk of destiny? CC and VV both. Ah, I'm guessing VV gives up his immortality to Charles. Yep, that's probably what happened as bullets stopped working.

Or Charles *took* it from VV along wuth the other powers of the Code. Huh, didn't know that was a thing that could be done. Also I'm betting Lelouch will do the same with CC before the end of the series.

[Hey, those masks!](http://i.imgur.com/Oo6uq4v.png) Neat, though it looks like some of them are mirrored so that they'd cover the right eye instead of the left, so there goes the symbolism I was looking for previously.

Come on, Villetta, it's really not that bad to love someone regardless of whom it is. gi may be foolish for still loving Villetta, but he has my respect. ...and Sayoko's just eavesdropping. Diethard had his concerns, after all.

[I thought those masks looked familiar.](http://zeldawiki.org/images/thumb/c/cc/MM3D_Mask_of_Truth.png/120px-MM3D_Mask_of_Truth.png) And they're even doling out truths to Lelouch.

And finally the contract details come out. The harsh existence of immortality, you can't die even if you want to.

Nunnally has the same blind-girl-lie-detector as Toph! Schneizel's still using her though. Suzaku, you just lied about not lying to her and now she wants to know about her big brother. Nice job losing the princess.

Sayoko, you really don't understand relationships. Just let them talk it out and then you can get with the stabby later. But no, you had to go and (probably nearly but not quite) kill gi there.

CC's memories, huh. Not an alien, just a poor girl that wanted to live back in what looked like the medieval era. Her Geass made people love her? I almost called it [with my speculation about Nina getting a similar Geass effect](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33uo5w/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqoil3s) back near the beginning of the season. She just wanted to be loved... and the similar process of losing trust in everyone around her.

The double-eye Geass is just the next stage of the power, scratch my theory about both VV and CC with Charles then. She was used, and in turn decided to use Lelouch to gain her freedom as well. [So this is the famed World of C,](http://i.imgur.com/7wp22cf.png) her memories. So when she told Mao she'd see him there, she only meant as a fragment of her past, presumably?

Opened.. the Thought Elevator? "This area of space itself is a system for disrupting thought." I don't get it.

[Charles is going to kill CC?](http://i.imgur.com/zxnvFVQ.png) How? I didn't think she gave up her immortality to Lelouch.

"She's my..." Yes, answer that, Lelouch. What *is* she to you? Your immortal witch? Something else? Might as well make use of that giant mech and save the woman.

[Nina just invented the nuke.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJM4UhbQ7A) Damocles, eh? Interesting name choice there.

Congratulations Lelouch, there's another girl who doesn't remember who you are now. In this case it looks like she's reverted to her pre-Geass memories entirely. I'm losing faith in the writers for using this damn trope yet again.

Probability Lelouch kissing CC to restore her memories: 80%.

---
How can Charles be sealed away? I don't get it.

Lelouch, don't be an ass to CC. The poor girl doesn't know any better. "I won't harm you in any way." I foresee that backfiring very soon. I'm amused that [Jeremiah's call sign is Orange](http://i.imgur.com/hWLBI7C.png) but I wouldn't expect anything else.

[Cornelia bringing the fanservice today.](http://i.imgur.com/NyG2HO1.png) She's understandably upset by Lelouch claiming that he just wants to save *his* little sister.

More dissent from the Black Knights. I think Td may have a splinter faction before this is all said and done.

I love Kallen fighting back against Suzaku. "You think you can just act like a good guy and then stop when it suits you?" Preach! At least Suzaku knows that he majorly screwed up there.

The United Federation of Nations: see, Lelouch, you *can* do good things without committing atrocities. [World map time!](http://i.imgur.com/aQLe2ka.png) (Screenshot from later in the episode because it's a better view of the same map.) What's the deal with Australia? Have they somehow retained independence from all major powers? Also Europe is once again a battlefront and that pink area covering Iran/Iraq is intriguing.

Poor CC doesn't even know what a TV is, this world must be frightening. At least there's pizza. [Milly's bringing her antics to the silver screen now,](http://i.imgur.com/0PC9XCt.png) I like that we keep getting updates on her.

Something *is* off about Anya. She might be Geassed as I suspected, but could be more to it than that. I wonder if Suzaku will do some investigating into her past.

[And here we have a clear antagonist.](http://i.imgur.com/qbPpEIO.png) I guess we needed another asshole to make the actions of our protagonists more palatable. The Knight of One's bringing the big guns in, wonder what Galahad's special ability is. Schneizel's not underestimating Zero here.

Bradley asserting his asshole status with Kallen, just in case it wasn't clear before. Gino provides a nice counterbalance there.

[Cecile is so cute here.](http://i.imgur.com/23jrQiM.png) I love when someone starts gushing about something they have a passion for. I'm guessing that this souped-up Gurren is only going to return to Kallen's possession before too long.Nina wants to mount a WMD on Suzaku, naturally. Well, his mech, but I don't think she'd miss him too much should he get annihilated along with his people. [Oh Lloyd.](http://i.imgur.com/8p2pHLQ.png) He knows his boundaries.

Come on, CC, [you need to stop being too adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/qL4nvOI.png) You might make me start thinking that Lelouch *isn't* a heartless bastard. Tamaki's again being insensitive but I'm sure he just started rumors about CC being pregnant, and even that one woman wants to confess to Td. I'm afraid one or both of them will die before that happens, just because it's looking like that kind of series.gi's still alive and well, good to see. Wonder what happened to Villetta though...

Poor Rivalz, all alone after Milly graduated and Shirley was murdered. The rest of them are either soldiers or rebels.

Why is Jeremiah calling Guilford? Either a potential hostage exchange (they have Cornelia and want Kallen back) or maybe he's a spy after all. I missed if there was any dialogue exchanged between them so feel free to clarify if I missed something.

The UFN are basically under Zero's thumb, as expected, but giving him all of their military resources as well doesn't seem like the best idea.

Hey, if Zero can hack the broadcast feed so can Charles, I approve. Challenge issued! Now it's a formal war rather than a rebellion.

Aaaand there's the attack on CC I was expecting. Nice job, Lelouch, I know you're stressed but you're just making yourself look worse here. [Lelouch has clearly forgotten what friends are.](http://i.imgur.com/Q43HYfR.png)

Suzaku knows what's up here. I wonder what his plan is for meeting Lelouch alone?

[Wild speculation turn 13](/s "Lelouch brings Jeremiah to de-Geass Suzaku so he can immediately issue him another command: protect Nunnally. Meanwhile, Schneizel decides to overthrow Charles and tries to put Lelouch on the throne while controlling him from behind the scenes with Nunnally. Suzaku is mildly depressed by that until Nunnally comforts him and they start dating.")
>> ARTICLE
> Wild speculation

[WST13](/s "You've convinced me about the Suzaku re-geass. I don't think Schneizel would betray Charles though, at least not willingly. Suzaku has thoughts for no one but Euphy. I think if Suzaku does get re-geassed, not having the command to 'live' will play a huge part in how he dies.")
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting seeing how people react based on their preconceptions of the characters. When I watched Geass for the first time, I saw Suzaku smashing the vial of Refrain after realizing how much he's become like Lelouch and Lelouch apologizing to CC after realizing how much he's become like Charles as obvious parallels. They both have an "Oh my god, what have I become" moment when they realize they're unthinkingly acting like the very thing they hate, and this is what precipitates their agreement to a meeting  to set aside their past quarrels and solve things together.

However, people who hate Lelouch and/or Suzaku tend to view the character they like as "oh, he apologized/oh, he didn't drug her, this shows he's a good guy at heart" and the character they don't like as "this is unforgivable, you monster".
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch has a history of doing terrible things before this point, while Suzaku has been relatively clean and there are lines he hasn't crossed.
>> ARTICLE
Suzaku has the same moral attitude as a concentration camp officer in Nazi Germany  it doesn't matter what you do so long as you follow orders. He has supported a violent, merciless and discriminatory regime simply because he views never disobeying orders as more important than actually doing what's right, and futilely clings to the idea that he can make things better from inside the system if he just appeases his masters enough.

Don't get me wrong, Lelouch is a horrible person who's done some pretty terrible things (although the worst of them were almost all unforeseen consequences or downright accidental). But Suzaku is hardly some kind of moral paragon either.

Perhaps CC isn't an alien, but I'm still not 100% convinced that Code and Geass didn't originate from another planet, or after these episodes, another world/reality. I'll have to wait on seeing who exactly God is, and also what the deal is with the picture of all those children with the Geass symbols.

> Opened.. the Thought Elevator? "This area of space itself is a system for disrupting thought." I don't get it.

Neither do I. It was confusing. All I could think of was that it allowed Lelouch and CC to share thoughts telepathically like CC and Marianne have been doing. Though I don't know how Charles would know Lelouch activated something like that. I guess just because he was able to come back from World of C or wherever he was gave it away.

> More dissent from the Black Knights. I think Td may have a splinter faction before this is all said and done.

It's seriously nearing the time when more people than you can count on two hands find out the truth about Britannia and Geass. Everyone would be confused at first, maybe mad that Zero hid it from them all along, but how could they not realize that it's a threat worth fighting together against?

Given that we keep getting the imagery of the cult and some other planet I'm inclined to agree with you.

> It's seriously nearing the time when more people than you can count on two hands find out the truth about Britannia and Geass. 

I'd like to see that. You're right that it would be a good uniting cause. Maybe Lelouch is waiting for someone else to reveal his identity before using it as a trump card?

Eh, I didn't like it too much. Especially with the level of fanservice Geass usually pulls, it felt uncomfortable and kind of creepily exploitative. Like here, we're going to give you this super hot but incredibly submissive moe girl who will do whatever you order her to do! She's already stripping!

Like she was meant to be on a body pillow. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a little weird. Lelouch always makes stupid jokes though. "Kill all Japanese" and "Sing with your clothes inside out."

Still, I thought the CC situation made enough sense. She's now supposed to be a little girl again. She was someone who always wanted others to love her, and combine that with the slave aspect and you get someone who is willing to do anything to please her masters.

You really don't think so? To have someone, this formerly intelligent woman reduced to a terrified slave who is completely obedient, all *goshujin-sama~* ? I mean, she essentially has the mind of a child now, but the fanservice T&A this show usually gives its adult non-Nunnally women. Together it's just... eugh.

If it weren't for the fanservice it wouldn't be so bad. But I really didn't like it.

That's not the kind of "Oh, boy..." I meant.

You do realize that this entire series is supposed to make you uncomfortable right? Everything is morally ~~ambiguous~~questionable and it is quite literally about genocide and massacring entire peoples and destroying free will.

This sequence of events makes narrative sense and fits into the overall story. It wasn't thrown in as random fanservice. Frankly it should be less disturbing than Lelouche being able to order people around with no resistance and what he can do with that power.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that it wasn't uncomfortable. For me I just didn't mind it because it *did* make narrative sense. It also wasn't too fanservicey for me, especially not compared to those Kallen ass shots from back at the beginning of R2.

So was it a little weird? Sure, but it's just another part of the story I'm watching, so whatever.

So much info all at once. Good god.

**Episode 15**

Plotting against her?

How did he have those mirrors? No way. No way Charles is dead. Thatd be crazy.

Suzaku resisting the dark side.

How did Charles steal VVs immortality? And VV loved Marianne?

Ok. So Charles is immortal, but he cant use Geass anymore.

Im a Britannian BaronAss.

Charles really hates lies. He also talks about one being in the past, the future. Is he talking about the god hes trying to kill?

Is CC actually here or is this an illusion? She must be there. Why is she just giving up *now*? She wants to end her existence in all worlds?

The user takes the position of the one who granted them the power.

Code is having immortality. Alright so is Code Geass having both immortality and Geass?

CCs going to die and Charles is going to kill her. Why? To take her place?

Nunnally pulling rank, nice.

Schneizel making moves.

Suzaku, if you do nothing else, just protect Nunnally.

Ohgi!

CC made people love her. The only one she could be with to avoid her powers was the one who gave her Geass. Just like Mao.

Now she has Geass in both eyes, and shes calling her Geass giver sister. So maybe VV isnt actually Charles brother. And why is CC naked?

So Lelouch is just a tool? He definitely means a little more than that to CC.

Is this World of C or just some strange illusion world?

Was CC forced into killing her Geass giver or did she truly do it through her own will? I know she was tricked into getting the Geass and whatnot, but it didnt look like she wanted to kill that woman.

Ok, what? The thought elevator is for interfering with thought. So now Lelouch can talk to CC? Is that why CC has been able to talk to Marianne?

CC, dont die. Lelouch will love you!

Nina bombs. Schneizel has Nina bombs.

Charles you DICK! Oh no, wait, he doesnt have Geass anymore. He didnt rewrite her memories. Looks like she reverted to her young self.

**Episode 16**

Gino showing more best guy colors by standing up for Nunnally. Hate that moley sea green bitch.

How the heck is Charles trapped? Did destroying those columns disrupt the power flow or something causing the door to stay shut?

Kiss her, Lelouch. Give her her memories back.

[Helloooo Cornelia.](http://i.imgur.com/zuDPCIJ.jpg) Seriously though guys, shes your hostage not your play thing.

United Federation of Nations! *gasp*

Damn, thats one fancy pizza. CCs like a wild animal. [She still loves pizza though.](http://www.gfycat.com/HastyHelplessAssassinbug)

Hmmmm, so the Emperor Geassed Anya? That would explain all of her recording.

Knight Bradley is a dick And hes everywhere. Leave Nunnally and Kallen alone. Here comes Gino. True best guy is here to save Kallen.

Suzakus been struggling a bit lately with whats right and wrong. Hes not going to kill 11s.

Tamakis a funny guy, and is that Sayoko cosplaying Ohgi?

Poor Rivalz is all alone.

Nope. Sayoko is with Rolo, so I guess Ohgi is still alive. Villetta, who knows?

Sorry Britannia, the world hates you. The Black Knights are now a PMC, and theyre coming for you.

Charles, wtf? Surprised he didnt just out Zero for being a Britannian prince. He gave Lelouch crap about hiding behind a mask and lying to everyone. He couldve ruined for Lelouch everything right then and there.

Lelouch. Cmon man. She was offering you the last piece of pizza. Thats so nice of her Good. Show her some kindness. Good, good.

Uh oh. Bloody chess piece.

Lelouch. Its time. Tell Suzaku everything. Remind him why youre doing this. Tell him the truth about Charles and Geass.

**Post Episode(s) Thoughts**

So many questions. Im glad we finally have substantial information, but it was all dumped on us at once. Theres a lot to think about.

The user takes the position of the one who granted them the power. So there is a never ending cycle of immortality. I wonder how far back in time this goes and how the original person/people gained immortality. Perhaps it was just the god that Charles is planning on killing.

Did CC make a contract with Charles or is he capable of killing CC because of the power he acquired on his own? The contract doesnt actually matter. Lelouch wasnt the only one who could kill CC. Anybody who has enough power can do it. It just so happens Charles is the only other one to reach that level of power.

So then why would Charles even bother to kill her? I thought he took VVs immortality already. Would CC just die or would Charles also get even more power from her? Maybe hes just doing it to mess with Lelouch. Would there be consequences for Lelouch since he wasnt able to fulfill his end of the contract? Maybe hed lose his Geass. Perhaps Im thinking of the contract as too supernatural whereas its actually just a spoken agreement.

Come to think of it, why the heck was the Emperor trying to capture CC this entire time? He already has immortality thanks to VV, no? Episode 15 made CC seem so human yet I cant help but feel like theres so much more to her. Charles was trying so hard to catch her only to kill her. I dont buy it. What power was he going to acquire by killing her? If Charles would get power from her, why would CC just allow herself to be killed? Shed be making things so much harder for everyone still alive, including Lelouch who she seemed to like. I guess she just really doesnt care. Shes just tired of being alive and tired of the suffering that follows her wherever she goes.

There was talk of multiple worlds. Does CC exist in other places? She wanted to die an all worlds. Is that just her way of stating how badly she wants to die or could there be other planets/timelines?

[thoughts on the future](/s "I have no freaking idea. I tried coming up with something cohesive, but every scenario raised so many questions as to why that would happen or it was just quickly shot full of holes. How about random events that arent too intricate? 1) Either Charles or Lelouch will have both Code and Geass by the end of series and become the most powerful person to ever live. 2) Lelouch will speak with his mother through CC now that he has activated the thought elevator. 3) In order to get to Lelouch, Charles reveals everything to Nunnally who is devastated. He gives her Geass thinking it will manifest in a way that will help him destroy Lelouch. However, Nunnally is such a sweetheart that even if she thinks what Lelouch has done is horrible, she still loves him. Her Geass manifests in some magically happy way and she ends up helping Lelouch. 4) Marianne will have an incredibly impactful significance on the way the series turns out since she has been MIA for 40 episodes. Not sure how she does it, but her wisdom/actions will help save the world.")

Thats all I have for now. So much more to learn still. Give me Marianne already!

> Tamakis a funny guy, and is that Sayoko cosplaying Ohgi?

Ooh, I hadn't even thought of that! I'm not sure what she's gain from it, but it's an intriguing possibility and entirely plausible.
>> ARTICLE
There was a scene soon after that where Sayoko was seen walking with Rolo. I originally thought that Ohgi had died, and in order to keep it covered up for a little, Sayoko put on the Ohgi mask.

Darn! I'm not a huge Ohgi fan, so I would have been up for some shenanigans there. I'm sure the eventual blowback when Zero found out would have been huge.

Thanks for debunking!

I really thought that this was a nice touch by the writers gives a sense of history repeating itself.

> shes calling her Geass giver sister.

Her geass giver is a nun, that's why she's calling her sister.

> Alright so is Code Geass having both immortality and Geass?

Don't think too hard about the title of the show.

> And why is CC naked?

Fan service.  The answer to this is always fan service.

> Kiss her, Lelouch. Give her her memories back.

Even if it were that simple could you imagine how awkward Lelouch would be about it?

> is that Sayoko cosplaying Ohgi?

Nope that's the real McCoy.

> Sorry Britannia, the world hates you.

Finally someone recognizes the real bad guy that is the oppressive Empire taking over territories and subjugating their native peoples.  Think about it Japan is Area 11 so there's at least 10 other countries that've had that treatment, yet people think Lelouch is the worst guy here...

> Knight Bradley is a dick

You are far too kind.

> Hes not going to kill 11s.

Do Black Knights not count as Japanese?

> Lelouch. Its time. Tell Suzaku everything. Remind him why youre doing this. Tell him the truth about Charles and Geass.

Yup

> So then why would Charles even bother to kill her?

He's doing her a favor.  He's granting her wish, they've known each other for awhile remember the flashback to 1997?

> Is that just her way of stating how badly she wants to die or could there be other planets/timelines?

She just really wants to die.

> thoughts on the future

Some really interesting stuff here, won't comment on accuracy, but I will say I love reading first timers theories and predictions.  It's great to see how you folks formulate theories and ideas about the show at the rate we're going.  I am kind of envious in a way since I never gave myself that chance since I just binge watched each season after about episode 13 each time.  Damn my lack of self control.
>> ARTICLE
> yet people think Lelouch is the worst guy here...

I think that Charles and the Empire as a whole are worse. But that doesn't mean Lelouch can fall to a few feet above them and claim he's doing *good* for it.
>> ARTICLE
> I think that Charles and the Empire as a whole are worse. But that doesn't mean Lelouch can fall to a few feet above them and claim he's doing good for it.

Agreed.  I think Lelouch can ultimately be described as a bad person who's trying to do a good thing.  In a lot of ways he's similar to Kiritsigu Emiya in that they both have no qualms about doing terrible things for what they determine to be the greater good.  Basically in this series Lelouch is the lesser of two evils.

Good comparison with Kiritsugu, who I never liked either. I'm with Saber regarding him, except she didn't have a choice but to obey.

I... am an idiot. Right over my head.

> He's doing her a favor. He's granting her wish, they've known each other for awhile remember the flashback to 1997?

So then the four of them (VV, Charles, CC, Marianne) are an interesting group. Maybe when we learn more about that some answers will finally come to light.

> Some really interesting stuff here, won't comment on accuracy, but I will say I love reading first timers theories and predictions.

Thanks. This anime is probably the most, idk how to really put this, intricate? In depth? There's just a lot going on. Even this far into the series I still have no idea how it's going to end. Quite a ride. This of course makes it hard to think up predictions, but I might as well try.
>> ARTICLE
> The only one she could be with to avoid her powers was the one who gave her Geass. Just like Mao.

Lelouch is getting there too. He already wears one mask or another when dealing with people most of the time.

> Sorry Britannia, the world hates you. The Black Knights are now a PMC, and theyre coming for you.

Britannia's half the world, the Black Knights represent the other half. Aside from Australia, that is, the Switzerland of Code Geass.

I honestly have no idea what the deal is with Charles and CC now. I'd watch that episode again but I don't think it would help any.

>  So much more to learn still. Give me Marianne already!

Yeah, I think she still has a role to play in this. Strong Harry Potter vibes right now.
>> ARTICLE
That's true about Lelouch and the mask. This also made me remember he wasn't wearing his contact for most of the time he was with CC. Was he not worried that he could Geass her? I wonder if this is significant at all to prove that CC still has her powers, that she can't be Geassed.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot to mention that! Yes, I think CC still has her powers and the lack of accidental Geassing is proof for that. Her bleeding at the end is misleading because she was shot in the first episode and it seemed like she bled to death then. Her memories are just locked away like Lelouch's were at the beginning of the season. Still expecting him to kiss her to reawaken her just like she did with him.
>> ARTICLE

I see we're in agreement.

>> ARTICLE
Here's my reactions! I have one more day where I'll be working come 4 PM EST, and then on Friday/the weekend I'll be good to finish the series! 


**Episode 15: The Cs' World**

- I think it's interesting the four figures shown in repetition at the beginning of the OP. Nunnally, Schneizel, Suzaku, CC. All of whom are incredibly important to Lelouch in some way: His sister, the reason he's doing it; his brother, his potentially greatest foe; his former best friend, now lethally hated enemy; his mysterious benefactor, his partner.       
- The confrontation we've all been waiting for! ...ten episodes too early, which makes me think this isn't going to be final at all!     
- This is the exact opposite of "whoever blinks, loses." Whoever looks first, loses.     
- Lelouch, didn't you come here for answers? Are you like, just conditioned to order people to die at this point? He doesn't seem very happy about it, though.    
- Suzaku seriously almost crossed a serious line there. A line so serious that even walking *up* to it is fucked up. Also, it's kind of unsettling how legitimately terrified Kallen looked. But the thought of being like Lelouch and breaking someone's will/forcing them to obey him was a line he wasn't willing to cross. (See, Lelouch? We call this having a moral compass.)     
- Both of the brothers are dying/dead. Except not, and what a terrifying face that was, Charles. So VV lying to Charles either got him mad because he broke their promise, enough for Charles to kill him - OR, Charles was planning on betraying him already and that was a convenient excuse. Either way, VV is dead and Chuck is now immortal.      
- So wait, did CC mean VV LOVED Marianne, as in romantically, and was jealous of Charles (presumably for not having a shota body)? So then the flash of rage at her name wasn't hatred of Marianne, but... Chuck? I could completely be misunderstanding the line.     
- Villetta and Ohgi work out their feelings. At gunpoint. Note that Villetta doesn't respond to Ohgi's confession of love by saying she doesn't reciprocate. And then there's a ninja maid.     
- Oh look, Charles has taken Lelouch into Unlimited Blade Works. Interesting character stuff here about the things Lelouch has gained and lost, and what he really wants. It's not a point without merit, either: Setting aside the struggle of the Japanese resistance to Britannia (which he was only ever using for his own purposes anyway), would Lelouch not have been ultimately happier as a normal student? He'd still have Shirley and Nunnally and Milly, Euphy would still be alive. Has his crusade actually made the world better in any way? And we're going to get a good "not so different" speech from Chuck here.     
- Wait, it wasn't a "not so different" speech. It was literally "there is only one person." Charles is a solipsist?     
- We finally get to learn the terms of the contract. CC wants to die. Which means she (presumably) wants Lelouch to take her place as an immortal. So, she realized when VV died that Chuck had attained that stage so he could do it for her?      
- Nunnally putting her foot down! Metaphorically speaking.    
- Arthur is sensing your turmoil, Suzaku. And of course, the fact that the entire OSI staff has been Geassed should be a big clue that yup, Lelouch is back. "I would never lie to you, Nunnally," Suzaku lies to Nunnally. Being told that he's just like Lelouch seems to be a big sore nerve for Suzaku, for obvious reasons.        
- CC backstory, ooh. So Geass really does depend on your wishes. And... that's very interesting, how she killed her benefactor, like she now wants to be killed. Getting a Code means you really are just living to die.     
- Seriously, are we ever going to find out what the fuck Jupiter has to do with any of this or is it just an Evangelion-style "I think it looks cool and it'll make people argue about symbolism forever" deal?      
- I can't help but feel that regardless of how emotional it is, stopping CC from accepting death here was a very selfish act by Lelouch. She wants desperately to die, but he still needs her around.      
- So Nina's developed nuclear weapons (or something very similar) and it's key to Schneizel's plan, "Damocles." AKA the sword hanging over your neck by a thread. Well that's not fucking ominous or anything.     
- And CC's gone nuts. Great.          

**Episode 16: United Federation of Nations Resolution Number One**     

- So Chuck can't get back to the real world. He can't be killed, but Lelouch may have pulled a Buu-saga Piccolo and destroyed the way out? Except we clearly saw Lelouch and CC on the other side of the gate, so that doesn't work.     
- So this is how CC used to be as a girl? It kinda comes off as a little exploitatively moe, to be honest. Lelouch says he won't harm her in any way, but his word clearly isn't worth much at this point.     
- Another one of the BKs is learning not to trust Zero. Good. That'll probably be important later.     
- As much as I like Suzaku, watching Kallen kick the shit out of him was endlessly entertaining. I went back and watched that like four times just now. Not like he didn't deserve it from her.     
- And Zero just made the UN. Okay, that came out of absolutely nowhere. Not a bad idea, though. And as Deithard points out, if the governments-in-exile of various Areas agree, it makes for *casus belli*. Of course, it carries the clause of "don't worry about your own individual country's concerns, join the greater good."       
- Lelouch re-introducing pizza to CC. OK, that's kind of cute, I'll admit it.      
- So Anya's memories are on the fritz, but it's a constant thing. So it can't just be Chuck Geassing her over and over again (if he even can, we don't know the limitations on that). Especially because she said it happened in China, so he wouldn't have had a chance to. I'm guessing she's referring to the collision between her and CC?      
- And here comes a new Knight of the Rounds! We know he's evil because Arthur hasn't ever had that reaction towards anyone ever before, and also because he greeted Suzaku by throwing a knife at him. Unlike the evil-ass Knight of Ten, though, the (probably)-honorable Knight of One is here. They're anticipating an attack on Japan and concentrating their forces here. That's a pretty formidible defense, especially without the Guren, since that leaves just Xing-Ke and Tohdoh in current-generation Knightmares against five KotRs and more conventional forces.     
- Did... did this Bradley guy seriously just threaten Kallen with sexual assault? Like, is that something that was actually in the original Japanese or were the subbers taking liberties there?     
- Nina's super-bomb gets mounted on Lancelot, and Lloyd and Cecile super-upgraded the Guren so Suzaku can't even fly it anymore. If these two things don't turn out to be Chekhov's Guns (Chekhov's Bombs?) I will buy a hat literally to eat it.      
- The preparations are fun. Tianzi is adorable trying to remember her lines, Tamaki thinks CC's been knocked up, and the lady Four Swords... I can't tell if her "there are things I want to tell you" is a death flag or not, and if it is, which of them it's a death flag for.     
- So Ohgi survived his fall, meaning Villetta saved him. But what happened to her, if Sayoko was there? And hey, wasn't he also like stabbed four times in the process?     
- Aw, that shot of Rivalz alone in the student council room is actually kind of upsetting. Rolo, Kallen and Lelouch are off being terrorists, Milly graduated, Shirley's dead. villetta's missing, Gino, Suzaku and Anya are Knights...        
- The UN is being led by Kaguya and Tianzi, who are 16 and 13 respectively. Code Geass really IS noodle rollerskate Gundam.       
- I really want to know what the credits scrolling by say. I can read some of the names in Kana, but not the titles or the rest. Anyone got a translation?      
- HEY CHUCK. So we cetainly know where Lelouch gets his touch for the theatrical from.    
- Told you your word was worthless, Lelouch. Your regret doesn't mean much when you keep choosing the harmful path.       
- A second climactic phone call to mirror the one before the Tokyo battle in R1. This time, neither of them are hiding their intentions from the other.      

I'm not sure how I feel about the Charles plotline, and the whole "moe innocent CC" feels really exploitative like an attempt to appeal to the body pillow crowd. But I am pretty interested in the impending battle that's brewing. We have a bunch of major factors that are being set up: The Black Knights starting to mistrust Zero, Nina's uber-bomb, the Knights of the Round in full play, Nunnally as potential hostage, whatever "Damocles" is from Schneizel's plan, and now one final agreement between Lelouch and Suzaku. I'll be interested to see how that plays out. 

Also, I'm wondering if Marianne, at her death instead went into CC's memory world? Which would explain why they were talking to each other.

> Lelouch, didn't you come here for answers?

He had to choose between getting the answers he so desperately wanted or eliminating the person he hates the most in the world so he chose the latter.  Can't really blame him Charles is pretty terrible.

> what a terrifying face that was, Charles.

So friggin scary.  Still gives me the creeps.

> I can't help but feel that regardless of how emotional it is, stopping CC from accepting death here was a very selfish act by Lelouch. She wants desperately to die, but he still needs her around.

He's not doing it because he needs her for his plans he stopped her because he was trying to show that she still does have someone who cares about her and who she cares about.  CC still has something to live for in her life, she wanted to die because everyone who had ever cared about her was dead.  I understand that you don't like Lelouch, which is more than understandable given him being a bit of a dick, but don't let that fool you into thinking that he and CC definitely care for each other on a deeper level than just accomplices.

> So this is how CC used to be as a girl? It kinda comes off as a little exploitatively moe, to be honest.

I definitely agree.  My first time watching the series I hated this CC and haven't changed my opinion during this rewatch.  It just felt like it cheapened the character.  CC was a fun character with a lot of agency and personality (despite her usual deadpan nature) then they went and made her this quivering helpless girl that Lelouch had to protect.  I hate when shows do this, because it's always with female characters.

> And Zero just made the UN. Okay, that came out of absolutely nowhere.

They've been sowing the seeds for that in the background of the last few episodes talking about all the different countries that were prepared to join up with them.  Also, I think that meeting that Tamaki walked in on to tell Ohgi about Zero was implied to have been about it.

> Did... did this Bradley guy seriously just threaten Kallen with sexual assault? Like, is that something that was actually in the original Japanese or were the subbers taking liberties there?

He did it in the dub too.  He's a super creeper.

> The UN is being led by Kaguya and Tianzi, who are 16 and 13 respectively.

Tianzi really isn't in any sort of leadership position with the UFN as a whole despite being one of the two people who announced it.  Plus any decision she makes is going to be heavily influenced by Xingke who's shown himself to be pretty level headed.

> Aw, that shot of Rivalz alone in the student council room is actually kind of upsetting.

I thought it was a really cool shot to highlight just what you said.  It really drives home how the plot is affecting those who have been left on the sideline.

> it carries the clause of "don't worry about your own individual country's concerns, join the greater good."

I think doing a deep dive into the various sociopolitical ramifications of the UFN and how it operates would be fascinating.

> I think it's interesting the four figures shown in repetition at the beginning of the OP. Nunnally, Schneizel, Suzaku, CC. 

I noticed Nunnally repeatedly flashing but wasn't paying close enough attention to see exactly all who was there or if anyone showed up more frequently. Why Schneizel rather than Charles, who has been the ultimate target for the whole series up to this point? Your theory about the prince being the final boss seems to be gathering more evidence.

> Suzaku seriously almost crossed a serious line there. A line so serious that even walking *up* to it is fucked up. 

Suzaku is looking pretty gray right now, I'm afraid he may not restrain himself in the future.

> So wait, did CC mean VV LOVED Marianne, as in romantically, and was jealous of Charles (presumably for not having a shota body)? So then the flash of rage at her name wasn't hatred of Marianne, but... Chuck?

Not something I had considered, interesting though. I don't buy it yet, will need more evidence.

> It was literally "there is only one person." Charles is a solipsist?

I was pondering that phrasing. Maybe he believes the world is a product of someone else's mind and his goal was to kill that person (God) so he can end his brother's (now his) immortal life? Just spitballing here but that makes a surprising amount of sense to me at the moment given how weird it sounds.

> I can't help but feel that regardless of how emotional it is, stopping CC from accepting death here was a very selfish act by Lelouch. She wants desperately to die, but he still needs her around.

Didn't give much thought to that but yeah, he's denying CC her one wish there.

> So Nina's developed nuclear weapons (or something very similar) and it's key to Schneizel's plan, "Damocles." AKA the sword hanging over your neck by a thread. Well that's not fucking ominous or anything.

That directly fueled my speculation for today. I think Schneizel wants to rule indirectly and through fear via a puppet.

> Also, I'm wondering if Marianne, at her death instead went into CC's memory world? Which would explain why they were talking to each other. 

Can't think of how they'd be talking otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
The issue is, C.C. herself did not really want to die. Her true wish was not death. Lelouch might have his own reasoning for it, but I felt the sequence did indicate her true desire was less pessimistic than self-destruction.

> Setting aside the struggle of the Japanese resistance to Britannia (which he was only ever using for his own purposes anyway), would Lelouch not have been ultimately happier as a normal student? He'd still have Shirley and Nunnally and Milly, Euphy would still be alive. Has his crusade actually made the world better in any way?

I thought about this a while ago. Lelouch, Nunnally, and everyone else could have easily lived normal, happy lives. Becoming Zero was something Lelouch felt he needed to do, but ultimately caused a lot of pain for many people, including those he loves. However, it's sort of one of those "everything happens for a reason" things. Charles has been planning something big from the very beginning. Nobody really knew about it, and we still don't know what his true goal is other than to kill god. We don't know what the consequences of his actions will be. In a way, the world might end up being lucky that Lelouch decided to become Zero at this time because he'll end up being the only one capable of stopping Charles. So if he didn't hate his father, Lelouch, Nunnally, Euphemia, everyone would be living happy lives for as long as it took Charles to reach his end goal (assuming his goal is an evil one).

> Seriously, are we ever going to find out what the fuck Jupiter has to do with any of this or is it just an Evangelion-style "I think it looks cool and it'll make people argue about symbolism forever" deal?

Those and the pictures of the Geass symbol children. I don't even know if I think they're planets anymore. Maybe they're just eyes with misshapen irises/pupils staring directly into each other. Who the hell knows anymore?

> Especially because she said it happened in China, so he wouldn't have had a chance to. I'm guessing she's referring to the collision between her and CC?

Good catch. That's a good thought.

Turn 15

* I wonder if Cs World gets its initial renamed depending the initials of who the main character is.

* Considering how megalomaniacal Charles is, I wouldnt be surprised if hes using that Prodigal Son allusion literally.

* I dont know. Id say mind control is pretty much the same thing as memory rewriting. Just rewrite the persons memories to where they agree with you, but still retain the information you want to know. And *you* can do it to a person more than once!

* Dude, shut up. Were at war. Theres no room for morality here. It sounds hard, but its true.

* I dont get why Jeremiah suddenly says he hates that body. He seemed to be rather enjoying the perks. Maybe he just meant he hated being turned into nothing but an assassin.

* Why the hell did Lelouch have a bomb filled with tiny mirrors on him? Guy really is prepared for all situations (unless the plot demands it).

* [Well, that was easy.](http://webm.land/media/NQKB.webm) If he Geass is that reflective, Im amazed Lelouch never accidentally Geassed himself just looking close into someones eye. (You know, before he purposefully did it.)

* Notice how they dont do the mind-locking animation with Charles. Ive never been able to figure out if this meant he had already killed himself, activating his Code ahead of time, or if they were just in a rush. They never really give you a close enough look of his eyes to be able to tell if the red-iris thing is on. Almost definitely on purpose.

* I wonder if /u/rascorpia was upset when Charles went down, or knew it was just way too easy to be legit.

* That reaction from Lelouch post-Geass is incredibly human and well done. After so long, with all those pent up emotions, believing you finally accomplished your goal, and did it that fast, would definitely lead to some necessary catharsis.

* Kallen is becoming the queen of get-ahold-of-yourself slaps.

* Holy shit, Suzaku, it took you that long to draw the comparison? Is this Code MENT Suzaku? Cause this guys a fucking moron.

* [They said her name again!](http://webm.land/media/w77d.webm)

* Why do these guys always seem to flashback to these dramatically happy points when near death? Is *everybody* on Refrain?

* [Well, Im terrified.](http://i.imgur.com/1Mt1jbe.jpg)

* Charles: You want the Power of a King? Than have the courage to come at me like a king!

* Lelouch: Well, technically Im not a king.

* Charles: Oh, Pheloneus?

* So, can a person like will where they want that Code insignia to appear on their bodies? The forehead seems the default location, but Charles definitely seemed to have that glove-reveal planned out.

* C.C.: Hmm Lelouch is fighting against an immortal Emperor who hates his guts. Maybe he needs backup? Nah, hell be fine. I still have monologuing to do. ^I ^still ^luv ^u ^bby.

* Lelouch: Aah! [Youre that guy from Big Hero 6, too?!](http://i.imgur.com/qduHuG3.jpg)

* The way Viletta said baroness sounded an awful lot like baring ass. Im sure it was just a coincidence.

* Ohgi: But I still love you!

* Viletta: Are you insane?!

* Ohgi: Look, girl, Im just trying to fulfill the Romeo and Juliet trope here! Work with me!

* Sayoko: [Im a bird.](http://i.imgur.com/ivsj9GX.jpg)

* I wonder whose side people like /u/Durinthal are on in this scene between Lelouch and Charles. Like, people who currently hate Lelouch but acknowledge Charles is just as ruthless. /u/rascorpia is just on a whole other playing field.

* This whole thing with Charles just verbally beating down Lelouch must be so cathartic to D, EC, and R.

* [Does this shot confirm Ds theory from yesterday that Lelouch will at some point where that mask?](http://webm.land/media/v31c.webm) Eh, Ill give it to him.

* You are me, and I am you. All else is illusion. Better helps symbolize why when Charles was talking a few moments ago, we heard Lelouchs voice speak at the same time.

* C.C.s comment about Charles mentally attacking Lelouch to scare her into appearing reminds me of that episode of Future Diary where Yuno says that if she keeps flaying [Spoiler](/s "Female Seventh, then it would make Male Seventh come rescue her.")
* C.C.: Lelouch, its time you knew the conditions of our contract, and what I desire. [Its a face that doesnt disappear every time I turn my head.](http://i.imgur.com/brxB7Tj.jpg)

* C.C. finally cluing Lelouch in on the super obvious [Who Wants to Live Forever?](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever) trope. Just remind her that she may not get pizza in the afterlife, Lelouch.

* The music during the argument between C.C. and Lelouch is fucking beautiful.

* Ive actually not got much to say about C.C.s wish to die. I dont want to her to (I mean, I *REALLY* dont want her to), but I cant blame her. After what shes been though, she deserves peace.

* Jeez, these filler scenes get more boring the further the show goes along. JUST GET BACK TO THE PLOT, DAMN IT!

* It is nice to hear Nunnally actually take charge for once in her life, though.

* Aw Arthurs worried about his chew toy.

* Okay, wait. So, Suzaku *can* see the red irises, even without a Geass or Code? Or did he just infer that from the way they talked? Oh, I dont even fucking care anymore.

* *NOW* Nunnally doesnt trust Lelouch, anymore?! What the hell is going on?!

* [Tom Riddles looking feminine.](http://i.imgur.com/TiTZliC.jpg)

* UGHH! Everybody knows its gonna work out between Ohgi and Viletta! GET BACK TO THE GOOD STUFF!

* I believe it was /u/Durinthal who jokingly predicted that Nina would get a Geass that made people love her? Good call, but wrong person.

* I feel like I should say something about the Geass being overloaded in both of her eyes but [Damn it, girl, put some clothes on!](http://webm.land/media/WI0c.webm)

* So, according the nun, only a person with an exceptionally strong Geass can have it overload in both eyes, and thereby allowing them to steal the Code of the Code-bearer. K. (I guess that explains why Rolos Geass hasnt overloaded in all the years hes had it. Its just not that strong as far as Geasses are concerned, apparently.)

* [I want to know what happened here.](http://i.imgur.com/UVcZZuV.jpg) Did the nun just somehow force C.C. to accept her Code, then killed her to activate it, *then* committed suicide? What a sacrilegious nun. (But, seriously, how did she force her Code onto C.C.?)

* Thought Elevator?! What?! Huh?! How?! [Who?!](https://youtu.be/356faqb9JnU?t=1m12s)

* Sit where you are and watch. Who knew Charles was an exhibitionist?

* So Hes just forcefully leaning over her? Based on their location, is he just willing her to die? Oh, I dont fucking know anymore.

* Fuck yeah, Lelouch with the Dont you give up on me! speech.

* Odd how a Knightmare is able to functionally interact with something based on thought. I guess its more due to him thinking it will work than anything.

* GRAB HER!

* [This is the second Great Gatsby reference Ive made in this rewatch.](http://i.imgur.com/83w8FnX.png) This is not something I expected to happen in a Code Geass thread.

* Yeah, shes a genius alright Managed to do everything except think to add the radioactive fallout to that nuke.

* Oh, here it is. Amnesiac C.C. is probably the cutest thing Ive ever seen in my entire fucking life. You try to find a girl more innocent. On a side note, it sure is lucky that the English language didnt evolve in the slightest during the hundreds of years of time shes lost, so they can easily communicate.

* Lelouch: HOLY SHIT! You can count to twenty?! Well, why didnt you say that first?! Ive been stuck forever since I was born without a right pinkie toe.

* Actually, he probably does need help carrying away corpses.

* Onward we press!

VV's code was on the back of his neck, or at least that's what was implied because that's where CC was looking when she realized he lost his code.

> Okay, wait. So, Suzaku can see the red irises, even without a Geass or Code? Or did he just infer that from the way they talked? 

The way they talked made it pretty obvious that they were Geassed.  Their answers were so rote.

It'd be cool if they ever gave us an explanation.

Hatred is slow, subtle, quietly destroying positive thoughts until there's nothing left but burning fury directed at their very being. You do not forgive, for forgiveness does not exist in this realm. You do not pray for their redemption, for they have no soul left to be redeemed. Death is too kind a fate to wish upon them, for that shall set them free from the rotten core that they have made of this world. There is only their downfall to hope for, losing everything they hold dear so you may hear their lamentations of grief. And even after their world has fallen apart, when they have plunged deep into the bottomless depths of despair, you do not feel joy at their loss, for they have robbed you of all potential for happiness. There is only a husk left of your emotions, a hollowed-out shell which contains nothing but all-consuming anger.

*That* is hatred. *That* is how I feel about Lelouch.

[Well...](/s "Not really.")

Johnny Yong Bosch's  fucking *nails* Lelouch's reaction to Charles' death. It's animalistic, cathartic and almost a bit... I don't want to say *sorrowful*, but it's almost like he just feels kind of lost in the gravity of what's just happened, like he doesn't know how to process everything that's going through his mind (which is a unique experience for Lelouch). For a few moments at least, he's a man at the end of very long, very brutal journey and with one of the guiding purposes in his life finally complete.

While that was technically not the World of C but rather C.C.'s inner world, I cannot credit you with 100/100 points on the **OFFICIAL_CODE_GEASS_PREDICTION_POINT_STATSHEET**.

At first, I thought Charles was just being anticlimactic.  Should've known that -- if there were other provably immortal people -- then Charles could do the same.

I miss pithy C.C already.  Also, shout-out to whoever said "haha" when one of my fellow first-timers speculated about someone having a Geass to make people fall in love with them.  Also, Lelouch is *okay* at intro monologues, but he's no C.C.

Kind of surprised to see Oghi still kicking.  I thought he'd be alive but bed-ridden (and maybe cared-for by Violetta or Sayoko).  Curious to see how that plays out, since his position within the Black Knights is likely compromised.

I dislike this new Knight of Ten already. -_- I'm guessing he's there just to throw shade in Suzaku's direction and be suspicious of Suzaku's upcoming heart-to-heart with ~~Lelouch~~ Zero.
>> ARTICLE
> Also, Lelouch is okay at intro monologues, but he's no C.C.

It's the fact that he always refers to himself as Zero.

I kind of like seeing this demure CC though. It's a nice shift to see Lelouch care for her this way after knowing her for so long as a snarky equal. I guess it makes sense thematically too, considering Lelouch almost lost himself earlier this season. Though it seems this kind of calm really will not last due to the desperate circumstances coming in late ep 16.
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the most interesting speculation here can come when you parallel this episode with the similar one last season. 

Episode 23 of R1 has the tragedy, followed by declaration of impending attack, and the ominous phone call between Lelouch and Suzaku. In R2 we get pretty much those three points, but we are only on episode 16. 

At the pace this show moves, if the black knights were successful in R1, it probably would have been done in those 2 episodes fine, maybe a 3rd. But with 9 to go now, can only imagine how many pieces still need to move before the final checkmate.

I almost stopped watching episode 16 when Lelouch was fully enraged, geass flaring, and &#128167; was walking up behind him. I was fully expecting him to turn around and shout "Leave me alone!" or "Just be *quiet!*" and doom her to solitude or silence forever. It seemed so, so likely that I almost couldn't bear to watch.

He got close enough, at that, but at least he lucked out. It's ironically a *good* thing that he lashed out at her so she was already cowering when he ordered her to be quiet. He might be able to make up for his actions with time, but he can never fix what he does with his geass.

The strong devour the weakWe of Britannia shall feast upon the raw flesh of the world itself. Is Charles planning to move? Hes getting Britannia all hyped up.

Rolo, dont lie to your big brother.

Nunnallys been taken away from Lelouch. He has nothing left.

Holy hell 87th? Thats much more than the 17th in line Lelouch was. Wasnt expecting so many royal siblings. Good lord Charles is a machine. Respect.

Surprise. The Japanese hate your plan, Nunnally. Even [Suzaku](http://i.imgur.com/GiYslgU.jpg) was shocked you proposed it. [Lloyds](http://i.imgur.com/dtMdW6c.jpg) intrigued though. Maybe hell end up trying to help her out.

Nobody whos involved with the political troubles realizes theres much more going on than just Japan vs. Britannia.

[This gal.](http://i.imgur.com/F7KQ29K.jpg)

Kaguya's got a dirty mind. Its still a little strange how she keeps acting like shes Zero wife. Theyve only spoken, what, once? Im still not ruling out that she might have an idea that Zero is Lelouch, and that maybe she had a crush on him when they were little.

Wow Lelouch is sad. Geassing everyone so he can be alone on the train car. Poor guy. He sort of brought this on himself though.

Having some fun with Geass. Nice. I probably wouldve tried that out sooner.

Yes, CCs talking to herself" again. And its Marianne! Stop teasing me and give me some info on her already!

Christ, refrain? Trying to push yourself on Kallen. I didnt think hed fall this hard this fast.

Rolos speaking some truths, but why the heck is he [getting up in Lelouchs face?](http://www.gfycat.com/AnimatedHarshDungbeetle)

Oh god, the origami. :(

Lelouch is finally realizing life was good. Hes in too deep now though, and Im glad he admits his actions are no longer going to be about Nunnally. Progress.

[Bring em home, Lelouch.](http://i.imgur.com/8mS17BM.jpg)

Im not even gonna bother thinking about where Zero got that mech, but who was flying it? Nobody? Can Knightmares do that?

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Lelouch broke down, but put himself back together just as fast. It looks like he has something planned. The Black Knights think hes surrendering, but I dont think he is. I dont know what hes going to do next, but Im excited to find out. Love the way this episode ended.

Charles has *a* *lot* of children. We threw some theories around in the past and [talked about](/s "Charles needing his children for some sort of sacrifice. He was giving those who share his blood Geass in order to harness their power. Stuff along those lines. Im wondering if thats somewhat accurate now. Its possible Im thinking too much into the 87th in line (and he probably has more kids who are younger than Nunnally), but if he was preparing an epic, large scale plan with the thought elevator and such, why would he put so the time and effort into making that many children?")

CC is still talking with Marianne (presumably). Is Marianne actually dead though? [Speculation time](/s "Is she in that World of C place CC mentioned to Mao? That hasnt been mentioned again. Maybe when Geass users die they are reborn or something in World of C. CC never wanted to kill Mao because hed go there and screw things up. Maybe World of C is where the god is that Charles and VV want to kill. Marianne had Geass. She called her guards off because she didnt mind if she died. She could go to World of C and prepare for Charles arrival. But then why wouldnt Charles just kill himself? Hmmm, maybe once you go to World of C you cant come back, and he wanted to be able to travel between both worlds. But then why wouldnt he just kill someone like Rolo and have him go to World of C ahead of time? Maybe VV doesnt even know how to get to World of C. Welp, I got some of my crazy back. There are definitely some holes in this theory, and while writing it I didnt think of how it could fit in with some of our previous theories, but I liked it enough to post it. Have at it if you so wish.")

Kaguya doesn't know who Zero is, but the way I always rationalized it was that it's sort of a huge celebrity crush.  You see the way young teenagers act obsessively over their celebrity crushes like Bieber or One Direction.  Zero is the equivalent of that for Kaguya who mind you in only 15.  Add in the fact that she was pretty much born with a silver spoon in her mouth being the de facto head of one of the six houses of Kyoto which means she's used to getting what she wants so she basically assumes that Zero will bend to her whims and marry her just because she has a huge crush on him.

> Im still not ruling out that she might have an idea that Zero is Lelouch, and that maybe she had a crush on him when they were little.

I kind of figured that was the case. Not sure why she'd be acting like that otherwise.

> Rolos speaking some truths, but why the heck is he getting up in Lelouchs face?

Kallen might not comfort him, but Rolo's willing.

> Im not even gonna bother thinking about where Zero got that mech, but who was flying it? Nobody? Can Knightmares do that?

I think that was Rolo's Knightmare, so would make sense if he was piloting. I was actually expecting him to use his Geass at some point there to try to take down Suzaku.

Okay, big ol' speculation time. I came up with part of this last night but your comments gave me another couple of ideas. [First part](/s "Yes, this is more evidence for Charles wanting a number of Geass users for their power, assuming it needs to be something related to bloodlines.")

[This is reaching a bit](/s "The World of C? World of *Charles*. It's his power source for the Sword of Akashathe floating temple that he's going to use to kill God. I agree with you and think Geass users in his bloodline specifically go there when they die. The stronger the Geass user, the more power provided to Charles when they're sent to the World of C. Lelouch wasn't powerful enough yet, or maybe Charles saw much greater potential in him, so Charles let him go. CC needs Lelouch to stay alive to avoid him entering the World of C, thereby giving Charles enough power to accomplish his goal. Marianne was a Geass user, also as you hypothesized. I think Charles had her killed, maybe altering people's memories for the cover-up.")

[Grade-A tinfoil here](/s "However, CC found a way to pull Marianne back from the World of C, which also earned her Charles' ire. Maybe they were friends, closer than even she is with Lelouch now. The rescue gave them a mental link, telepathy of sorts. Marianne's Geass ability? A glamour, a way to change how she's perceived in other people's minds. She used that to permanently change her name and identity to that of a simple maid...")

[Tinfoil part 2](/s "Under the guise of Sayoko she continued to look after her children, unable to reveal her true identity for fear of endangering them. This is a parallel to Kallen, whose mother continued to serve as a maid to stay by her side as well; additionally this explains why Sayoko didn't appear to be concerned by CC abruptly showing up to hang out with Nunnally early in the first season and why she's been assisting the Black Knights for some time. When Nunnally was taken from Ashford Academy, Sayoko/Marianne was able to tell CC that she was taken. And assuming Nunnally and VV left by conventional means, Sayoko could have used the Black Knights' resources to track them for a time and tell where they were headed.")

Now I haven't gone back to rewatch earlier episodes and verify certain aspects of that, so there could be some very big holes in it. I like my crazy theory though.
>> ARTICLE
> I think that was Rolo's Knightmare

I'm an idiot. I wonder then if Suzaku knows what Rolo's Knightmare looks like. He'd be able to tell that Rolo is now helping Zero, and probably that Lelouch has his memories back.

All the speculation stuff, goddamn I love it. [more theories ahead](/s "We only know of one child, Lelouch, having Geass. I'm on board for Mao also being a child, but that hasn't been officially confirmed yet, right? And I guess it's possible Rolo could be his child too. So of his 87+ other children, how many of them have Geass? I guess it's possible that they don't need too many people for the Sword of Akasha sacrifice. Charles just needs to make sure they've reached their full potential first.")

[In response to your tinfoil](/s "I love this. There was one episode where Charles was also seen "talking to himself" briefly. So is CC able to speak with him as well? Is Charles talking to Marianne? Who knows? The Sayoko theory, love it too. I'm just not as on board with that yet as I am with the other stuff. If that is the case and Marianne is Sayoko, I would have liked to see Sayoko play a slightly larger role in the series so far. She's barely had any lines, and hasn't even done that much to help. I still have no idea though why she'd be helping Diethard and CC. I know Marianne would need to stay in hiding both to protect herself and her children, but she could've helped out a little more. Even if she did something simple like trying to give Lelouch advice, even if he ignored it and called her "just a maid." Now I'm not fully against this Marianne/Sayoko theory happening. I'd need to see it properly play out, but I'm not sure I know what that would entail.")
>> ARTICLE
I have absolutely no expectation that my tinfoil theory's true, I'm definitely stretching to fit everything together even if there isn't anything directly contradicting it.

I agree with you about wanting her to play a larger role in the series if that's the case, though the same could be said of more than just her. There are several things that I suspect will be plot-critical later on that we know next to nothing about right now, the prime examples being the World of C and Sword of Akasha.
>> ARTICLE
> Charles was also seen "talking to himself"

Hate to be a buzzkill, but Charles said he was talking to Clovis in that scene.  I would link to a youtube video of it, but spoilers galore in the suggested videos.  If you're interested it's the first 20 seconds of episode 6 in Season 1.
>> ARTICLE
First off, kudos for not linking a vid just because of the spoilers in suggested videos.

Secondly, that is not the instance I was referring to. I only joined in on these discussions at episode 6, so I know that wasn't the one. I tried looking back in my comments, and it was in episode 18 at about 7:30. Charles says, "Construction of the thought elevator is proceeding as scheduled. Yes, I understand." Then some hooded guy walks up from behind him to tell him about Schneizel.

The way he said it made it seem like he wasn't talking to himself, but rather to somebody else, kind of like CC does.
>> ARTICLE
> Charles says, "Construction of the thought elevator is proceeding as scheduled. Yes, I understand."

Oh ok gotcha.  Yeah when he's in the Sword of Akasha he can talk to people who aren't there much like CC and using the episode 6 example of Clovis it's clear that the people he's talking to don't necessarily need to be alive, given that the hooded guy comes up and tells him that Clovis' remains had arrived, confirming the fact that Clovis is dead.
>> ARTICLE
Oh holy shit! Going back and rewatching that first part of episode 6... that was just so long ago now I didn't remember. He's talking to Clovis after Lelouch had killed him. That would've been something to catch on a rewatch.

This actually could help with some theories. /u/Durinthal, you might want to check that out.
>> ARTICLE
...well damn. Had to listen to JIBUN WO after that of course, I miss that OP.

[Theory alterations](/s "To me that seems like more evidence for World of C being where Geass users get sent after death. And Clovis being among them; makes sense if he was doing research into the whole Geass thing on Kamine Island. I want to say it doesn't really shoot down my Sayoko==Marianne theory since that required some leap of logic about CC finding a way for her to return from the World of C anyway.")

[Edit: wild*er* speculation](/s "World of C is in CC's mind. That's why Charles needs her back and she can talk to Marianne without being at the Sword of Akasha.")

The Ten Commandments? Total crap. ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

Hey, for once Lelouch realizes he's standing in the way of what Nunnally wants. Time to step aside and let her rule, right?

Nunnally's moment to shine! Even the Black Knights are going to have difficulty gaining the people's support against her. Lloyd's amused by her being blunt about the SAZ. Yep, Massacre Princess, of course Euphemia has a bad rap among the Japanese.

[Lelouch is done with being Zero?](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gif)

I *guess* Kaguya's right about Zero's harem there. Don't think he's interested in the loli though. Oh Cecile's poor cooking. Love Lloyd's reaction.

Hah, Rolo scaring Lelouch off the train. Looking for trouble after that though. Really, push-ups? I guess he's just screwing with them, a bad mood can do that.

CC *only needs Lelouch to stay alive*. So it's not even about her using him to take down Charles? Damn, I really liked that theory. It adds more to the idea of Geass users powering something else, though... but why would she stay hidden from Charles then?

The Black Knights are done, Britannia wins! I like this ending, good series guys.

Wait, Lelouch was about to shoot up? [I expected him to have a Nunnally-related breakdown](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33ybmc/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqpl22n?context=3) but not quite like this. Kallen's not putting up with his shit though.

"Comfort me." [Some of us know where this is headed.](http://i.imgur.com/CwLPNoi.png) Dude, no. Thank you, Kallen.

Rolo has a fair point. Just go back to being an ordinary student, everyone can be happy (particularly Rolo), no one will be hurt.

Meanwhile, Suzaku just happens across the Black Knights' ship. Time for the submarine, I guess.

That's a cute scene on the rooftop of the school and I like Suzaku's glass analogy. Reiterating request for a slice of life series.

"My battle isn't just about Nunnally anymore." Finally he gets it!

Huh, Suzaku knows exactly what's going on for once. Could this be the end of the Black Knights for real? Never mind, Zero's back. I knew it was too good to be true.

He accepts Nunnally's request? Expect another bloodbath.

[Wild speculation turn 07](/s "Cornelia discovers the truth behind the Geass abilities and tries to assassinate Charles in revenge for Euphemia's fall from grace as he's behind it all. She kills Charles, but she's struck down by Schneizel in the battle as well. Guilford is mildly depressed by that until Cecile comforts him and they start dating.")

You know, I just realized something. If Lelouch had revealed himself as a Prince from the beginning, or at least after he had acquired Geass, he would have been in the most advantageous position to do everything he wants to do. Protect Nunnally? He'd have access to at least part of the world's greatest military at his command. Create a better world? Suzaku's right in this one, that be easier by actually being a priviledged individual within the existing system, imagine what Lelouch could have done as Viceroy of Area 11. Worried the Emperor or someone else would use him as pawn? Still have Geass as his trump card. Never mind his genius-level intellect.


>> ARTICLE
Hes afraid that he, and especially Nunnally, would be used as political tools sent to a new country about to be invaded or just assasinated.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because Lelouch is way too prideful. That has been his downfall throughout the whole series. And he does admit that openly (usually to himself).
>> ARTICLE
The emporer himself disowned him for being weak, I don't think that'd work.
>> ARTICLE
And let's not forget the small matter of assassinations, something he's already familiar with
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, if not for the fact that he hates Britannia with every fiber of his being ...
>> ARTICLE
The easiest way to destroy it would be from the inside. Or maybe if he hates not what Britannia is, but how it is, he could turn it into liberal democratic constitutional monarchy. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice try Suzaku, but Lelouch isn't going over to your side
>> ARTICLE
B-But meh hypocrisy...
>> ARTICLE
> "My battle isn't just about Nunnally anymore." Finally he gets it

Yup. That is what we call proper character development. Even though it involved incestuous (and partly homoerotic) tensions.
>> ARTICLE
> Even though it involved incestuous (and partly homoerotic) tensions.

Lelouch should watch out though he's apparently got [some competition](http://i.imgur.com/cVVbnpu.png) for Nunnally.  If Lelouch saw him blushing like that he would've killed him on the spot in a fit of jealous rage.
>> ARTICLE
> CC only needs Lelouch to stay alive.

Honestly in rewatching I found that both this episode and the last one showed that CC's feelings towards Lelouch have grown to be something more than her viewing him as a means to an end.  I think she legitimately cares for him now and just doesn't want him to die because of that.  

For instance last episode her silent plea for Kallen to rescue Lelouch when the airship is going down did not seem like her merely caring about him for the sake of the contract, especially when I contrast it with how she defended Lelouch against Suzaku at Narita.  Again in this episode she kind of gives her true feelings away a little when she has her initial excited (for CC) reaction upon hearing Lelouch's voice coming in to the sub when he returned as Zero and the fact that when Kaguya notices it she instantly schools herself back to a neutral expression. It's kind of the small things that I've latched on to and maybe am reading too much int it.  I think, however, they kind of show that, much like Lelouch's mission is no longer just about Nunnally and hasn't been for sometime, CC's relationship with Lelouch isn't just about the contract anymore and hasn't been for awhile.  She genuinely wants Lelouch to succeed for himself.
>> ARTICLE
I quite agree with you on all of that. I was just trying to think about what she literally stated there with regard to the larger scheme of things rather than focus on her feelings.

Those little things you pointed out are all good, I noticed a few of them at the time but forgot later.
>> ARTICLE
> I was just trying to think about what she literally stated there with regard to the larger scheme of things

I think with CC the things she literally says, especially to Marianne, have to be taken with a large grain of salt.  She's carefully constructed a facade to hide her true feelings and thoughts behind in order to cope with and prevent pain.  Like in the season 1 finale during the illusion she stated that everyone who ever cared about her or hated her is gone and it's clear that she has become withdrawn as a result (who wouldn't really?).  I think she's most untrue to herself when she's talking to Marianne because- well I can't say without getting into spoiler territory, but there are reasons why CC constantly lies to Marianne as a way of lying to herself (beyond the fact that it'd be weird for CC to admit that she's kind of into Marianne's son).
>> ARTICLE
> "Comfort me." Some of us know where this is headed.[5]   Dude, no. Thank you, Kallen.

I felt a great disturbance across anime forums, as though thousands of shippers cried out in frustration and were suddenly silenced.

... You can tell it's Lelouch at his lowest because he actually wants to plow someone that isn't a blood relative.

>> ARTICLE
Well, Euphie and Shirley are not totally blood related to him.

**Episode 7: The Abandoned Mask**

- I had to actually go back and check that this wasn't a flashback to the Emperor's speech at Clovis' funeral. You are a hardass, Charles.  
- That's fucking creepy, Rolo.   
- Who are you trying to convince, Lelouch? That you're not super depressed over this?    
- Lelouch is the world's worst liar, and yet everyone still buys it.     
- Is this the first time in the series we've ever seen Nunnally reading Braille or this universe's equivalent? Also, yup, none of the Student Council recognize her.   
- So not even Suzaku saw Nunnally recreating Euphy's plan coming, huh? She really IS a surprise. Constantly being underestimated.   
- People are torn on whether or not to trust Suzaku. Also, they say he "shot Zero," referring to his capture at the end of R1 25, right? I wonder what the public story is about what happened and Zero's identity.    
- Lelouch, way to be super fucking obvious and ditch the speech early. Good thing you're not under surveillance anymore, apparently.   
- Aw, Nunnally touching Suzaku's hand was kind of cute.   
- Wow, Lelouch really is broken up over this. Is this the most depressed we've seen him?   
- ...I like that Kaguya pretty much said "yeah it's ok with me if he's boning you girls too"   
- Did she seriously just create a compact on "Lelouch's love interests" because that's hilarious. Is the "Three Court Ladies" a reference to something I'm missing?   
- Cecile: Brilliant scientist, lethal chef.   
- Lelouch really just fucking geassed an entire train car to leave him alone. Wow.   
- That's fucking creepy, Rolo.    
- So are those guys just going to keep doing his orders until they die? That's fucked up.   
- It really does sound like CC's having an actual conversation with Marianne, not just talking to her memory. I have no idea what's up with that.    
- Lelouch about to use Refrain? Wow, dude's fallen hard.   
- And Lelouch got skeevy all of a sudden. Well slapped, Kallen.   
- Rolo's actually making a lot of sense, but I think he's forgetting that to go back to being an ordinary student would require him to abandon his relationship with Nunnally for good. I don't think Lelouch can do that.    
- Now Rolo's acting skeevy. Did this scene launch a hundred ships or what?    
- Dramatic irony, Nunnally. Gotta love it.    
- Aw, this is a cute scene on the rooftop. I really do want a slice-of-life with the Ashford gang.    
- Suzaku makes a really good commander, I have to say. He suits the role nicely.   
- Neat plan, Lelouch. Suzaku's fleet just got wiped out and he could have never seen it coming.   
- Didn't see that ending coming. The Black Knights have to feel betrayed.

Clearly, something is going to go terribly wrong (again) with the SAZ or else this show is going to end 17 episodes ahead of schedule.
>> ARTICLE
Isnt the official story that zero was killed? I think Britannia just went with executing him. Either faking a public execution or that zero died amidst the chaos of the black rebellion. Either way the public thought he was dead, not simply dissapeared after the black rebellion
>> ARTICLE
> Is the "Three Court Ladies" a reference to something I'm missing?

It's just a term used when a ruler has multiple wives at a time, sounds classier than harem anyway.
>> ARTICLE
It's an old story in east asian folklore. I forget the name of the actual story. Romance of the three kingdoms maybe?

It might also be a reference to some Chinese or Japanese tradition, but I wouldn't know for sure.

> Is this the first time in the series we've ever seen Nunnally reading Braille or this universe's equivalent?

I think so, I only recall her working on origami before.

> Cecile: Brilliant scientist, lethal chef.

Cooking is an art, not a science. She might be better off baking.

> Lelouch really just fucking geassed an entire train car to leave him alone.

He *kinda* did that in the first season too, though that was so he could talk to Kallen's rebels in peace.

> It really does sound like CC's having an actual conversation with Marianne, not just talking to her memory. I have no idea what's up with that.

I know! I mean I have my theory about what potentially happened with Marianne but we don't have any evidence of *anything* regarding her now.
>> ARTICLE
I love your theory, but the one hole in it is: How could she be a person AND around for CC to talk with her all the time? Maybe she's a ghost floating around, for all we know. 
>> ARTICLE
Magic! Yeah, that's the biggest leap I had to make, they would basically need long-distance telepathy if Marianne's still walking around somewhere.

Well, my old account got shadowbanned for some reason (Im guessing from all the times I voted in NP threads without bothering to change the URL. I blame /r/SubredditDrama.), so Im here now. I was gonna go with /u/UnidanX, but that was already taken for some reason. Please shower me with hundreds of thousands of upvotes to make up for it. Anyway, on to the episode!

Turn 7

* Opening immediately on Charles face. Im sure /u/rascorpias happy, wherever he is.

* I think Charles and Javik would get along well together.

* Eh, why not? ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

* I wonder if Charles wears a wig or if his hair is really just that magnificent.

* [Seriously, has any ever woken up like this?](http://webm.land/media/tRkg.webm) At least he didnt bolt upright.

* [Its not creepy](http://i.imgur.com/oatzomP.jpg)

* Sure. Ask the assassin kid you know almost nothing about and has shown to have a severe little-brother-complex if you said anything, knowing it probably involved Nunnally. Im sure youll get a truthful answer.

* [Rivalz: Fuck history!](http://webm.land/media/YoLJ.webm)

* [Connection?](http://i.imgur.com/gWljU4x.jpg)

* I suddenly want to watch a movie called Lulu and Stitch. Make it happen.

* Rivalz *Upon seeing Nunnally*: I have the strangest feeling I used to act like an idiot around her. Maybe Im just confusing her for every other woman.

* *After Nunnally announces the Special Zone*

* * Britannians: Didnt those dogs learn their lesson the first time?!

* * Japanese: Does she really think we forgot what happened last time?!

* * [Lloyd](http://i.imgur.com/1YH57cY.jpg): Theres got to be some way I can make a new Knightmare out of this.

* Tragic misunderstanding Girl, what exactly were you told happened? That Euphie just *accidentally* started firing wildly into the crowd and *accidentally* ordered the guards to do the same? Next youre gonna say Lelouch *accidentally* manipulated her mind to make her do that.

* I can assure you it wasnt Euphie who was wrong. For some reason, him saying that makes me *really* angry at Lelouch. Like, the idiot *really* had to go and say *THAT* of all things as an example? *THAT*?! LIKE, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, DUDE?!

* At least Lelouch recognizes that hes basically useless now.

* Littering! Thats a $500 fine!

* One Gurren. Have you forgotten that one Knightmare is piloted by the most plot-armed piece of fanservice since Suzaku?

* Where do these guys find these hot chicks in power that are all over them? Like, first Yukki got [Future Diary Spoiler](/s "literally God"), Light got Misa Amine, and now Lelouch gets the Chinese Empress?

* SHES EVEN PERFECTLY COOL WITH HIM CHEATING ON HER! WTFFFFFFFFFAJNFKAWJNCDKBF

* [Shes even a harem shipper.](http://webm.land/media/b3Am.webm)

* For a second there I thought it was still at the same location, and Lloyd was secretly working for Zero the whole time.

* Lol. Cecile knowing that Lloyd would steal the sandwich and Lloyd refusing to spit it out.

* Lelouch just wasting Geass on a bunch of people just so he can sulk by himself.

* And Rolo seems to really like reminding him of how fucked he is.

* Thats probably the highest Ive ever heard J. Michael Tatum ever get his voice. (Hes the guy getting beat up.)

* These Eleven thugs are more brainwashed than Lelouch could ever make them. Who needs Geass when youve got money?

* For some reason its hilarious how Lelouch is just Geassing these guys to literally work themselves to death just because he feels sorry for himself. The guy really is a teenager. And we finally see how long it actually takes a Geass command to take effect, skipping the whole Zoom and Mind Locking animation.

* [This poor guy needs some therapy.](http://webm.land/media/JCZw.webm) Still love that laugh, though.

* C.C. needs some therapy, herself.

* * Alright, honey, now tell me these voices you keep hearing.

* * I just hear one voice.

* * Of course, of course. Now, what does this voice say?

* * Normally plot relevant stuff that I cant disclose yet.

* * I see. Now, have you at any point in time come into contact with a black notebook with instructions saying to-

* * No, were not doing that!

* Oh, yeah, shes talking to Marianne. Ill let the first-time watchers debate over that.

* Kallen: Dont go turning into my mom on me, Lelouch. I can only have so many contrived anime problems. I dont need a friend with amnesia *again*.

* But, really, how the hell did she know *exactly* where he would be? Thats a large area.

* Lelouch: Hey, I Geassed some very nice young man for this! Go talk to C.C. and get your own superpower! Then you can have all the drugs you want!

* Kallen: Ill do whatever you say! Ill even show arbitrary shots of my ass and tits for no real reason!

* Did Lelouch just go straight-up Guy on a Bender in Need of a Hooker? She said shed do fanservice, man, not rule 34.

* Kallen: Ive done my job of slapping him lightly and going through the standard Get Ahold of Yourself speech. I even cried during it! Now, all thats left is to get some fried chicken and wait for him to come crawling back.

* A wild Rolo appeared! It used Creepily Stand and Homoerotically Monologue!... Its super effective! Lelouch has been stunned by all the slash-fic fan art!

* Doesnt Charles have better things to do than play babysitter to the blind, paralyzed girl? Shouldnt he be killing God, or tracking down C.C., or just standing and looking awesome?

* Lelouch: This is Area 11! How dare you bring that Chinese smut within these walls!

* [What the fuck is this bitch doing here?](http://i.imgur.com/5cSeH8v.jpg)

* * [Thats better.](http://i.imgur.com/2qIazna.jpg)

* I doubt anything else could argue its own existence more eloquently. Try watching the finale of Lucky Star.

* Lelouch *Thinking*: Fireworks Bazookas As long as they shoot and explode.

* About damn time Lelouch accepted hes fighting for more than just Nunnally.

* What hydrodynamic genius that modeling the sub to look like that would help in any way? What, did you hope to fool Britannia into thinking you were just a whale?

* Havent you guys learned by now that Lelouchs orders will always be right except when the plot demands they arent? Hes coming back from his Heroic BSOD; of course its going to work.

* Of course! Lelouchs plan was to open the Breach and release the Kaijus, thus forcing Britannia to focus its entire military might on *them*, leaving him free to act as he pleased! Its brilliant!

* Sir Kururugi! Bubbles! *Sniggering*

* Well, Lelouch did kind of agree to do that with Euphemia in the first place. Of course, that was probably more for dramatic irony than actual character growth.

* Zero, your Geass is currently hidden. Not sure why youre talking like you do when youre Geassing someone.

Oh, well, episode over. See ya!

There is a backstory in Sunrise for Kaguya's existence; namely, they needed someone to represent the Japanese Imperial family. However, there was literally no way for Britannia to invade Japan without having the Imperial Family executed. That was how Charles does things. This would have caused a bit of a political issue in Japan. So in the Geass universe the Japanese Imperial Family simply never existed. Kaguya is the secular civilian substitute.

This being my second time watching this, you'd think I'd remember that.

I forgot just how heart-rending this episode was. It was very close to Lelouch losing his sense of self entirely.

And his iconic 'happiness is like glass' speech that he remembers Suzaku saying:

"Because although you don't normally notice it, it's definitely there. The proof is that you just have to slightly change your point of view slightly, and then that glass will reflect light. Nothing else argues for its own existence more eloquently". 

Definitely one of the most sentimental and sweet moments in the series.

So I've seen a psychiatrist and I've started taking some medicine to calm the nerves. It was a long journey but I've been told everything will be okay and that things should be on the uphill from here. It did take awhile (and a few strange glances) before the psychiatrist started believing my ramblings about Britannia, Lelouch and the Black Knights but I think he caved in to the idea, after all he sure was writing a lot down...

...anyway that is not relevent. What is relevent is that I missed two episodes, or rather three if you include today. Tragic! I know, but I'm here now /r/anime and just like Britannia everything will be okay.

*It will be okay.*

**IT WILL.**

**RIGHT /R/ANIME?**

Time for the medicine methinks.

What's this? A recap? /u/rascorpia must be running out of budget...

**Episode 5**

**In this episode:**  The Black Knights get a makeover! Supporting brand new and better than ever uniforms, they are just about ready to die to the Britannian empire. I have to wonder if Lelouch is going to pull a Hitler with his own 'Night of the long knives' where he just kills everyone who was a part of the Black Knights after he becomes ruler of Britannia. I mean he doesn't seem to care too much about the people themselves, since he left them to die last season despite the sacrifices they themselves made. Plus the world at large still doesn't know who Zero is so he could asume the throne under the guise of being royal blood rather than the leader of a rebellion, although like I say that would mean that the rebels couldn't follow him into positions of power. Then he could kill them all to satisfy Britannians while putting him in position to manipulate the government in any which direction he wants, even if that is perhaps pro-eleven. See? Two days away and the tinfoil is on the horizon. 

Lelouch should really get into poker instead of chess though. If he trips people out making them wonder if he has regained his memories or not then he must have a hella good poker face. Unfortunately he is not so smart when it comes to using his Geass. He missed a great opportunity to pass all his exams and instead he uses to have the teacher overlook his rebellious shenangians? 

Nice to know that in the alternate future humans still have to put up with buffering circles. You can have mechs that destory armies, machines that make Pizza larger than fields and forcefield technology but you still have to put up with the same old shit. Could it be the comcast still exists here? Has Britannia inadvertently brought about their own downfall? 

Tristan the decipticon? You could come up with a better name than that for a transformer guys. At least we get to see Britannians with some semblence of competency, now we just need to wait until Lelouch bypasses their skill and technology by using his geass. Fuck Lelouch (and not in the way you are thinking, yes you, /r/anime lurker). 

It's that fucking cat again! I've decided that the cat represents chaos, given that it has on seperate occassions worked for and against Britannia. The cat just wants blood (for the blood god?) and he will manipulate the people around him in whatever way he chooses in order to get what he wants. Putting it that way makes me feel like the ending will simply be Emperor Arthur standing above the flames upon a pile of corpses, Britannian and Eleven, having finally sacrificed enough souls to achieve immortality. You heard it here first folks, don't say I don't fortell the end of times.

Yolo Rolo, don't go telling one of the most powerful leaders on the planet your weaknesses. Not that it would save you since your stupidity is boundless. This isn't x-factor or _____ got talent, I don't give a shit about your life story, all I care about is results. 

[Results](#gendo-pls)

Don't you go thinking I hadn't noticed those crosses on the wall. Antichrist-kun is still at it in season 2. Makes you wonder what she was up to when the school was raided. Surprised she didn't get shot when she tries walking off to put a mark on the wall. What if Lelouch's geass ran out ages ago and it has been cat commanding her all this time? Must. Dig. Deeper.

Shirley can throw one hell of a punch though...

Crowd Control is finally going to die! And what an undignified death too! "Here lies C.C, slain by Pizza while rebelling against Britannia" I can see it already. This show is finally begining to redeem itself and I couldn't be better. The only thing that could ruin it now is if C.C doesn't happen to die and is miraculously save right before her planned demise. 

And to conclude the episode...Suzaku being as cold as ice. I think at this point he just loves fucking with lelouches head. Using his sister like that is a very nice move though, whether Suzaku was behind it or not. It puts Lelouch in a vary conflicted postion that is for sure. I don't like this 'new viceroy' talk though. That seems to presume that we will not be getting Cornerlia back. Lets hope this means she was promoted rather than killed. **Do not let me down code geass.**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Episode 6**

*"California base"*

That doesn't even deserve my time and effort to list everything wrong with that.

Became Zero for Nunnallys sake? Piss off with that self-dellusionment Lelouch. You had plenty of opportunities to end the conflict and you just had to keep raising the stakes on your personal quest for revenge. How dare you use Nunnally as an excuse, she's a good Britannian girl unlike the filthy traitor that you are. That said, how come C.C could sense that V.V took Nunnally last season but now she can't sense where he is? Does she just have an on/off switch for her google tracker ability?

I have a really hard time understanding the technology in the geass world. It's like one moment someone is able to create an ungodly mech and then the next scene a airborne warship doesn't have the radar functions to detect a team of mechs decending upon them. They should airforce one level of protection you know what I'm sayin'? For that matter mechs moving that slowly should have been easy to shoot out the air before they even got within an inch of the ship. I guess it just really hurts my brain that the Black Knights are able to take down entire Britannian fleets and armies with mininal effort. Even if you do have an incompetent commander we should at least be seeing the Black Knights take casualties but we never do, they just storm in take down everyone and walk away with no casualties (and no I'm not counting the nameless grey knightmares that die of occassion then get instantly replaced). I suppose realism isn't the name of the game with Code Geass but it would be nice to have a little balance. I think the finale of last season was the first time I saw the Black Knights take a loss and even then it was a close defeat.

Wait someone with a name died (dickhead)? Still wasn't anyone important but the shows seems to be trying its best to prove me wrong. It then has to go ruin it by having Ms.Fanservice conviniently rescued when she should have died like 50 times already. Go Gurren Lagann I guess? I just hate how Ms.Fanservice is someone the best pilot in existance with no backstory or build up to it and she just keeps getting the best technology in the universe thrown at her out of nowhere epiosde after episode. Granted Suzaku isn't much better. Is it wrong to want things to naturally build up so that it doesn't feel like complete bullshit every time?

Annnnnnnnd to end this episode...Nunnally could here Lelouches scream over a huge explosion and subsequent shockwave while traveling hundreds of miles per hour through the air.

**Code Geass** ladies and gentlemen. **Enjoy the ride.**

Back to the normal format from now on. I only intended to write up a short summary to save time but...well you know the rest. Watching Kids of the slope at the minute.

Well that is three episodes done. Surprisingly I actually had less to say for the current episode than the previous two. Oh well, I'm up to date now so I can't complain. Feel free to critize my spelling and grammar and such, since I am far too lazy to check it all.

Maybe I'll see you tomorrow, maybe I won't, maybe go...have a lovely day!

You're back! I missed you, there's a distinct lack of a loyalist presence without you around.

That's one thing I'm still confused about. Have a potential theory but there are still some unexplained issues with it.

Agreed, there's no way they should have been able to assault a flying fortress like that.

As I explained in yesterday's thread, she's actually Daredevil and has super hearing. ^(Makes about as much sense as everything else happening right now.)

In today's episode Lelouch finally starts using his geass properly.  

I mean seriously how would you *not* use it just to make people do stupid crap all the time?  Especially when you're in a really bad mood.  It would make me feel so much better that's for sure.

Well, Lelouch is too serious most of the time. 

He only occasionally does stuff like that.

If he doesn't give a duration or a way to conclude the mission the person would keep following the order until they die. Those thugs will literally drop dead there after a few days.

I'm suddenly getting the vibe that &#128167; is utterly using Lelouch, and not in the way he thinks. I feel like her actual contract is with Marianne, and she's only with Lelouch to further Marianne's ends. Perhaps V2 is contracted with Charles and &#128167; is contracted with Marianne, and it will end with a a proxy battle between the murderous king and his victimized queen?

[We are now on two episodes a day, and theres only one week left till I see the end of Code Geass!](http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/infinite-yes-daniel-bryan.gif) I mean, I dont want the rewatch to end, but Im so excited to see how it all plays out

 but for now, what a clusterfuck of an episode.

Ok, so Britannia-China would be a huge alliance too powerful to overcome. There still may be more to Lelouchs kidnapping plan than simply preventing their union, but its a pretty good reason on its own.

Get Schneizel Was Todo just going to slice through everyone to kill Schneizel? Maybe it was just a grab Schneizel order, but it looked like Todo was going to swing.

Whenever someone starts talking about something important they cut away. Ugh, so frustrating.

Awww, the [Empress just takes a sip of the drink](http://www.gfycat.com/ElasticThreadbareElephantbeetle) when Zero scares her. Ummm, have they said in the show yet what her actual name is? Because I dont know it, and Im not looking up names/how to spell things again.

Zero traps are awesome, and everyone has the Guren tech now. Badass stuff. Lucky the enemy hasnt been able to make it like they have.

The Chinese Knightmare from the OP! Its Uncle Lis!

Now Xingke is killing Black Knights. Why didnt Zero team up with him?

Has Xingke ever piloted a Knightmare? Now hes apparently the most skilled because his Knightmare is near impossible to command.

Good job, Zero. Couldve just worked with Xingke. Now he has Kallen.

Diethard talking nothing but sense, and Lelouch says screw that, were going for it.

[All the pictures that Anya took.](http://imgur.com/a/fClvi) Youve got Gino being awesome, as usual. Swimsuit Villetta with the bustiest babe in the series so far. Otter Kallen watching Rivalz. Milly sexually harassing her friends, nothing new there. Suzaku got Euphys pen back, Arthur bites again. Rolo caught in the bathroom? Lelouch and CC, which is a highly incriminating picture. This should give away the fact that Lelouch has his memory back. And lastly, young dapper Lelouch. Anya is everywhere!

Zero better pull out some of his genius. But nope. Not good enough. Knightmares are sinking.

At least they got away. What a mess. Clever hiding spot though.

Schneizel is ready to take over. Guy is smart. So is Xingke for knowing hes smart. Chinese eunuchs, not so smart.

Aaaaand Lelouch is back at Ashford. What? Did Diethard make a teleportation device? Is that his trick?

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Lelouch is an idiot. Xingke seemed like such a good ally, but their relationship turned out so rocky. I remember now that Xingke didnt like associating with someone like Zero, but at some point you can put that aside to further your own goals. Xingke was Lelouchs only ally in China so why wouldnt you talk with him first? He wanted literally the same thing as you, Lelouch. Had you discussed things with him maybe you wouldnt have him and the Chinese Federation kicking your ass.

So were going back to Ashford? Entirely confusing ending, but Im sure it will be explained next episode. Rolo may have helped out somehow. No idea whats really going on with that though.

Still no more crazy theories. I think once we get around ten episodes left well finally be delving into the juicy details of the story. There will likely be plenty of theories around that time from us first timers that are ~~batshit crazy~~ entirely accurate, and theyll keep evolving until they are as close to correct as we can get!

She even has an almost bored expression on her face.

I know she doesn't bother to disguise herself around the Black Knights, but who among the Britannian forces actually knows what CC looks like?

> And lastly, young dapper Lelouch. Anya is everywhere!

Honestly that makes *no* sense to me right now, unless she took it when she was around 5. Or got it from somewhere else, which raises more questions.

Lelouch treats most people like chess pieces, he has very little empathy for others and seems to not realize that *they will remember* being used and tossed away (unless Geassed).
>> ARTICLE

I was thinking mainly Suzaku who was sitting right there looking at the picture. Charles must have told him who CC is and what she looks like.

[/u/EditorialComplex and I discussed it a bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34qvyw/spoilers_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rebellion_r2/cqx8p58) I figured she just took a picture of a photo though.

> Ummm, have they said in the show yet what her actual name is? Because I dont know it, and Im not looking up names/how to spell things again.

The empress' name is Jiang Lihua or Tianzi.

And, yes. Lelouch is a fucking moron for this episode. I guess they needed him to be, because it gets kind of monotonous just seeing him pull a winning move out of his ass at the last second every single time.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks. I'll refer to her as Tianzi now.

Lelouch does need to lose sometimes even if he is incredibly smart. Still, I wish it wasn't because he decided not to talk to the one guy in China who technically *was* on his side and should still be on his side.

Xingke is still a good guy, as is his lady friend. Perhaps Tianzi will ask Zero to rescue the two of them when he rescues Kallen. Or if Lelouch is actually not going to attempt a Kallen rescue attempt, Kallen and Xingke will have to break out together. Either way Xingke and that Knightmare would be great allies for as long as he stays alive.

**Episode 10: When Shen Hu Wins Glory**

- I seriously don't get how the show expects me to root for the guy kidnapping a little girl with a gun to her head as she sobs in terror.    
- Xiang-Lin, okay. That's the lady. I don't think I'll remember that, though.     
- Tohdoh has a new Knightmare! And it has hair. It looked silly on the Nadleeh, it looks silly now.    
- And Suzaku is right on schedule to fuck with Lelouch's plans.    
- Though, transporting by truck is pretty clever.   
- So Lelouch is gathering political allies internationally. Pretty smart, it's what he was lacking last time.   
- The Empress really likes older men, apparently.    
- And Captain China has it all figured out.   
- Rakshata recognizes the Knightmare. Guessing this is the "weapon" the Eunuchs mentioned?   
- And Captain China kicks everyone's ass.    
- So this Knightmare is too powerful for a pilot to handle, aka the Tallgeese. But Captain China's already dying, so.    
- Did Kallen just lose because she wasn't recharged? That is... tremendously embarrassing.    
- On the one hand, Deithard is being extremely logical. On the other, Kallen and the Guren aren't just "another combat loss." Knightmare and pilot together are the single reason the BKs don't lose to the KotRs.    
- Nice picture of Milly blatantly groping Shirley there.   
- ...and a picture of Lelouch with CC. Is this where they figure out that it is him after all?    
- What.    
- Okay, Anya has a picture of Lelouch as a kid. For one, how is she old enough to have taken that? For another, will this spur Milly's memory? This feels like it could be a game changer.    
- Oh damn, Captain China just completly took Lelouch for a ride. Well played, Xingke.    
- Maybe you should have fired the hadron cannons earlier. And repeatedly.    
- And now the High Eunuchs... turn on Xiang-Lin, Captain China and the rest. That seems tremendously stupid.    
- Something tells me this is Keikaku Doori for Schneizel.    
- Lelouch has one final "trick" up his sleeve, it appears.    
- ....and Lelouch is in Ashford.    
- What     
- No seriously, what     
- Oh, I can't wait to see how he pulled this one off.

I think that was the only thing people really remember about this episode.
>> ARTICLE
> I seriously don't get how the show expects me to root for the guy kidnapping a little girl with a gun to her head as she sobs in terror.

Lulu is basically Cobra Commander of G.I. Joe fame. The show never denied that. Lulu struggles between trying to do the most efficent thing, and doing the most right thing. Today, efficency won out. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but the fans act like he's this great guy. I'm confident in saying that aside from Charles, VV (?), etc, he's probably the most morally reprehensible character in the series. All the more so because he manages to convince people / (himself?) that he's being righteous. 

He's a straight-up Villain Protagonist at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
You got that backwards. He convinced himself that he is villainous. Lulu deliberately make Zero, Cobra Commander. The point is that he could only go so far before he hits a morality wall and couldn't go any further. He could point a gun at a child, but it is another matter entirely for him to actually fire that gun. You will see soon enough what I mean.

Remember; Zero is all about theatrics. Zero say a lot of things. Many of which are outright lies and only for the purpose of making himself look cool. Just understand that what Lulu say is often not what he truly meant. And sometimes he even lies to himself.
>> ARTICLE
> He convinced himself that he is villainous.

Convinced my ass, he IS villainous. Or do we forget the whole part where he betrayed his closest allies because of his completely selfish motivations? Do we forget the part where he mindwiped an innocent girl without her consent because he decided for himself that it was best for her without asking her what she wanted? 

He's a terrible person. I have no doubt that if killing Tianzi was standing between him and Nunnally, he'd shoot her in the forehead in a second. 

The fandom's boner for Lelouch grows ever more inexplicable to me as the series goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
Again, it will all make sense in the end.
>> ARTICLE
People do not necessarily like characters, or find them to be interesting, based on their morality alone. 

Is Lelouch a great example of virtue, purity and respect for human rights? No, but that does not make him a bad character. Personally speaking, I like the fact he does have more range than full villainy, yet I wouldn't want to be his sibling or friend in real life at all.

>> ARTICLE
I think he's an interesting CHARACTER. I just think he's a repugnant human being. 
>> ARTICLE
In that case, it's a matter of degrees. I am honestly critical of his twisted sense of morality, but I don't hate him. 


>> ARTICLE
You can believe what you want. Lulu has that effect on people. He never behaved like someone who wanted to be loved. I won't argue about your interpretation of him, just keep in mind he s a VERY, very good liar...
>> ARTICLE
What is there to interpret? He took a young girl hostage and wiped out another person's memories. Those aren't things a hero does.
>> ARTICLE
I would explain, but I think it is best that you see how the story progress. And villainy is not determined by what you do, but why you do it. Lulu is... hard to read. Both Suzaku and Lulu lie. I can't say more without spoiling.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes, the [Utopia Justifies the Means](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans) approach. I saw that there was a large Code Geass entry under the anime section but didn't read any of it.
>> ARTICLE
That's not what I mean... You have to separate what Lulu say he does, from what he actually does.

Case in point, using an example that isn't a spoiler; he accidentally Geassed Euphie and got a lot of people killed. Did he say it was an accident to anyone? No, he just told everyone he murdered her. He also made it look like this was all some elaborate plot that he orchestrated, when it was really a horrible mistake.

There will be other, much more obvious example in the future episodes. Lulu lies; he is not actually as Machiavellian as he SAY he is. If you take him at his word you are being tricked.
>> ARTICLE
> So Lelouch is gathering political allies internationally. Pretty smart, it's what he was lacking last time.

Except for Xingke *right in front of him* who probably would have helped again. Neither of them want to see the empress handed over to Britannia.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, except for that. That was stupid of him. 
>> ARTICLE
> Did Kallen just lose because she wasn't recharged? That is... tremendously embarrassing.

Yeah it is. I thought they recharged the Knightmares when they were in the truck. Maybe that Kamehameha/Galick Gun standoff drained her of most of her energy.

> Okay, Anya has a picture of Lelouch as a kid. For one, how is she old enough to have taken that? For another, will this spur Milly's memory? This feels like it could be a game changer.

Interesting way of looking at that, though I think Anya had just taken a picture of a photo of Lelouch as a kid. And what do you mean by "spur Milly's memory?" It's just a picture of Lelouch as a kid. Are you referring to her knowledge of him being a prince?
>> ARTICLE
> I thought they recharged the Knightmares when they were in the truck.

Kallen mentioned getting resupplied when they made it to the truck.  Guess there wasn't time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's dressed all fancy-like. It might help Milly remember he's a prince. Though I suppose he could just be rich/noble, it depends on what Charles rewrote his false history to be.

I'm slightly embarrassed that I didn't even consider the fact that Anya took a picture of a photo instead of taking the picture herself. 
>> ARTICLE
She did scroll through a bunch of pictures before coming to the one with young Lelouch. So maybe she didn't take the picture of the photo at Ashford, but rather somewhere more royal, wherever Charles lives maybe. Then when Suzaku said "hey, that's Lelouch," Anya remembered an old photo she took.

I don't know if this is even important at all, but maybe it could be. Anya might not know who Lelouch is at all other than him being a student at Ashford. So she'll wonder why the royal palace (or wherever she took the picture) had a photo of him as a child.
>> ARTICLE
> So she'll wonder why the royal palace (or wherever she took the picture) had a photo of him as a child.

Does Anya ever wonder or think about things?  She doesn't seem to have many opinions on well anything.  She's like Rei Ayanami with a penchant for taking cell phone pictures of everything.  Actually compared to her Rei has a big personality...

The quiet ones always have the most to say. Anya might end up doing something incredibly important.

I wonder how Zero knew of Xingke's plan and was able to disable his support ahead of time.

Nice that Td has a mech on par with the better Britannian units now, I expect him to be a serious threat considering how good he was at tactics before. And he already shows that by putting the Forbidden City behind him and stopping Suzaku from firing in case he missed.

An entire Cheese-kun family now, CC's collection is growing. Wonder when she was last there.

The High Eunuchs tried to use the empress, yes, but Lelouch isn't any better for doing the same. And he discovered the coup plan by coincidence as he was preparing to do it as well. I'll let this one slide.

So there's the mech with the Chinese people in the OP, was wondering when that would come into play. And as is the rule with these things, it's better than the previous mechs in so many ways and they need to show it off.

Huh, Kallen being taken hostage changes things. Some nice words from Zero about saving her but I'm not inclined to believe him at this point. Diethard has a good point about favoritism too.

Blah blah there's a battle, Black Knights retreat. Is threatening the empress to get the Chinese forces off of them not an option? Oh, and the eunuchs turn on Xingke. Again.

...Lelouch is at school too? Well that's a neat trick. Wonder if it's Rolo in disguise or if there's something else going on.

* Last episode until we start doing two at a time, and Im already spending like an hour writing these things. Oi.

* Weird how that third superpower never actually gets brought into play. Like, why even bother making it if you never use it?

* I wonder who C.C. thinks shes talking to when she does these narrations.

* [Kinky.](http://i.imgur.com/xZLoTRb.jpg)

* Is Zero using our plan for his own purposes? Well, it is kind of what he does, dummy.

* Respectable of Li to still continue trying to talk Zero into releasing the empress rather than just straight fighting him.

* What do you mean, It cant be!? Did you forget how he sort of trained you as a Japanese, brah? What made you think he wouldnt be fighting for his country? Exactly how much did you repress?

There are fundamental differences between the two concepts. The simplest explanation in military context is that 'strategy' is everything surrounding battles, while 'tactics' is everything that happens during a battle. To give examples, "weakening enemy forces by targeting their supply lines" is a strategy, "draw enemy fire to a certain point and have someone sneak around and attack them from the rear" is a tactic.

In other words, strategy is the large big picture, tactics are the small things that comprise them.

So the Chinese hierarchy is a bunch of scumbags?

India is now in the mix too, and they want independence from China. Im glad weve been hearing more about other countries and not just Japan.

Oh cmon. Just tell us where Jeremiah is already.

[Awkward?](http://i.imgur.com/4GLvTVI.jpg) Barely.

They still have the [otter costume.](http://i.imgur.com/R6X7mQP.jpg)

[CC still manages to get pizza even when on an island in China.](http://i.imgur.com/lZs9XKD.jpg)

Odysseus to be the groom. Britannias moving fast. Hopefully Uncle Li can help solve this problem.

The Chinese Empress seems quite young even for an arranged marriage. I guess it wouldnt be that uncommon though.

Gino is hilarious. Is this made out of potato? I mean, I can eat it, cant I?

Lloyd and Milly are still to be married, and Kanon making strange jokes that maybe arent a joke? Idk.

Nina takes off her glasses and shes beautiful. What a concept. What the heck is she doing here anyway? Whats Schneizels angle?

Yes. Lis going to save the Chinese Empress. [Shes adorable.](http://www.gfycat.com/ShyUnimportantAmericanalligator)

Damn, Nina. Youre not wrong, but you dont have to be so harsh to Milly.

Suzaku. Smart move blocking Zeros view.

This chess match is going to be more tense than anything in this show so far.

Anyas still a mystery. Always recording things. Whats her game?

Much prettier than her wanted poster. At least Gino is still being awesome. 

[Ninas as unstable as ever. ^dem ^background ^reactions](http://i.imgur.com/rOlED1f.jpg) Schneizel you picked the wrong date to bring to the party.

Gino [putting in some face time](http://i.imgur.com/QLeN6Ww.jpg) with Kallen showing her hes a friendly face from the opposition. I dont usually do the whole shipping thing, but Id be ok with this one.

Oh, and in that quick flashback, [Arthur was biting Suzaku.](http://i.imgur.com/19hpddj.jpg)

Yes! Uncle Li Xingke to the rescue! [The Empress really wants to be saved.](http://www.gfycat.com/ResponsibleDazzlingDotterel)

Damnit, Lulu. Xingke needed his moment to be a hero. Sigh. Hell still get it, I think. Anyway, Zero stealing the Empress. No idea why. Just to have the Chinese leader? Interesting move.

So Jeremiah goes missing for a bunch of episodes and comes back even more powerful again. Forget that. I dont like him.

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Im still unsure what Schneizel gains from bringing Nina to the party. Maybe it was to make sure Nina was on his side. He was playing on Ninas soft spot for Euphemia. When the time comes he can use her bombs for his own reasons. Nina just thinks shes helping avenge Euphemias death or following in her footsteps or something. I hope its something like that or just anything at all because Nina made a fool of herself. Nothing to be gained from that.

China isnt really an ally. Lelouch just made a deal with Xingke because China was the closest place to escape to. Is that the gist of it? Lelouch must have a bigger plan in place now that hes kidnapping the Empress. Kaguya may have had something to do with that. Perhaps shell talk to her friend and create a new ally for Zero. I still think the Chinese hierarchy will act without the Empress authority, and Xingke is going to be pissed off as well.

In the preview for the next episode, Lelouch says he will finally have the power to confront Charles once he checkmates the Chinese Federation. I wonder if hes talking about pure military strength or if theres something more to China than meets the eye. Maybe they have some sort of connection to the Geass stuff that Lelouch plans on harnessing. At the end of the episode, VV talked about Zeros true objective being where he was, which was somewhere. On an island, maybe near one of the artifacts? Why would VV have an idea of Zeros plans before we do? Planning for the worst I guess.

No new solid info for more theories yet. All I can guess is that maybe Zero is planning a big power grab possibly relating to Geass/the artifacts.

I normally avoid cross-faction shipping but there might be a chance with these two.

I expected crazy, I didn't expect weird cyborg upgrades. Going rogue would have been more entertaining.

A good question and I'm wondering the same. Do we know what Ganymede is yet? Or was that not even something Schneizel had her working on?
>> ARTICLE
> Do we know what Ganymede is yet? Or was that not even something Schneizel had her working on?

If they've told us, I don't remember.

As for Jeremiah, I wish he went rogue. I thought it was stupid they used *him* the first time for those cybernetic experiments (which apparently had something to do with CC iirc). Now just because he hates Zero he gets free upgrades. I feel like there's nothing to him anymore other than "I hate Zero. I'm going to kill him."
>> ARTICLE
All the stuff with Jeremiah was probably the weakest part of the series for me... The experiments were really not planned out well (on the part of the experimenters). And Jeremiah... I feel like he has some sorta mental disorder, and it has nothing to do with what Lelouche did to him. That was just the straw that broke the camel's back, there's something just fundamentally wrong with him.

He already did that though. And if you recall, he didn't go crazy until after he heard Zero's name, before that he was still quite the gentleman.

He's still being used by Britannia (or at least Charles and VV) rather than acting as an independent agent though. I'd like him as a force of nature kind of deal, wiping out anyone that stands between him and Zero.

Well that's a nice explanation of what happened with the Japanese people moving over to this Chinese island. Now that they got that out of the way, back to the action without any further consideration for those million people being uprooted from their lives and their struggle to find a new home, I'm guessing.

Well, at least they're talking about the larger political situation. I do wonder why India and China are so willing to help though. Interesting that they're moving part of Gawain to a different ship, but glad they could salvage at least some of it. "Knight Giga Fortress" being Jeremiah's craft that's missing? Can't wait for him to show up again.

Taking out the Chinese capital makes it easier for Lelouch to beat Britannia? Not sure what his reasoning there is yet.

[That sexual tension.](http://i.imgur.com/VLSubGC.png) Asking her to come back to Ashford with him isn't solely for the student council's sake. Ah yes, the [Ikaruga.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8MoniJKCjY) Excited to see Zero navigate a bullet hell soon.

Odysseus is the first prince! I mentioned the possibility the first and only time he showed up previously. Good job by someone in Britannia or the Chinese Federation to head off Zero's plans. Schneizel's doing, suspected it might be him. [I don't know who this woman on the right is but she's cute.](http://i.imgur.com/e8vm1QA.png)

I'm liking everyone's outfits at the reception. Milly bringing more fanservice here. Heh, I like Kannon. Schneizel has unusual tastes, eh? Damn, Nina, you're moving up in the world.

Aww, Li Xingke made a promise with the empress. Won't end well for him, I'm guessing.

Nina bringing the heat on Milly there. She has a good point about Milly, and the academy's always been a sort of shelter from the harsh situations in the rest of the show.

Chess... for Suzaku? Wonder if he's going to cheat since Schneizel always beat him, but that's not something worth wasting his Geass on. Oh Lelouch, you think Schneizel has some extra plan so you scrap your own.

Okay, Nina's less stable than I thought. Love that scene though.

Xingke's not done yet! Good timing for Zero to step in with the distraction and steal her away.

Aaand we have Jeremiah with VV now. Fun.

[Wild speculation turn 09](/s "A three-way battle begins between Xingke's group, Britannia, and the Black Knights. Suzaku nearly gets Zero before Xingke forces his focus away and Kallen kills Gino in their escape. Anya is mildly depressed by that until Suzaku comforts her and they start dating.")

So I know this is a couple of days late, but i wanted to make an important point about the chess game. Lelouch had the win, but only because Schneizel gave it to him. Lelouch then refuses due to his pride. This is important, as it tells Schneizel how Zero will react if they face in battle.

* Well, China seems to be exactly the same, minus the *system* of government.

* Tamaki is lucky hes a good fighter. You cant just go bragging that some guys got castrated and expect to live.

* India is not Nowheresville! They export very tolerable customer service operators.

* Diethards voice is so deep. Just imagine if *he* became a Eunuch.

* Why does Rakshata constantly sound like shes on the edge of orgasm? Is someone just eating out her voice actress while shes saying her lines?

* I dont know what was happening with him at that time. Standard Heroic BSOD, Kallen; do you even TVTropes, girl?

* Do I even wanna know how she twisted herself mid-fall to end up in [this position?](http://i.imgur.com/coWuJmx.jpg)

* [C.C.: Immortal witch, pizza lover, cockblock queen.](http://webm.land/media/mKXv.webm)

* What?! A political marriage?

* * Yes, and for some reason it isnt between you and me. Damn post office, screwing up the paperwork.

* Kallen: Thats what happens when you underestimate your siblings, Lelouch.

* * Lelouch: I have like eighty! I cant keep track of what all these bastards are doing! Oh, and Im not insulting them here. Like a good 95% of them my dad had out of wedlock.

* I would have liked to hear *that* conversation between Schneizel and Odysseus.

* * Schneizel: Hey, bro, I need a favor.

* * Odysseus: What?

* * Schneizel: I need you to marry the loli empress of the Chinese Federation.

* * Odysseus: Depends. Can I get access to her makeup stores once were married?

* * Schneizel: Yes.

* * Odysseus: Im in.

* Gino flips from sadistic and cruel to quirky and charming so much Im half-convinced hes bipolar.

* Lol. Lloyd is like, Well, technically were still engaged, but I just want you to know Ill be constantly cheating on you with my work.

* Did Kanon just make a pass on an engaged women with her fiance right in front of them? Eh, its not like Lloyd actually cares.

* Schneizel is such a chameleon. He reminds me of Iori, always changing the way he acts to best suit the situation.

* * Lelouch: Sub, bitches?

* * Kallen: Why did I have to come?

* * Kaguya: Im standing next to Zero!

* Youre relieved? Well, Im mostly relieved that you didnt kill us all back at Ashford, but yeah, I guess Im happy youre also feeling better.

* I hate women who have no depth to them. WHAT THE FUCK?!! Are you seriously telling me that in the two, count em, TWO instances you actually met face-to-face you were able to see how much depth and love she had for you?! And the first time it was because you were being threatened! It could have been literally ANYONE else had they threatened another person! You are not fucking special! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, YOU INSANE, OBSESSIVE CUNT?! ***THIS*** is why people hate you! Well, that and other reasons that I cant go into right now

* while you swim in your own hypocrisy! Never has that phrase ever been as ironic as it is right now.

* Whoa, back up. Geez, I got so fueled by my hatred for that psycho lesbian bitch I almost missed that line. You and Suzaku are cousins? Think you could have shared that information with us sooner? Or maybe they did and Im just too stupid to remember.

* Yeah, Suzaku did sort of forget that if Zero hadnt admitted that he had killed Clovis, he would be rotting in a sack in the ground right now.

* Kaguya is still so optimistic. Poor girl clearly has never had to job-hunt before.

* Lol. You seriously didnt anticipate that he would just copy your moves until stalemate?

* [Yeah, you sure look like you are.](http://webm.land/media/eGvb.webm)

* Why does no one call Clovis on this? Like, going back to the first episode of the season, this is pretty much the only way you can cheat at chess, and its by putting *yourself* at risk. Its against the rules to put your king in check or checkmate, and with them both being such good players, theres no way they both (or at least Lelouch) forgot that. Not to mention, even on the extremely slim chance Lelouch did forget, theres still a room full of nobles in there. And not *one* of them pointed out that he just made an illegal move? And if for some reason in this version of history that rule was never added, it would have been nice to at least tell us beforehand.

* Oh, and Lelouch? Fuck your humiliation. Win the fucking game; theres way more at stake here than your petty sense of pride.

* Okay, I actually need to go take a break for a few minutes because of how fucking angry this stupid bitch has made me. Im sorry, /u/Durinthal, but I honestly have *no clue* what you see in her. Fuck, if they would have just let her die

*Several minutes of banging my head against a wall later*

* As much as I didnt want to have to expose you guys to this fucking bitch with audio, I have no choice. [You have to hear the stupidity leaking out of this dumb cunts mouth.](http://webm.land/media/Pl8t.webm) The only good part is how the dub VA is able to capture the insane obsession not heard again until [Madoka Rebellion Spoilers](/s "Cristina Valenzuela nailed Homura going demon on everyones ass.")

* Honestly, if anybody has *any* respect left for this mother of a fuck after *this* shitshow, Im seriously concerned for you.

* And Schneizel just brushes it off like a bird had flown in. At least he didnt try to force Zero into removing his mask.

* That Priest: So, should I do the Princess Bride routine, or do you want us to just get on with it?

* At least Li is there to kick ass.

* Sadly, Nina doesnt get a katana through the throat here.

* [Its like that scene in Future Diary where Yukki kissed Yuno to give her the final push she needed to kick major ass.](http://i.imgur.com/c0jJZzr.jpg)

* Do I even want to know where Lelouch was hiding to be able to drop those flags and grab in her in one fluid motion?

* Lelouch, how do you plan on this in any way raising your image with Li? I get if you want to fool the others, but you really do owe him, and youre not exactly making your case better for the Lelouch-haters watching this.

* And we end it with Jeremiah sounding bad-ass. Of course, this isnt hard when your VA is Crispin Freeman.

Well, this is episode was a series of ups and downs. I can only hope people are finally beginning see *why* those of us who have seen the series hate Nina as much as we do. Go ahead and start wildly swinging a knife; almost cause an international incident, why dont ya, you retarded excuse for a smart person?

While she is crazily obsessed, I don't think Nina actually thinks Euphemia had special feelings for her. I think she knows that it's all one-sided; Euphemia's her goddess, far above her and compassionate to all mere mortals.

**Episode 8**

* Zero that girl is way too young for you. You need to shut that shit down yo.
* Will be good to see Nunnally's planned ~~masaccre~~ nippon S.A.C thingy come to fruition
* No more one sided mech battles woo!
* I am curious to know how the Geass works if Suzaku is still responding to the "live" command. Does that mean that some of the Britannian officers he commanded earlier could still be desperately trying to do X in order to help the Black Knights? Could he still go and find Cornellia and ask her questions that she would have to answer?
* Yuri girl is stealing the spotlight back this episode. Good to see it was more than just a cameo before
* Still don't know what the fuck happened with the nuke mech
* More horses? No complaints from me
* And we find out what happened! Yuri girl actually went through with it, her loyalty to Princess Euphy despite the slaughter brings tears of pride to my eyes
* Lloyd please keep being snarky as always
* Please tell me he really will betray the Black Knights and that this isn't just some HA! I FOOLED YOU WITH MY CHESSMASTER TRICKS! moment
* Suzaku you better not ruin this opportunity to be rid of the Black Knights
* WHAT THE FUCK?
* YOU MEAN 1 MILLION PEOPLE CHANGED IN ZERO CLOTHES IN LIKE 7 SECONDS? 
* AND WHERE WERE THEY HIDING THESE CLOTHES? BARELY ONE OF THEM SEEMED TO BE CARRYING A BAG OR SUITCASE
* Fuck logic
* You're not welcome here
* And what nation would recognise them having the legal right to be exiled? Should I dress up as Al Capone so I can go to Alcatraz right?
* Just kill them, they may not all be Zero but they are still insects that dirty Britannia with their presence
* "The people? You mean the elevens" FINALLY SOMEONE TALKS SENSE
* *Sigh*
* What's with the weird ass iceberg anyway?
* Zero is gone! The Black Knights are gone! End of show lets wrap it everyone
 
**Episode 9**

* I suppose you could make the next 15 or so epiosde about Britannia invading China
* They deserve a good bit of Britannian justice
* Oh look, by letting them go you enable them to turn the Chinese empire against you, WHO WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE COMING
* FUCK YOU SUZAKU
* I WAS SUPPOSED TO LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
* The only reason this season has anymore episodes is because you lack the mental capacity to do what must be done
* Woah, it's the reverse fall-onto-characters-chest 
* Nobody likes you Kallen; stop taking up screen time
* There's no Pizza Hut on your iceberg C.C so no more Cheese-kuns for you either
* Wait but she has Pizza? Has she betrayed Pizza Hut???
* YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
* Whoever is behind that masterful Britannian plot will be declared my new favourite character
* I just love seeing Lelouch's face when someone screws his plans over
* And the award goes to...*drum roll*...**Schneizel!**
* Apparently he is voiced by Troy Baker in the english dub? Good stuff
* All the women in this show seem to have massive boobs, what part of the alternate timeline caused genetics to change that way?
* Yuri girl is the escort? I guess she was in the carriage before but I didn't quite expect that
* Scheniezel/Best guy looking fabulous
* When will this show end. It should have stopped at season one when Suzaku pulled the trigger
* I'm putting all my hopes and dreams into Schneizel pulling up this show to greatness
* For that matter the first order of business should be killing that anoying ass princess Zero has attached himself to
* So now is perfectly acceptable moment to Geass everyone under his command but not at any point previously in the series?
* I thought the game ended at checkmate, so why is he allowed to uncheckmate it? Are they just throwing the rulebook (like logic before it) out the window?
* We all mourn Euphemia's death yuri-girl ;_;
* Even table-kun...
* School prez is the only person smiling in that room. It's super creepy given the context.
* Fucking chinese. You mean to tell me that you have absolutely no security at a Britannian wedding so that that a bloody swordsman can break open the front doors before you even notice? 
* Oh so you did bring guns as well? WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT THEM RIGHT AWAY THEN?
* I can't handle this show. I'm going to be hospitalized for high blood pressure at this rate.
* How old is that girl anyway? I love Britannia and all but you've got to have standards...
* RoboJere reveal! So he did survive last season as I expected. He seems to be slightly less Robo now though. Wonder what V.V has given him to kill Lelouch?

So two episodes as promised. Has been hard to keep consistent as of late because of work and such. Doesn't help that the first thing I want to do when I get back home is fall asleep...
Will try to be on schedule until the rewatch is over but I make no promises. You can pretty much predict that I will be raging at things anyway, it is just a case of how much rage.
That's why you read my posts anyway, so I shall not disappoint!

> There's no Pizza Hut on your iceberg C.C so no more Cheese-kuns for you either

Lelouch made sure there was a Pizza Hut built on the iceberg before shipping out.

And in general I agree about logic going out the window. Not that there was ever that much to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought the game ended at checkmate, so why is he allowed to uncheckmate it? Are they just throwing the rulebook (like logic before it) out the window?

I'm fairly certain that the creators of this show have no idea how chess actually works other than taking pieces and saying checkmate.  Schneizel's move to give Lelouch the win is impossible.  It's a fundamental rule of chess that you cannot move your king into check, that's why the game ends when the king can't move anywhere without being in check.  However for the sake of symbolism or metaphor or something dumb "chessmaster" Schneizel **INTENTIONALLY** puts his king in check!  Of all the dumb illegal moves for that game to end on that's the dumbest possible.

>> ARTICLE
The game was already over, at that point it was all just mind games. Are you gonna but in and tell the prime minister of Britania and the worlds premier terrorist leader to fallow the rules?
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, it's an alternate history, who's to say the rules to chess didn't slightly change in a world in which the exiled British monarchy in North America went Social Darwinist and expanded across 1/3 of the world.
>> ARTICLE
Figured as much. Britannia makes its own rules.
>> ARTICLE
I also enjoyed Schneizel's comment that the Emperor would've taken the piece without hesitation because there's no way in hell the Emperor would waste time playing chess with an enemy commander he'd probably just shoot them and be done with it.
>> ARTICLE
That is the same Emperor that rather than just kill Lelouch or throw him into a dungeon beneath Pendragon, came up with a contrived plan involving mindraping not only him but also the enterity of the largely irrelevant student council of certain Ashford Academy thousands of miles away and replacing the enterity of the remaining students.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, that's what Schneizel expects the emperor to do under normal circumstances. Lelouch being zerp, leading a rebellion and having geass are the definition of an abnormal situation.
>> ARTICLE
All evil villains have a phase where they make convoluted traps that the hero escapes in some clever way. Doesn't matter how ruthless they normally are. Well, except for that one guy in Kingsmen. 

That and I blame CC
>> ARTICLE
" If the opponent does not claim and the arbiter does not intervene, the illegal move shall stand and the game shall continue."

From the FIDE rules. Seeing as there was no arbiter, it was on Lelouch to claim the win, and he did not want to do that. This happening is far more conceivable than some of the positions we have seen when they show the chessboard.

**Episode 9: A Bride in the Vermillion Forbidden City**

- The Empress is still really cute? I want to hug her????     
- The High Eunuchs are helping out the Japanese, but I'm still curious as to the cause of Captain China's grudge.    
- So Horai is where the Japanese are staying temporarily. I wonder what the long term plans are?    
- Oh, Tamaki. You crude lout. It's kind of endearing.    
- More Knightmares! I wonder if India will play a bigger part? Interesting that the Chinese Federation is giving them a sanctuary, but India is giving them Knightmares with the hopes that they'll get independence from China. I smell a gambit pileup!    
- Deithard wants to turn Zero into God. Okay. And Charles wants to kill God. Where did God come from in this?    
- Oho, so they salvaged the Gawain? And Jeremaiah's giant spikey ball? Iiiiiinteresting.    
- Okay, so the Chinese let you in and give you sanctuary and the first thing you think about is overthrowing them. God, this is why nobody likes you, Lelouch.     
- Nice fall and convenient land-straddling-Lelouch, Kallen.    
- "Kallen, when this is over, will you return with me to Ashford?" This line makes me sad.    
- CC puts Tabasco on her pizza YES CC THERE WAS A REASON I KNEW I LIKED YOU.   
- Should I know what the Ikaruga is other than a great Dreamcast shootemup?    
- ODYSSEUS DUDE THE EMPRESS IS LIKE 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU    
- WHAT THE FUCK DUDE    
- I like that Tamaki, literally in the span of a few lines, went from "it's no big deal" to "SHIT WE'RE FUCKED"    
- So this is Schneizel's move, huh? He's literally playing his older brother, who in theory should be closer in line to the throne, as a pawn.     
- oh no Empress you look so scared and sad you need a hug    
- Cecile says the Empress agreed to it, but the Empress' body language says otherwise.    
- Everyone but Suzaku fails at food forever.    
- I like that neither Lloyd nor Milly know what the fuck is going on with their engagement.    
- So Kannon is Schneizel's aide "public and private"? I bet that line launched a thousand fanfics.     
- Of all the people schneizel could have brought as a date, I would NOT have guessed Nina. Wow.      
- I guess she just really likes the Britannian royal family, amirite???    
- I kinda feel bad for Odysseus, like he's trying to be friendly but the Empress is just like NO I AM UNCOMFORTABLE STRANGER DANGER     
- Aw, Schneizel invoking Euphy to Nina is kind of cute.    
- Nina just wants to make sure her friends at Ashford are doing well. And of course she recognizes those boobs. Face. I meant face.    
- So this is what the High Eunuchs get; Britannian titles. Interesting. So, let me get this straight. The High Eunuchs are planning on selling out the Black Knights to Britannia. The Black Knights are planning on betraying the High Eunuchs with the help of India. Captain China's faction is... doing something. And it's all coming to a head at court. Fun.    
- Oh, so the tiny Empress saved his life. That explains his loyalty.    
- This pinky-swear is fucking cute. So that's what Captain China is about, he's sworn to protect the Empress.      
- And Kaguya's choice of date causes one hell of a stir.   
- "Who should I bring to the wedding of my best friend? I know, the guy who's trying to tear down her husband's empire!"    
- And Kallen's there too.    
- I like that Gino seems to have a thing for Kallen based solely on the fact that "she's the pilot of the Guren and that means she's a badass."     
- "I hate women who have no depth to them." Was Nina just calling out Milly? Holy shit, that's cold.     
- Wow, Nina, that went from 0 to 60 reaaaaal fast.    
- The Empress hates getting involved in politics, but now that means they'll be risking the life of her only BFF.   
- Kaguya and Suzaku are cousins, huh?    
- Man, Kaguya is SHARP. She's dancing circles around Suzaku rhetorically.     
- This chess game just became really interesting. If Lelouch wins, he gets Suzaku. If he loses, he gets exposed. I can't see either possibility happening this early in the game.    
- Yep, Gino has a crush on Kallen.     
- I'm pretty sure nobody who made this show had any idea how the fuck chess tactics work.     
- THAT'S NOT HOW CHESS WORKS       
- Still, interesting that Schneizel references not underestimating the "white king." If Lelouch is the "Black King," that's setting Schneizel up directly as his main rival. My "Schneizel is final boss" prediction holds strong.     
- Schneizel has Lelouch's number. Also, still not how chess works.     
- And here comes Nina to lighten the mood with some revenge murder.    
- I feel bad for her. I really do.     
- "I'm Japanese." "No you're not." Nina, for someone so smart, you're fucking dumb.     
- Does therapy not exist in Britannia or something? Because Nina needs some, stat.     
- Like, okay. Nina being a little unhinged aside, I really do sympathize with her feeling betrayed by Kallen and also by Suzaku, the one "Eleven" she'd almost come to trust.    
- The Empress is under no delusions about her fate. She knows she's going to be a hostage, and yet...        
- .... and yet she'll be saved by Captain China!      
- Who is a fucking badass.     
- See, unlike Lelouch, Captain China immediately considers that the person he's doing this for may not want his help. He does, however, immediately disregard it.     
- Awwww, she does remember.     
- Wow, for being a loli she sure does have some hips.    
- Aaaaaand now she's captured by Lelouch. Way to repay him for his help, douche.     
- NO LELOUCH SHE'S FUCKING CUTE AND INNOCENT DON'T HOLD A GUN TO HER HEAD     
- God dammit Lelouch       
- And VV and Jeremiah are having drinks in the desert. And Jeremiah's getting upgrades. 
  
The more I watch, the more Lelouch seems absolutely like a villain protagonist.

I believe Rakshata said that she *tried* to recover Jerm's mech, but couldn't.  This does explain how C.C was able to get back up from the depths of the sea, though.  Also explains why they won't know about Jerm's continued vital signs.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel bad for her. I really do.

This is probably because I've seen the whole series already, but I don't. At all. I have no sympathy for her; she's just an insane, obsessive bitch in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
She reminds me of one of my favorite characters from the Ace Attorney games, Adrian Andrews from PW: Justice For All. Adrian appears cool and stoic but is concealing psychological problems, namely a codependence problem that leaves her needing someone strong to build her life around. She ends up trying to frame someone for murder, but she's a very sympathetic character.

I think it's pretty clear that Nina has mental issues (perhaps something similar to Adrian Andrews' codependence disorder), she's not getting help for them, and even from the glimpse we have we see Schneizel invoking Euphy not once but twice to motivate her. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he kept nurturing that posthumous devotion to Euphemia to make her more willing to make weapons, rather than letting her get over it. 

I mean, Code Geass is a show that's asking us to root for someone who murdered his older brother, lied to his closest allies, abandoned said allies to defeat and capture just to go after his sister, killed who-knows-how-many innocents in the crossfire of his plans (see: Shirley's dad), fucks with the brain of innocent people (see: Shirley), and in this episode alone kidnaps a child who's obviously terrified of him.

I think Lelouch, while being a fascinating protagonist, is many many times more reprehensible a human being than a girl with obvious serious anxiety/mental issues who clearly needs help getting over her grief and isn't getting it.

And we're not calling Lelouch a cunt. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can see that (though I've never played any of the Ace Attorney games). I still fucking hate her, but that may be for some stuff that happens later on.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of obsessive people in this show.  The non-obsessive ones tend to get squished.
>> ARTICLE
I don't feel that bad for Nina. She formed a crush on Euphemia because she stood up for her (when she really was standing up for everyone) in the hostage situation. Then when they finally meet, Euphemia says a bunch of nice things, and Nina's obsession becomes worse. So once Euphemia dies, Nina flips out. She was going to blow up Ashford Academy and all of her friends. Was Zero still even there at that point? She still hasn't let her hate go, and remains unstable. Did she really think she could kill Zero with a knife in front of all of those people, trained soldiers included? She needed help. She needs help. Since they probably won't get her any, she's going to continue to be an unnecessary problem.
>> ARTICLE
And we haven't even gotten to the worst part yet.
>> ARTICLE
TBH, it would have to be something really, really bad and hateful to make me think she's a worse person than the protagonist we're ostensibly meant to be cheering for.

Nina's fucked up but Lelouch too often seems *malicious.*

It's Schneizel who's keeping her around for the purpose of making bombs. And he's also clearly using her feelings for Euphemia to do it, he's dropped Euphy's name to motivate her twice now that we've seen. 

I think he wants her to be dangerous, because then she'll have less hesitation to create bigger and better bombs. 
>> ARTICLE
> I think he wants her to be dangerous, because then she'll have less hesitation to create bigger and better bombs.

Ooooooh. I like that. Nice reasoning.
>> ARTICLE
Here my thoughts:

* Milly knows next to nothing about dress code. That cleavage is tasteless even for a 50 cent music video.

* Schneizel intrigues me. He appears to be a sharp manipulator and a tool of his father's Empire, but he also looks benevolent and easy-going, not as ruthless and impulsive as his (late?) sister Cornelia. And he's also a bit I'm-so-over-this-imperialistic-shit, isn't he?

* Kaguya is probably the only good thing about the Chinese Federation, a country where 20-something samurais aren't afraid to display their sexual feelings towards little princesses. I kind of prefer Britannia, if you ask, I don't mind the totalitarian thing compared to this.

* And this is when the Gino x Kallen ship sailed out. And never returned to port.

* "Tabasco" - Yet another reason to love CC.

* Nina is a disgusting racist and an out-of-control maniac. That character is awful, I highly doubt anyone can feel sympathy towards her. I don't know what kind of statement was Scheneizel trying to make by choosing her as her companion to the engagement party. Plus, the table is still crying.

* More Lloyd and less Rolo = YES PLEASE
>> ARTICLE
> Milly knows next to nothing about dress code. That cleavage is tasteless even for a 50 cent music video.

It's her amazingly subtle plan to see if Lloyd is even slightly hetero.

>> ARTICLE
I think this happens in the next episode so I'm going to put it as [spoiler](/s "Xingke implicitly (for me, quite explicitly) proposes to the princess who's basically in kindergarten. To top this, there's a kind of flashback when he met the princess (she was even younger) and it's quite obvious he not only developed a sense of loyalty towards her, but a sexual attraction from that very moment. Really cringeworthy IMO but unsurprising considering the Chinese Federation sold her out to Britannia like she were part of a catalogue")

That happened this episode.  And I think you're reading in a sexual attraction where there is none.
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree. Going down on one knee before royalty isn't at all sexual, and the Empress was so young that a physical manifestation of a promise would have made it much more real. Even Euphemia got a physical recognition of loyalty from Suzaku by knighting him; for the tiny little Empress, locking pinkies was much more appropriate than touching his shoulders with a sword.

**-- THE FINALS --**

Well, to put it bluntly, I'm voting for Steins;Gate. [And this here is the reason why.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140316140252/dragonball/images/6/64/We5ikbG.gif) Well, that and the gorgeously well-done plot, the endearing characters, the marvelous visuals. But mostly that.

The biggest thorn in Code Geass's side is the particular uniqueness of its visual design and art style. Mostly due to how some more critical anime fans may consider Geass's characters resembling anorexic, high-school-student-cosplaying Slender Men more so than human beings. Shit's kinda iffy, in my personal opinion, but I could see the appeal in it. 

Both series are known for their complicated and interwoven plot points, their captivating characters, and, most importantly, their fucking kick-ass endings.

With that, then, I'd see the main advantage that Geass has over Steins is that many people would probably see the ending to Geass as better and more well-done than that of Steins.

But, is that going to be enough to give Geass the edge overall? My apologies, but I really would rather think not. Personally, Steins;Gate has an iron grip on my heart, and I think on the hearts of countless others. It has its reputation for a reason, and it wholly deserves it. I think Steins;Gate is going to take this tournament, everyone. And if there had to be one series I would rather have win this thing other than 'Gatari, it's Steins;Gate.

[**Steins;Gate has come here to drink Dr. Pepper and kick ass, and it's *all out of Dr. Pepper*.**](http://31.media.tumblr.com/7fa63887e0e008a65a84004c8a499c3d/tumblr_mxtp6lAxct1r3rdh2o1_500.gif)

Good game, would play again, now it's time to strategically retreat back to /r/araragi and [lick our wounds](http://24.media.tumblr.com/de0ad06cf58a7beef2b2636bd9fbeb4f/tumblr_mr0bf7bTyg1rbtx3po1_500.gif).

Also, to anybody who hasn't seen the top four shows yet, you need to get on that. They've survived through this bloody battle royale for a reason, alright? I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari *are* among the best anime has to offer. (EDIT: Although there are other amazing and fantastic shows that just haven't been able to garner enough attention to popularize themselves, mind you.)

And I would really like the idea of a movie-exclusive tournament, although I don't think I'd be able to contribute very well to it. Outside of Satoshi Kon, Makoto Shinkai, Ghibli, Summer Wars, and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and the quintessentials like Ghost in the Shell and Akira, I must admit I'm not too well versed in the realm of anime films.
>> ARTICLE
Running down my List, I've seen 40 movies. Some of those are actual feature-length movies. Others, like [Tsumiki no Ie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5365/Tsumiki_no_Ie) or [Harmonie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20903/Harmonie) or the regrettable [Eikyuu Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1106/Eikyuu_Kazoku), are shorter and more OVA-like. So I'd probably be more informed about the movies than I was about the series... Plus, it's easy to just sit down and have a movie night. 2 hours and done is much simpler to organize than the 4-to-6 hours for many full series runs. That should make for interesting nights as a decent percentage of /r/anime get together and watch movies for a week or so.

> I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari are among the best anime has to offer

While I do agree with this, I also think some of the best shows anime had to offer got unceremoniously crushed, while some of the mediocre to downright bad shows made it pretty far. But of course these are opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was definitely thinking about that, take a look at the edit.
>> ARTICLE
of the 4 I hadn't yet watch 'gatari yet. It seems from MAL that the 3rd season is the best. I'm almost done with the first, and dang I find it draining just to watch. It's good...but exhausting. 
>> ARTICLE
Good but exhausting is exactly how I'd describe the show, yeah :P

Make sure you're watching everything in the right order, including the last 3 unbroadcasted episodes of Bake (they aren't on Crunchyroll). It might be annoying if you've already been filled in on this, so sorry, but Bake > Nise > Nekomonogatari: Kuro > Monogatari Series Second Season, in case you haven't.

Also, tell me what you think/thought of episode 12 of Bake when/if you've finished it.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Bake like a week or so ago. Watched it on CR.

The show had something interesting happen in almost every episode, and at times I was very interested in what was going on. At others, though, I found myself a little bit bored.

It was a very weird show, if nothing else. I'd have a very difficult time describing what it's about if anyone was to ask.

I find I have trouble understanding Japanese dialogue a lot of the time. What I mean by that is, a lot of the time in anime characters will have an exchange and then one of the characters will have a reaction that to me makes no sense. They'll act as if they were just insulted, or they'll get a bit upset, or they'll make an exaggerated EHHHHHHHHHH?! face or whatever and I'll be like "wait what? why are you reacting this way?"

Anyways, the 'gatari series seems to be a very dialogue heavy show and so instances like this occur a lot more frequently than in anything else I've watched. I've never really hard anyone complain about this so I assume it's not a common problem. Also I'm a bit slow in general; I didn't understand that in the first like 8 or so episodes that Senjouafesafdrgahara was flirting with and interested in Araragi, and I find I don't 'get' or appreciate a lot of the 'witty' dialogue.

The point of this post, really, was to ask: based on this information, should I continue watching? I really wanted to like this show as much as everyone else seems to, but after season 1 it really seemed just 'okay.'
>> ARTICLE
Well, personal tastes vary so it may just not be your kind of show. With that said - a lot of the wit in the dialogue comes from puns made based on the structure of Japanese language. For example, at one point Araragi is talking with Hachikuji (whose name roughly translates to "89 temples" - this is important) and then fools with her name, for example calling her Shichikuji - this would alter the interpretation of her name to mean "79 temples" - with each mispronunciation, he is, essentially, devaluing her.

So a lot of this is going to get lost in translation, and things like that you can't really help. I feel like the banter is pretty witty on its own English merit, however, although it can indeed be hard to follow.

Ultimately, whether or not you continue watching depends on how much you enjoy the show. If you still think it's an enjoyable show even if you can't catch everything that goes on then sure, keep watching. But if you spend your time confused and lost, then no matter how much I like the show, I'm not going to continue to encourage you to watch it. Go find something else that you can actually *enjoy* watching, because ultimately that's the entire point of any entertainment medium.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for sure. Thanks for the response! I was mostly wondering if it gets notably better in the later seasons, or if its just more of the same.

Overall I guess I enjoyed it, but found it to be nowhere near 'masterpiece' or even 'really good' levels.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really say, myself, because I've just finished Bakemono and nothing else. I'm going to keep watching, and I'll most likely enjoy myself. Same to you though - if you can definitely say you liked it, then I don't see any reason to stop. The opposite is also true though.
>> ARTICLE
I was in the middle of 12 when you messaged me, lol. 

First, someone really needs to teach shaft how human heads work, I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke. 

12 seemed fine. Though I feel that all the "romance" in 1-11 was almost tongue-in-cheek or parody-ish. It was a more "proper" romantic episode. Mostly dialogue, but that's par for the course in this series. Is there something in particular I should be noticing? 

Also, on the site I'm at, I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?
>> ARTICLE
> I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke.

The worst part is, I think that Shaft still does think that.

>Is there something in particular I should be noticing?

No, nothing in particular, really. It's just that that episode is considered generally one of the better ones of the series until pretty much all of the Second Season arc finales, and a lot of people really like the ending  of the episode. I really liked it myself.

>I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?

No, you're good. Only the original 12 episodes were broadcast as part of the series on television (did you think at all during it something along the lines of 'man, this seems like it could work as a finale'?), and there are 3 final episodes that finish the Tsubasa Cat arc that Shaft set aside to release by themselves, combining to form 15 total episodes. It looks like the site you're using has everything in order, and saved you some work.

Still waiting for how they will treat Nisekoi season 2 when Marika gives the line "Raku-sama, your head is bent in a weird direction."

Hey man, you're under no rush, watch the shows you want to watch, and watch them at your own pace.

I have a very long to-watch list but I usually do like 2-3 episodes  a day. I've marathoned a few animes, though (NGNL, Steins;Gate, Gurren and Code Geass).

I just watched Clannad and it pretty much changed my life. Of the top four, I've only seen Steins;Gate. Guess I'm watching code geass next!

Alright, I'm back, and I finished 22 (not 23 nor the OVA/recap whatever it is)

[I really didn't expect that ending.](/s "I have to say, I didn't feel like it fit in with the slice of life that's gone on so far. So many feels from 16 onward, though. When Ushio died, man, that was harsh. After that it got a bit confusing with all of the feels going on at the time. I thought it could've been done differently but seeing the family together was amazingly satisfying and tearjerking.")

Will report back when I finish later this week. Or maybe tomorrow depending on if I want to swim through the rest of these feels before I drown ( [just watched 14](/s "that sudden pregnancy...") )

> 64- Space Battleship Yamato

Poor Yamato, even getting beat by some pretty terrible stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Poor availability really hurts that one just in terms of likelihood that anyone outside of Japan has actually even seen it, which is a shame because Yamato 2199 is a fantastic show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anyone that hasn't seen it but has seen whatever it's up against would certainly vote for the other one, especially if there's no talk or hype about it.
>> ARTICLE
Even when 2199 came out, there wasn't really all that much interest in seeing the classic. Which is too bad, as it is one of the better anime that came out in that entire decade. (Plus, unlike most people on this sub, I was actually alive when the original Yamoto came out. I wasn't yet out of diapers, but I was alive.)
>> ARTICLE
At last we come to the final round of the Chinese Cartoon Grand Prix. In a result no one was shocked by Steins;Gate and Code Geass move on to battle each other for the coveted /r/anime crown. As much as I hate to admit it the result of this match is pretty much determined already with Steins;Gate as the victor. Unfortunately for Lelouch strategy means nothing when your opponent is a mad scientist, and to be honest I'm not even angry. I'll take second place with pride as I retire to work on my orange farm, good on you Steins;Gate. 

The movie tourney sounds like a great idea. I quite enjoyed this one and you did a wonderful job running it. Looking forward to more.
>> ARTICLE
I know which one im voting for :)
>> ARTICLE
Rest in peace FMA and Monogatari. You fought valiantly, but you were merely lambs led to a slaughter.

Your comrade, Code Geass, will be joining you in this cold dead grave shortly.

All in all, I quite liked this tournament. Steins;Gate did its stereotypical run and there were a couple of close matches.

[NGNL rustled some jimmies.](http://i.imgur.com/aLhZiGi.gif) It probably got as far as it did due to it's "fresh" factor, but it isn't a TERRIBLE show as many people make it out to be. If you started watching the show, you were given it at face value. If you expected any significant character development and no otaku pandering, you came to the wrong place.

Yes there's excessive fanservice, and there might be a certain crossing of lines, (I'm looking at you Shiro) but it's a fun show to watch if you can not get hung up on the "[Super Healthy Space](http://i.imgur.com/L04VDI3.jpg)". It's no great work of art, but it's a show you can enjoy the ride for. 

----

For future tournament formats, I would love to see one excluding the "super popular" franchises so it would be much more volatile. (e.g. no Steins;Gate, FMA, Code Geass, etc) An underdog tournament if you will.

I was pleasantly surprised that Kill la Kill and SAO ranked so low (still pretty high all things considered), but I guess they couldn't beat out the classics such as Angel Beats, Clannad, and Samurai Champloo.

Since we all already know the flaws of the shows that got shot down in this tournament. What does Steins;Gate really fail at? What blemishes could have been improved or was it an untouchable masterpiece? 

One of the major plotholes I see is that "Time travel will ALWAYS have a problem, whether in the future .... or in the past".

Thanks for reading my musings, and I quite enjoyed this tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate*

sorry, it really bothers me
>> ARTICLE
Sorry about that.

I thought I caught all of them >_>
>> ARTICLE
I admit, NGNL being ranked so high maxed out the rustle meter on my jimmies. I agree with what you're saying, it's not a bad show. It knows what it's doing and who it's doing it for, and it executes that particular flavour of entertainment pretty well. But god, reading testimonies of how it's up there with the fucking titans of animation just gets my blood boiling man.

I know, I know, I shouldn't care. Enjoy what I enjoy and leave it to that, but WHO IN THEIR FUCKING RIGHT MINDS COMPARES MADOKA AND NGNL AND DECIDES NGNL IS THE BETTER SHOW OH MY GOD I'M SO MAD ABOUT SILLY JAPANESE CARTOONS.

I realize it's stupid, but I guess I just want my viewpoint to be reinforced by the community I feel a part of, and it hurts seeing a show that I feel is so painfully, painfully mediocre and striving for nothing but, get above what I consider truly meaningful pieces of art. 

EDIT: stupid typo, thanks Arbalor
>> ARTICLE
Meh. Some shows just need to be taken at face value.

If you overanalyze your run-of-the-mill anime, all you're gonna get is bored. It's just a fun anime, and should be viewed as such.

Yes many of the "great" anime tackled great questions and were meaningful works of art, but NGNL is NOT one of those. Not by a long shot. 

Just accept that it's never going to make you question your world and see reality in a new light, and accept it for what it is. Pure unadulterated fun and stupidity. 

Arkada who does Glass Reflections for anime similar to this style. (along the lines of Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) Stu-fective. Stupid yet effective. Stufective. It's not any literary masterpiece, but it sure as hell is fun.

Just don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine. If you want some more intellectual fare, I would suggest Steins;Gate, Ghost in the Shell, or Welcome to the NHK. This is not one of those, and there are MANY more that are better at conveying a message and being a piece of art.

TL;DR Don't overanalyze it. Sometimes the curtains are just blue and it doesn't mean anything. Your AP English teacher can try to convince you that it represents the melancholy that pervades the human spirit as much as she wants, but sometimes the author just means that the curtinas are f*cking blue.
>> ARTICLE
I accept all that, trust me. It's just that, to me anyway, for a piece of art to cross a certain quality threshold, it needs to attempt to tell me something important in a unique way. So when I see a list of "top anime", it bugs me to see a show that I don't consider having crossed that threshold for me personally. Again, I fully acknowledge I'm in the vocal minority on this, and am probably being a humbug. 

And also, I feel KLK and TTGL did stupid fun a lot, lot better than NGNL. I think it did stupid fun with an interesting twist, with unique characters and beautiful animation, and a plot that wasn't centred around weekly doses of deus ex machina.

To be honest, analyzing shit is what I enjoy the most about entertainment. I like shows like Breaking Bad, I like movies like Memento, I like feeling like I'm not only being entertained, but I'm also being taught something. I think that feeling is really, really cool. I don't think that's the only way to enjoy art, or the 'right way', but it is definitely my way. So a show like NGNL that offers nothing beyond the surface at all, bores the utter crap out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Meehhhhhhhh. To each his own.

I totally understand your desire to search out entertainment which also can be thought of on a deeper level. It's a personal choice and it's a great way to judge/enjoy those works.

But trying to apply that to every product of entertainment isn't going to work out well. Intellectualism isn't the focus of any series the majority of the time and judging them on the scale of Breaking Bad and Memento is unfair to all shows in general. They simply aren't geared for that type of audience.

They're for a more juvenile crowd which just doesn't need as much in terms of deep thought. 

This is not a list of "top anime". This is literally a popularity contest in every way shape or sense of the word. This is your high school student council elections all over again. The most popular person wins and the same will be applied to this "tournament".

This is NOT an accurate representation of the "top" anime. It's simply a bracket system which pitted anime of differing caliber against one another and was sorted by the amount of votes.

This isn't indicative of much besides how /r/anime feels about these anime in this particular instance of time.

I agree that analyzing shit is fun, but if you try to analyze SpongeBob Squarepants you're just wasting your time. It's meant to be a source of entertainment with little to no substance (deeper logic, social critique, etc) 

Not everything has to be a piece of art, just the exceptional CAN be. Only the top 10-20 percent of shows have this aspect and I believe it's extremely unfair to judge the rest of those on that standard. 

TL;DR NGNL is entertainment NOT art. Anime can be art, but the vast majority of it is just there for fun/sales.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka is a much better anime than NGNL. I honestly had more fun (enjoyment) watching NGNL. IDK if most people voted on their objective best or what they had the most fun watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Really just depends how you are comparing them. I loved madoka but not as much as the average anime fan apparently. Ngnl however I thought did stupid, ridiculous and hilarious fun amazingly. I couldnt get enouth of it and personally got enthralled in it more so than madoka. Probably in the minority though lol
>> ARTICLE
I'd say you are in the majority. It is just the loud minority that hates NGNL.

Madoka my friend cause god knows ngnl is atleast better them mahouka

WHAT!?! BUT FMAB IS AMAZING!?
>> ARTICLE
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood was amazing, but Steins;Gate is by FAR the standout anime at this point.

Unless you're talking about something else entirely, I don't think that FMA truly beats Steins;Gate in many categories. 
>> ARTICLE
I think its safe to say that there will always be flaws in every show but i feel like the best are the ones that make you overlook the flaws without a second thought. I felt like FMA brotherhood did this the best for me(which is why it is my favorite anime, and one of my all time favorite shows) but the fact that some other people feel that others did it better is fascinating.

Im in the middle of Steins gate and i can say it is spectacular, but it was this subreddit that made me watch it because it wasnt on crunchyroll. I only recently got into anime(only used to watch toonami and adultswim back in the day) and i kept seeing it being praised here and then people were betting on it to take the win against great shows like fma and code geass? "Well shit, now i have to watch it."

Ive put quite a few other shows on my to watch list because of this tournament so i really enjoyed it. And Super Healthy Space too fkng good lol. Kind of annoying that people are hating on it for being good at what it tries to be:fun. 
>> ARTICLE
I quite agree that great shows will be the ones that make you overlook the flaws.

Everyone remember's their first time watching Stein's Gate and I hope you enjoy it as much as many of our other members seem to have. Don't forget to rewatch it to see what you may have missed the first time through.

Recently getting into anime isn't really too much of a problem in my opinion. It's about what you get after you come here. There's a niche for almost everyone, and I'm sure you'll find your stay here quite enjoyable.

I agree that the Super Healthy Space was hilarious. Some times you just need to accept something and move on. If you take things too seriously, then it just gets ruined. Shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill would never be good. NGNL isn't quite on that level, but you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.

It's not MEANT for you to take it as a social critique of child pornography. It pokes fun at fanservice by going excessively overboard with their fanservice. (Notice they removed all genitalia and nipples, common points of censorship) If you take it at an intelluctual level it has gone a couple miles over the line. (11 year old pedophilia much?) 

But it's meant to be a fun show that shows off how brilliantly amazing these shut-ins are and how even magic and [furries](http://i.minus.com/iVPXhWiVv9zSz.gif) can't stop their quest for world domination.

It's an otaku empowerment anime and the otaku pandering is almost a given.

I hope that you enjoy the rest of Steins;Gate and you find many more things to watch in your adventures as an otaku.

Could I get a name or two of shows that are on your to-do list? You don't seem to have a MAL or anything, and I'm quite interested on what you will be watching!

Thanks for the conversation and I hope you have a great day!


>> ARTICLE
Ive been binging quite a bit of shows on crunchyroll whenever i get the time and im getting around to starting jojo, log horizon, and twgok because my friend recommended them. But from the good things ive heard and their placements in this tournament ive decided to check out Haruhi Suzumiya, Angel beats, Hunter x Hunter, spice and wolf and psycho pass. Ive seen most of the other entries.

Yeah its a lot now that i look at it lol. This is going to take a while considering ive got League and a few currently airing shows to keep me occupied. Oh and real life too lmfao
>> ARTICLE
Looks like a pretty good lineup!

Log Horizon is great. I finished marathoning it in like 3 days. And there's a fall season coming up soon!

I haven't watched Haruhi yet, but I have experience with most of the others. It looks like a good list to go on thus far to be honest. Angel Beats pacing sucks quite a bit though so just power through it. The feels you get are pretty worth it.

Spice, JoJo, and TWGOK are pretty niche series, but if you liked the initial premise it shouldn't be too bad of watch. 

League is great, and this season's currently airing shows are pretty amazing thus far. I followed the manga of Akama ga Kiru and I hope that the anime adaptation does it justice.

[Real life is just a video game with shitty gameplay.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/48/486b454f99e9a1962b3defc0b5d5338348214aade0d97b33b231537e87a23b6d.jpg) Seriously though, enjoy your summer. I might give SAO 1&2 a whirl if you really like the concept of Log Horizon. Latter half of SAO1 was mediocre, but the new season is looking pretty amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ive seen SAO1, i enjoyed it although i definitely prefer badass asuna to damsel in distress asuna. 

Im one of those people who will usually like a good show if it has at least some enjoyable qualities, regardless of how niche. And im pretty good with shows with slow pacing, for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its magic/science really interesting.

I have high hopes for Akame ga kill, havent read the manga because i just dont have the time, but from people who have all i hear are good things about it. Zankyou no terror is shaping up to be pretty great too. Im going to wait for a few more weeks to decide if im going to pick up any other airing shows.

Good talking to you though. Enjoy your summer as well.
>> ARTICLE
> for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its ONE TRUE TATSUYA IS MY ONII-SAMA

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the original can still hold. I'm interested in Mahouka from the worldbuilding perspective (and will probably start reading the LNs after the show is over) as well as because of /r/onetruetatsuya, so it doesn't need to be an either-or scenario...
>> ARTICLE
I mean i watched it, had fun and all, but 6th place against all other anime ever made? uwot

Can someone explain this hype to me
>> ARTICLE
The hate for NGNL is seriously getting absurd on here. Like jesus Christ. Is it THAT hard for you to grasp that a show meant for fun and enjoyment CAN STILL BE REALLY GOOD. Why is this so hard to grasp? A show doesn't need to be morose, dark, sad, or any of those just to make it into the top. NGNL did what it intended (for many people) perfectly, and that's why it's at a top spot.

Where's your bitching and whining about TTGL winning top 5?
>> ARTICLE
Because like you said, a show meant just for fun and enjoyment without much in the way of depth or meaning can still be really good and enjoyable.

The difference between TTGL and NGNL is that TTGL was really good and enjoyable. NGNL wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe to you. I found Gurren Lagann stupid. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah and you allso have a  shit taste, move on
>> ARTICLE
This is all turning into a circlejerk. Why not accept both shows were most likely placed high for good reason?
>> ARTICLE
Ughh the point isn't that it's a bad show dude. The point is that it's undeserving of its standing. Call me in a year's time when it doesn't even make top 64. That's the whole point. Yet because it's fresh, it beat out classics like Clannad and Madoka. Of course people are going to shit on it.
>> ARTICLE
Which I disagree with. Especially because TTGL made the list, while nobody had a problem with that being there. 
>> ARTICLE
It is 7 years old. I'd say it's passed the test of time.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, great hype is usually followed by unwarranted backlash. Both will balance out eventually, and people will see it for what it is. I wasn't part of the anime scene when TTGL aired, but I'm sure it garnered similar reactions at the time. Just gotta play the waiting game. 
>> ARTICLE
it was pretty easy to get into so lots of people got into it
>> ARTICLE
Nomination topic got downvoted pretty hard and the nominations were limited, so we can't say "against all other anime ever made" first of all. Secondly it's new and popular, and there are a lot of new anime watchers on /r/anime. I think I saw an age poll where the average was around 17 or 18. If this was an older audience, or this poll was held a couple years later, I don't think it would have done nearly as good.

Maybe this poll should be an annual or bi-annual event, it would be really interesting to see how much the standings change.
>> ARTICLE
Then it would only be the hype trains that showed any real movement, and nothing else would really matter.

It might show some demographic changes in the subreddit if nothing else, /shrug.

Kinda sad it got so much recognition while all i saw about my season favourite, Ping Pong, outside the discussion threads was 'lol art sux, dropped'
>> ARTICLE
I loved ping pong, and although the art style was unorthodox and strange, I thought it had its own unique charm that fit the story perfectly. I can't even imagine it in any other art style.
>> ARTICLE
If it makes you feel any better, I have Ping Pong down as one of my Top 5 anime. Its one of five that I've ever given a 10/10. 
>> ARTICLE
The art was part of its charm and I can't imagine how would it turn out if it was like any normal anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care how they animate it. Good story and good characters make a good anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong would have done a lot better if it didn't go against Geass round 1
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I had a feeling that Steins;gate was going to come out on top vs FMA and is probably going to win which tells me something really important. I really need to watch Steins;gate!
>> ARTICLE
Do it.... NOW!
>> ARTICLE
Just as a piece of advice, DON'T skip the intro EVER! And go do it NOW!

>> ARTICLE
Why shouldn't you skip the intro? Did I miss something?
>> ARTICLE
I never skipped it because i love it but i noticed that as you watch it, it changes it's meaning, adding to the show quite a bit. There is also a new intro on the last 2 episodes
>> ARTICLE
oh gotcha. yeah i agree, it's meaning does change as you learn more. I never skipped it either, but I thought you meant that there was something different in them that I never noticed.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Steins;Gate twice, and though I watched the intro most of the times I never really picked up on it being different. Any of the lyrical changes would just be using different parts from the full Hacking to the Gate song, right? Maybe I should have paid attention to reading the song subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
Changes in the last 2 episodes from the full song, yes
>> ARTICLE
The song stays the same but it conveyed more of a message as you go through the anime, giving meaning to the lyrics. Perhaps i'm just kinda dumb... Could be that
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I should pay attention to it when I inevitably watch it for the third time. But that won't be for a while, I feel content having experienced the series (dub+sub), movie, and visual novel (which is even better than the anime IMO).

I've been wanting to try the VN... Will give it a go when possible

He means how [](/s "the intro sums up the majority of the show and the main plot point, but you don't realize that in the first watch until you're mostly finished"). The intro doesn't change iirc except for the last eps.

Code Geass versus Steins;Gate is hard, but I know which one I've watched 4 times :D
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Code Geass 6 times. I think that Steins;Gate is a better anime overall, but Code Geass is my personal favourite.
>> ARTICLE
How is it possible to have one as a favourite but think the other is a better anime overall?
>> ARTICLE
One has obvious flaws yet you find more enjoyment in it? By your logic does that mean everyone's favorite NBA player has to be LeBron?
>> ARTICLE
Now it does, because I love the Cavs (in all seriousness though good analogy).
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that neither poll is a blowout yet. It's a fitting ending to the tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess I overestimated this sub's love of Monogatari. I had it beating S;G in the finals, but as I have said before, I would not have been surprised to see S;G, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, or FMA win either.

I do find it interesting that Code Geass and Steins;Gate are battling for the top slot. There are a lot of similarities between Hououin Kyouma and Lelouch, and these shows have two of my favorite endings of all time. In fact I once wrote a [large post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1kv16a/a_deeper_look_at_steinsgate_spoilers/) talking about these two very things, and using the similarities to analyze Steins;Gate a bit.

Steins;Gate and Code Geass are two of my favorite animes but...

COME ON GUYS!  CODE GEASS FTW!

Congratulations to Caleb for winning the [Bracket Challenge](http://www.bracketmaker.com/predict_list.cfm?parent=883051). If I did my math right, the closest competitor will still be 2 points behind him no matter what the outcome. For the late people, there are dates next to each entry. Just compare yourself to those that entered at a similar time to see how you did.
>> ARTICLE
I would be thrilled for the movie contest to be done as a condorcet method type vote ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method ) such as ranked pairs or schulze method.

Such a method produces much more "accurate" results, and determines every position rather than just first.  The drawback is it is not quite as fun since you do it only with one complex vote rather than many simple votes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh geez, I remember doing something like this for a math competition. To be honest, 64 votes are going to be intimidating for most people to do.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps do the Condorcet method in the first round, then use the results of that to make seeds for a bracket-style tournament? 
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't even matter who wins this.  I love them both!

Different Format: Double elimination brackets..... like fighting games with Grand Finals, Winners "Winner" vs Losers "Winner".

welp anyway it would be glorious have another tournament :)
>> ARTICLE
I think it would be fun to have a tournament with anime that don't get much attention on reddit. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with this would be in the voting phase. "I haven't seen either." would stomp both of the two competitors each time. Even with the popular anime in this tournament, that was a pretty common choice that racked up about 20% of the votes. I don't know how fun it would be for the majority of people to vote in something where they haven't seen many of the shows.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if we're given a wider timescale to work with... Ain't nobody got time to watch 8 full series in 24 hours like these polls gave us, so either you saw it before the ball opened or you had to pick None Of The Above. 

Maybe announce the vote on Monday and hold the actual vote on the following Sunday? That might give people enough time to find those less-popular shows via their usual *"perfectly legitimate means"* (*coughcough*) and give them a good watch before the poll opens. Also, too: Make it 4 shows per week. Again, that way we can give a full watch of whatever series we find interesting.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Guess a 1v1 voting system wouldn't really work. Personally I never voted "I haven't seen either", I just skipped voting when I hadn't watched the shows.

Wouldn't really be a tournament, but having a survey format could work. First survey you get to pick 3 anime. New survey for the top 20, limit it to 1 pick and there you go. I am just excited to see the results of who won, personally I don't really care about the 1v1 matchups..
>> ARTICLE
There's no way I can choose between these two...they're both among my very favorites and I've watched each of them 4 times, more than any other anime except for Cowboy Bebop. They were both extremely compelling binge watches that gave me major cases of post-anime depression. 

In the end I'm going to vote for Geass...only because I think Steins; Gate will win this and I want the vote to be as close as possible. 

It's been a fun tournament! ^^^Except ^^^for ^^^NGNL! ^^^I'm ^^^still ^^^salty!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, FMA:B vs Monogatari was the hardest choice I've had to make this whole tournament, they're both 10s for different reasons.

I think for me though, FMA just edges out by the smallest margin imaginable.
>> ARTICLE
It was sad seeing FMA lose, but both it and Steins Gate are great shows. However for the finals I can see Steins Gate winning hands down, primarily due to Code Geass' overall weaker second season. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Steins;Gate...but the one thing I felt is that some of the characters are just **too** strange.

I got used to it as the show progressed, but starting the show and seeing Mayuri, Okebe, and Daru be the way they are is odd.  They are very different.

I really did enjoy Steins;Gate though and I am only on R1 for Code Geass so I will not vote, I am fully loving Code Geass though.  These two are very good, and it was almost predictable that they would be finalists.
>> ARTICLE
If anything I'd say R2 was better than R1 for Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I actually preferred R1. The show devolved into "new, more powerful mech of the day" in R2 which kinda turned me off. Plus I was very disappointed with the resolution with Charles near the end. Too abstract for my tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
>one thing I felt is that some of the characters are just too strange.

yeah it's a good show. the brother sister thing really isn't as bad as it was in other shows. it has lots of fanservice (it's ecchi like sekirei, High school of the dead)

watch up to episode 3 and decide for yourself.

If you don't take it seriously, yes. It's a great show.


>> ARTICLE
Against Reddit opinion, I really liked No Game No Life. It hit my top 5 and the unorthodox drawing style made it even better for me. There is a lot of fanservice, but since I watched it in a group that just added humor at times.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a very shallow show, but the hype train rolls on.
>> ARTICLE
Agree on all counts that Steins;Gate deserves this win, it's of my top 3 shows for sure. Code Geass is amazing too. Sure, many fault the second season for this that and the other, but other complaints could also be said of Steins;Gate's first half as it isn't terribly interesting in isolation.

We should do this at the end of each season for that season's shows. It'll be a but short and maybe we can do double elimination for more accurate results

It's part of the "new anime flux" new shows that are solid are always shown to be spectacular until time washes over them and they're replaced.

Overall I thought it was a cool show but ended up dropping it at Ep 7.

How about a best character contest?
>> ARTICLE
This is outrageous. How did Code Geass make it this far?
>> ARTICLE
Because it is one of, if not the best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
You could not be more incorrect. 
>> ARTICLE
What did you not like about it?
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't you like Lelouch? He was the ultimate anti-hero. He was an excellent military strategist, he was charismatic, he was everything you could want in a character. [ R2 Spoiler](/s "And he ultimately sacrificed his own life, and his legacy to make the world a better place") If you watched the english dub, Johhny Yong Bosch did a fantastic job voicing him. What's not to love?

>> ARTICLE
That shit he pulled with Schneizel was a real ass-pull, though. I won't go into details, because I'd rather not have an entire paragraph of spoilers, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about and you've probably heard the same complaint before, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't really Lelouch being a bad character, so much as lazy writing. I agree that the whole thing as complete BS, but I still think overall, despite the sometimes lazy writing and deus ex machina stuff, Lelouch is one of the most well developed, and amazing characters out there.
>> ARTICLE
Of course this is all personal opinion but I felt like [Spoilers](/s "his character was far to unlikable for me to root for him in any way. I don't think he was the ultimate anti-hero, nor excellent military strategist (just pretty clever, but a bit dues ex and a bit douchey haha) and not even charismatic (he's just fake, nothing charming about his character at all).")[](/s "His actions were a little too unbelievable for me to really immerse myself in the show, and Suzaku's terrible character along side him just made it worse. I didn't enjoy the show anywhere near as much as other people because quite frankly I hated a lot of the characters and I was happy to see them stuck in shitty situations because of their so called "great leader". ")[](/s "Anyways, I still feel the show wasn't incredibly intelligent, just very well written. These two things can be mutually exclusive. Well written shows tend to flesh out everything nice a cleanly with characters that have depth (even if they are unlikable). I just don't feel like it was intelligently written. Half the time I felt like all of the plans on Zero's side were far too luck based or flat out suicide. Not to mention he got intercepted quite a few times. While this makes for a believable scenario, I feel like it costed the MC's integrity far too much. It could've been handled better. I enjoyed lots of the exposition and world building more than I enjoyed the actual interactions between Keikakku MC with his godawful leadership skills and his army/anyone ever. It was even more disappointing how the story just fell apart in the R2. It's been a long time since I've seen the show (watched it while it was airing way back in 06), I just never felt like it was worth a rewatch. But you know, regardless of how much I actively disliked Lelouch as a character, I still enjoyed the show, I just don't think it should be anywhere above the Monogatari Series." )

EDIT: ~~oopsie forget to close the parenthesis.~~ Spoiler tags do not work on giant blocks of text.
>> ARTICLE
I can respect your opinion I guess. What made him unlikable? He was pretty douchy at times, but he was smart, and he worked towards a good goal
>> ARTICLE
Being an awful leader. I thought he was a shitty leader.
>> ARTICLE
In the first season, he was a fairly good leader, and even at the beginning or R2. He gave Kallen the Guren, because she is a better pilot, instead of using it as protection for himself, and he wasn't a dictator or anything, he listened to the other members of the black knights. [R2 Spoiler](/s "He was still a good leader at the beginning of R2. In the second episode of R2, an ordinary soldier was trying to sacrifice himself to give Zero a few moments to escape, and lelouch tried to talk him out of it, and to not think of himself as disposable. About halfway through R2, he realized that in order to change the world, not just japan, he needed the entire world to hate him, and so he made several decisions to do so, he betrayed the black knights, and betrayed the country of Brittania even. If anything, I think this makes him a fantastic leader, he gave up his life, and his legacy for the benefit of the world")
>> ARTICLE
I'd said its worth a rewatch.  Maybe the show is just better marathoned.  If you ever do rewatch it, I highly recommend the english dub, the VA really increased how  much I liked Lelouch. I agree with almost everything you said, except for Monogatari being better than Code Geass.  I'd say the Monogatari series is probably my second favorite show of all time however
>> ARTICLE
I watched it in english while it was airing. And Monogatari is my favorite, personally I feel like it surpasses Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Really? It's a fun, campy show, but calling it "the best anime of all time" is a fucking delusion. A good analogy would be calling a cult-movie like Starship Troopers "the best movie of all time". (and I love starship troopers and I don't mind geass).
>> ARTICLE
"Fucking delusion" is a strong phrase. Perhaps you don't feel that way, however considering it's battling for the top spot in 'this' poll means that he's not far off calling it at least, 'One of the best anime of all time' 
>> ARTICLE
Most popular =/= best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
The difference being? What we consider best is generally directly related to the most popular anime. When you consider that like the top ten anime left on this list are also probably the top ten best anime and the most popular. 

Unless we all just agree "best" is entirely relevant to the viewer and therefore there is no such thing as best anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Example: NGE can very well be considered one of the best anime of all time by many people (critics and the seasoned anime watchers alike!), but it's not even in the top 10. Just look at the sheer amount of reception it's gotten worldwide. It's no secret that NGE was a groundbreaking show that is a true representation of how anime as a medium can successfully convey such controversial, yet well thought out themes and still also appeal to a large audience, yet it's not even in the *top 10* when it very well should be.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, just look at how far TTGL made it. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it's the best show of all time, it has a few too many flaws and plot holes for that, but it is hands down my favorite anime. Lelouch is an absolutely amazing character, and the plot was excellent, but the art is a bit odd, and there are some unnecessary filler episodes from here to there, and R2 started to stop making sense. R2 also focused too heavily on the mechs themselves, as opposed to Lelouch's master strategy. 
>> ARTICLE
YES! My favorite two anime in the final! Sorry Code Geass, but Steins;Gate gets my vote today.
>> ARTICLE
YAY! Elfen Lied beat bleach :)

I'm so salty Monogatari lost to all of these other shows, I can't even pick anything for the final considering I don't even like either one all that much :\

Salty it will likely come in 4th out of 64(and this is out of thousands)? Am I missing something? That's pretty damn good, dude O.o

No I'm salty that it didn't beat out Code Geass and Steins;Gate. I feel like it deserves to be at the very least above CG.

Aww man my two favorite anime...this is gonna be hard

totally called code geass winning over tittygill.  RIP in pieces.  i'm almost glad because that makes the final round easy - pitting two of my 10s against each other would have made for an *almost* difficult decision.

Where is Little Busters! ?? It should be in Top 20 atleast.

Also it might be fun to have a "greatest episode contest", where rather than the whole series you judge based on a single episode.

EG Madoka Ep 10 versus Steins;gate episode 12.  Would probably have to include spoiler explanations of what happens in the episode and why it is awesome.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series

I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation

In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.

Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-

Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.

Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.

>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

I love Akito the Exiled. It gives out so much yet so little at the same time. Many people complain that Sunrise is using CG instead of hand-drawn, but personally I like the CG better than the hand-drawn mechs, partly because CG is easier to understand when you're watching rather than two mechs decking it out in hand-drawn. 

(Also, I'm saying hand-drawn, but I don't know if I'm too sure myself if that's correct.)

The music is absolutely fantastic, especially during the fight scenes. I always love jazz, but when it's upbeat and intense like this, I fucking love it to death. Akito is an interesting character to check out, along with a few others. I can't say specifically for sure, due to that I haven't rewatched the episode yet, but I will after I'm done typing this out.

Overall, what I think so far is that Akito the Exiled, for me, is better than Code Geass R2. You might have different opinions on that front, but to me, that's how it is.
>> ARTICLE
Aww yeah dancing kid.

I haven't seen this episode yet and will probably be busy for the next 24 hours, so expect one post from me covering both later in tomorrow's thread.
>> ARTICLE
So, I just finished the first episode of akito the exiled. It is the first time watching this ova for me.

Some of my first impressions:

What I liked

-  CG gets a lot of hate, but god the animation of the knightmare fights are fucking gorgeus, I was seriously amazed by the fluent change of camera perspectives, it was a real eye candy.
Also the accompaniment was also top notch. 

-  Akito is pretty badass

- The goal of the rebellious group. I like how it is simple and yet so important: They just want to belong and have a place to live

- The mysterious guy at the end with geass.. I suppose his geass is the same or pretty similar to Lelouchs geass. The short flashback showed that his family (I guess?) was slaughtered, he probably killed the previous leader of the order because he failed to protect them

What did not impress me:

-  The instant jump into action.. I would have honestly preferred a little more exposition. While the fights were amazing, I would have liked a more defined starting point

- The Commander's (forgot her name tbh) past felt a bit uninteresting. The whole got adopted, her new brother despises her thing felt too generic.

- We got too little info on Akito, besides the fact that he seems like a good guy who is loyal towards his comrades... but I suppose it will be covered in the next episode, so that is totally fine.  

That were some of my initial feelings, overall I feel like this episode is mostly setup for the big fights in next one. Lets see.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so this stuff I'm a first-timer for.  I didn't do the take-notes-while-watching thing, so these are all post-episode thoughts.

* I was pretty confused for the whole initial fight  "Are these people with Brittania?  What about these people?  Wait, no, they're fighting with the first ones" and so on.  Figured it out eventually.  The setup of this part of the world seems a bit of a mixed up situation even after I did.

* Unlike in the original series, the title character doesn't seem to be the protagonist; instead it's this Leila chick.  Turns out she's an orphaned Brittanian immigrant to the "Europian" (what's with that spelling?) Union and is now with their forces.  All the same, she seems a lot more "anime-d up" in appearance than just about anyone else in the episode (and by that I mean giant hair decorations, ZR, frilly skirt) vs. the other women shown.

* The title character, Akito, is ~~an Eleven~~ Japanese, but is also with the EU forces.  Thus the "exiled", I guess?  But that would imply he was sent away from Japan rather than just having found himself stateless while away from a home that got yoinked.  Guess we'll find out later.  He seems to be Geassed in some way, and a complete badass fighter.  A lot like Suzaku.  However, he seems more jaded than idealistic.

* Just as Brittania stands in for Old-Europe-style colonialism, the EU seems to stand in for the messier democratic republic of the US, complete with decadent monetary elites, economic inequality, societal (but not official policy-based) discrimination, and so forth.  They even have their Japanese in internment camps, just like we did in WWII.  (You gotta wonder what became of any Japanese within Brittania itself when the takeover of Japan happened.)  The parallel isn't complete, though, since this EU doesn't seem to have any truck with Japan itself the way the US did in WWII.

* Instead of Black Knights, we have a tiny band (three kids) of underground rebels?  Terrorists?  Shit-stirrers?  Not really clear what they're after despite this business about "a place to belong", since nothing they were doing seemed in furtherance of such a goal.  (I dunno why, but I get a bit of a Rolo vibe off that hacker kid.)  And as in the original, they're brought into the protagonist's fold for an uneasy alliance.  Leila must have a lot of sway to pull that off after her super-level-headed boss was hijacked and held at sword-point.

* Meanwhile, back in St. Petersburg, we have a little business with Geassing one's boss to off himself.  And the dude doing the Geassing seems to have something to do with Akito.

* There appears to be a lot of allusions to back-story in the credits stills.  I can't divine a lot from them that couldn't be guessed without them, though.

* Others have commented on the CG mechs; I don't mind too much, I'm no purist either way.

* The high-energy jazz for the battles is an interesting choice, and gives this a fairly different feel from the original.

* Despite the amount of stuff that happened and the info that was dumped, this felt slower-paced than the original.  I guess that's really a testament to how super-fast the original was.
>> ARTICLE
> (I dunno why, but I get a bit of a Rolo vibe off that hacker kid.)

I did as well. A few of the characters reminded me of ones from the original series if only in their visual design. Like Ryo. He gave me a very Tamaki/Todo vibe, and Leila seemed like CC, also in that she had a very serious face most of the time.

> The high-energy jazz for the battles is an interesting choice, and gives this a fairly different feel from the original.

There was a fast paced, almost crazy song playing when Akito was fighting in the forest near the beginning of the episode. It fit perfectly as he started going nuts and killing everyone effortlessly.

Alright guys here we go:

- CG Mechs  I wanna quit 

- Theyre not even using landspinners. Theyre walking  thats bullshit!!

- The EU seems to have their own calendar ... good for them I guess but that makes it really confusing. If I didn't know this was set between seasons 1 and 2 I would have no idea when this date was.

- Yo that ain't C.C. who does she think she is, monologuing like that

- That ain't Arthur either

- Spider mechs, alright

- Thankfull at least one soldier knows how to use landspinners. That guy deserves a medal. And a promotion!

- KAMIKAZE!!!!

- Akito seems kinda Geass related

- Stereotypical racist military guy. I love those :3

- I really don't see where the advantage of the Alexander Knightmare lies so far. You wanna tell me that thing *crawls* faster than a Sutherland can drive? ... Alright I guess it can move like a monkey.

- Is Leila also Geass related?

- Much better sound design than the main series so far

- Alexander Knightmare Frames have boobs. NICE

- The movement of those Frames seem crazy un-mecha-like though

- Actually, the CG is pretty good so far

- No dude, mechs don't howl after killing an enemy. You're not a fucking vampire or some shit.

- Ah, richfags. Wherever you go, they're all the same.

- I see, so she is Britannian and he is Japanese

- This Akito kid seems a bit loose in the head

- Seems like a gang of rogues, probably a ragtag team of war orphans

- So ... is discrimination against numbers also national policy for the EU? Makes no sense because the Numbers system is a Britannian thing, so the EU shouldn't need to discriminate here right?

- GEASS

- Shin *Hyuga* Shain ...

---
Alright, so there is this SUPER obvious parallel between Shin and Akito and Lelouch and Suzaku. Shin seems to have a hypnotism based Geass just like Lelouch and Charles and the way that Akito talked about seeking death while being under a Geass curse is obviously a parallel to Suzaku.

So far, the action sequences are pretty good but feel a bit unnatural given the fact that the Alexander class Knightmare Frame moves so differently compared to every other Knightmare shown so far. I don't really like the fact that they added the unnecessary leg movement for standard Knightmares. As I said way back during season 1 episode 2's discussion: I'm a big fan of the mech design in Code Geass because they make a lot of sense if seen as an evolution of tanks. They move around by driving on wheels which gives the mechs a much more military-equipment feel as opposed to something like Gundams, where mechs are essentially just gigantic humans.

Other than that, I'm a bit torn when it comes to the action scenes. The CG is pretty good but I think the use of CG rigs made the director a bit too playful with the shot composition. I personally find the erratic camera movement a bit too over the top, albeit fitting most of the time. And despite how I don't really like how humanoid the Alexander class frame feels, I'm not gonna complain until I get an explanation as to why they perform this outlandishly.

I won't go into speculations but at least this time I managed to get through the first episode of Akito without dropping it halfway through like last time. Also we see Suzaku and most importantly C.C. in the preview for the next episode, so call me intrigued.
>> ARTICLE
The EU actually seems to use the Calendar that was actually put in place after the French Revolution and began with the declaration of the Republic being year 1 (or it might have been the storming of the Bastille, I can't really remember). If I remember my history correctly Floreal is April (each season was named after things to do with nature).
>> ARTICLE
> So ... is discrimination against numbers also national policy for the EU? Makes no sense because the Numbers system is a Britannian thing, so the EU shouldn't need to discriminate here right?

The Japanese in Akito are like the Polish soldiers in WW2. Their lands got invaded by the Germans, but the soldiers outside the country kept fighting. However they were screwed and backstabbed when the Russians invaded Poland and killed even more people and the other Allies allowed it, because they needed the Russians to defeat Hitler. The Polish basically got fucked by their own team.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that makes sense so I'll go along with it.
>> ARTICLE
> Theyre not even using landspinners. Theyre walking  thats bullshit!!

They can use both...and they do, as a matter of fact!

That is also true for the original show as well. Check out Code Geass S1 episode 9, when the Knight Police unit makes what is clearly a distinct walking motion while approaching Kallen's downed mecha towards the end. 

>So ... is discrimination against numbers also national policy for the EU? Makes no sense because the Numbers system is a Britannian thing, so the EU shouldn't need to discriminate here right?

Hmm...strictly speaking, there appears to be no national policy for discriminating against the Elevens in the EU. It's more that they are merely being treated as unwelcome immigrants and refugees without a nation. 

The rather crazy military commander at the start of the episode was going too far, but that was his prerogative. As uncomfortable as that behavior might be, it makes some sense if we examine both the past and current history of humanity. 

To put it simply, discrimination towards other races is not only practiced by people who live under totalitarian regimes. Within the context of the show, the EU is a democratic republic yet also a rather decadent one. They do not appear to be a truly prosperous society at this point. The war against Britannia seems rather stagnant too.  In that sort of situation, several Europeans are not too fond of having a bunch of stateless foreigners with a different cultural background sticking around.

>Alright, so there is this SUPER obvious parallel between Shin and Akito and Lelouch and Suzaku.

Indeed. However, I think the parallels go hand in hand with certain differences. For example, Akito shows more outward signs of mental instability than Suzaku.

>So far, the action sequences are pretty good but feel a bit unnatural given the fact that the Alexander class Knightmare Frame moves so differently compared to every other Knightmare shown so far

Well, look at how agile that old Glasgow was during the highway battle. I think we are meant to assume a similar range of movement applies across the board. It is simply something that is easier to produce thanks to 3D animation technology. 

>I'm a big fan of the mech design in Code Geass because they make a lot of sense if seen as an evolution of tanks. 

Speaking of which...what did you think of the non-Alexander robots the EU was also using? Specifically the redesigned Panzer Hummel and the Gardmare that Akito piloted.

>Also we see Suzaku and most importantly C.C. in the preview for the next episode, so call me intrigued.

Quite. I am just glad that this community exercise isn't happening too far from the third chapter's release date.

I cannot say anything about them, but the spoilers sound promising.

>> ARTICLE
> Speaking of which...what did you think of the non-Alexander robots the EU was also using? Specifically the redesigned Panzer Hummel and the Gardmare that Akito piloted.

I'm not too sure about that Panzer Hummel design. It looks unnecessarily bulky which isn't a real advantage on the battlefield when it comes to Knightmares. I think a Knightmare's greatest strength lies in its high maneuverability since they aren't supposed to tank hits that well. Usually they explode when hit a few times by a high caliber weapon so unless those are designed to be a lot more tanky I'm not really sold on them. 

The only time we see Panzer Hummels in the main series is when Suzaku manhandles them one-man-army style, but since Suzaku's main weaponry consists of beefed up Slash Harkens, MSVs and VARIS rifles, there was never an indicator in the original series on how tanky Panzer Hummels were compared to Sutherlands.

The Gardmare reminds me a lot of SVCs from Starcraft :p

Overall I think the EU has pretty shit Knightmare designs, that excludes the Alexander so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think it's still significantly better than the original Panzer Hummels that appear in a single episode of R2. It does lack agility, which is a weakness compared to Britannian KMF models, but I wouldn't be surprised if the armor is in fact stronger thanks to that extra bulkiness. 

I don't mind the Gardmare looking a little like a SVC since it seems to be mostly meant for guard/escort duties rather than purely conventional combat.

Ah, Reddit.

Personally, I think No Game No Life has a quite interesting storyline, but that's not what caught my attention.

It's the first anime I've seen with such a unique art style - bright, as if making everything seem happier; and the characters are outlined in red ink instead of black.

I hated Madoka Magica's crayon-esque drawing, but I really enjoyed NGNL's unique art style.

>> ARTICLE
I wonder whether people who are still disappointed by how far NGNL got are going to vote for it just to see the backlash that would happen if it actually won the whole tournament. I'm not going to do that, but I sort of hope it happens just so that people realise how stupid it is to hype every new show that's at least semi-decent up to high heaven, just because it has broad appeal (unlike a certain great show that aired in the same season as NGNL).
>> ARTICLE
> people who are still disappointed by how far NGNL got are going to vote for it just to see the backlash that would happen if it actually won the whole tournament. 

I believe that the opposite will happen. They're going to vote against it and desperately try to stop it in its tracks now that it's defeated Madoka *and* Clannad.

Lol youre probably right, havent finished steins gate yet so as much as I loved ngnl I cant vote on it myself but all I hear are good things about it. In comparison to ngnl which people love to hate because of the hype behind it. True it isnt as good as madoka in a critical sense but I liked it more than madoka. The hype probably swung the vote in its favor since its still fresh, but it doesnt make it a bad anime. In fact, despite ping pong being superior if i look at the shows objectively, ngnl was aots for me because it was the show I wanted to watch most every week. And it didnt disappoint in giving me a lot of fun.

And toradora taking it isnt that much of a surprise what with death notes slight dropoff in the second half, while toradora is considered THE romance anime.
>> ARTICLE
> In comparison to ngnl which people love to hate because of the hype behind it

Trust me, people aren't hating on it because it makes them cool LOL.

>> ARTICLE
Idk a lot of people seem to really like it, but everyone who hates on it always says the same thing. That its just a pretty show with fanservice that got more hype than it deserves. If you dont like it thats cool, everyone has different opinions, but more often than not people will call your opinion shit if you say you like any of the popular shows that get hated on. 

Its wrong to think that every show should be judged from a critical standpoint only. Transformers movies are absolute shit in terms of actual quality, the latest one is the worst of the bunch, but they consistently all performed well from a financial standpoint. I dont like the movies, but if I were to tell my teenage cousin who liked the movie that its shit and his opinions are shit, i would be wrong. Just because the plot,characters, pacing, and basically everything about it was terrible, who am I to say that his OPINION is wrong. He likes terrible movies, good for him. At least he knows what he likes and doesnt like, which is something that cant be said about a lot of his friends.

I feel bad comparing ngnl to transformers because it actually is a good show that is more than just good visuals and fanservice. You may not see it that way, which is cool, but others do. It isnt like the only reason it got votes was because of hype. I think itd be safe to say that if the poll was held when the hype dies down, it wouldnt be a complete 100% vote win for madoka. Some people genuinely liked it better than madoka, myself included. 
>> ARTICLE
So reading some of the other responses to you I see a lot of people claiming that the hate for NGNL comes largely due to the hype. And to a certain extent this is true, as people have said they don't want it representing anime to outsiders, and they don't want the industry to keep moving in that direction. But the reality of it is, it would be just as hated even if it was not popular, people would just be less vocal about it.

There are a bunch of reasons it's hated. Let's start with the fanservice. It's not just regular old fanservice, it's loli-incest fanservice, pretty much as low as you can go right there. Even some of the official artwork is pretty much porn. Then we can get to the fact that pretty much everything in the show is calculated to make the typical anime nerd like the show. It's a show that is designed to be popular and it's sickening to see that work. 

Now that is not something that is unique to anime at all. Pretty much everything on American TV follows a formula of what they think an audience wants to see. I was just watching American Ninja Warrior and they spend more goddamn time telling people's stories than showing people tackling the obstacles. Take older shows like Survivor or The Apprentice. Each season they would spend more time on the scheming, more time on the tribal council/ boardroom, and less time on the actual challenges. This is commercial entertainment trying to sell shows the the largest audience, and NGNL is doing that to the extreme.

So when you look at it what do you have. You have a piece of disgusting commercial entertainment smut. Yeah it might be funny. Yeah it might have some great characters and awesome scenes. If you stripped away all the bullshit and had anything left of the show you might have something pretty darn entertaining, but to me it's just goddamn revolting.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not fanservice distracts from something is relevant. If the fanservice overloads the story then there's a far more legitimate criticism but while I didn't particularly like NGNL, I can't say fanservice therefore bad. Fanservice is ultimately part of marketing and is unfortunately what most people's tastes have forced certain anime to devolve into. However at the same time, NGNL did a decent job at staying on track with the storyline. Also the difference between "disgusting commercial entertainment smut" and NGNL is the fact that NGNL has a trajectory that is separate from the fanservice.

Just because something is loli-incest fanservice, and as wrong as that might be, in regards to fanservice and affecting the content for Black Bullet, a friend of mine stated:

>thats a bit of a superficial complaint. Sure, as someone who doesnt have any strong pedophilic urges and actually thinks its quite monstrous to want to do sexual things with people who are a much younger age then yourself, I may find it disturbing, but lets be honest; that has nothing to do with whether or not the series is poorly written. Make all your characters look like Jeanne from Nobunaga the Fool, only give them cat ears and a rabbit tail (someone photoshop that so I can use it as my avatar). I dont care as long as playboy cat Jeanne is a well-written character.

This is a sentiment I agree largely with and simply saying fanservice isn't a good reason to say NGNL is crap because anime contain more than fanservice. It is indeed bloated and somewhat detracts from the point but the storyline is very present and real in comparison to shows like Infinite Stratos that is riddled with a poorly done harem that detracts from the actual substance by replacing the actual story in multiple episodes.

There are plenty of reasons why NGNL is bad but fanservice doesn't change it from something special to something horrible.
>> ARTICLE
I was not dismissing it because of fanservice. However the particular nature of the fanservice is extremely revolting and people are absolutely justified in writing it off for that alone (which is a sentiment I don't support for any other form of fanservice).

But that was not my only complaint. The commercial nature of the show is not just about the sexuality, it permeates the entire plot and structure and is inherent in the source material as well. Every aspect of the show from the comedy, to the references, to the plot twists and characters is calculated to appeal to it's target audience. And quite frankly that would be a massive turnoff for me even if any of these calculated decisions appealed to me to begin with.

I could see arguments being made that KLK is the same. Its full of fanservice, bit as I said that in of itself does not bother me. It is certainly self indulgent and caters to its fans. But that is not all it is. It takes all of the anime tropes and ramps them up to 11 to show how absurd they are. NGNL is playing it all straight, using every single clich crutch there is. Maybe that may be a subtle difference to some people, but to me its night and day.
>> ARTICLE
And? So what if it panders to the audience? What is the impact of pandering to the audience with fanservice in the context of NGNL? Why is pandering necessarily bad in the case of NGNL? The generic idea that pandering to an audience is somehow a less legitimate form is a very limited view. You could have made a wide array of arguments but in the end your arguments all resolve down to a "pandering is bad" argument which makes no sense.

There are a wide array of possible arguments here aside from fanservice that you hint at but don't actually touch. There is a large degree of wish fulfillment that results in characters who don't actually have a conflict. A wide array of deus ex machina render the plot completely irrelevant because more previously established intricacies can be wiped with an instant gamechanger that they can pull out of their ass whenever. The characters themselves are projections of what the audience wants to be and thus we have NEETs who are somehow beyond genius and completely unrealistic. These characters are static fixtures because they are the ideal of the audience and thus avoid any need to make a deep character. Defining characters is easy aside from a few quirks they tack on that don't resolve the issue of these characters being static.

There are plenty of arguments to be made but commercial does not always equate to bad which is why the best anime are also relatively popular to some degree. There's also a lot of your opinion of what is good:

>And quite frankly that would be a massive turnoff for me even if any of these calculated decisions appealed to me to begin with.

However this is a non issue, what you think is irrelevant just like what the people who this is marketed think. Their personal opinions and yours don't impact what we might call "objective", or as close as we can get to it, quality. This argument is fairly ironic because you've essentially defined quality around your perception when trying to combat fanboyism that defines quality around its own perception.

My argument here does not hinge on pandering being a bad thing, although personally I think it is. I think it is incredibly stifling to any medium and does not encourage growth, new ideas, the pushing of boundaries, and the overall enhancement of the medium. But not every show needs to do that. 

What I am saying is that pandering is a large part of what turns me off from the series personally, and what a large portion of the people complaining about the show dislike. I'm not saying it's wrong to like it, I'm explaining why I don't like it. It's as simple as that.

I was never trying to say that NGNL is inherently bad or that none of this was my opinion, and I don't understand why you think I was. All I was doing is explaining why there is a lot of backlash to the hype it has rendered. I personally feel it has no artistic worth, and that in addition to that it has no appeal to me. I despise Evangelion, but I understand that it did great things for the medium, while NGNL on the other hand does not.

>Their personal opinions and yours don't impact what we might call "objective", or as close as we can get to it, quality. 

Quite frankly when it comes to art and entertainment there is no such thing as objective, and at no point was I ever trying or pretending to be objective. There is nothing ironic about arguing against a rabid opinion based fanbase with opinions of your own. That's called expressing your opinion, which is what I have been doing.

As far as the "wide array of arguments" that I don't touch, they pretty much all fall under that commercialism I'm talking about. The fanservice, the wish fulfillment, the Deus Ex machina, the glorification of NEETS, etc, etc. It all falls under catering to the least common denominator.


>> ARTICLE
Pandering is not stifling to a medium because pandering can come with other aspects. NGNL is not one dimensional. But that issue aside, I'm making the point that all of this stuff is not a good reason to deem the show as "bad" (which people who hate the show are generally going for) in the same way the stuff that people say makes the show "good" does not make the show a masterpiece or anything that belongs on the top 20 of any list in regards to quality anime.

Yes, and I personally feel that reason for hate is stupid. Especially when these "arguments" are in regards to quality, perceptive opinions are hardly important because both sides base their arguments off of that. If you are relying on your personal opinion of taste to make your argument, you are never going to convince anyone that NGNL is a bad show. If your intent was merely to explain why people would hate on it, that's fine but you also made the claim that its commercial smut which is why its ironic. The argument of perception goes both ways and has no value in determining whether a show is good.

Hence, objective in quotations. I don't think there's anything formulaic that can say X is better than Y but clearly we have boundaries for what is considered good and what is considered bad. Based off wide spread agreement, we can come to terms with statements like "Mars of Destruction is bad", "SAO is overhyped and not that good", etc. To some degree we can say what an anime should be. Obviously 50 pages of the word "shit" could appeal to someone, but in the end we would shoot that down as a great work of literature.

Bad writing itself is not necessarily all the result of the least common denominator and I'm sure the least common denominator would have been fine just seeing a pair of tits on the screen for the half hour without much thought. NGNL while not amazing does go beyond just catering.
>> ARTICLE
I can understand giving it something around a 6-8/10 and calling it a guilty pleasure. What I don't get is people who think anything they enjoy is the best anime evar and fuck you because they enjoyed it and have an opinion. 

In addition, I do have a reason for being angry about people enjoying it and considering it better than Neon Genesis Evangelion and Death Note. The more people respond positively by buying this crap, the more of it gets made. I don't like this side of anime. I could live without all the tsunderes and best girls and fanservice. I enjoy grand futuristic mech and spaceship battles, psychological thrillers, and epic quests and adventures sans the breasts. Maybe I'm wrong to worry, but it feels like this part of anime is getting thrown down the drain in favor of this fanservice escapist bullshit. Hell, Love Hina had less fanservice than NGNL does, and it was considered to be one of the most risque shows of its time. 

Moving on to specifics, I can understand why people like NGNL. It's a wish fulfillment fantasy that lets you have fun and doesn't try to be serious like SAO did. The protagonists are cool and take charge, as opposed to the typical harem lead. I can safely say that this anime is the best at what it does, but I don't care for any of this sort of thing. 

I feel that the anger towards NGNL is more-so generated toward the massive amounts of undeserved praise it gets. It is a guilty pleasure anime and should be treated as one. Instead the anime community has decided to parade it around like the second coming of Christ. Think about it: this is what we show to the world. Do we want NGNL to be the face of anime? If your answer is yes, I find that extremely sad. If the anime community thinks that this is the pinnacle of achievement in the medium, I see no hope for the future. 

Sorry for long irrelevant rant. It feels good to say that and since I already typed it I suppose I'll just post it. (don't much care about up/downvotes) 
>> ARTICLE
It might be *your* guilty pleasure, but to me it was one of the best to come out this year. I voted for it all the way so far (but quite obviously Steins;Gate got mine this time,) because at the end of the day I enjoyed and loved NGNL waay more than the other contenders. Best anime evar? Not for me, but if someone chooses to make it theirs I won't charge them for it. The rest of your rant is basically: "I don't like this kind of anime, I don't want it to be made!" Brother, get over it. I used to think so too, back when I watched stuff like Steins;Gate and Madoka only, but then I loosened up and embraced a few of the ecchi and generic harem ones, and guess what? I didn't die of brain cancer or anything, and some of them genuinely entertained me. Breasts, Harems and dense OPs define Anime, but even if they are the face for it it doesn't mean good stuff won't get made.
>> ARTICLE
I think you don't quite understand the reason why NGNL is getting all of this hate. To play off your transformers example, while transformers is always popular and does well in the box office, it is usually torn a new one by critics. It may do well, and people may like it, but it is critically recognized as bad. People generally seem to be okay with this fact, besides bitching about sales.(ignoring the people that still get upset about the bastardization of the franchise).

Now the difference between western film and anime is that there isn't quite the professional critic base for anime as there is for film. I'm sure there are some out there, but for at least western fans, we don't put as much stock in it as western audiences do with aggregate scores on websites like Rotten Tomatoes. Instead, the critical reception is general taken from community scores, and the most popular website for that is MyAnimeList.

Now the problem is that because of the ridiculous amount of hype towards NGNL, it is at an insanely high ranking right now, around #20 ranked. This is upsetting to a lot of people, as seems to most people as if the general population is saying that this show is better than anime favorites like Mushishi and Cowboy Bebop. So now we have an overhyped show that is almost extremely overrated. To add fuel to the fire, we have this poll, which rides on this hype train due to the series just being out.

The biggest problem is that this poll would be different in a years time. NGNL may not lose outright, but it wouldn't have gone head to head with Clannad and Madoka Magica, shows that have already stood a decent time test. Right now it is ridding a wave of hype, and, in the eyes of many anime fans, throwing their favorite shows under a bus.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is this: NGNL suffers from being both overhyped and overrated to the point where people just hate it because literally no one else is. This poll has NGNL riding on the wave that hype has created and is creating a breeding ground for this hate. At the end of the day it doesn't matter because it's going to lose to Steins;Gate anyway because Steins;Gate is insanely popular and generally holds up to a more critical lens. But you know, like whatever you like and all that. Just don't be surprised if this hate continues until NGNL is out of the top 50.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that it would have lost to madoka in a year, i also agree that its mal ranking will decrease over time (just like almost every other anime that got hyped up, including madoka) but to say that these things should influence how you view a certain show so much is ridiculous.  It is indeed overhyped, but it doesnt make it overated. The general consensus is that it is a good show, just not as good as a lot of people make it out to be. But for me it is as good as people make it out to be, a 9/10. Just my opinion.

When any popular show comes out it gets a lot of hype, whether it be like sao or madoka. Ngnl just finished so of course the hype alters some peoples decision  on which to vote for. But saying that just because it has hype, it doesnt deserve it is pretty dumb. Sao may not have been a masterpiece,  but it got hype because people thought it was good and liked watching it. Is that so wrong that people liked a show enough that they wanted others to see it too?

And if the day comes where ngnl ranking on mal plummets to dead last, it wont change how I feel about it. I liked it better than madoka, in what way does that affect anyone elses opinion on madoka? Fmab has the highest ranked score on mal, does that make it the best anime ever? But death note is the most popular, does that make it the best anime? Its just numbers. 

Ngnl is in no way pushing other anime aside. Its not as if people who have seen it and enjoyed it are prohibited from watching other shows. In factl if this discussion of ngnl vs madoka convinces them to watch them for the first time and draw their own conclusion, its a good thing no matter which they thought was better.  It got hype because a lot of people liked it. It really shouldnt matter what shows other people like or dont like or thought is overated/overhyped when you are the one watching them.
>> ARTICLE
For me personally, I liked NGNL. I thought it was great. Not fantastic or a masterpiece, but great. I'm not saying to judge it based on hype, but rather that people are getting pissed off at it because it is so hyped. It's not that I think the show doesn't deserve the top 50 or getting this high in the tournaments because it is overhyped, it's because I don't think it isn't good enough to be that well regarded. The reason it is, is because of its hype.

Now I can obviously see your confusion, after all, hype is generated because people enjoy the show, so why is a show getting hype bad? Well in this case the Anime void or Anime honeymoon is in effect with NGNL, aka people are rating it insanely high because they just finished watching it and haven't had time to think about it yet. A lot of others are caught up in the excitement from people about the show and also have their thoughts influenced towards it. Give use a year, and people that both see it without the episode discussion and the weekly hype and we will see a lot more people being critical about it and people revising their scores after a rewatch. Hell this exact scenario happened with me and SAO.

It may be "just numbers" but the fact remains that these shows are the faces of anime. Websites too lazy to think up materiel will use MAL for their top 10 anime lists, people looking for recommendations will be looking down the top list, and even some new people will get drawn to it. Therefore a lot of people care about what kind of anime is up there, as it should be stuff that can accurately describe the varied and deep kinds of stories that anime can tell. Having NGNL up there, well it reaaaaaally doesn't give the best representation to anime as a medium. It would just reinforce the idea in new people that anime is basically porn, which is an overwhelming stereotype as it is without false evidence to back it up. And yes, NGNL is extremely fanservice filled and that is a problem. I've seen people claim it "doesn't bother them" but frankly those people are either lying out of their asses or insane, because it has a lot of fanservice and most of it is blatant and in your face. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm very well said. I personally think it was better than madoka, hype aside. But I have no doubt that this im in the minority, and I have no qualms about it. 

Although I disagree with the fanservice stuff, it really doesnt matter to me. In fact the fact that ngnl was so ridiculously hilarious with it (super healthy space ftw) made me appreciate it more than other shows. Even if it had no fanservice I wouldve enjoyed the show abiut the same, although I doubt everyone would feel the same whatever they say.

But to say that ngnl being high up there is bad because it pushes the whole anime is porn isnt exactly accurate. Because for one almost all anime has fanservice. And 2nd parts of the monogatari series are higher than it in ranking and popularity. I mean im pretty sure that many people will agree that the monogatari series is more offputting in terms of fanservice to non anime fans than ngnl.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually just running through Monogatari for the first time (Just finished the Karen Bee arc) and while this show has way more offputting fanservice, it is contrasted by the shear insane amount of depth that not only the show has as a whole, but each conversation the show has. But Monogatari itself does need to come with a warning label.

The difference between NGNL and most anime however, is that NGNL has a lot of fanservice. Obviously it has a lot, otherwise it wouldn't be labeled ecchi. And while it can be done right, see super healthy space, it mostly left a problem. It was just too much too blatant.
>> ARTICLE
That's what people said when it faced Madoka Magica. 

Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo. It was 598.

And Toradora's late come back gave me extra work. I had already made the polls for today like an hour before I closed voting. I even wrote up a little thing about Death Note squeaking by with a couple votes. Then I click on it later, and it completely changed.
>> ARTICLE
>Third match should be really close. I'm giving it to Steins;Gate by 5%

>Steins;Gate: 647 - Baccano: 165

Sorry Penguins, but you heavily underestimate Steins;Gate (someone already mentioned this in the Day 7 thread). 

NGNL made it to the Elite Eight solely on fresh hype; Madoka Magica's hype ended around Rebellion's release. 

In all my time in /r/anime, I have only seen Steins;Gate either being praised or recommended.
>> ARTICLE
But I've never seen Baccano! criticized either. Everyone loves Baccano, so I thought it'd still put up a decent fight. It's especially popular with dub lovers, so I thought it'd get every vote from people that only watch dubs.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano is completely void of character development and Jacuzzi is annoying. (don't get me wrong, I still really enjoyed it, but those are the two main criticisms I've found with the show)  
>> ARTICLE
Jacuzzi is the best damn character in the whole show, you take that back!

(Actually Isaac, Miria, and Rail Tracer are tied with him)
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say "completely void", but it's a fair point all the same.  Baccano! is less interested in intricate characters, and more in telling wild tales of the exploits of extraordinary people and their interactions with one another, not terribly unlike the kinds of stories told in the mythologies and epics of old.  I think it hits what it aims for pretty solidly, but I can't fault anyone for taking less of an interest in it because of the things it ignores.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the show, but I view it more as an entertainment anime. 
>> ARTICLE
> entertainment anime

So an anime. Seriously, if you're watching anime for any reason other than entertainment then I don't think you're doing it right :P
>> ARTICLE
I didn't watch Serial Experiments Lain or Paranoia Agent to space out in front of my computer and watch the explosions, that's for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Spacing out does not equate to entertainment. If you did not enjoy the shows then you probably would not watch them. If you were hooked by their intrigue, or by the themes they were expressing or the symbolism they employed then you were entertained. This can be entertaining without having action or explosions.

For the record I loved the first half of Paranoia Agent, but hated the second half. It completely abandoned any narrative coherence for the sake of it's symbolism and themes. The two should be separate facets of a well crafted gem that both compliment each other and enhance the experience. I've liked it before to the narrative being a vessel through which to deliver your themes, like liquid in a bottle. But someone broke Paranoia Agent's bottle and let the liquid just flow all over the ground. Just because something is "deep" doesn't mean it's a well crafted story.
>> ARTICLE
That's more or less the sentiment I was getting at anyway, but I really dislike the distinction between "entertainment" shows and...what?  "Thinking" shows, I guess?  Even "thinking" shows are meant to be entertaining, but because they reward you for making your own conclusions and inferences from what they provide you.  Even "entertainment" shows can make you think, though most don't go much past skin deep in terms of themes and subtext.

Then there are the shows somewhere in between, shows difficult to classify.  Samurai Flamenco can be watched as an "entertainment" anime since there's some sort of spectacle in just about every episode, but there's enough thematic meat there to chew on for a little while.  The Monogatari series likewise can be enjoyed thoroughly for both its spectacle and subtext.  If we really need some sort of sliding gradient to align shows along, I would argue "Spectacle vs Introspection" would be a more accurate way of framing the distinction.

Anyway, sorry to rant at you.  You just got unlucky and unwittingly struck upon a pet peeve of an insufferable pedant.
>> ARTICLE
>Spectacle vs Introspection

That's exactly how to put it. I've been calling it spectacle vs depth ever since KLK (which is 100% all the way spectacle), but introspection captures the other end of the spectrum much nicer.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still of the (seemingly increasingly unpopular) opinion that KLK was loaded with symbolism and depth, similar to FLCL. But it certainly becomes a more and more difficult argument to make as the show goes on and feels like it loses that focus it seemed to have towards the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes that's true, but in terms of popularity AND ranking (from MAL), Baccano! doesn't come close.

As I said in an earlier thread. I think Steins;Gate is way more engaging to a broader audience. So yea, no way Steins;Gate loses here.

Lasting appeal vs immediate entertainment is how I see it. I enjoyed NGNL too, and it deserves high ratings for what it is. Steins;Gate wasn't a show I liked the first time around (time travel ew) but I went back and finished it. Definitely something that you could rewatch with friends and still get a good experience out of, while NGNL feels more like a one-shot wonder. 

Indeed, there are the people who are still riding the hype. And there are people who reflexively react against the hype, balancing it out to an extent.

It's gonna come down to the top 2 of myanimelist aka FMA:B and Steins;gate. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, but we shouldn't underestimate "the toothbrush scene".
>> ARTICLE
Macth 1: Psycho Pass, you had a good run. You faced tough opponents and triumphed, but the journey ends here. There is not the slightest percentile of a chance of victory against FMA, but hey you have a second season to look forward to so chin up kid.

Match 2: NLGL you also had a run, though many would argue whether it's good or not. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, you are in the same shoes as Psycho Pass in that you have no chance against one of the most loved shows on /r/anime.

Match 3: This will be the closest match out of any of the four, and I sincerely hope that Code Geass can pull this out and push to the finals. Gurren Lagann you may have taken out Fate/Zero but I bear you no grudge, mostly, and you also hold a place in my heart, but I have to side with my main man Lelouch on this one.

Match 4: Toradora! and Monogatari each have thier own highly vocal fan bases as well as their share of criticisms, which one comes out on top will be something interesting to see. Personally my vote lies with Monogatari who I think will pull through to get crushed next round, but if Toradora can pull off the upset I can say I will be pleasently surprised.

Looks like the reign of the mad king and queen is over at the hands of the mad scientist. Now we can all take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the tournament finale.

Wow, this is the first tournament that I can't vote in because in all the match ups, I have not seen one of the shows (then again, its been a while since I watched an anime that could be considered popular, except for One Piece and Hanasaku Iroha).  I am surprised how well NGNL did, especially that it beat Clannad, one of the most well regarded anime (the first season excluded). When I first heard of it, I thought it was just a show jumping on the Sword art online bandwagon, but it must be more than that (especially since it already ended, so it must keep up a decent pace). Also, I am surprised that Gintama is so low. Even though it is extremely long, its setting and comedy should be good enough to push it higher in the rankings.

My aching buttocks compel me ask wtf. You *appear* upset over the former pairing and its decided victor which I'd probably agree with you (never saw F/Z).

Okay, I swore to myself I'd lay off the NGNL criticism, finally, so we're going to move on before I get all bothered. ^(rip in pieces clannad)

Shoutout to Fate/Zero finally getting taken out, you fought well.

**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Psycho-Pass, baby, as much as you hold a special spot in my heart, not even the most optimistic little girl in the world could claim that you have the faintest sliver of the popularity and adoration that FMA has. Although, I wasn't expecting you to even make it this far, so maybe I should not have underestimated you or this community. Fight-on, Psycho-Pass. The cruel fury you have fought with in this tourney has pleased your master Urobuchi indeed, I'm sure. There's nothing to be ashamed of.

**2.** See above. Sick'em, Steins;Gate. Tear that hentai baka aho limb from limb, nani his sore, make him dead when he is killed. Rip him in half, onii-chan.

**3.** The best there is in mecha and political thriller versus the best there is in mecha and, I don't know, manliness and friendship. I will be proud of the victor of this clashing of the champions, whomever they may be in the end. Voted for Lagann myself and will be cheering my ally on, but I'd have absolutely no problems with Geass taking this.

**4.** I think by now I don't need to delve too deeply into my adoration of neither the Monogatari franchise or Toradora!. I think these two are also good examples of the "generally very well liked but with a vocal and strong-willed base of critics"; many people are just turned off or annoyed by 'Gatari, and many people don't see the appeal in or dislike the drama/tsundere-ness of 'Dora. It fits that they meet in a trial by combat like this. I'm proud that they've both come this far, I'll be with my lady Monogatari to the end, Toradora!'s a good, honorable man that I would trust my life with.

> rip in pieces clannad

I just want to ask, is Clannad really that good? I saw like.... between 7-12 episodes some time ago, and absolutely hated it - I found it pointless, plotless, characters were boring and stale, and it moved SLOW. There was barely a premise, nor did it feel like there was any direction except for some psuedo supernatural hinting in the beginning.

I really want to ask, is it that good? What kind of mindset should I have when I come into it? Does it compare to the polish of today's anime/did it age well enough?
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you mean 7-12 episodes into Clannad then you didn't watch any of what people love about Clannad. Thats like 90% After Story, Clannad is usually thought of as a set up.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take this one.

Yes. Clannad is that damn good, and After Story is just as good. 

Your mindset should be to sit back and let the story happen. Don't worry about when things happen or how things happen, and don't grumble when the romance begins to go into full effect. Your problem with your previous watch was probably that you had yet to experience a full-out romance anime. Watch a couple romcoms to get used to the pacing, and you'll be fine.

And yes, Clannad has held up remarkably well over time. The traditional Key art style is much more tame in [Clannad](http://i.imgur.com/FG0iPLm.jpg) than it was in either [Air](http://i.imgur.com/vEEoU6W.jpg) or [Kanon](http://i.imgur.com/LKgRix6.jpg), and is perfectly accessible to people who have only watched newer anime.

>> ARTICLE
Wtf is up with people voting so much for NGNL? Yes, it was fun and entertaining,  but it was really superficial and lacked depth. It was like Outbreak Company meets Code Geass without the story. NGNL is so over hyped because the lack of decent shows last season. I cannot belive it beat out Madoka Magica....the quality of Modoka Magica was so much greater than NGNL in every aspect.  I agreed with a lot of the results and some of them were really hard calls, but this is stupid.
>> ARTICLE
The hype is only beginning. Can't wait for season 2!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't vote in the previous ones but it can be purely due to enjoyable and entertainment value. NGNL didn't waste a single episode having filler or doing anything of no consequence, knew what it was and went to be enjoyable, ridiculous while having a smart strategy element to it. I understand people enjoy Madoka for its characters, despair and story but it can be simply people enjoyed watching NGNL way more. 

I for one didn't enjoy Madoka  due to Madoka being stuck and not doing anything for 11 episodes, didn't enjoy the "look at this despair and hopelessness" and only enjoyed the rebellion movie and homura's backstory.

I also don't think that writing an anime like NGNL without the story or things collapsing on yourself is easily done (esp when it can fall into a lot of pitfalls like OP Mc making it boring).
>> ARTICLE
NGNL beat Clannad? Really? I mean sure, I liked NGNL as much as the next guy, but is it Clannad good? Nope. Hell no. Not even close. I dont even think its Angel Beats! good. Hell, I dont even think its Melancholy good, and i say that with full disdain for endless 8. NGNL is good. A solid 7 and nothing more. Just goes to show how strong the hype train is I guess. Oh well, Clannad will always be #1 in my heart. 

Some thoughts on today's matches:

Match 1: I like both contenders here quite a bit. Gonna give it to Psycho Pass tho. I doubt it will beat FMA, but a man can dream.

Match 2: NGNL beat my #1, but there's no way it can beat my #2 Steins;Gate. Despite Clannad being my favorite, I think S;G is fundamentally better, and most of the anime community agree.

Match 3: This is another tough one. Similarly to match 1, I liked both of these shows quite a bit. Despite voting for NGE in TTGL's match with it, Im completely cool with TTGL beating it. Gonna give my vote to TTGL, but this will be a match to watch. 

Match 4: Toradora, you cute thing, I dont think you will be getting past the Bebop slayer with your tsun. Gonna give my vote to Monogatari for this one. Its not #3 on my list for nothing. Hitagi queen tsun.

>> ARTICLE
I'm betting folks that have never even seen Clannad still went ahead and voted for NGNL and that's the reason it went through.

There is a lot of young crowd in the sub and NGNL is just too recent so most of us if not of all of us have seen it.

I think shows from 2014 should have been excluded from the voting completely but w/e.

NGNL wasn't anywhere near as good as Clannad Afterstory was.
>> ARTICLE
I think the first season of Clannad kind of holds back After Story. I realize it's necessary for the character development, but many of my friends dropped Clannad because of the Fuko arc and dismissed it as your average highschool harem. It's a shame, really, because I truly consider After Story to be a masterpiece in storytelling and character development.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely agree with you there. Watching Clannad is essential to get the full emotional impact of After Story. Unfortunately, the first season tends to drag on a bit, and is almost always the reason the show is droped. The second most common reason is the style of the show. Its a real shame that such a beautiful piece of art can be overlooked so easily. But I love the show very much, and that's all that matters.
>> ARTICLE
> NGNL beat Clannad? Really? I mean sure, I liked NGNL as much as the next guy, but is it Clannad good? Nope. Hell no. Not even close. I dont even think its Angel Beats! good.

What a backhanded compliment! Say NGNL is good, but then say it's not even Angel Beats! level of good!

;)
>> ARTICLE
When I rate a show, its almost always on how much I enjoyed the show. Not how good or bad the show is on a technical level. As far as enjoyment is concerned, I enjoyed Angel Beats! far more that NGNL. This way of rating is very heavily opinionated and I don't expect everyone, or even anyone to agree. 
>> ARTICLE
I swear if Steins;Gate falls to the hype of this season I will take a potato chip, and eat it. Also I'll be super disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it Toradora. I like you and all... but really? You beat Death Note? Well, I'm kind of indifferent because NGNL is still around, but I don't want to get into that again. 

I still stand behind FMA as the clear winner in the end of things, which is fine, I wouldn't have an FMA poster on the wall behind my computer if I disliked the show. I just kind of wish some of the more legitimately great shows in the tourney got this far.

Of course the three anime I vote for are the three anime in last place in the placement poll. /r/anime and I definitely don't see eye to eye.

Why was the garbage known as elfen lied even in this? Was there precedence in the community to give it a shot?
>> ARTICLE
The most underrated anime of all time had enough supporters in the qualifiers.
>> ARTICLE
Elfen lied is not underrated, if anything its overrated. I see people praising it all the time and I can't understand why. No character development aside from Lucy and the purple haired one, its blatantly manipulative, no subtlety, near insulting amounts of Gore and nudity. The plot also made no fucking sense. I dreaded watching every episode. I think I liked something about episode 9 though. 
>> ARTICLE
Character development in Elfen Lied is learning about each characters history, and that part is its strenght.
>> ARTICLE
Well yes, they delve heavily into back stories but that tells me little about their character, as in emotional patterns and different traits. The main dude and his cousin (I think that's what they were) could've been rocks for the amount of character they had. 

Like I said, Lucy was a solid character. That and the purple haired mutant thing's interactions with bandit were solid. Everything else in that show was a poorly written, pretentious mess.

Monogatari Series crushing Toradora, heh
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero. rest in peace, my sweet prince.

This was *the* anime for me. Intriguing and unique characters, amazing character interactions, great premise, great plot, and not to mention orgasmic animation and soundtrack (Ufotable and Kajiura hnng) . 

Gurren Lagann was really good at what it did. It knew what it was, and I definitely enjoyed it immensely. 

However, everything for Fate/Zero just felt so much more intricate. Barring the controversial ending, each character and their motives/actions fit perfectly with one another into the overarching plot. Ideological mouthpieces, yes, but everything was measured and executed so well that it truly felt like an *epic*. 

Jeezus I could go on for hours about these two. I think that Fate/Zero should have won due to how well it handled such a difficult premise, and yet exceeded those expectations as well. 

Slightly disappointed, but perhaps i'll take some solace in how Gurren Lagann just barely scraped by.

I'm sure i'm not having it as bad as Clannad and Magika peeps though.

Surprisingly, Toradora's loosing right now by about 40 votes. 
It's literally THE romantic comedy that's been recommended here since I joined. Wow.

Monogatari Second season is leagues better than Bake, Nise, and Neko combined. There is a reason I have it beating Steins;Gate in the finals, altough I would not be surprised to see any of the remaining contenders win except Psycho-Pass (and I would be damn proud if it did) and NGNL (at which point I would weep tears of lament at what our world has become).
>> ARTICLE
Nisemonogatari is generally considered the worst of the series, but I thought it was just as good as Bake, just in a different way. I wasn't a huge fan of Neko, but then again, it was only 4 episodes. So meh, whatever. Now Second Season is where the series really shines, it blew me away and it is easily a top 2 favourite of mine.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari just demolished Cowboy Bebop and AnoHana back to back. I'm surprised it's as close as it is. I didn't expect it to do half as well.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain the interest in Monogatari series? Besides the amazing visual and senjogahara, I don't really feel like it deserves a space this high up in this list. I am not trying to be insulting to those who enjoy the show, or to the show itself. Its just from what I have currently seen of it, which is basically everything of the series that has been animated so far, I haven't really thought of it as more than a 7-8/10. 

So, my question is what have other people enjoyed about this anime? Or hell, ANY anime that is up here so far? what do you guys think should be up on the list right now? I'm pretty interested in hearing the feedback

Edit: I forgot platinum disco and toothbrush scene. Now I understand
>> ARTICLE
Head over to /r/TrueAnime . Wait a couple of days. Any one of the numerous Monogatari writeups that appear now and then will show you why.
>> ARTICLE
So Many people crying about NGNL taking out other big animes. If you think this poll isn't accurate, just don't vote. 
I found NGNL quite entertaining & even enjoyed it more than steinsgate that's. If it was up against deathnote I wouldve picked deathnote probably.
The question is "which anime do you like more?" Let people have their opinions and vote for their favorites without being insulted, criticism ist absolutely fine.
Its just disguisting to see the hatred, I almost feel like people who liked the NGNL have to be ashamed of it.

I love Code Geass and as much as I want TTGL to lose, I think it may end up taking this one.

I don't care for either series but Monogatari will end up beating Toradora!

My favorite anime of all time(Monogatari) vs one of the animes i dislike the most (Toradora). I still think S;G will take it all which is fine by me.

I bet FMA wins, and second place goes to Steins;Gate or Code Geass. At least I'd like Code Geass to come in second place, even if it does have flaws.

I have doubts that the Monogatari Series will win due to the enormous general popularity of the other three (which all I loved watching as well).

I'm thinking Steins;Gate vs Code Geass in the finals.

Steins;Gate vs. Monogatari is my dream finals, or perhaps a nightmare since I wouldn't know which one to vote for. I hope at least one can make it. Also I'm kinda sad that Gurren Lagann lost, but I'm glad it was to Code Geass. I love them equally.

>> ARTICLE
RIP in piece NLGL, you will not be missed, but I'll still watch you when the next season comes out. Also props to Fate/Zero for taking the top poll spot. At least Kiritsugu won something.

Match 1: Here it is, the match we've all be waiting for. The number one rated show on MAL versus number one in the hearts of /r/anime. Who comes out of the smoldering crater left by their battle victorious in this clash of the titans will almost certainly crush their final opponent and take the glorious title of "favorite show of some guys on the internet that sometimes take Japanese television way too seriously." My vote, as blasphemous as it is, goes to FMA, but I'll be happy with whoever wins.

Match 2: In this battle for second place we have Lelouch, expert strategist and charismatic leader of The Black Knights against Arararagi, conquerer of women's hearts and dental hygeine enthusiast. I love Monogatari, but orange is the color of my loyalty here as I'm siding with Lelouch, emporer of my heart. As a dear friend once said "All hail Brittania!" as he memorably lept from his mech to his enemy's, memorably defeating her. Too bad she had no memory.

Was that too many Code Geass refrences? I think it might have been too many. At least I didn't complain about Gintama losing again this week.

Oh god FMA is getting crushed, I vote for them because even though both anime were amazing, FMA is more memorable for some reason.

How is it even possible? I mean I love FMA and SG but FMA is so much better in many aspects. My heart is crushed :< FMA:B is the best anime of all time. I've seen over 100 Animes so far and nothing could ever compare to FMA

FMA is the contender for best shounen of all time, not sure about for all anime tho

Hyouka's racking up the votes in the big placement poll. Is it really that good? It's really been off my radar, but I've been thinking of watching it after it won the most votes in the nomination topic.

At the risk of overselling it, it's the closest thing to a flawless mastepiece there is and one of my favorite pieces of entretainment ever. It's weakest point is probably the writing but it more than makes up for it with the direction, and that's ok because it's a great example of "show, don't tell".

Honestly at first the show just seems average/above average but the more I thought about it the more I realized about how good it was and how much I really liked it.

Some call it KyoAni's biggest masterpiece, and even if I may not fully agree I do think it's a substantiated claim. It's a lazy thing to say, but it does pretty much everything right which it attempts to do. The only thing that I could possibly point out as a negative is the occasionally slow pacing, but that could easily be argued to not be negative at all. Some people thought the ending was a bit disappointing too, but I have no problem with it.

It's definitely one of my favorites. The tenth on my personal Top Ten. Relaxing and tranquil SoL entertainment with barely if any fanservice or crude humor, gorgeous visuals and beloved classical music pieces used as BGM, literary references, fun and adorable characters male and female, and some surprisingly captivating but down-to-earth, light mystery to tie it all together (although it could use some polishing up in a few places, and can get slow). I'd recommend it. It's not anything visionary or a masterpiece, but it's got likability and chill factor fo' days.
>> ARTICLE
Voted for Code Geass cause it's the one I've seen, but the fact that I haven't seen a quarterfinalist (even though this isn't representative of all anime fans) means that I'll have to go and watch Monogatari. Anyone wanna give me a brief description and in what order to watch it?

EDIT: OF THOSE TWO. Of course, I've seen FMAB and Steins;Gate is my all-time fav.
>> ARTICLE
It's really unlike anything else. Amazing dialogue, which is a majority of the show. Absolutely gorgeous visuals and really developed characters. It has some fanservice and might make you feel pervy at times, but those are just minor minor gripes. Start with Bakemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really LIKE too much fanservice, but I can handle it. I mean No Game No Life had a ton, but it was too fun of a show to really complain. Also thanks.

>> ARTICLE
The watch order is Bake -> Nise -> Neko: Kuro -> Second Season -> Hana. 

If you want a proper description you can check out the entries on MAL, but I guess basically it's about this Araragi guy and he helps people who have problems with the supernatural. And I've seen it referred to as "Conversations: The Anime" (though it does have some action) and it's pretty indicative of Shaft's style so just be prepared for that.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I don't really mind lots of conversation as long as I'm prepared. As an example, I would have preferred twice the talking and half the action in Sidonia no Kishi, but on the other side of the coin, I was waiting for the action in Madoka Magica for so long I was upset when I realized there was virtually none. So as long as I know...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it sucks when you go into something expecting something else and end up disappointed. Even if someone doesn't mind lots of talking, it might still put them off if they weren't expecting it so I just wanted to give a heads up.

Definitely rooting for FMA and Code Geass with FMA winning, but Steins;gate gets a lot of love here and Code Geass is up against the entire Monogatari series so fingers crossed.

Steins;Gate and Code Geass. Let's go.

I think this round is where favorite will take its toll on Monogatari. Is it a masterpiece and one of the most beautiful shows out there? 100% yes. But Code Geass is so much fun to watch and had a bunch of individual really good episodes. While I still am rooting for Monogatari, I think its time has come.

Expecting Code Geass to trump Monogatari here, although I found it a little difficult to choose between the two.

It's gonna come full circle like it did with SAO haha.

It's the new cool thing to hate.  A lot of it comes down to anime fans wanting to claim that they're have better taste than your average anime fan, so how could they ever enjoy something that blatantly caters to the fandom?

Also, some people take issue with people wanting their hobbies to be fun, and not just an exercise in forcibly digging for literary undertones in everything.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to say that your statement is bull shit. NGNL was entertaining because it was over the top, simple, and funny, but that's it. It had no depth and it didnt draw the viewer in like Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica did, at least for me it didn't. I did like NGNL, but it shouldn't be held in such high regards. It's just hardcore Otaku pandering wrapped in an okay story, some funny moments, and decent visuals. To me, a show like NGNL is okay to watch everynow and then, but i hope to God that it doesn't become the standard for quality.   
  
Also, the fan service in NGNL was a little over the top and could be off putting at times and definitely scare off most viewers. Monogatari had one episode that was over the top with the fan service where it didn't contribute to the story where NGNL was like that almost every episode. 

In short, NGNL was fun, but I really disagree with the notion that it's top 20 status. It is like saying daytime soaps are better dramas than Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad. 
>> ARTICLE
>NGNL was entertaining because it was over the top, simple, and funny, but that's it. It had no depth and it didnt draw the viewer in like Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica did

This a popularity contest haha. If you were to try and compare every single aspect of Madoka, S;G and NGNL, you'd realize can't because they're not the same type of show.

>just because a show is ecchi doesn't mean the fanservice should be there

dude do you even know what ecchi is?

> The word 'ecchi' has been adopted by fans of Japanese media to describe works with sexual overtones. In Japanese, the word ecchi is often used to describe a person's conduct, but in fandom, it has come to be used to refer to softcore or playful sexuality in contradistinction to the word 'hentai' which connotes perversion or fetishism. Works described as ecchi do not show sexual intercourse or genitalia. Instead, sexual themes are hinted at, and much is left up to the imagination of the viewer. Ecchi themes are a type of fan service, and can be found in comedy Shnen/Seinen manga and harem anime.

You didn't even quote my response correctly, I didn't say that.   
  
I wouldn't overlook the fact that I thought that NGNL had too much fan service just because MAL says it fits in the ecchi sub-genre. Regardless of the fact that it is labled as ecchi I found it distasteful and it was a negative part of the show for me. 
>> ARTICLE
the reason I didn't quote you word for word is because that's exactly what you conveyed with the sentence you wrote.

is basically

> just because something is classified as ecchi doesn't mean that the fanservice has a reason to be there

you seriously need to look at all other anime considered ecchi:

Golden Boy

Sekirei

To-love Ru

High School of the Dead

*Nisemonogatari*

All of theses shows had lots of fanservice which is why they're even in the ecchi subgenre. Like... how can you go into a fucking horror movie not expecting death/blood/scary shit?! It's basically the same thing. How do you watch an ecchi anime not expecting loads of fanservice? 

If you know tons of fanservice is gonna bother you, then maybe you shouldn't watch ecchi anime dude.

Wow, whoever wrote this comment is pretty cluey

If you didn't understand what they said, here are some definitions of some of the more *grandiose* words in their comment:

*ecchi*: erotic, lascivious, lewd, naughty, sexy, suggestive

*haha*: Type of boundary to a garden, pleasure-ground, or park, designed not to interrupt the view and to be invisible until closely approached.

*softcore*: Being less explicit than hard-core material in depicting or describing sexual activity:  softcore pornography. 

*fandom*: All the fans of a sport, an activity, or a famous person.

*hentai*: A work of anime or manga (or any similar medium) that contains sexual or pornographic art.

*fanservice*: The inclusion in a work of fiction of any material, especially racy or sexual material, which has no relevance to the storyline, but is designed merely to excite the viewer.

This is stupid because you're treating NGNL like it's supposed to be a full on drama when it's not. It's a comedy/adventure/fun oriented show. Not some deep dark mysterious thing like Madoka. A comedy can definitely be just as good as the other. A better comparison to what you're doing would be like you saying Game of Thrones doesn't deserve it's fandom because there's not much comedy.

NGNL is not dark, nor is it deep really. It's fun, and **that's fine**. It does not make it less of a show, because to a majority of people, NGNL does it right. Hating on a show because it's fun oriented is just stupid. Don't insult a comedy because it's not dramatic/dark because it's not *trying* to be. It's a comedy and should be viewed as a comedy. Something funny can be just as good as a drama, just in a different way. That's what NGNL is. You may not agree (which is fine) but to say it doesn't deserve it's spot because it's just funny is silly. People love the show and the game/mental battles, that's a big part of it's charm. It's not some bullshit show. Stop fooling yourself into thinking comedies can't be top tier shows just because they're more about being funny/fun to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I like NGNL for what it was, but you seem to be missing the point I'm making and the point of the bracket. Does NGNL really stack up to any of its competitors in this bracket, I'd say no. I don't even think Monogatari deserves its spot, but I still liked the show for what it was.
>> ARTICLE
You're fine to say no. But to say no *just because it's a comedy* is dumb. You don't like NGNL? Nor do you think it deserves a spot? That's fine. But that's your own opinion. The other shows aren't automatically better just because they're a drama vs NGNL's comedy. You can still think the show as a whole is better of course, but *not* basically because it's a comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually said I enjoyed NGNL, for what it was, but I find it ridiculous that it is considered top 20 and that it beat some of the shows it did. I'd say the same for Monogatari, it was good for what it is, but in the grand scheme, it doesn't stack up.
>> ARTICLE
I meant "you" as in a general term there. Not you specifically, but to point out that dislike the show, or not thinking it deserves a spot is fine. But to think it doesn't deserve a spot just because it's a comedy is where the problem I have with it arrises. 
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't trying to say that because NGNL is a comedy is why it didn't deserve the spot, I'm saying it didn't deserve it because it just wasn't top 20 status.  It was made for a very specific audience, not for a broad one like the shows I mentioned were. If a show can't be enjoyed by most people then I don't think it is that great of a show. Comedy or not.
>> ARTICLE
>NGNL is not dark, nor is it deep really. It's fun, and that's fine. It does not make it less of a show.

See this is where I think a lot of people disagree. As far as I (and many others) are concerned) something that is legitimately powerful/meaningful is incomparable to something that is "fun". The two obviously aren't mutually exclusive (you don't see anyone complaining about TTGL) but NGNL is very far from being powerful/meaningful (it is only "fun"). That doesn't mean people should dislike it (most don't), but considering something like it overrated when it is reaching the top 10 in a poll like this is completely understandable. Many (including myself) just don't feel it deserves it. Any genre can be a top tier show but it still needs some sort of decent ambitions and NGNL has none.
>> ARTICLE
I... don't think you actually read my post.  I specifically made the point that some things are just supposed to be fun.  I never claimed NGNL was supposed to be anything more.

If, on the other hand, you're trying to claim that nobody should ever do things for fun... Well...

>Monogatari had one episode that was over the top with the fan service

Because Araragi repeatedly attempting to molest a 12 year old girl was vital to the plot?
>> ARTICLE
>A lot of it comes down to anime fans wanting to claim that they're have better taste than your average anime fan, so how could they ever enjoy something that blatantly caters to the fandom?

Or how about because they simply dislike those shows ? Maybe some are actually like you said, but "a lot" seems exaggerated to me.

Tbh i find the whole "People who dislike my favorite popular show must be trying to be hipster" of some fans annoying as well. Do they really think there are no legitimate reasons to hate those shows beside wanting to be cool ? 

>> ARTICLE
I don't care if anybody dislikes anything.  Nearly all NGNL hate I come across, however, bashes it for catering to the fandom, not for it being outside their sphere of interest.

>Tbh i find the whole "People who dislike my favorite popular show must be trying to be hipster" of some fans annoying as well.

Mind not trying to put words in my mouth?  When did I ever imply it was my favorite series, or that I was bent out of shape because someone didn't like what I did.  My issue is specifically with the hipster snobs, and I make that clear.

>Mind not trying to put words in my mouth? 

I could say the same to you, since where did i imply i was talking about you ? It's true that the first paragraph is direct to you, but the second paragraph i was just pointing out people with the anti-hater mindset in general, not any specific person (that's why i used the word 'they' not 'you')

>> ARTICLE
That's fine, but it comes down to those who say they disliked it because it was 'pandering', not those who disliked it because they're not into the fantasy/ecchi/adventure genre. 

Every show has a reason to be disliked, but can you seriously say "oh I hated x anime because it was made specifically to cater to an audience I don't like."?
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I like NGNL but I agree with everyone that it is overrated to hell. It looks like it is going to be #6 on this list and is top 20 on MAL. Obviously the validity of both of those lists are questionable but that isn't the point. Many just find it rediculous that a show where enjoyment of it is almost purely derived from some form of pandering (gaming world, fan service, OP MC, etc.) is being ranked anywhere near that high. Basically, I don't think NGNL is overrated because it was pandering, I think it is overrated because it didn't do much else and the fact that it is even compared to some of the shows it has been ranked higher than is just absurd.
>> ARTICLE
It is overrated, but it's by no means the terrible show people are making it out to be.

Everyone's upset it's changed the MAL rankings and that it scored above most shows here. I'm laughing because no one seems to get that the very obvious hype train hasn't exactly left the station yet...

> Obviously the validity of both of those lists are questionable but that isn't the point

of course, those lists I linked are a little more reliable in the sense that they actually make sense when compared to MAL's massively messed up list(s). I say MALs lists are messed up because Gintama is taking tons of spots (all specials should count as one, IMO) and NGNL is up there on the 'Top anime' list when it should be on the 'most popular' list. They should really only allow anime that have been out for at least a year or more (so scores can average out better) be on the 'top anime' list and allow the 'most popular' sort themselves out more like how they have the 'top anime' sorted out. They got everything all janky on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just not even paying any mind to it anymore. This is exactly like the whole SAO thing, down to the reason most people disliked it at first. 

The whole hipster mentality is disgustingly annoying and super discouraging to any new fan. 
>> ARTICLE
You're assuming that people don't like the show because it's the mainstream thing to do? That cries hipster, I can completely understand why the general population wouldn't like NGNL. It had hardcore fan service and other serious Otaku tropes such as an over powered main character and a loli with a brother complex as one of the main characters. Every episode was geared towards hardcore Otakus,  not the casual anime viewer. Steins;Gate and Madoka had neither of those elements, they were serious story driven shows that could be more enjoyed and a viewer could walk away with something to think and talk about, I never found my self that excited about NGNL.

it's an ecchi show, as per MAL.

araragi's sisters have a bro complex and araragi has a sister complex. soo... again why is this an issue? just cause NGNL does it?

Why do people always bring Bakemonogatari up in this dsicussion? You treat it as if the sexual parts are the only thing defining both shows, not just a part of the whole. I dislike the incest vibes/fanservice in both, but that doesn't instantly put their writing, themes, and goals on the same level.

> the same could be said about the tatami galaxy and the monogatari series EDIT: to elaborate on this, i mean that these shows aren't exactly geared towards the casual anime viewer

Uhm, I have to disagree here, at least partly. The Tatami Galaxy really doesn't demand any knowledge of Otaku-Culture in order to fully enjoy it. It might not be the best thing for someone looking for cheap fun, but that has nothing to with catering towards it audience.


>> ARTICLE
> Why do people always bring Bakemonogatari up in this dsicussion?

Because the Monogatari series can be classified as ecchi as well, hence it's relevance. I'm arguing that even amazing shows like the Monogatari series can have excessive amounts of fanservices, but *apparently* just because NGNL is a subpar show, it's suddenly worse than any fanservice ever.

> The Tatami Galaxy really doesn't demand any knowledge of Otaku-Culture in order to fully enjoy it

you misunderstood, I mean that if you were to watch anime for the first time ever (or even if you've watched 10-15 anime), you'd have a really hard time doing it with The Tatami Galaxy or the Monogatari Series considering these are much more dialogue heavy. Like you wouldn't want someone who's never or bearly seen any anime watching SZS, considering all the jokes they have don't make any sense if you're not knowledgable about japan or even some anime tropes. Most people start off with ecchi, action, adventure shows like Code Geass, Steins;Gate, FMA and Bebop. These shows are much easier to get into vs Monogatari Series and the Tatami Galaxy and SZS.
>> ARTICLE
Well, bringing monogatari up in that light is really only useful when someone criticizes NGNL solely for the fanservice, not when talking about both shows as a whole.

And I still have to disagree with you on the Tatami Galaxy being bad for newcomers. Maybe it isn't the best show for your usual teenager, who the mayority of anime is aimed at, thats correct. But if someone saw it as his first anime he still would be able to fully understand it, knowledge of Otaku-Culture isn't necessary.

Saying that a lot of dialogue is bad for newcomers really just implies that you expect the average person wanting to get into anime as always looking for the same thing. You wouldn't say someone couldn't get 2001: A Space Odysee just because he isn't into movies, right?

Of course, for Monogatari, your statement is totally true. It really isn't a show you easily enjoy without knowing the tropes it plays on beforehand. 
>> ARTICLE
But the point I am discussing *is* the fanservice in NGNL (and the issue people have with it) which is why I brought up the Monogatari series. 

> But if someone saw it as his first anime he still would be able to fully understand it, knowledge of Otaku-Culture isn't necessary.

again you're misunderstanding. I'm not saying any of those shows (Monogatari, SZS, The Tatami Galaxy) require knowledge of otaku-culture, just that they're not shows that people who aren't that into anime would find easy to get into. I know this because I've personally tried to recommend these shows to first time watchers and the responses are usually that the show is too hard to follow or boring. 

I'm not saying a lot of dialogue is bad for newcomers either, just that it's not the usual thing to reel the typical viewer in since these shows aren't as accessible as Code Geass, Steins;Gate and FMA. If you look at [the responses](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/23jzp8/what_was_your_first_anime/) in the [threads that are these](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/12uvl7/discussion_what_was_your_first_anime_does_it/), you see that most people started off with things like Ghibi movies, typical shounens, romance, comedy or action/ecchi anime and you see that most of those shows are *very* accessible. It's not that's it's not possible to start of with heavier shows, just that's is very rare when someone can actually get into anime via a show that is nothing like any other anime out there.
>> ARTICLE
Excuse me, but are you just assuming that people pretend not to like a show, because it's "the cool thing to do" in stead of, you know...actually disliking it?

For the record, no, I haven't seen NGNL yet. I'm not going to see it because I hate shows with excessive amounts of fanservice, regardless how good the rest of it is.

While it may annoy you, that people dislike and speak against something you enjoyed, the fact of the matter is that this needs to happen, otherwise this subreddit would just turn into an even bigger echo chamber (or "circlejerk" as reddit likes to call it) than it already is. And trust me, that's bad for everybody.

If people constantly refuse to look at things critically or at least semi-objectively just because they're "fun" and condemn the people who try to look beyond that, then there's no point in even having a discussion, because the discussion won't have any sort of critique in it. And discussion is what reddit's all about.

As for your "hipsters" claim...if disliking something that's popular and having valid reasons for doing so makes me a "hipster" (a term that's rapidly becoming a piece of overused nonsense) then so be it. I'm not afraid to say I didn't like something just because everybody else seems to think otherwise and I goddamn shouldn't be. People should embrace the fact that different opinions can exist simultaneously and not try to eradicate the one with which they don't agree. 

If I think NGNL is worse than Hitler, then in stead of just downvoting me into oblivion, you should try and dislodge my opinion with your own counter-arguments, because unless I'm disproven, I am logically right.

that's the point i was trying to make

thats fine, it's an ecchi show anyways, most of those have tons of fanservice. I think it's a bit shallow to dismiss a whole show because of that, but I mean at least you know what you don't like.

> if people constantly refuse to look at things critically or at least semi-objectively

which is not at all what I'm doing. It very easy to see the kind of show NGNL is, so why are people hating on it for doing what it said it would do? Of course NGNL isn't very deep, it wasn't meant to be anyways so why is it so bad that there is a show thats just mindless fun?? I'd say it's on the same level as KLK, but at least the story made more sense.

> your own counter-arguments, because unless I'm disproven, I am logically right.

no opinion is right or wrong. i'm not trying to strip away anyone's feelings about the show, I'm just saying that I feel like most people don't even have a real reason to dislike it so much since everyone just seems to be regurgitating the phrase "otaku pandering" that it's almost become the trendy thing to do. I'd rather hear some legitament concerns with the show than just "it's wish fulfillment" or "lolibait" or "pandering". Like maybe "Oh I thought the bad guy wasn't motivated enough." or "I felt like the characters backstories could've been fleshed out better" or just anything that actually makes more sense than just "otaku pandering".
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for actually taking the time to write a reasonable reply.

I admit that using the word "hate" was incorrect, the existence of shows that have harem/ecchi/otaku-baiting in really just irritates me more so than anything. It's not just because they gross me out (although that is a significant aspect by itself), it's mostly because, in my opinion, they perpetuate the stereotype of the creepy otaku shut-in who makes sexist sleazy remarks towards real women. 

I know most of us aren't like that, hell, a significant portion of the anime viewerbase (at least in the West) consists of women, but if that's true how is it possible that these kinds of shows air every season and sometimes even garner considerable fanbases? I simultaneously love anime as a medium, but hate some of the culture surrounding it, particularly the way it tends to objectify women (and in certain cases, men).

When I say "I hate fanservice", I'm not just saying that I hate the fact that shows include it, but the whole culture of objectification that it represents.
>> ARTICLE
No problem!

I cans see your point! But personally as a girl, I don't care about the objectification of women [or men] (I mention my gender because most people would think that women care about this as much as men do) in anime because it's just not a big deal to me. It's never bothered me because most shows that do objectify women tend to be those that are usually not of any real merit (e.g. comedies, harems, ecchi). It's never bothered me basically because I know when to take a show seriously and when not to. 

And honestly, I don't care if it perpetuates the stereotype either. Anime is the very last place I look to avoid stereotypes anyways (just look at how the show americans, white people and black people)! Most people aren't actually influenced by this either. Just because MC-kun treats all the girls around him like objects/weapons, doesn't mean that someone's gonna go be a disrespectful prick and try to treat people around him/her like they own them.

Your reason for disliking fanservice is totally valid, but my advice to you would be to either avoid ecchi/harem shows or try not to take it so seriously.  
>> ARTICLE
> my advice to you would be to either avoid ecchi/harem shows or try not to take it so seriously.

Don't worry, I avoid them like the plague!

By the way, I'm really glad I could finally have a reasonable argument with someone on /r/anime , it's been an honour.

>  I'm not going to see it because I hate shows with excessive amounts of fanservice

You gave Kill-la-kill an 8/10... and you say you hate fanservice?
>> ARTICLE
I'm well aware of the fanservice in Kill la Kill and it's my biggest problem with the show. In my head the actual rating is somewhere around 7,5 and that's not only due to the fanservice itself, but also the annoying villains and pacing slow-down in the second half.

Also, while self-awareness isn't a great excuse, the excessive fan service of Kill la Kill is often pointed out in the show itself and is built into it thematically. I'm not excusing the anime, though. I still really dislike how much fanservice there was overall and was actually planning to give up on it after watching the first episode. The only reason I continued to watch was because of how much it reminded me of FLCL, which is something I have quite a bit of love for.

I still strongly believe that if a show heavily relies on fanservice/otaku-bait, then it's creator wasn't confident enough in his/her work being able to stand on its own without resorting to "cheap tricks" to get the viewer's attention.

If you think me liking Kill la Kill despite hating fanservice is hypocritical, then so be it. I don't see it that way.

"OH GOD THIS SHOW IS A TRIGGER FOR MY HATRED OF POWER FANTASY, HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST IT!"

In all seriousness, I agree there completely too. The whole buzzword thing (I hate using that term, but it's easy to get the point across) that's circling around here is just getting ridiculous. It's like everyone's trying to be the next god tier literary critic when half the time they don't even make sense/miss a massive part of the show.

Hell, I had someone yesterday telling me that NGNL was nothing without the fanservice *when he flat out admitted he didn't even watch past episode 1.* Like how can you honestly judge a show as shit without even watching to like episode 3? It's just ridiculous. 

The attitude around here lately is gettin on my nerves. I read some post earlier that actually described my thoughts pretty well. It feels like people here nowadays watch anime just to *not* like a show, rather than watch to find things they enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
There is a lot of hate that surrounds it, but I don't think your assertion that people "forcibly dig for literary undertones", and that's why they don't like it, is incorrect. I think many people think that there is huge and unnecessary hype behind it being that it's now rated in the top 25  on MAL, and the fact that the fan service is excessive and the use of a preteen for fan service is a little disgusting. The whole pandering to a wide audience is a really whatever argument, but that's just my opinion.

People also probably have some dislike for the characters, and the complaints are completely understandable. The main characters really don't have any sense of depth. Not to mention the fact that they are near omnipotent beings when it comes to games. I mean I understand the fact that they're supposed to be good, but the intelligence they supposedly possess is far too much. That's not people looking for literary undertones or seeking dark themes, those are pretty valid complaints when you look at an anime and say, "Hey, these characters aren't really that good, or developed." Also, the main characters have an IWIN button for just about everything. The only thing that's really that interesting is the premise.

 On top of that it beat  seasoned anime, or things that in years we believe we'll call classics in the coming years, when there isn't really much NGNL will have once the hypetrain calms down (by comparison that is). In the end, people are upset that the anime they like more didn't win against an anime they feel isn't actually good. I don't think it's cool to hate and THATs why people do it. They legitimately feel that it isn't good.
>> ARTICLE
>fan service is excessive 

But...it's an ecchi show. It even says so on MAL.

This highlights my frustration.  I agree that NGNL is nothing more than a somewhat fun series.  But this:
>I think many people think that there is huge and unnecessary hype behind it being that it's now rated in the top 25 on MAL, and the fact that the fan service is excessive and the use of a preteen for fan service is a little disgusting...

>In the end, people are upset that the anime they like more didn't win against an anime they feel isn't actually good.

What I see here is:  

1. People are mad because more people like the show than they think should like it (and/or more people like the show than like their favorite show), and
2. People are mad because of fanservice featuring a young girl.

Oh dear.  I think we can all agree that (1) is pure nonsense if you're not a child desperate for validation.  (2) is even funnier, because I haven't seen any hate flooding into Monogatari, despite it's rather terrifying habit of including fanservice featuring such fan favorites as:

* Repeated attempts to molest a 10-12 year old girl
* Incestuous dental hygiene as a thinly disguised fellatio stand in (with a 15 year old girl)
* Frequent appearances of naked child (but it's okay because she's an ancient vampire)



>> ARTICLE
Trust me, Monogatari does get a lot of criticism for the fanservice parts.

Everything that gets hyped up will eventually generate counter-hype and collect people who hate it just because its popular. But that doesn't mean you can dismiss everyone who dislikes a well-recieved show as a "blind hater". Some people have actual reasons for dsiliking stuff, you know?

As for the monogatari comparison, which always pop up. You treat it as if the sexual parts are the only thing defining both shows. I dislike the inces/loli parts in either, but there still is a huge difference in character writing, storytelling and thematic depth that distinguished the two.
>> ARTICLE
Believe it or not, there are some who don't want the face of anime to become softcore porn. (Yes, parts of NGNL equate to that) Seems more off-putting to potential fans than people communicating what they dislike about the show. Also, there are many people, myself included, that have more fun watching a Satoshi Kon movie than No Game No Life.
>> ARTICLE
Except that almodt all anime has fanservice in it. I mean the monogatari series is regarded as a must watch show for many, and it has arguably much more offputting content than ngnl. 

Fact of the matter is there are different genres of anime and that shows can be great from any of them, whether it be because they are critical master pieces or are just good old fashion fun.

To say that ngnl shouldnt be highly rated because it leads to potential fans hearing about it and being turned off because it being ecchi is stupid when you think of the kind of posts that hit the front page. And im not even complaining about them, I actually appreciate good art whether it be nsfwish or not. 
>> ARTICLE
> Except that almodt all anime has fanservice in it

Except that most of the anime in the top 50 do not have fan service in or have minimal fan service. Ignoring shows in the top 50 I have not seen, here are all the other shows that have minimal to no fanservice in the top 50

* Mushishi (Both Seasons)

* FMA:B

* Steins;Gate

* Clannad

* Cowboy Bebop

* Attack on Titan

* Death Note

* Fate/Zero (Both Seasons)

* AnoHana

* Ping Pong

* Madoka Magica

* Baccano

* Jojo 

The only ones I've seen that do fanservice in them (or at least any more than 1 or 2 scenes) are

* Code Geass

* Monogatari

* and of course NGNL

Fanservice is inherently bad. When a show has fanservice, it is because the show is not trying to attract people's brains or hearts, but their dicks. I have seen shows that make good use of fanservice, such as episode 6 of NGNL, but overall fanservice is bad, period. And among all these shows, the only one to be described as softcore porn or "ecchi' is NGNL. A lot of people either don't like softcore porn, or don't think softcore porn deserves a place on the top 50.

>> ARTICLE
Not that it's a huge thing, [but I'd have to say that Cowboy Bebop has it's fair share of fan service.](http://myanimelist.net/character/2/Faye_Valentine) 


Jojo (Battle Tendency) has a lot of fanservice coming from Lisa Lisa, and we also have a lot of Loli fanservice in Stardust Crusaders

Death Note had a bit aswell (during the 2nd half, when the new girl started appearing).
>> ARTICLE
Faye is kind of fanservice, but besides the skimpy clothes not much other fanservice exists except for a shower scene

Battle tendency and Stardust Crusaders were both one scene/episode. So again, not much.

Death note I only remember one particular scene with the new girl wearing a skimpy dress.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not being rude or anything but,
Fanservice isn't always equals to nudity.

Here's a few more examples from [Cowboy Bebop \(nsfw\)](http://imgur.com/a/mCTT0). I'm fairly sure there's a lot more.


Jojo had Lisa Lisa wearing seductive clothing almost everytime she appeared and the camera angles weren't even hiding that fact.
I may be overreacting with Stardust Crusaders though (sorry).


Forgive me but I haven't seen Death Note in a while, last time I watched it was when I was still in highschool (which is around 7 years or more ago) had really suggestive shots for Misa, plus it had that weird BDSM-esque interrogation scene. The fact that she had a model background meant that she was meant for fanservice.




I'm not saying that it's bad for the series, but you can't deny the fact that even shows that are considered "top" have their fare share of fan-service.
>> ARTICLE
Again, for Cowboy bebop it's kind of bad, but it is still only one character that was a representation of the Femme Fatale  that was especially popular around that time.

I can only seem to find pictures of lisa lisa in a scarf and dress, except for the bath scene

I'm in a similar boat to you with Death Note, it was my first and I watching it around 3 years ago in my sophomore year of high school and I seem to mostly remember the one particular scene of her trying to seduce Light but I may be wrong. Beyond that it seems her main attire consisted of Gothic Lolita which isn't exactly very revealing. 

Like I originally said, I''m not denying that shows at the top don't have fan service, just that they don't really have that much. In my mind fan service is like salt. A little salt never hurt anyone, and most things have some salt. Too much salt though, makes something taste terrible to most. NGNL is a truck load of salt.

If the fanservice/sexual content is well done, it can add to the story. Some examples of this would be the previously mentioned Bakemonogatari, Welcome to the NHK, and Berserk. NGNL throws tits in your face and asks, "are you having fun yet?" I am fully aware of how enjoyable the anime can be. What I do not understand is why people delude themselves into saying the characters and story are in any way well-done just because they could turn their brains off in order to get a laugh or two. Hell, this show has more fanservice than Love Hina did, and that was a pure ecchi harem for it's time. I would love to be able to actually mention that I like anime and have someone immediately think of Cowboy Bebop or Perfect Blue rather than this crap. Maybe, just maybe, the industry could grow into something accepted normally. Shows like this ruin any chance of that ever happening. 

>> ARTICLE
"Well done" is completely subjective, and to say the Monogatari fanservice "adds to the story" just shows your bias. For instance, that bathscene with Senjougahara and Hannekawa was DEFINITELY relevant to the plot right? Monogarati fanservice is just that, fanservice. People need to stop giving it a pass just because the fetishize about the show. It's okay to like fanservice. Stop pretending it isn't. 

>Bakemonogatari

This one was especially bad. Araragi literally *molests a little girl.* 

>Welcome to the NHK, and Berserk.

I haven't seen these so I can't comment there.

> What I do not understand is why people delude themselves into saying the characters and story are in any way well-done just because they could turn their brains off in order to get a laugh or two.

Because a show CAN have well-done characters, and an interesting/well done story even if it's a "fun" oriented anime. Something doesn't need to make you depressed to be "good." Get over yourself man. A comedy can be a great show just like dramas can. They are DIFFERENT, but they both can be good. 

> I would love to be able to actually mention that I like anime and have someone immediately think of Cowboy Bebop or Perfect Blue rather than this crap. Maybe, just maybe, the industry could grow into something accepted normally. Shows like this ruin any chance of that ever happening.


Monogatari is just as guilty for this. If you want people to think of anime as something without fanservice, then lets hear your threads on that hmm? Mono fanservice is just as bad, and in fact, many times *more* off putting like in the case of Araragi sexually harassing a 9-12 year old, or brushing his sisters teeth where it's meant to make it seem like a blowjob. 
>> ARTICLE
>"Well done" is completely subjective

I get the feeling that he is talking about the general critical consensus here. Even if it is technically subjective it can basically be considered a pseudo-objective rating of the work critically. NGNL fails in this regard whether people want to believe it or not. Shows like Monogatari and Cowboy Bebop don't.

>Because a show CAN have well-done characters, and an interesting/well done story even if it's a "fun" oriented anime. Something doesn't need to make you depressed to be "good." Get over yourself man. A comedy can be a great show just like dramas can. They are DIFFERENT, but they both can be good.

I don't think anyone is arguing that a show being "fun" oriented is mutually exclusive with good writing. For example, I'd say TTGL had pretty damn good writing and it is one of the most fun-oriented shows I've seen. NGNL, however, happens to be a show that many consider to not be a good example of this. 

>To say the Monogatari fanservice "adds to the story" just shows your bias. For instance, that bathscene with Senjougahara and Hannekawa was DEFINITELY relevant to the plot right? Monogarati fanservice is just that, fanservice. People need to stop giving it a pass just because the fetishize about the show. It's okay to like fanservice. Stop pretending it isn't.

Your constant use of Monogatari as an example of a pandering show that gets love anyway is honestly kind of obnoxious. The reason people like Monogatari usually isn't because of the pandering but because of the dialogue/character writing/themes/etc.. As a general case, I'd say that fan service doesn't necessarily take away from a show (NGNL and Monogatari both being good examples). Monogatari is simply considered to do so much more (and NGNL isn't) which is why it is so highly praised by many critical reviewers. Whether you consider the fan service in monogatari purposeful or not is independent of this. Personally I think it often is, even if there are instances of it being just fan service but that's not the point of this anyway.

Personally, I like NGNL. I really do. It borders between a 5 - 6/10 for me which is actually really high for a show that did nothing worthwhile to me from a critical perspective but the defenses people are giving for this show being anywhere near as highly rated as it is are just absurd. The ambitions of a show do affect its quality whether people want to believe it or not and NGNL has none. 

People want others to have a more positive outlook on the medium. In order for this to occur we need certain types of shows to be thought of when people think the word "anime." These shows should probably do two things: have little to no pandering and hold up critically. A show like NGNL which achieves nothing but being pretty entertaining through absurdity and fan service is not the kind of show most people want representing the medium. It fulfills neither of these. Monogatari probably wouldn't be a good example either (there is fan service whether it has merit or not - and that is off putting to many) even though it is often considered fantastic critically. 

This is why people get annoyed by the fact that everyone votes something like NGNL to the top. Top anime lists are the things people who don't know the medium see if they look into it at all and something like NGNL is the exact opposite of the image we want to portray.
>> ARTICLE
> get the feeling that he is talking about the general critical consensus here. Even if it is technically subjective it can basically be considered a pseudo-objective rating of the work critically. NGNL fails in this regard whether people want to believe it or not. Shows like Monogatari and Cowboy Bebop don't.

Maybe to you, a person who actually believes that stuff. Monogatari for one (as for Bebop, I think that's very overrated too,) definitely, to me, doesn't seem nearly as great as people act. And no, not just because of enjoyment. I do not think the dialogue was engaging. 

>I don't think anyone is arguing that a show being "fun" oriented is mutually exclusive with good writing. For example, I'd say TTGL had pretty damn good writing and it is one of the most fun-oriented shows I've seen. NGNL, however, happens to be a show that many consider to not be a good example of this.

Okay, so the people that *do* consider it a good example are just pushed aside then? If a show is that high rated, and tons are saying "no, the show actually *is* good." Maybe it's *you* (or the people in question) that are wrong, rather than the vast majority you are disagreeing with. 

>Your constant use of Monogatari as an example of a pandering show that gets love anyway is honestly kind of obnoxious. The reason people like Monogatari usually isn't because of the pandering but because of the dialogue/character writing/themes/etc.. 

That is as obnoxious to you, as what you're saying about NGNL is to me. And yeah the fanservice isn't the ONLY reason. I dislike the Monogatari series, but I'm not going to pretend like fanservice is the only reason people watch it. That being said, everything else you mentioned, to me, really wasn't that good either, but that's not the point right now. The main thing is that fanservice isn't the only reason people watch NGNL, just like it isn't the only reason they watch Mono. Plenty of people (myself included) love the character interactions, find the comedy hilarious, love the engaging mental battles with bluffs, love the art, find the story interesting, love the world, enjoy watching the reactions and playings of Shiro and Sora, etc. So to imply people only watch NGNL for fanservice and pandering is, to steal a phrase from you, kind of obnoxious. 

> Monogatari is simply considered to do so much more (and NGNL isn't) which is why it is so highly praised by many critical reviewers. 

While I really don't think Monogatari deserves that praise, I just covered above what more NGNL does. It's not deep nor dramatic, but it's comedic, fun, exciting, and the games are solved in interesting and unique ways, rather than just "LOL I WON!" While this is subjective, so is what you're telling me about Monogatari.

>Personally, I like NGNL. I really do. It borders between a 5 - 6/10 for me which is actually really high for a show that did nothing worthwhile to me from a critical perspective but the defenses people are giving for this show being anywhere near as highly rated as it is are just absurd. The ambitions of a show do affect its quality whether people want to believe it or not and NGNL has none.

That's fine, I really don't care what you rate it. But the reasons you're giving **ME** for why it's bad are just as absurd. You're basically insulting NGNL because it's not a drama when it doesn't intend to be, nor does it intend to give off some deep intellectual message. That does *not* mean a show is bad, nor does it mean a show doesn't deserve a top slot. 

>People want others to have a more positive outlook on the medium. In order for this to occur we need certain types of shows to be thought of when people think the word "anime." These shows should probably do two things: have little to no pandering and hold up critically. 

Okay, you want to think that, fine, I don't care. It's your opinion. But the problem I have with it, is that people shit on NGNL for the fanservice in that it's "bad for people outside to see that as representative!" but the thing is, those same people wouldn't have any problem if Monogatari were to represent it. Just look at this thread. I know you said Mono wouldn't make a good example either, but the point is many others in threads like this *do*. I despise the hypocrisy that is present, especially when surrounding Monogatari. If someone feels shows like Psycho-Pass, FMA, or Fate Zero should be what is shown as a good representation of anime to attract more newcomes/get rid of the stigma, that's fine. Hell, I would even agree for the most part. However, when shows like Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, and Monogatari are pushed to the front, there is absolutely no reason for why NGNL shouldn't fit right along side those. It would be hypocritical to say NGNL doesn't belong while those other 3 do.

>This is why people get annoyed by the fact that everyone votes something like NGNL to the top. Top anime lists are the things people who don't know the medium see if they look into it at all and something like NGNL is the exact opposite of the image we want to portray.

Yes I know, but when things like Monogatari get put up there, where the MC literally *molests a little girl multiple times as a joke*, NGNL has just as much a right to be up top. 
>> ARTICLE
You are completely ignoring the fact that I am talking about the critical consensus here. Whether you or I or anyone else dislikes it, NGNL is not considered, by the consensus of the critical community (by this I mean those who actually analyze shows and present reasons behind their opinions of a show through the quality of writing/directing/etc.), to be anything great. Monogatari, however, is.

>That's fine, I really don't care what you rate it. But the reasons you're giving ME for why it's bad are just as absurd. You're basically insulting NGNL because it's not a drama when it doesn't intend to be, nor does it intend to give off some deep intellectual message. That does not mean a show is bad, nor does it mean a show doesn't deserve a top slot.

We'll have to agree to disagree here. As far as I'm concerned, a show that succeeds in being meaningful/powerful is simply superior to a show that succeeds in being fun as long as said success are in relatively similar ranges (not that these are mutually exclusive, NGNL just isn't something I've ever seen someone consider to be the former). Because of this, I just can't see a show like NGNL ever deserving a top spot.

>Yes I know, but when things like Monogatari get put up there, where the MC literally molests a little girl multiple times as a joke, NGNL has just as much a right to be up top.

Although I agree that Monogatari shouldn't and doesn't have the right to be the face of anime, but because of said critical consensus I would say that it does have *more* of a right to be there than NGNL as it at least fulfills one of the requirements for what I believe should be the face of anime.

>The main thing is that fanservice isn't the only reason people watch NGNL, just like it isn't the only reason they watch Mono.

I think the difference here is that I consider most of that pandering (not that I believe that pandering is necessarily a bad thing). The comedy in NGNL was mostly referential (which is pandering), the world itself is a from of pandering in that it is made to appeal to a particular audience, etc.. Just making sure you understand that when I say that enjoyment of NGNL is pretty much purely derived from pandering that that isn't necessarily an insult. NGNL is a really solid show, but many (myself included) just can't consider it *as good* as something that is powerful/meaningful, whatever genre it may be (and NGNL was the only show that made it far at all in the polls that I wouldn't consider to have these qualities at all).

Also somebody call its mother and tell her that **she's fat and ugly**.

^cough Now that that's over with, here we are, at the semifinals. We are nearing the conclusion of this grand tourney, everyone, and it has been quite a journey indeed. Minna-san, I'm glad to have come this far with you all.


**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Full Metal Alchemist versus Steins;Gate - the One Good Shounen versus [our favorite time-travelling goddess of beauty](http://hdw.datawallpaper.com/anime/kurisu-makise-291982.jpg) right here. Who will take this match and move on to pulverize either Geass or 'Gatari in the finals? Well, FMA has its unsurpassable, unbelievably ferocious popularity on its side, while Steins;Gate has the edge in critical acclaim, gorgeous visuals, memes, and the entire labcoat fetish community ^not ^that ^I ^would ^know ^anything ^about ^that backing it up. While I loved FMA, hell, you're lying if you say you didn't, I still get goosebumps sometimes from the best and most memorable parts of Steins. This is probably going to be the most fierce, bloody, amazing, and spectacular battle yet. People will die, the Earth will become scorched, legends and song will burst from the ashes of men and, when the sun sets at the end of this day, I'm sure it will [rain with flooding fury, and the terrible odor of gunpowder will become interwoven with the dreadful petrichor in the night and in all nights to come](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1367/40/1367402468723.jpg).

**2.** This is pretty much a contest to see who get's to be either FMA or S;G's punching bag tomorrow. [Monogatari, as aforementioned, is the one lady whom I've sworn my life and blood to](http://i.imgur.com/cfMH3Wo.gif). I will fight and die at its side, and I only hope that my allies will rally to mine. Code Geass is going to bring the big guns to the table, drawing dark magic from the deepest corners of the official Pizza Hut cookbook and inspiring itself by staring at blown-up pictures of tables and nightstands. And, to be perfectly honest, I fear that that's going to be enough to give Geass the win here. Geass suffers from a mere fraction of the criticism that Monogatari always has and will be bogged down with, and I'd be shitting myself if I said it didn't have an exponentially larger amount of popularity to its name. Monogatari is certainly at a disadvantage, but, hell, it's been at a disadvantage this entire damn tournament. Hell, Monogatari is at a disadvantage whenever it's compared to the more popular shows anywhere. It took down the giants that are Bebop and AnoHana, didn't it? Maybe this will be a match that will go down in history, maybe this fight will go down just as expected. If the Gods be good, maybe [Monogatari will finally take its long-awaited crown](http://i.imgur.com/mgQjCbN.gif) (er, well, second place crown), if not, then I have no qualms against the magnificent and deserving show that is Code Geass being the one to finally defeat it.

Thanks for the awesome writeup. ^^^and ^^^that ^^^pic

Of the final four, I haven't yet watched Bakemonogatari. It is on my to watch list, but it must have flown over my head how big the series is. I guess I will bump it up to next in line to watch after I finish psycho-pass.

I hope Monogatari pulls through, but it's obvious it isn't considering the huge following the other shows have.

I'm going to be platinum mad if Monogatari doesn't make it to the finals!  I've been working my way through Second Season in preparation for Hanamonogatari and so far its been absolutely incredible, probably the best show I've seen so far.  However Code Geass is higher rated and the second most popular show on MAL so I'm not optimistic.  I think Steins;Gate will probably edge out FMA:B just based on the fact that over 1k people voted for it last round (granted it was against NGNL) but I wouldn't be surprised either way.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, I love Steins;Gate , but FMA is just so superior in comparison (an extensive lore, a plethora of amazingly memorable characters, plenty of feels, etc.), why is it losing by such a big margin? I'm also a little bias against regarding Steins so high because the story is a rip off of ''The Time Machine'' novel lol.

I also can't stand Code Geass got this far, it's a really entertaining show, but there are quite a few I believe deserve to be there instead.

>> ARTICLE
HxH is unique as a shounen, but shonuen as a group are not unique. (I have seen all of both shows and HxH manga) That's the problem. Code Geass was incredible in just about every way, with some of the craziest plot twists and best characters I've seen. Not to mention the animation quality and just how damn good the show looked and sounded.

1\. Code Geass versus Ping Pong - *Why*?! Why must you do this to me?!

3\. Great Teacher Onizuka versus Haruhi Suzumiya - This is interesting. A much older show that remains commonly referenced, or the newer, hyper-popular show that's rarely mentioned these days?

7\. It was nice knowing, you, Kill la Kill.

8\. Hanasku Iroha versus Gurren Lagann - I'm fine with either of these.

Day 2 Results:

Not surprised about Clannad versus Index/Railgun, but still a bit sad. Well, it's also an uneven franchise. I'm really glad Shinsekai Yori won, but while sports shows are still popular on this subreddit, considerably less than elsewhere I've seen.

Just goes to show how bad the community's taste can be. (Not that Kill la Kill was bad by any measure, but definitely not better than Evangelion) 
>> ARTICLE
Define bad taste? Other than people liking shows you don't like, or rate highly of course. Because that's absolutely idiotic, people predominately watch anime for entertainment/escapism, not to distinguish what's the best on offer within the medium or to please short sighted people. It's that shallow mindset which stops a lot of people from getting into anime.

Ping Pong is going to get absolutely smashed in those match ups despite it not even being bad, but simply because the majority of people pegged it as simply a sports anime and didn't bother picking it up. That's understandable. I could easily say that even with Evangelion being a huge anime, it's not as easily accessible nor it is something you try to introduce a casual watcher with. Whereas Kill la Kill is the exact opposite, it's easily understandable why things are winning here, it's not majorly due to 'bad taste'. Whatever you believe that to be. I'm sure many of the Kill la Kill watchers could easily enjoy Evangelion, if they'd even seen it, and they'd seen enough anime to understand why it's so good. It's the same exact reason GTO is getting smashed, not as easily accessible as Haruhi, nor is it 'new'. I've never seen GTO on sale in any place I live, Haruhi is always there begging to be bought.

This is a poll of favourites, not what is better. I thought that was absolutely evident with the amount of fantastic shows left out of the poll, apparently not?

What stops a lot of people from getting into anime is the garbage ecchi and moe shows that become popular now turn most people away. Bad taste would be someone who likes a show that is not good for an invalid reason.

Depends what you consider as 'garbage'. Again you're only focused on what you like. I introduced a friend to anime through K-ON! They've went on to watch tonnes of great shows. The easy to digest ones you seemingly put down are great for bouncing people into better crafted anime.

> Bad taste would be someone who likes a show that is not good for an invalid reason. (Such as for escapism or guilty pleasures)

God knows how you consider escapism and guilty pleasures to be an invalid reason for enjoying shows. You've ruled out an enormous amount of people who watch any type of entertainment... again, short sighted.

How is it creating a worse community? Explain. Because you've just essentially insulted half the subreddit by saying they have bad taste, and what? That makes you the 'better' part of the community? You think you're better than them because you watch different shows? Get over yourself.

I'd take Monster or NHK over KlK or NGNL any day, but I wouldn't put other people down for doing the opposite, it's just bad manners and a disgusting attitude which puts people off going further into anime and its community if they get shit on for enjoying something.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair people who literally stop enjoying something because of what people on the internet say are thin-skinned as shit and have obviously never been on the internet for longer than five minutes.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the question isn't what's a better show, but which one did you like better.  I can pretty easily understand why someone would like Kill la Kill better.  There's probably some availability bias as well since I can't think of anywhere to legally watch Evangelion and cant possibly be the only person who avoids watching shows illegally whenever humanly possible.

I know that on such a large scale, there are going to be definite flaws in the voting system, but isn't it sort of unfair to put something that's been considered a classic for 5+ years against a show that, while incredible, had only just ended about a month ago and hasn't really had the time to gather a large fanbase?

I'm aware that you could say the same thing about No Game No Life vs Dragonball, but unlike Ping-Pong, which is a smaller niche show, NGNL is straight off of a massive hype train. I don't think it's much of a surprise that something that's been filling a large portion of r/anime's front page  won against a juggernaut like Dragonball/Dragonball Z.

One has to wonder how that specific poll would like like in a year, once the hype has died down a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Suprised that NGNL beat out Dragonball by that much. Nice to see that OHSHC and YuYu were close. 

Edit: On a side note some of these were incredibly hard to answer...GTO vs Haruhi? Damn, you dark. 
>> ARTICLE
I just hope the NGNL crowd doesn't beat Madoka.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Ngnl was cool, but madoka will still be relevant in 10 years.
>> ARTICLE
And then we get fairy tail vs k-on...
>> ARTICLE
Funny thing is I've only seen k-on and SAO of those choices
>> ARTICLE
Started out a little slower than yesterday, but it looks like we're going to reach around the same numbers. I thought Bleach and One Piece would be a little closer, but I guess since Bleach concluded, it lost some of its steam. Kill la Kill and NGE is still too close to call. I've been rooting for Kill la Kill. Definitely the more entertaining series in my opinion. I've only seen the original NGE series though. Maybe if I saw any of the movies I'd have a better opinion of it. The biggest surprise for me is that SAO is losing. No one can say now that the series with the higher viewership will always win. SAO more than doubled Fate/Zero's viewership, but it's getting destroyed.
>> ARTICLE
It probably has to do with the fact that both SAO and Fate/Zero are fairly popular (and recent) shows, so there's an actual competition rather than "what genre do people watch more?" Emphasized with Hansaku Iroha vs TTGL, but I think options for "I've only watched x" would have been helpful at the start. Just to see what people who've watched both really think. 

Also, the general attitude toward SAO on this sub...
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, I can already see Madoka and then Shin sekai yori/Clannad losing to NGNL, lets hope the hypetrain falls off till the next voting.

On an unrelated note, can't we sticky these threads for greater visibility? 
>> ARTICLE
KLK and NGE are nearly equal in votes.  

Absolutely disgusting to the highest degree
>> ARTICLE
NGE pretty much got me into anime and I found KLK mediocre at best. I'll be so bummed out if NGE gets eliminated. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't like either one, I couldn't stand the art style in KLK and NGE I just found boring. However if I were to pick one I think KLK would be my choice from a personal standpoint despite knowing NGE is superior when it comes to quality.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh, I hate when other people like different things than me
>> ARTICLE
Elitism is a way of life, amigo.
>> ARTICLE
So I couldn't vote for one of these. The third option should be "I have not seen one or both of these shows". I hate Haruhi but have not seen GTO, so I had no option to pick (As much as I would have liked to say I have not seen Haruhi). Also people really should not be voting unless they have seen both shows anyway, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Picking between Kill la Kill and NGE hurts my soul.
>> ARTICLE
It pains me to vote against GTO but TMoHS is a top 5 for me.
>> ARTICLE
3. I know both shows are pretty well known and well regarded for obvious reasons, but I am kind of surprised to see Haruhi holding its own against GTO. 

4. One that is surprising me the most at the moment, I honestly didn't think K-On had a chance, but it looks to be holding its own. Still pulling for fairy tail though.

6. Really wish I could have voted for One Piece, but no matter how  much I like one piece, I can't vote for it since I have not seen Bleach yet. 
>> ARTICLE
K-On!'s too cute to lose. I should have picked it in the second round as well.
>> ARTICLE
But....Fairy Tail has cute characters too. There's the snowman,the cat people, a flying owl man and a goat in a suit....that can push them to victory.....
>> ARTICLE
Hang on a minute, 21% have not seen *EITHER* One Piece *OR* Bleach? How is that statistically possible on the Anime sub?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen either. Their length is too intimidating to start, and Dragon Ball is the only power-up shounen I need.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they have seen some of it and not all of it? Or at least not enough of it to pass a judgement ? 
>> ARTICLE
RIP Hanasaku Iroha
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised to see Kenshin losing to HxH.  I guess HxH is winning because it is currently airing.  Kenshin though has some of the best fight scenes out there, and good characters/drama/story to match.  Do yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't.  Not hating on HxH at all, I love it too, but Kenshin is definitely my pick here.
>> ARTICLE
Aww, sorry to see raildex out so early. I liked those.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, did my civic duty and voted for Eva, for whatever good it will do.

A shame Ping Pong gets sniped early by one of the heavyweights, but it was never gonna win, so eh. We might actually have the deciding vote long before the final - Madoka versus NGNL.
>> ARTICLE
Voting time is almost over. Get those last votes in!
>> ARTICLE
**Code Geass** vs Ping Pong - Ping Pong was a good series but Code Geass is sure to become a classic in the near future. It has a great ending and is generally considered one of 2006's best shows and as I am personally of the belief that the importance of endings is quite large Code Geass was a no brainer here.

**Hunter x Hunter** vs Rurouni Kenshin - I enjoyed Kenshin and all but HxH is a very unique and good shounen series. While I do find it has major flaws I still think it's one of the best shounen series out there.

Great Teacher Onizuka vs **Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu** - I personally watched both for quite a while but I couldn't get into GTO and dropped it after 20 episodes while Haruhi was quite enjoyable all be it somewhat confusing.

**Fairy Tail** vs K-on! - I thought K-on! was very meh... nothing special really however Fairy Tail isn't all that special either and if it would be only the 2014 version I would've surely selected K-on! but the first season of Fairy Tail is somewhat enjoyable so I gotta pick Fairy Tail.

**Fate/Zero** vs Sword Art Online - Quite honestly in my mind this is a question of general quality versus target audience so Fate/Zero was a given.

**One Piece** vs Bleach - A nice matchup but in my eyes not close what so ever mainly thanks to the comedy of One Piece which in my eyes makes it superior, I also believe One Piece to have more interesting characters and Tite Kubo's writing to be pretty crap.

**Kill la Kill** vs Neon Genesis Evangelion - Now I don't really like either one of these series however my reasoning is different for not liking them. With NGE I found the series to be boring and bland and I couldn't stand Shinji or Asuka. But with KLK I dropped it simply because of the art style and as such I've made KLK my choice.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann vs **Hanasaku Iroha** - Honestly this one was finished at the announcement of the matchup but I believe Gurren Lagann to be among the most overrated series in anime and that is the only reason I went for Hanasaku Iroha.


From day 2 I'm a bit surprised about the votes on Ouran Koukou Host Club, I thought it was more popular than that. I'm a bit sad that Kuroko lost out as I'd love to see a matchup between my two favourite series (Kuroko and Clannad) but aside from that 3 other series in my top 6 advanced to the next round so I'm quite pleased with the results.

>> ARTICLE
ping pong is extremely more quality than code geass, code geass is mostly a hollywood-action style series that promotes flash over substance, while ping pong is a phenomenal character study. it's probably easier to watch code geass, but i'd recommend ping pong over it 100/100 times.
>> ARTICLE
Idk... I liked Ping Pong but it had a lot of areas it was lacking in as well.
>> ARTICLE
like what exactly? hardly anything was less than stellar in that anime
>> ARTICLE
Well a given is it's art style, very off putting and hard to get used too.

Other than that I'd have to say that the OST and general SFX were nothing special at all though I did take a liking to the opening.

The general story wasn't strong either, the show felt more character driven.

The characters however were very good, especially Peco and Smile.
>> ARTICLE
alright i can respect what you sayin, but in general i think that anime characters are so badly written that ping pong is a huge breath of fresh air, and everything that came with those characters was icing on a delicious cake 


>> ARTICLE
Gonna have to vote SAO over F/Z. Fate/Zero might have been technically better, but I just couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't stand most of the characters and it was trying way too hard at being all grimdark. SAO I at least had fun with. (especially the first half)
>> ARTICLE
That's going to be an interesting matchup...

SAO has hype over Season 2, but it's got a great amount of people who dislike it and would vote F/Z just because it's NOT SAO. 

On the other hand, F/Z is absolutely amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the results of last round, it seems we will have the two of the most overrated shows in the history of this subreddit going at it.
>> ARTICLE
Which in particular are you talking about? 
>> ARTICLE
Not the same person but if I had to guess I would say he means NGNL vs Madoka
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't see how people can call Madoka overrated to the degree they are. It's a fantastic show and it's super well done. I'd have to say that I think Gurren Lagann, KLK, AoT and NGE are all way more overrated.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren lagann and especial evangelion earned their position you can't say one of the most influential shows of the past 20 years is overrated 
>> ARTICLE
Idk I mean... Evangelion does have it's credibilities but in all honesty I don't find it anywhere near as good as people claim. The only reason I tend to mention it is because it's a classic. Gurren Lagann however is a different story as it can't really be said to hold the value of a "classic" yet... In my eyes atleast and especially here TTGL is looked upon as some divine creation.
>> ARTICLE
How exactly did Gurren Lagann "earned" their position? Eva is influential, but so is Madoka. It has also won more awards than any other series beside Eva and broke many records with its releases.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann I'll concede but Madoka may be popular but it hasn't had the impact of Eva nor did it inspire as many copycats so Eva is in no way overrated 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't say Eva was overrated. 

I'm simply saying it is hard to call something overrated when a series is loved by both fans and critics alike.

I started it a few months ago but couldn't get past the episode after looking at that huge number of episodes even though I've watched the big 3.

some people say it starts to get better at 25. I definitely liked the episodes before, but you might wanna try to hold out that long. Obviously if you notice that it's not for you you shouldn't push yourself

I've heard that too but I didn't have the motivation back then to watch it. That changed since back then though so I might pick it up again soon.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it.  I watched 74 episodes and I find it...  Okay nothing really special.  Just most of the comedy in it is not for me I guess
>> ARTICLE
Is it true the premise combines sci-fi with samurais? Oh did I get that wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
well in theory yes, it's sci-fi with samurais. but it's much more. It's the comedy that makes the show, so the setting doesn't matter all too much  (it's still very well used). So you see loads of aliens showing up in feudal japan with spaceships. Just see for yourself, it's tough to describe.

I don't know how much effort it would take, but it would be interesting to see these figures adjusted for popularity.

How do you put Hellsing Ultimate on hold o.O
>> ARTICLE
probably because it took like 6 years for 10 episodes to be aired at a pace of 1-3 episodes per year. some people just got tired of waiting and haven't bothered to finish it yet.

I'm assuming there were a lot of people who put it on hold because they were waiting for the last 2 episodes to be dubbed and haven't gotten around to watching them yet. (I'm in this exact situation)
>> ARTICLE
But... there are subs.

The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.

Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.

Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.

Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Sorry for not being really that helpful.

Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit.

Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.

I was really rooting for Hungrybox. Jigglypuff power!

Hbox is my favorite of the big 5, was definitely cheering for him (also Axe and Fly Amanita).

Man, as a huge League of Legends fan and a Diamond 1 player, I just can't watch LCS. It's so boring seeing the same teams play over and over again. I really wish there were more tournaments instead of the monotony that is LCS.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I switched to Dota 2! Whether or not you like the game better, I think Valve has done a much better job with the pro scene. They host one tournament annually, and there a tons of other, somewhat smaller tournaments throughout the year. There a loads of good teams from each region, and you get to see some interesting hero choices, plays, and strategies.

I like the casters and players a lot better too, there are a lot of different personalities with different... personalities, who all bring something unique to the table. Also, you can watch games from the client or twitch.
>> ARTICLE
Well for me personally I have like 30+ friends who play League and 0 who play Dota 2. And I really love to play with my friends so making the switch would be hard.
>> ARTICLE
The issue is how it's a team-game. So in terms of salary/people... used to watch SC2 GOM tournaments before League, and you can have a lot more players there, with much more change in the matchups.

Then again, more champions, less races.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, more champions, less races.

It's too bad we only get to see about 20 champions played until next patch when we get a new set of about 20... 
>> ARTICLE
more like replace 2-3 :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah true. Back in the old days, it was all about tournies. IPL (rip), IEM, Dreamhack. But, I think it's better for the whole industry. Having a LCS makes league more like a real sport and more games means more content from third parties, more drama (yay), more trashtalking, more games to back up that trashtalking, and simply a better stage to prove who really is the better team.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, fortunately it was recently announced that they'll maybe add more participating teams to the lcs next season, so that will maybe create some diversity/uniqueness in matchups

Mushishi lost to toradora

Cowboy Bebop losing is definitely a travesty and while I understand why TTGL won against Evangelion because it's easier to get into and a more "epic" show, it's still disappointing to see Eva lose. 
>> ARTICLE
This is why I hate the anime community right now. A space-adventure show loses to a harem. We have fallen out of the bounds of geek culture and into something lower. We really have to ask ourselves, is this what we want anime to become? Harems and ecchi? If we keep this mentality up, anime will have to become a form of softcore pornography to keep sales up. Don't get me wrong, the monogatari series is good, and the best of the ecchi harems, but it should not be more popular than the timeless classic that is Bebop. There is something inherently wrong with that. 
>> ARTICLE
You're really throwing Monogatari in with countless generic ecchi harem shows? Have you even seen it?
>> ARTICLE
I said it's the best of the ecchi harem shows. It's still an ecchi harem though. 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is this unique little thing that manages to balance entertainment, themes, and interesting characters with campy humor, endearing/moe characters, and ecchi fanservice.

 It's able to do that because, at its core, all it's trying to do is put on a show. And, in my opinion, that's the best thing a show could try to do. It doesn't pretend to be some amazingly-written and literary piece of art, because it's still an animated late night TV comedy series, and it doesn't try to be heartless, money-milking, tit-squeezing moeshit either, because a show still needs to captivate and cultivate interest in order to entertain.

Is it ecchi? Oh yeah. A harem? A bit. But it's also a show, with great characters, great music, and great comedy. So what's wrong with having some fun? I'd rather have that than another angsty, grimdark series with a permanent scowl and an ugly color palette. 

 And, hell, Bebop is a classic, was one of my first and to this day is one of my most beloved, and I'm sure it's exactly the same with many others. But it had its fair share of problems, just like Monogatari and every piece of entertainment in existence does. The effect that nostalgia has on the series is terrifyingly strong; and that means two things. One, the show was so amazing and innovative that it caused so many people to keep it in their hearts for so long in the first place, and two, people looking back at it now tend to look back it with thick, thick rose-colored glasses.

**TL/DR;** Deciding between favorite TV shows always has and always will be shitty for all involved, let's be friends.
>> ARTICLE
I was being harsh on monogatari. I enjoyed it too. Just expressing general grievances. 
>> ARTICLE
No you're right it's BS that Bebop loss against gatari...
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is about to lose to NGNL. The BS meter is high will this poll.
>> ARTICLE
There's just *a little bit* more too it than just being "an ecchi harem". If that's the only thing you took away from it you very very much need to rewatch it.

You responded to this guy just as I did homie.

Are you sure you're not spiritually linked to me or something?

The hell man? What's even more strange is that I was writing a much more detailed comment about the Monogatari series and then thought to myself "fuck it, someone else will write it" and then erased it in favor of the short one I left.

But I got nothin'.

As someone who has only seen the original ending of NGE this doesn't surprise me.

Like I said in the other thread, both Eva and Gurren Lagann spiral into insanity at the end. 

Only one of them does it intentionally.

Am I dense for not being certain which you are referring to? They both do everything intentionally. I'm guessing this is supposed to be critical of Eva but the ending was completely deliberate so I'm not really sure...

Bebop had to lose because most people in /r/anime haven't even seen it.
>> ARTICLE
That really seems to be the case and it's a real shame. It's just a classic anime to me right there next to Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Rurouni Kenshin. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I'm currently in the process of watching Bebop (about halfway through) and while its definitely a good show, its not one of my favorites. I would have voted for Bakemonogatari over it.
>> ARTICLE
See the problem here is that most of bebop is episodic until the end where it wraps everything up and makes the journey meaningful. Having not completed a show and claiming other shows are better is just one problem with a popularity contes... I mean tournament like this.
>> ARTICLE
There's an extra poll today today with the previously eliminated shows to decide 17th to 32nd place. Vote for as many as you'd like. http://strawpoll.me/2109607
>> ARTICLE
**Match 1:**  FMA will probably win because it had so much more time to flesh out the story and was done well.  I'd like for Angel Beats to win, but I do have to agree with some its critics in that it does feel rushed.

**Match 4:** NGNL will probably win, due to popularity and recent memory, but I am a bit sad it is able to outclass established classics on that alone.  I'm sure that if this same poll was taken a year or two in the future, NGNL would do significantly worse.  While fun and entertaining, it doesn't really impact the audience in a meaningful way.

**Match 5:** Code Geass will win because it was entertaining, done somewhat well, and because everyone who watched Haruhi remembers the Endless Eight episodes, which severely reduced the audience's experience of Haruhi.

**Match 6:** This one should be close, but I hope for Fate/Zero to win because it was not only entertaining, I feel that it also had better characterization and themes present.  TTGL is fun, but I feel like its overhyped and that's causing me to go against it.

**Match 7:** Toradora should win because it impacts the audience and is memorable as one of the best rom-coms in anime.  Death Note, on the other hand, is entertaining, but I feel that its just a fun show and doesn't really leave any hard message for the audience to remember.

**Match 8:** Bakemonogatari should take the cake since it was memorable in pretty much every way, whereas Anohana has some problems with its drama feeling slightly arbitrary and (as I understand it from others) it feel emotionally manipulative.

I don't feel confident enough to comment on matches 2 and 3 since I haven't seen Psycho-Pass, Stein;s Gate, and Baccano!  I know I should get on them, but I haven't gotten around to watching them due to lack of interest.
>> ARTICLE
For me, in any other bracket, I wouldn't have voted for NGNL, but I'm just one of those stonehearted bastards that utterly hated Clannad/AS
>> ARTICLE
The best-of-16 selections are basically shows that were in /r/anime's favorite anime list from a year ago, plus one flavor-of-the-month, so I'm not sure there's anything interesting to say.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'd hope they'd be on /r/anime's favorites list, or else I'd have done a poor job of selecting anime. That's kind of the whole point of the tournament. It'd be a little strange to choose unpopular anime...

Well, then I miss the point of people fawning over the same shows over and over again.

Okay, next round, here we go.

Also, holy titty, Monogatari was able to pull through and defeat Cowboy Bebop. What a display. I'm glad my favorite show won out, but I definitely understand and sympathize with those who are currently drowning in sorrow. It was a shame to see Bebop go, especially **before fucking No Game No Life**.

**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Angel Beats!, beloved as it is by many, including myself, has much more criticism and hate tethered to it than the majority of the rest of the giants here. I think it's safe to say it's going to taste FMA's big ol' boots right here.

**2.** Champloo and Psycho-Pass. Two mature, well-done, and original shows going neck and neck. While Champloo has had a consistent following ever since it aired, Psycho-Pass is much more fresh in everyone's mind, and having Urobuchi's name attached to it and a second season incoming very soon isn't going to act against it, now, isn't it? Although, hell, Champloo can still pull through this, with its appeal and Watanabe and all. This is a match to watch.

**3.** Two well-done and intelligent shows again here, although I think Steins;Gate has ^(sadly, IMO) a good advantage in popularity, at least here in /r/anime. Not to mention, there's just plain much more available material that pertains to Steins;Gate than there is to Baccano!; more fan-art, more memes, more discussion. Steins;Gate might be the one to take Baccano! out, and I'll be ready to catch my friend as he hits the ground if it comes to that.

**4.** If NGNL beat Madoka, it's going to bring a good, hard challenge to Clannad here. Well, Clannad definitely has a lot of criticism dragging it down, that first season really is a thorn in its side. But I think a lot of people still agree that it's a good show. However, considering the majority of people believe Madoka was a *great* show, I don't know exactly how this all spells out for Clannad. But, shit, NGNL didn't deserve to make it remotely this far. I'm rooting for you, Clannad. Tear shit up.

**5.** Two modern classics here, in terms of popularity. Geass probably has a bit of an edge in the popularity field and the critical acclaim, while Suzumiya is going to hold strong to its dedicated, devoted fanbase. This is going to be a good match, I'm standing to fight for based Haruhi-sama as always, let's see how it all goes.

**6.** Fate/Zero and Gurren Lagann. The King of Kings ^^heh of high-budget action, dark themes, and drama, versus the King of Kings of mecha, adventure, motivation, and campy/fun-loving style. This might be the fairest and most fearsome conflict yet for us to spectate. I'm voting for Fate/Zero myself, but I wouldn't have really minded voting for Lagann. Shivering with anticipation.

**7.** Here we have THE gateway anime versus THE romantic comedy. The fangirls versus the tsundere-lovers. Death Note is going to summon its fearsome and humongous host as always, and Toradora! has its dedicated and loving fans ready to rush to its aid. As for myself, I'm doing my part to defend Toradora! against the Death Note onslaught, and I hope we can hold out. There's gonna be a fight, but I'm remaining faithful.

**8.** I'm applauding you, Monogatari. You exceeded my expectations, and I'm sure the expectations of many others, you sexy little thing. And AnoHana baby, I love you, but if Bebop kicked the bucket, you'd ought to start digging your grave now. I'm sorry, I truly am, you're still one of the best. Ganbatte, Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
>  Here we have THE gateway anime versus THE romantic comedy

I always thought FMA: Brotherhood was THE gateway anime.

>> ARTICLE
FMA Brotherhood is one of the top ones but Death Note is literally the most popular show show on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but Brotherhood is the highest rated one.
>> ARTICLE
Fear not fellow Madoka fans, it looks we have spot #17 secured.

:(
>> ARTICLE
So my prediction for the final is FMA vs. Code Geass, and I think FMA will win the whole thing though Code Geass should put up a decent fight. As popular as Steins;Gate is, I don't think it can take down down FMA and the matches on the other side are too close for me to think that they'll beat Code Geass (well Monogatari isn't close but I think it's too niche to win against Code Geass).
>> ARTICLE
Out of all the shows in the tournament everything I like has either already lost or is guaranteed going to lose.  

[All is lost](http://i.imgur.com/albpYVX.jpg)  

I was able to predict pretty much every result so far except for NGNL vs Madoka, I thought for sure Madoka would win, like there was absolutely no way for it to lose. I was wrong... so wrong...
>> ARTICLE
Madoka and NGE losing definitely was unexpected
>> ARTICLE
Match 1: I see a lot of love going around for Angel Beats!, but there's no way I can see it beating FMA:B who some would argue is objectively the greatest anime of all time.

Match 2: Personally I'm voting for Psycho Pass. It'll be close but seeing as it's popularity is on the upswing with the upcoming second season and a current re-airing it should win out.

Match 3: I absolutely adore Baccano! and everything about it so I'll do my part to try and push it further, but sadly it doesn't quite have the same following as Steins;Gate so it looks as though this is most likely the end.

Match 4: I liked NLGL fine but it really has no bussiness coming this far simply because it was hyped so hard. If Clannad doesn't take it down Steins;Gate most certainly will.

Match 5: Code Geass is a gateway anime for many people, including myself, and one of my personal favorites. Haruhi should put up a good fight but I think Geass has it.

Match 6: Easily the closest match out of all of them. I personally will be voting for Fate/Zero, but I predict that the manly passion of TTGL will come out on top.

Match 7: Another super popular gateway anime versus everybody's favorite RomCom. This one will be close as well but I think Toradora! is too beloved to lose.

Match 8: Seeing as how the Monogatari Series beat out Cowboy Bebop, one of the great anime classics, AnoHana doesn't really stand a chance.

Excited to see who is going to take the whole thing, personally my bets are on FMA. 

On a side note I'm still depressed Gintama didn't even crack the top 32.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder... should you vote in any of these matches if you haven't seen both shows? I know there's a "I haven't seen either" choice, but what if you've only seen one? Because in many cases I think this kind of turns into a "which show has been viewed by the most people" competition, which isn't particularly interesting.
>> ARTICLE
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CLANNAD!!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm out. I predict FMA wins, but honestly, I feel like NGNL has a could also have chance, which pisses me off. Stop voting for the hype guys, it'll piss me off if the flavor of the month takes this. This was more fitting yesterday, but allow me to dig up what I had to say about NGNL on a rage thread a few weeks ago. 

>NGNL IS NOT THE GREATEST ANIME EVER CREATED. YOU ALL NEED TO GET YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR ASSES. ITS FUN, THATS IT GOD DAMN IT.

>YOU'RE ALL PUTTING IT IN YOUR FAVORITES LISTS NOW, GO BACK TO THE SHOW IN TWO MONTHS WHEN THE HYPE IS GONE. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE SHOW IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE ANIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO CLING TO FOR SOME STUPID FUCKING REASON.

>REMEMBER SAO, TITAN, KILL LA KILL? ACCORDING TO THE SAME DUMB ASSES THAT ARE PARADING NGNL AROUND LIKE IT'S THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, ALL THREE OF THOSE SHOWS WERE, AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, THE BEST ANIME EVER. IT'S A FUCKING PATTERN, STOP GETTING SUCKED INTO THE HYPE.

>TLDR--- FUCK HYPE.

Angry and vulgar, but still my exact feelings. Stop voting for it.
>> ARTICLE
Different people have different opinions. Deal with it
>> ARTICLE
>Stop voting for it.

No.
>> ARTICLE
I just wonder why the NGNL supporters are so silent. Negative post after negative post pile up in these topics, but never anyone defending it. Yet it keeps on winning. Hey, silent majority! Get in here and tell RandomMan why he's full of shit. Arguing is part of the fun of these type of topics after all. 

So why do you guys love NGNL so much?
>> ARTICLE
NGNL was a lot of fun.  It is really silly and free spirited.  The art is very pretty.  The fanservice makes fun of fanservice, which appeals to people who like fanservice and people who hate fanservice (to me the fanservice is satirical parody of other shows).  It is an ongoing show so it doesn't have an ending for people to dislike.

Of all the anime I have seen so far in 2014 my single favorite episode of anything has been NGNL episode #6 - it is hilarious.

I wouldn't go so far as to say NGNL is the greatest anime of all time (I'll give that one to Ghost in the Shell (movie) or my personal favorite (Madoka), but I enjoyed it more than many of the other shows in this contest.
>> ARTICLE
Next you're going to tell me it's a deconstruction of the ecchi genre... >_> 

I'll give you that it's fun and pretty, but I don't buy that it's trying to parody fan service with its non-stop panty shot parade. Instead, it's fully embracing the genre. They know that boobs sell, and they ain't shy about shouting it out to the world.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't people say the same thing about KLK?
>> ARTICLE
I always held that No Game No Life was good because it didn't take itself too serious. It never really tried to be more than what it is, an action ecchi show, and that gave it all the more strength. 

But honestly to say it's anywhere near Madoka Magica, or even a 10 is a little crazy. I wouldn't be surprised to see this show get hit by some level of backlash latter on. Maybe not SAO levels, but some level. It just isn't top 50 of all time.
>> ARTICLE
NGNL is far, far above Madoka, though I agree it's not quite a 10. You know, not everyone is a fan of Madoka. Saying they're crazy for thinking NGNL is better than it is stupid.
>> ARTICLE
eh.

I mean sure, not everyone likes the same things. It's just that, in my opinion, a show that needs to throw a bunch of unnecessary nudes and fan service to keep you entertained is automatically worse than a show that doesn't do that.
>> ARTICLE
My opinion differs in that I don't think NGNL "needed" to have fanservice to be entertaining. In fact, I know I personally would've still been entertained  without the fanservice because I don't really like fanservice all that much. However, the fanservice in NGNL was, I thought, done tastefully and wasn't distracting and annoying like it certainly can be. I either found it hilarious or didn't really notice it.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not the fan service was needed in the show to be entertaining doesn't matter, even though in the this case I agree it would have been fine or even better without it. The problem is the show thought it needed it and used it heavily. It used those kind of cheap tactics in hopes to stay relevant, and whether or not it really needed them, doesn't change the fact they were used.

As for the way the fan service was done, well.....subtle isn't the word I would use. The bit in episode 6 was a fantastically done joke and was fine, but to list of some of the other problems

* Loliservice
* Like 5 bath scenes
* Tentacle shampoo? (seriously what the hell)
* A whole shit ton of stuff during the finale
* Magically grown boobs
* The first shot of shiro being her panties.

I could also include steph in general but my problems with her and the way the show treats her are way more than just fanservice. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it subtle either. It wasn't. However, even so I didn't find it distracting or all in-my-face about it. I'll try to explain. Like the stuff with Shiro, for example, I didn't really pay much attention to it. Because, well, she's 11. It'd be like if in real life I saw an 11 year old in their underwear; I wouldn't care at all. It doesn't even register on a sexual scale, so it almost doesn't even come off as fanservice. Or the bath scenes. My attention was being held by the conversations and the funny actions so I wasn't really thinking about the naked bodies. Or Kurumi's boobs. Given her personality, I totally wasn't surprised she'd try something like that. I thought it was funny. 

I know it wasn't all perfect though. Some of it absolutely could've been toned down, but still it really didn't detract from the show enough for me to be bothered by it. 

However, ignoring all that, the main problem you have is that the show did it in the first place. I see why you think that's a problem since it's basically just pandering bullshit, but ultimately if I'm not bothered by something then I just don't care about the why or the necessity of it. I can definitely see why people would have problems with it, but I don't. Some people are against any and all fanservice, but it's not like that for me. The only reason I'm not fond of it is because I've seen so much of it that I just grew tired of it. So, if I think it's done fairly well, I can easily be swayed into not minding it.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call NGNL fanservice tasteful to be honest. They went straight for the ass of a eleven year old when they had the chance and most of it was pushed straigh into your face. It didn't have the tiniest bit of subtlety, just always wanted to show *more* and impress you. In my book thats not tasteful, its obnoxious and distracting.
>> ARTICLE
[Sorry but I had to check to make sure...](/s "According to your MAL, you have never actually seen Madoka Magica")  

Also NGNL is average at best, your opinion is shit m8 :^)
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, my opinion is definitely biased since it's only based on what I've heard and I haven't given Madoka a fair chance. But I don't plan on ever giving it a chance either. I'm not a fan of magical girl anime and that doesn't automatically mean I'm a fan of "Look at me! At first glance I'm your typical magical girl anime but in actuality I'm dark and edgy" either. I'm not a fan of the genre it deconstructs nor am I a fan of grim and dark shows, so it just doesn't have anything for me. I'm not gonna try to argue that my opinion isn't shit but that's just how it is.
>> ARTICLE
AHAHAHAHAH you fucking admitted it too, you haven't even seen the show yet you claim NGNL is "far, far above".  

You are literally cancer, please delete your account

Don't need to see something to have an opinion on it. God knows its talked about enough to know what it's about. Oh, and you're a dick.

This is actually the first round i voted for No Game, but only because I had Clannad shoved down my throat by some of my friends and it was made a pretty bad experience.
>> ARTICLE
I've voted for NGNL every time so far, not because I think it's an amazing show, I just enjoyed it more than anything it's been up against so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering it's up against Clannad/Afterstory, and I considered most of Clannad (excluding Afterstory) to be sub-par, it's actually my choice this round. That being said, it beat Madoka, so wtf.
>> ARTICLE
Many more people read the subreddit than post on it. That's the actual explanation.

Most people also know the simple truth - they enjoy what they do, and "defending" one's enjoyment is as silly as demanding one do so. They're unlikely to get you to enjoy it more, and they'll enjoy the whole thing less, so why bother?

The conspiracy explanation is people vote for it just to troll people into pointing out how it's not a good show ;)

If only others had the same affinity for wasting time discussing pervy Chinese cartoons with the use of intense rhetoric that we do :c

>> ARTICLE
Well I agree that there reallyis no point in trying to convince other why you like a certain thing but I feel like ngnl gets a lot of hate so ill do it anyways. 

It really just boils down to the fact that I had a great time watching it. is it a critical masterpiece? Not at all. Objectively is it superior to madoka when it comes down to every little nuance of what makes an award-winning show? Lol, hell no. But did I find itmore enjoyable to watch? Yes, which is why I voted for it. 

In a lot of the ping pong discussion threads people were trashing on ngnl because people were calling it anime of the spring season while pingpong is the better show, from a critical standpoint.  And I agree that it was but it doesnt change the fact that it was ngnl that made me upset that I had to wait a week for the next episode, not so much with pingpong.

And its not like ngnl is the transformers of anime. It isnt some worthless show that is only good because fanservice. Just because it has a lot of hype behind it doesnt make it a bad show. Just like how I voted for it over madoka doesnt mean I have shit taste. 

I loved the premise, I loved the absurdity of the games, I loved how creative it got with its fanservice (super heakthy space op), loved the comedy and I really loved the  characters. I mean steph may be a useless character but damn if I dont find ithilarious, and i really love telling my friends how much of a steph they are. Sora and shiro are both ridiculously op (much like a certain character from a certain vrmmorpg anime that people love to hate) but I like that blank never loses. The way they analyze and manipulate ttheir oponnents and the games is awesome.

I really enjoyed watching ngnl, and this contest only asked you one thing, "which was your favorite?" Obviously the hype, and the fact that its still fresh in our minds, probably gave a different result than if this was done 6 months from now. But I know that I wouldnt have voted differently because I genuinely found ngnl to be better than madoka. It may be the unpopular opinion but it doesnt make ngnl worse than madoka, it just means people have different opinions. 
>> ARTICLE
Great response. Personally, I watch anime when I'm stuck at home, bored, looking for something to do. I'm not ashamed to admit that I vote for No Game No Life because it served its purpose: it kept me fucking entertained. It brought a smile to my face, week after week, as Sora and Shiro continued their crazy antics.

Unlike Code Geass, No Game No Life never caused me to contemplate moral or philosophical issues... but it positively impacted my life. Often, I get wrapped up in my own drama: my friend said this, I screwed up by doing that, I don't know how the future will turn out. I'm sure I'm not alone. But No Game No Life reminded me that life should be fun, and that I have the power to make the best out of my situation.

Many people cite episode 6 (the Materialization Shiritori) as one of their favorite episodes, yet I've seen a lot of comments which poke holes in the anime logic. When I first watched it, I didn't really care about that. I was just grinning from ear to ear because damn, did he just break physics?! Later, when I gave it some more thought, I realized that the game's logic did make sense. And then I realized that even if it hadn't made sense, I would have still been amused. I think that's awesome!

To all the haters of No Game No Life: I'm sorry if No Game No Life beat out your favorite anime and disappointed you; I felt the same way when FLCL lost so quickly. Still, I wish you would keep your hate to yourself and not ruin others' enjoyment too. :)

If you want the \^_^ smiley then write:

"\" cancels the effect of the styling of what you type after.

Also, it's usually not worth it, in terms of fun. Most people who do so do so not because it's fun, but because they can't help it.

Thank you. \^_^

Damn. While I saw it coming, Evangelion losing against one of my most hated shows is frustrating. Now I know how people felt about Madoka yesterday.

>Full Metal Alchemist/FMA: Brotherhood vs Angel Beats!

There is no way that Angel Beats! is winning this one.

>Samurai Champloo vs Psycho-Pass

Psycho-Pass has this one.

>Steins;Gate vs Baccano!

Steins;Gate will win this round.

>No Game No Life vs Clannad/Clannad: After Story

Regardless of how much people like Clannad,  I think people will be voting against No Game No Life out of spite but anything can happen.

>Code Geass vs The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya

I think Code Geass will win.

>Fate/Zero vs Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

As much as I dislike TTGL, It will most likely beat Fate/Zero.

>Death Note vs Toradora!

Ah, Toradora! Another series that I dislike but will probably beat Death Note. But who knows, I was wrong about yesterday's result so I could be wrong here.

>AnoHana vs Monogatari Series

I hate to say it but Monogatari will beat AnoHana.

You said you disliked like half the shows.  
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say half but I do dislike a good amount of these shows.
>> ARTICLE
I just found this tournament today, but judging from the Day 6 results, I think that I hate you all already.  Or at least whoever keeps voting for NGNL.
>> ARTICLE
I hardly think NGNL vs Madoka was a popularity contest at all. Madoka is #34 in popularity while NGNL is still over #100, but for average ratings it's vice-versa. NGNL won because it was voted by the same people who gave it a higher average score than Madoka. 

So now that it's No Game No Life vs. Clannad, I'm afraid NGNL's number is finally up. After Story is the second highest ranked show in existence, and NGNL just doesn't come close.
>> ARTICLE
When you talk about popularity you have to realize it is trending (current) popularity.

The popularity list on MAL is irrelevant.  It doesn't take into account that 1 person rating madoka 2 years ago translates to much less popularity than 1 person rating NGNL 2 days ago.  It doesn't account for popularity decay at all.
>> ARTICLE
Can you organize this better. Like can you make 1 post with all the days and all the results? Or at least include previous days posts in the next days one. The full bracket is bad because it doesn't show the total votes.

Shit. So many close matches, this is definitely getting more and more intense as it moves closer to the finals.

the fact that Bakuman wasn't in this disappoints me.
>> ARTICLE
I would argue that the adaption of Bakuman wasn't as good as the manga.

Same reason I voted against Death Note in one of the rounds, the manga is just the better version when you compare the two.
>> ARTICLE
My first time seeing this Tournament- and holy shit am I surprised.

---

* A little sad to see Durarara go under but it barely has a fan base behind it compared to the fucking monster that is Angel Beats

* My poor baby "Welcome to The NHK" it doesn't matter how great you were, against FMA? You didn't stand a chance

* Happy to see the AOT dying down a bit, a friend of mine enjoyed Psycho-Pass so I'll have to give that a shot


* Honestly, I hope Steins ; Gate at least gets to battle FMA. I know it's overhyped as all hell- but I really do think it's that good. Of course I don't even need to say a thing about FMA, it's more than well deserving of its place atop an anime tournament 

* Really surprised to see Baccano! make it this far, which is great because that show is all kinds of awesome

* WowNGNL vs Madoka and NGNL wonwhat in the hell? Did I watch the wrong anime guys? 

* xD Who's fucking idea was it to put Elfen Lied against Madoka? To say it's a landslide is one hell of an understatement

* Clannad's the best in that section IMO

* I'll try not to write too much more. Code Geass is well-deserving of its place, TTGL is not a surprise- it's great. Sad to see so little love for FLCL (My favorite of all time). NGE stays exactly where it has been the past 20 years with its fan base , "meh". Some people love it and some hate it. I fall in the middle as well. Death Note, like someone said, deserves a hell of a lot of credit for being the ultimate gateway anime against the powerhouse of all romance animes. Anohana is a bit surprising to see surpass Hellsing but I think there's a bigger fan base on r/anime.

* Did Cowboy Bebopjust lose against Bakemontogatari? By 100 votes?! Don't get me wrong guys, shows damn good. But to deny not only the near flawless masterpiece of Bebop AND it's impact on anime? C'mon guys, I thought you were better than this. I'm not madjust disappointed 




 
>> ARTICLE
>WowNGNL vs Madoka and NGNL wonwhat in the hell? Did I watch the wrong anime guys?

>Clannad's the best in that section IMO

As you'll notice, NGNL is currently winning that battle as well. I mean sure, *I* think it's better than Madoka and Clannad but doing this against those two powerhouses is just crazy. That hype man...

I'm sure it won't stand a chance against Steins;Gate though. Or at least if it gets through this round I hope it's stopped there. Hype should only take you so far.

Gintama lost to Naruto? Hmm, interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand how that happened. Naruto is now sitting there comfortably in last place of the 17-32nd placement match and I would've thought the weekly Gintama discussions was increasing people's awareness of Gintama. Naruto's not super terrible or anything but just... How?

Yea I mean I enjoy Naruto to an extent and all as it was one of the shows that got me serious into anime...but come on Gintama has it all. To each their own though.

Indeed.

Madoka and AoT are dominating the placement poll. I voted for Bebop, Mushishi, From the New World, and... K-On! Poor K-On, sitting near the bottom. At least it's faring better than Naruto. I thought Naruto would at least be more popular than Yu Yu Hakusho.
>> ARTICLE
sorry but in what universe is stylized otaku pandering better than bebop? ugh this subreddit sometimes...
>> ARTICLE
how the hell is hellsing and yu yu hakusho doing so poorly?  I guess I can't say anything since I haven't watched baccano yet...  but man!  Also, the seeding for kokoro connect was terrible!  Man i loved that anime...  I could see so many anime making it waaay further with better seeds, like raildex, and kenshin.  OH well, this tourney is insane! thanks for doing this!
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame the likes of Hellsing and YYH are doing so badly, but having recently seen Baccano!, it really is something else. You'd do yourself a favor to watch it. 

And sadly I've seen mostly bad things about Kokoro Connect, despite thinking it was above-average as far as slice-of-life dramatic shows go. I know there was some scandal to it at the time it was airing (not really sure what the deal was, exactly) that might have hurt the way some people saw it, but how it goes largely unnoticed while Clannad and AnoHana receive mass attention is beyond me.
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea kokoro had some sort of scandal, but luckily, i give no fucks about the outside worlds going ons when watching the show.  I think the show itself was a small masterpiece and I can easily put it on par with the likes of Angel Beats in terms of length and what they got done.  (I might even say I enjoyed kokoro even more).

I will watch baccano after I get through the gatari series then.  That series put me off years ago, but I tried it again and I can stomache it now.  It may even become a favorite :P

Hellsing...  My did i love that.
>> ARTICLE
I believe the scandal was about a prank they pulled on an aspiring voice actor if I remember correctly. They pretended that he landed some type of major role in the project, but then they made him the coffee boy or gave him like 1 line or something.

And Kokoro Connect was god-awful after the first arc.
>> ARTICLE
>Kokoro Connect was god-awful after the first arc.

Heeey, while I admit the show definitely dropped off the deep end a bit for a while after the introductory arc, it definitely picked up in the end and Michi Random turned it into one of my favorites. But it's cool, friendo, I respect your opinion.

And, here, /u/racheuphist, is a nice document that explains the whole [Kokoro Connect scandal](http://pastebin.com/EvntSeCV).
>> ARTICLE
thanks!  I agree, kokoro connect stayed a strong anime for me because it started strong and ended strong.  I even enjoyed the middle, it's not like it was terrible ever for me.

That prank sounds terrible, but that still doesn't effect my thoughts on the show, just the director person.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone really needs to tell their friends who like Clannad to come and vote. While I loved NGNL it had no business getting this far and has no business going any further. At least Steins;Gate will take it down if all else fails though.
>> ARTICLE
No chance. NGNL is simply a superior anime.
>> ARTICLE
Come on man I just checked your MAL and you haven't even seen Clannad at all. I can understand if you liked NGNL but at least watch Clannad and AS before going around calling NGNL better.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, i plan to. But i was talking about NGNL taking down Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh haha alright I misread that.
>> ARTICLE
NP, when i wrote that i assumed NGNL already won since there was only an hour left and it had a nice lead on clannad.
>> ARTICLE
Voting ending in about an hour.
>> ARTICLE
First match I see going to FMA pretty easily. Second match could be closer, but I'm pretty confident in Samurai Champloo. Third match should be really close. I'm giving it to Steins;Gate by 5%. And then we come to NGNL again. I've been betting against it every round, and I should know better by now, but I still think Clannad wins this one. Code Geass should have a fairly convincing win as well as Gurren Lagann most likely. Death Note will slay Toradora!. And finally, if Monogatari was able to beat Bebop, there's no way it's losing to AnoHana.
>> ARTICLE
You are underestimating Steins;Gate.

I'm pretty sure it will win the entire tournament. Also, underestimating Toradora and Psycho Pass, they should surprise you. Psycho Pass will win, and Toradora will put up a good fight, will be a really close one.
>> ARTICLE
So NGE lost to TTGL. I guess it didn't have enough tits.

>> ARTICLE
Because NGE is completely and utterly devoid of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Fan service has little to do with it I think. NGE's plot completely breaks down in the last third of the show. For a show that is supposed to exemplify story and characters that's kind of a death blow.

TTGL never pretends it is too worried about those things, it is all about the experience and the spectacle, and with the exception of episode four it manages to deliver on that again and again while raising its scope each time.

I don't pretend that Gurren Lagann is objectively the best show in the competition, but in terms of fun and enjoyment I think it is.
>> ARTICLE
That penguin shower scene doesn't count.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, NGE has tits. It just didn't have enough drills piercing the heavens.
>> ARTICLE
It did have a earth sized woman having her forehead vulva pierced by a crucified robot... What more do you want??
>> ARTICLE
I don't know man. I wanted NGE to win but, sadly, that didn't happen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad about NGE but at least quality is being recognized in the case of NGNL. I see it rigthfully defeating Steins Gate and FMA and going to the finals.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked bakemonogatari but seriously in no way should it have won against bebop... seriously that's kind of sad to see. I get some shows are pretty overrated in r/anime, (overrated might not be the word so much as grossly over represented), but there are a bunch of shows that shouldn't have won their previous bracket such because they are hyped up on anime reddit, (such as no game no life beating madoka!? seriously its like a liar game that focuses too much on fanservice and not enough on the game. Clannad beating from the new world? ummm ok. I liked clannad but from the new world was written better and just a better quality show. Gurren Lagann... I guess I saw this coming. Probably the most over hyped show on this subreddit. Also AnoHana was sad but really it probably shouldnt have beaten Hellsing. 
>> ARTICLE
Argh, NGNL vs Clannad. 

A deviant otaku fetishe vs forced emotional gut punches coupled with silly melodrama, guess which one I voted....
>> ARTICLE
It's okay, dude. You can admit that you voted for Clannad. No one will think poorly of you at all.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone who is annoyed that NGNL beat Madoka:

Even if you dislike Clannad, vote for it. End the NGNL hype train now, before it stomps other quality anime.
>> ARTICLE
What's up with these people. So mad that an anime they dislike wins over others. If people think NGNL is good, they vote for it, if you dont, you vote for another, it's this simple. 
What you're trying to make others do now ist just stupid, sorry.

So then Death Note is objectively bad then too right? Towards then ending of Death Note it was just "I know that you know that I knew that you were thinking that I may have thought...." pretty much predicting what each other would do and where they hid the Notebook. Plus I can only think of one fight in NGNL that deals with taking predicting each other to the next level.

I don't often get hooked by dramatic anime, not by the first episode anyway.

Well they're not #1 seeds for nothing.

I mostly agree on FMA: B and Steins;Gate, but I think Code Geass and Death Note have some tough matches upcoming.
>> ARTICLE
I think Gurren Lagann or Bebop make it out of the left hand bracket, leaning closer to Gurren Lagann.

Champloo or Full Metal Alchemist is what I would guess on the left hand side. I think No Game No Life will draw enough ire for taking down Madoka that it doesn't make it to the finals.
>> ARTICLE
My goodness, the Psycho-Pass to AoT voting and even the NGNL to Madoka were very, very close.

Remember, upvote the thread.
>> ARTICLE
Match 1: Code Geass by a lot. I think Hunter will get similar numbers to Ping Pong

Match 2:  As much as /r/anime likes cute, I don't think K-On is moving to round 3. Melancholy by a good margin

Match 3: Well Fate/Zero beat SAO, but One Piece has been building a fan base for years. I still think Fate/Zero will win.

Match 4: I haven't actually seen Lagann, but this subreddit is in love with it, and NGE barely made it out of its last match. I'm going with Lagann.

Match 5: Death Note by landslide

Match 6: I'm really hoping Mushishi wins this, but Toradora! is like *the* romantic comedy everyone recommends whenever the topic comes up. Toradora by at least 10%

Match 7: AnoHana won't be beat by some vampires...

Match 8: Bebop's going all the way to the finals. I don't care who they face.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Monogatari is beating Bebop and I'm pretty happy about that.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana is manipulative as all hell, but it's still well made, and people love it for that.

Hellsing, on the other hand is just good, ridiculous fun.  It's enjoyable, but at a very different level.  I doubt it really stands a chance.
>> ARTICLE
> As much as /r/anime likes cute

/r/awwnime, perhaps, but not really /r/anime. Moe seems to be pretty controversial here. Some people like it, other people see it as some sort of maniacal cross between the boogeyman of the anime industry and the heat death of the universe.

Ah, I'm glad I'm not the only one that hopes that Mushishi will win..

Bebop's actually losing at the time I'm posting this. I'm surprised...
>> ARTICLE
Psycho-Pass won by a single point. I am so happy. My bracket is not.
>> ARTICLE
At this point, I can't see much chance of No Game No Life not taking the whole series. If anyone was going to challenge its reign, it would be Madoka - not enough /r/anime users have seen Eva or whatnot for anything else to really put up a fight. I'm putting my money on "the newest show I loved is the best show ever."
>> ARTICLE
At least for me, much of the appeal of NGNL is the "feel" that it gives that's so much like Code Geass, and CG is objectively much better.
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't faced any of the 1 seeds yet. You really think Madoka would be a bigger challenge than FMA or Steins;Gate? No way. NGNL still has far to go.

I'm certain Madoka was a bigger hit than Steins;Gate. Probably less controversial, though you have a point with FMA and its potential staying power.

I think Steins;Gate is more engaging to most people than Madoka is and that's why it will tear down the NGNL terror reign!

The fact that NGNL beat Madoka is a bit ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed NGNL, but there's no way that it is better than Madoka. The hype is real. Also, I kinda hate you for forcing me to pick between Death Note and Pet Girl of Sakurasou. Death Note is going to win simply because it's more popular which I think decided the outcome of a lot of these shows, good shows lost just because they are underwatched and underhyped.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I enjoyed Madoka quite a bit, but I don't think it's that ridiculous that NGNL won out. NGNL and Madoka are so different from one another that one's preference for one genre over another factors in a lot. It would be like comparing Arrested Development to Game of Thrones. It's incredibly difficult to say one is "better" than the other. I do agree that this competition is basically a popularity contest though.
>> ARTICLE
Erm, personally, I preferred NGNL much over Madoka Magica. All in preference.
>> ARTICLE
I'm boycotting the rest of the tournament over the Madoka loss...and my absence will be very much noticed and will greatly sadden the /r/anime community. =P

Speaking seriously though, I think of this tournament as a popularity contest not unlike a prom king/queen vote in High School(btw is that still a big deal? It's been a decade since I was in High School :/). Usually it won't be the best person that wins the contest, but the most well-known and generally liked. [Please remember the golden rule](http://i.imgur.com/tSPcaXQ.gif)...this is just a simple vote by a group of people on the internet you don't even know. It's outcome does not and should not effect how you view your favorite anime. 

That said, if Monogatari, Bebop, or NGE doesn't win [I'm gonna lose my shit!](http://i.imgur.com/DzfSDtx.gif). =P
>> ARTICLE
It really seems to me that the golden rule that people on the Internet forget all the friggin' time is "Enjoyment (or Popularity) =/= Quality". 

I wonder whether that's because people lack critical thinking or because they aren't willing to accept that they like something that's flawed.

Yes, I'm disappointed that Madoka lost. The only way I can deal with this loss is to eat icecream while watching rebellion and try not to taste my own tears.
>> ARTICLE
I hardly think it's a popularity contest at all. Madoka is #34 in popularity while NGNL is still over #100. NGNL won because it was voted by the same people who gave it a higher average rating than Madoka. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering Monogatari and Bebop are up against each other already and NGE is losing against TTGL it looks rather grim

As this tournament goes on there's less and less anime I give any shits about. ^My ^favorite ^was ^never ^nominated...

Blame the downvoters. The first two topics (nominations and day 1 voting) were downvoted into oblivion. I only got like 30 or 40 nominations.

True story.  I spent an (potentially) unhealthy amount of time on reddit.  I never saw the first two posts.

I'd recommend contacting the mods in the future (and/or starting a post on /r/MetaAnime).  There's free space in the header, and getting it stuck there might help a lot.

Yeah, I've always hated how downvote-happy this subreddit seems to be. Going on the second or third pages, I always get really sad for the clueless and innocent people asking questions or attempting to clarify information or sharing some fanart (although fanart's been getting more and more accepted, it seems) and then getting furiously downvoted for it. Some people just feel the need to be mean to others, I guess.

I mean, we're anime fans, after all. We're definitely used to a lot of people who identify with us or share our interests actually being annoying, embarrassing pieces of shit.
>> ARTICLE
> I always get really sad for the clueless and innocent people asking questions or attempting to clarify information or sharing some fanart (although fanart's been getting more and more accepted, it seems) and then getting furiously downvoted for it.

To be fair though, those people that ask questions/seek clarification are usually answered pretty quickly, making it unnecessary for their thread to be upvoted to the front page. Many users that frequent /r/anime(myself included) see that a question has been answered and then downvote the thread to make room for threads that are more new/relevant/interesting. Now the fanart's a whole another story. It's a big ole mixed bag that varies by post in both quality and how it's received by /r/anime.

Well, gee, I never thought of it that way. That makes sense. But still, I mean, downvoting people might make then get the wrong idea, wouldn't just leaving the post neutral be enough to keep it down and away?

Bro, I don't even know. Just go with it.

>downvoting people might make then get the wrong idea

Perhaps a bit...but I'd think if they're looking to get something answered, getting the actual answer is of far more importance to the person than the upvotes/downvotes on a self-post(which don't contribute to your link karma, just in case you didn't know).

>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I'm not asking people to vote for the most artistic anime or the best written anime or even the plain best anime. Just whatever anime they happen to like better. I know I voted against objectively better anime a few times just because I like its opponent better for whatever reason. I for one really didn't like NGNL, but I can see why people might.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I was expecting to see something like FMA or Cowboy Bebop win, which is completely fine and understandable, even if I prefer things like NHK or Lain. I'm just really worried that NGNL is actually going to win, which would be terrible. Sure, it can be enjoyable, but at its core it is not a great anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Just out of curiosity, what would you consider to be a great anime? Of the 5 anime you listed (FMA, bebop, NHK, Lain, NGNL), I would personally rank NGNL 2nd after Cowboy Bebop and FMA last (imo, it's a generic shounen with just a bit of maturity sprinkled in). I usually dislike the harem genre, but it's been years since a comedy anime has made me laugh as much as NGNL has, so it's possible that I'm being a bit generous towards it

EDIT: downvotes for having a discussion, awesome.
>> ARTICLE
The characters are shallow and uninteresting and the plot is shallow and uninteresting. I don't find ecchi humor the least bit funny. Maybe I would understand it if I did. Have you even seen Welcome to the NHK? It provides a realistic depiction of a NEET in Satou, who I can say without a doubt is a much better character than Sora. I don't find ecchi humor the least bit funny, so the jokes of NHK were much better for me at least. Even the "fanservice" was done well in NHK. They depicted Satou's sexual fantasies, and then showed the guilt that stemmed from them, rather than throwing breasts in your face. I really just don't think the fanservice of NGNL is in any way appropriate for this kind of thing. If I wanted to see tits that badly I'd just go watch a hentai. 
>> ARTICLE
I have seen NHK and did enjoy it. I liked its believable characters and story and I was really impressed by how it had a realistic conclusion. It was one of the first anime I watched that didn't drown in the usual anime cliches so I do have a soft spot for it as well. 

If echi humor doesn't amuse you, I can see why NGNL was uninteresting for you. I usually dislike echi humor too, but I view NGNL as an affectionate parody of the echi/harem genre and it pushed the echi'ness to ridiculous extremes (The "censorship" in the word game with Jibril was the best implementation of echi humor I've seen in an anime). 

I'm not arguing that NGNL had an amazing deep plot or characters, but it was ridiculously fun to watch for me and many others. Much of the reason I enjoyed NGNL was due to its non-serious nature so I don't necessarily view its shallowness as a bad thing. A more serious and grounded plot would have ruined the atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
I have a hard time calling something a parody when it becomes the perfect example of what it is trying to ridicule.
>> ARTICLE
It's not exactly uncommon. A whole bunch of shows on [this list (tv tropes  warning)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AffectionateParody/AnimeAndManga) do exactly that. If you want to talk about why NGNL specifically would count as a parody, the word game with Jibril scene I mentioned beforehand satirizes the censorship methods echi anime use. The werebeast arc in particular was full of self aware parodying of multiple echi genres.
>> ARTICLE
> The werebeast arc in particular was full of self aware parodying of multiple echi genres.

It's not parody, it's more of the same.

Self-referential / Self-aware != parody.
>> ARTICLE
I fail to see the logic where giving you a worse version of something makes it better somehow. Like I said before, if I wanted this sort of thing that badly I would just go watch a hentai.  
>> ARTICLE
How is it exactly a worse version though? Just because you keep saying it's so doesn't make it so. Pretty much all of the fanservice in NGNL is a self aware parody of echi in anime, made more obvious by the ridiculous extremes it takes the fanservice to.

Examples:

1. The word game I keep mentioning. I don't see how that is a worse version of anything. If anything, it's the best version of satirizing arbitrary censorship of breast and genitalia.

2. Sora wants to take pictures of the girls bathing, but Shiro is genre savvy enough to take the the camera and take a picture of her arms strategically placed to look like boobs

3. Jibril's shampoo bottle. Obvious parody of tentacle hentai.

NGNL is definitely a parody of echi anime. It does exactly what a parody is supposed to do. It takes common ideas and cliches from the source genre and pushes them to ridiculous extremes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see NGNL winning, but if it does I'm going to feel really bad for all of the excellent shows that lost (Lain, NHK, Bebop, FMA and alike) for a kind of fun fanservice-y mess to win.

Well, so much for Sakurasou surviving Higurashi. Now it's getting the brutal ol' Death Note execution.

Ah, well, we had a good run, Sakurasou. You lasted longer than we all thought you were going to. Pat yourself on the back.

And good Christ, Madoka losing to something like No Game No Life is the last thing I'd expected to happen. I mean, actual opinions aside, how *did* it happen, logically? Pretty much nobody here wanted NGNL to win, including me, and yet it did. And I think we've all seen how intense the Madoka circlejerking can get in this neck o' the woods. Don't really know how that worked out. Damn lurkers. My God the power of hype is nothing to joke about.

Also, Psycho Pass getting that close to losing to SnK is definitely just a tad embarrassing.

**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Beloved series that served as a gateway anime for countless people including myself, versus an actually good shounen. While the two shows are certainly giants, Hunter X Hunter probably does not have the popularity and fanbase behind it to support it in this confrontation. Geass is going to win, and I'm sure that it's going to keep on winning for quite a while.
 
**2.** Another clash of the titans here. One is popular because it is beloved and had an amazing film sequel, the other because it helped to usher in the "cute girls doing cute things" phase. I'm putting my heart in for precious Haruhi-sama, and I expect the many other dedicated fans of this series to do the same. This spells the end for K-On!.

**3.** If Fate/Zero won against Naruto, I don't think it'd be that much of a stretch to see it win against One Piece ^see ^what ^I ^did ^there. Even though I'll be sad to see One Piece go, hell, that's just how good Fate/Zero was. The Urobutcher has One Piece at his mercy.

**4.** I really doubt that I need to go into much detail so to what Evangelion brings to the table. And, well, Gurren Lagann is still, even after all these years, pretty tender in all of our hearts. While both shows are undeniably extremely, extremely popular, they differ in that one is popular because of how well-liked it is, Lagann, and the other specifically because of how polarizing it is, Evangelion. And being famous for being polarizing doesn't help you too much in this sort of contest.

**5.** *Sigh*. If there's anything that's going to beat Death Note, it is most definitely not Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. I'm content, though, with how far it even made. This is an honorable and shameless defeat.

**6.** Two series that I hold very dear going against each other here. I think that Toradora! definitely has the edge in popularity/accessibility over Mushishi, though, and that that is what is going to give our favorite flat-chested tsundere the win here.

**7.** This here is a battle between two of the major things that anime is known for- feels, and visually intensive blood and gore. I'm putting my foot down and standing with my little buddy AnoHana here, and I'm not too nervous about us holding out, although I'm definitely not expecting Hellsing to go down without a fight.

**8.** Yep, this here is the match that I've been reinforcing the walls of my heart with steel for. My very favorite series versus one of my very first and beloved. An incredibly major handicap that Monogatari always suffers from in popularity contests like this is how it just isn't the show for everybody, and I think that is going to be the downfall of it today. Not everyone likes it, nor does everyone agree on what it is and where it stands. For how adored and loved by its fans it is (w00t), its shadow is teeming with enough critics to balance all this noise out. Bebop, on the other side of the ring, though... Well, who says they don't like Bebop? While it's gotten it's fair share of criticisms and indeed has its fair share of problems, the power of nostalgia is as formidable as, as aforementioned, hype. In a fair and honorable fight that will be sung of for generations to come, Bebop is going to walk away the victor.
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with the idea that someone cheated and gave NGNL more votes. I just logically do not see it winning, even with hype.
>> ARTICLE
>Well, who says they don't like Bebop? 

My opinion usually matches the majority, but I don't like Bebop very much - and it bugs me to no end that I just can't see what other people worship about the show.

Visually I need not elaborate. Cowboy Bebop is old. [We had new standards years ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-bV6GOGbQI) and the bar [just keeps getting higher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j64JegzWf3c).

I really like Bebop's ED (The Real Folk Blues), but the rest of Bebop's soundtrack (including the OP) is very ...drunk. This is a problem I have with Yoko Kanno in general actually: what others see as 'fluid' and 'energetic', I see as 'messy' and 'uncoordinated'. It's not that I dislike all of her work though - Ghost in the Shell: SAC also had a soundtrack from Yoko Kanno and *that* was 'fluid' and 'energetic' for me, yet also calculated and coordinated in composition. Favorite tracks include: [Torukia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ow4tGgZWk), [GET9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqueqtgHeNU), [Run Rabbit Junk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l13RCQNUyI4), among others. In fact, I think The Real Folk Blues is probably more similar to GITS:SAC's soundtrack - which is why it's the exception for me in Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack.

Spike is supposed to be considered one of the greatest characters of all time, yet I really don't see what I'm supposed to love about him. Sure, he has some nice sleight-of-hand and evokes Bruce Lee - but am I supposed to think he's witty as well? Cool? Smart? Badass? Somewhat cute? He doesn't make me laugh like Araragi, nor does he blow my mind like Lelouch. At times he can be 'endearingly oblivious badass' like Yasuri Shichika but there are many other characters (including Yasuri Shichika) who I find much more enjoyable than Spike. 


There's more to nitpick but those are the main reasons I can't love Bebop. It may be a generational gap, but I really like Princess Mononoke and the Ghost in the Shell movie; both of which came out before Bebop. There's one other show in which I am similarly perplexed by the popular opinion (Steins;Gate - how is this better than Madoka, or even Baccano!?), but that's another story.

My votes  
Code Geass vs **Hunter x Hunter** - didn't see Geass but HxH is my favourite shounen  
**Fate/Zero** vs One Piece - Fate/zero wins this easily for me. Have seen quite a bit of One Piece back in my younger years  
**Death Note** vs The Pet Girl of Sakurasou - didn't see Pet Girl of Sakurasou but Death Note is amongst my favourites  
**Monogatari Series** vs Cowboy Bebop - although I like Cowboy Bebop (haven't seen that much) I still enjoyed Monogatari more  
Everything else I couldn't really judge because I mostly didn't see any of them.

You should certainly watch Code Geass. It's quite amazing.

That's pretty high on my "to watch list", don't worry :P

Wait, you didn't see half these shows? Neither have I, but I would think that proper etiquette would be to NOT vote unless you've seen both. That's what I've been doing since the beginning. As much as I would love to vote for AnoHana for example, I have not seen hellsing so it'll have to do without my vote this time around. 


I clearly have a very different approach to this contest than other people if this is the norm. I see this tournament as completely useless if we are just ranking the shows we have SEEN rather than the shows that we believe are of higher caliber. I mean what's the point of the former? If someone could lend me some insight please.... 
>> ARTICLE
If it was about what I have seen I couldn't vote at all. It's about popularity after all. If I haven't seen one of those it's just not popular in my own little universe (I have voted for things I didn't even see, but they are high on my "to watch" list, so for me they are more popular than others) :3 I think you kind of take this a bit too serious. It's not like anyone can win money with this, it's just some polls to have fun.  
That's my point of view and I can totally understand your opinion in your case but for me it's just different :)
>> ARTICLE
So you've voted for shows you haven't seen, because you think that the majority find it more popular? 

So, basically the question, to you, is not "which of these is your personal favourite", but rather, "please regurgitate the opinions of the hive mind. This is a test."

I can see why you'd think I may be taking this too seriously, but, the truth is I just don't understand the point of this whole thing if we go by your method. 

Sure, it's just a contest, but I think some valuable information could be gathered from it. Isn't that the point? 

For example: 

If something other than FMA:B or Steins;Gate wins, I'll be surprised, but it'd be super interesting! It might hint that perhaps those shows aren't the best shows ever like the majority seems to suggest, and that perhaps there is another show that people like better on an individual level. Who knows? I think that's interesting! But what's the point if people just vote for the shows they think will win rather than the shows they like?

Edit: 
"I wouldn't be able to vote"

Well, perhaps, maybe, you shouldn't? I hate to sound mean here :( but...
>> ARTICLE
> So you've voted for shows you haven't seen, because you think that the majority find it more popular?  

No. For example I voted for Haruhi in match 2 because I would more likely watch this than K-On!. So for me it is more popular. It's still a personal taste of popularity and I don't vote for something because other people think it's more popular. And if I wouldn't want to watch either of them I didn't vote at all (for example Ouran High School Host Club vs Yu Yu Hakusho).
>> ARTICLE
"I'm interested in it, So to me it is more popular". 

"My personal taste of popularity".

I don't think that's the definition of popular dude. What you mean is it's more "interesting" to you. But I think the point of the contest is to determine how much we like the shows, not how much we like the premise or the cover art. 

I don't understand the point of the poll if we use your strategy. It's kind of detrimental to the results.  

What I mean to say is, having the information "this guy likes haruhi better  than K-on" is useful, but having the information "this guy thinks haruhi looks better than k-on" isn't really as useful. 
I mean, how many people thought Madoka Magica looked super badass and cool before watching it? Exactly 
>> ARTICLE
Well you maybe have a point here, but I will continue to vote because this is just fun for me. I accept your opinion but it won't change my behavior because of it. The whole thing is flawed because you could just vote over and over for the same thing until it wins and then there goes your analysis about it. Can't be sure if anyone isn't doing it. So bare with me.

It's interesting to me that everyone is so upset about NGNL beating out Madoka "because of the hype". Madoka is also crazy hyped about.  It's not like it trounced it. They were pretty damn close.

The point is Madoka is a modern classic whereas NGNL is, whether or not you like it, essentially the flavour of the month right now. In a year's time, Madoka will still make top 64 anime lists, but NGNL will likely be replaced by something new, or an old classic will regain its place.

Match 2. Even though I am upset GTO lost to it, I have to vote for Haruhi. Even though I voted against it, I still think it is a fantastic show that was a lot of fun to watch. 

Match 3. Probably the hardest one yet, since I love both shows, but I had to go for Fate/zero in the end, because it had a consistent plot, and actually does end.

Match 5. Got to go with Death note on this one. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of death note, along with the ending. The cat girl show really didn't give me anything as interesting as Death note did.

Match 8. While I will admit Monogatori was great, Cowboy Bebop just had so much I wanted out of a show (mostly based on the atmosphere and stories), that it easily gets my vote.

"cat girl show"



really?

Fair enough, that's not very distinctive when it comes to anime. How about Sakurasou pet girl show
>> ARTICLE
No my point is there is literally no cat girls in the entire show. Should watch both shows before making statements on which is better.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, it was more of me looking at the poster for the show again on MAL, and swapping out the pet for cat, than trying to say it had anything to do with cat girls. I didn't mean to say it was about cat girls, I just wanted to abbreviate the title down tremendously (for some reason), but it looks like I did it in a poor/confusing way, and I am sorry that it caused confusion, and also that looking at it again, it looks demeaning (which was not my intention and I am sorry that I made it seem that way). I did watch both shows, otherwise I wouldn't have voted at all, like with the rest of the numbers that were not listed. I don't like Death note enough to defend it against an opponent I have not seen.

While I'm sad to see Durarara! and Shin Sekai Yori go I didn't really expect them to win, very happy to see psycho pass move on though, it is one of my favorite new series. While I hope Baccano! keeps going I don't see it beating Steins;Gate.

Match 1. Code Geass is my second favorite anime of all time and my first true series, while I love HxH, and trust me I do, I have to side with Lelouch on this one.

Match 3. One Piece is okay but in the end it's just your typical battle Shounen, Fate/Zero definitely has this one.

Match 4. I really hope NGE can pull through this, but I don't think it is seeing how much everybody loves TTGL.

Match 5. I watched Death Note along with Geass as I was first getting into anime so it holds a special place in my heart. P.S. screw you Light.

Match 6. Just recently got into Mushishi recently and I'm loving it, though I'm unsure how well it will stack up against Toradora, everyone's favorite romantic comedy.

Match 8. Cowboy Bebop is a classic and one of my all time favorites, however, the Monogatari Series clicked with me so well that that I have to give it my vote. Whether it can eek out a victory over Bebop remains to be seen.

I haven't seen either series in matches 2 and 7 so I'll refrain from voting on those.

On a side note my soul is still crushed that my number one anime of all time, Gintama, lost in the first round to Naruto.

This one will be close but I think Haruhi will take it in the end.

>Fate/Zero vs One Piece

Fate/Zero is great but I find that One Piece is much more enjoyable and it has a huge fan base so I think that One Piece will win but not by much.

>Neon Genesis Evangelion vs Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

My favorite series vs one of my most hated series. I hate to say it but TTGL seems to be way more popular so I think it will win this round.

>Death Note vs The Pet Girl of Sakurasou

I think Sakurasou will win this one. People love their feels and I think people's complaints about Death Note's second half will affect this round.

>Mushishi vs Toradora!

I've never seen Mushishi but I voted for it because I can't stand Toradora! but sadly, Toradora! will be the victor.

>Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate vs AnoHana

I love Hellsing but I don't see it winning against AnoHana.

>Monogatari Series vs Cowboy Bebop

Personally, I didn't enjoy either show, so I didn't vote for either, but people seem to love Monogatari so I think it will be the winner.

Also, I find it both hilarious and satisfying that Madoka Magica lost No Game No Life.
>> ARTICLE
Watch a Feel Heal anime. I recommend "daily lives of High school Boys"
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Anohana. Now now, before you get the pitchforks, remember that it had a good ending. Despite turning you into a blubbering mass of tears, feels, and snot. [also](/s "just like code geass the series ended well for the main characters! Yes, I think it ended the best possible way for Lelouche cause he was still a psychotic murderer that we all love")

If you want to avoid any tears, just watch Lucky Star.

Anohana was nice.

All the Code Geass feels, it brings back such wonderful memories, it's one of my favourites. After I watched it I jumped straight into Mobile Suit Gundam 00 and I thought that was great too
>> ARTICLE
Time to watch more anime~
>> ARTICLE
You could try shittier copycats like Guilty Crown and Aldnoah Zero.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know about Guilty Crown since I've never seen it, but Aldnoah Zero is influenced by UC Gundam not Code Geass, lol. CG just happens to borrow UC elements as well.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I already watched GC and now that I think about it, it feels like they straight up tried to copy everything,  lol
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah Zero was built around Asseylum intentionally being the worst space princess in anime or science fiction history.   

Guilty Crown was plain nonsense, flashy nonsense.

> flashy, awesome-looking nonsense set to a truly phenomenal soundtrack

FTFY

Aye.  It will leave you saying "WTF am I watching."

I gotta add that this anime is not really influenced by Code Geass.  It seems more inspired by JRPGs like Xenogears, Xenosaga, and FF7.

Probably thw worst thing he can do Lmao

Don't worry, watch Death Note.

Watch the CG: Akito The Exiled movies, they are really good and the music is awesome.

"Death Note" Obviously. Or almost any "Gundam" series.

But man there is no need to be depressed if you are referring about the ending here. Hope this clears up some things for you  https://redd.it/3ozjl0
Also if you are depressed because you want more of it then go watch Code Geass Akito the Exiled. Even though it is a prequel its still decent. Its gonna end this year with its final episode getting a theatrical release on Feb 6. Here is another thread discussing the possibility of another Code Geass series  https://redd.it/3x49o8

I had been a casual fan, but then over one winter break (2 weeks) I binged Code Geass, Steins;Gate, and Gurren Lagann (in that order), and have never looked back since. If you want something to watch after Code Geass, I always recommend this track

I hated R2.

And that's a wrap! See you guys on Monday for the Gurren Lagann rewatch. Now, I have time to relax.

I'll not be joining the TTGL rewatch. The Geass rewatch turned out to be more time consuming than I thought so I need to catch up on other stuff.

You've done good work. Enjoy your break, but prepare to pierce the heavens.

I would not be mad at any of you if you tagged me with something pertaining to me being an episode skipper. I dont want you to, but I wouldnt be mad. I swear this has only happened with Code Geass. Its like somebody Geassed me: /u/Neawia, skip an episode every now and then! I hope this doesnt continue into future shows. I need to be careful and resist the order.

Lets start off with the stuff I missed yesterday. I apologize if anyone read it and was spoiled a bit, but I think /u/Blazin_Rathalos warned me early enough for me to take everything down.

**Episode 1 - The Wyvern Arrives**

That map made me realize Japan is such a small part of the overall conflict. I wonder how so many of the Japanese were able to travel so far across the world, or why they would choose to go to the EU where there is still conflict with Britannia. Unless they were already over there and the discrimination against them continued in other parts of the world.

Leila has Geass? And Clement totally likes Leila. Or is that just a cultural thing like showing respect or theyre friends or something?

Loved the shot of the machine gun fire switching to the bullet counter. The bullet counter still had the gunfire sfx, but it was electronic sounding. That was pretty cool.

These Alexander mechs move so strangely, but so quickly. Like a freaky undead corpse or hyperactive bug or something. Fun music during Akitos forest fight. Fast and a little crazy, just like his fighting style. He also has that Assassins Creed hidden blade.

Some guy at the party: True, Britannia doesnt appear to have any interest in expanding the war. Wonder if Charles just wanted everyone always focused on something (the war) so he could do what he wanted without any prying eyes.

Akitos a badass. Stops/threatens Leilas fiance/brother. Runs at a Knightmare with only a grenade launcher.

**Episode 2 - The Torn-Up Wyvern**

Orange haired guy is crazy.

The cockpit launch sequence was like the start of a futuristic roller coaster ride. The entire rocket launch was quite enjoyable too. Glad they kept the shots in space quiet. Its quite an elaborate, and likely expensive, drop-in method, but it worked.

Got some nice plot points from Commander Leila.

These battles feel more like an actual war. The mechs acted like people, having to run away or hide behind corners. The actual fighting was enjoyable too, though I guess the CG is still something you have to get used to. I dont mind it though.

So Akito was Geassed by his brother, but he defies the die order. That drive that he has is somehow linked to his squad so that they feel it as well, thus causing them to fight better in order to stay alive. How did they know about this to give them all the neural link thing?

Oh, and that centaur mech. Completely unnecessary, but Ill allow it because it was magnificent.

**Overall**

Ill probably have to rewatch episode 2 again to fully get everything, but I might wait until the rest of the episodes are out to do so.

I thought the sound design was a step up from the original series. From episode 1: The sound of the invading ships at the beginning, a lot of echoes, and all around gunfire sfx which were a bit more realistic.

Hopefully well see who contracted Shin (and Leila maybe?) by the end of these OVAs. If it was CC well find out for sure, but if it wasnt then I wont be surprised if we dont find out. Actually, if it wasnt CC that just means there were even more people with Code spread out around the world. That would just aggravate me since we didnt get to learn about them during the original series. Anyway, I hope we at least find out why Shins Geass took the form of making people die, if thats what it does. It seemed a bit similar to Lelouchs.

It was good to see how other parts of the world were faring. We got to see some different mechs as well as those long range artillery cannons (from episode 2). There was also a new Geass user, but I suppose I shouldve expected at least one. We also had a look at how other parts of the world view the Japanese, and its not much better.

Suzaku and Lelouch (it must be Lelouch) make a very brief appearance. Wonder how big a role theyl have in this. Kinda makes me dislike Suzaku a little bit more if whats actually going on is that Charles gave Lelouch memories of being someone else so they could use him as they see fit.

These episodes were quite good. In a way, I enjoyed them a bit more than the originals. The art design now matches the grittiness of the characters/fights/conflict. My feelings were quite neutral on the original bright and colorful design of the show, but thats really just a personal preference. I also liked the smaller cast of characters, and am hoping they keep it small and focus on good development for them.

**Conclusion**

Our rewatch is done. Been a pleasure.

When does episode 3 of Akito release? It says it aired on May 2, but its not out yet?
 
>> ARTICLE
It aired on May the 2nd in Japanese theaters. It's release is somewhere around 26th of June in physical format.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. I didn't know it was released in theaters. Thanks for that info.
>> ARTICLE
> That map made me realize Japan is such a small part of the overall conflict.

It's kind of funny how the somewhat myopic scope of the original series hid the fact that the struggle against Britannia is a global one.  It's definitely a clever trick. 

> Leila has Geass? And Clement totally likes Leila. Or is that just a cultural thing like showing respect or theyre friends or something?

It definitely seems that way on both accounts.  Especially with the geass [this picture](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/codegeass/images/9/94/1349067168690.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121011115741) from the first episode seems to be strong evidence of it.

> These Alexander mechs move so strangely, but so quickly. Like a freaky undead corpse or hyperactive bug or something.

I think it's just strange because we're using to landspinners or flying Knightmares.  I think the Alexanders area bit of form over function in that land spinners would not work as well in the very hilly terrain of Europe so they made Knightmares that could easily exploit that terrain.

> Akitos a badass.

He's like legitimately mentally unstable.  Somehow the geass command Shin gave him seems like it occasionally turns him into a homicidal maniac with no regard for his own life or that of others.  He's definitely an interesting change from Lelouch.  Where Lelouch was a big talker full of bravado and doing everything according to a plan, Akito barely talks and just seems content to go with the flow as long as it ends with him getting to kill someone.

> How did they know about this to give them all the neural link thing?

I honestly don't think they had any idea that this would happen.  Also, I don't really get what Akito is doing with the "die" order other than becoming a relentless savage, but I don't see how being told to die makes you do that?

> Hopefully well see who contracted Shin (and Leila maybe?) by the end of these OVAs.

In Leila's case it definitely seems like it's CC.  CC is in [this PV](https://youtu.be/K7iwah1K7vo) for episode 3 saying the same thing she said to Lelouch way back in the pilot.  Also, there's [this picture](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/codegeass/images/8/8e/Screen_shot_2012-09-29_at_11.33.44_PM.png/revision/latest?cb=20120930043939) from one of the PV's and that definitely looks like CC and Leila.

> Suzaku and Lelouch (it must be Lelouch) make a very brief appearance. Wonder how big a role theyll have in this. 

I don't see any way that Kingsley is not Lelouch.  There is way too much evidence pointing to the fact that it's Lelouch (besides his appearance of course).  From this [extended preview](https://youtu.be/v4tYbIXbdFU) that they put out it definitely screams Lelouch since he's seemingly up to his old tricks with showmanship etc.

> These episodes were quite good. In a way, I enjoyed them a bit more than the originals. The art design now matches the grittiness of the characters/fights/conflict.

I think it's very different to be sure.  The characters all seem toned down a notch from the characters in the original series.  None of them have the big magnetic personality of Lelouch and I think that's really smart and cool.  They chose to go with more understated and thoughtful which I think is a smart change of pace because this is a very different situation from the original series.  This is not a rebellion that they're fighting in rather it's a fight to keep their homeland safe.  They're fighting off an invading force, which leads to more open battles and less tricky let's pull a miracle out of our ass planning.  Very cool change of pace.

That's a good point to consider.

> Also, I don't really get what Akito is doing with the "die" order other than becoming a relentless savage, but I don't see how being told to die makes you do that?

Didn't Akito say he once died himself? I wonder if he doesn't want to die again so when he finds himself in near death situations he freaks out and goes berserk in order to survive. I don't know.

I'm not sure why the Geass order only seems to activate when he's fighting. We'll have to wait and find out.

But at the same time their military standard is those bulky ass Panzer Hummels and those don't really look all that practical for hilly terrain :x
>> ARTICLE

Ooooh right. First I thought it was a command type Geass, but you made a good point. Maybe Shin's Geass just compels people to die and since it's not a direct order like Lelouch's absolute obedience, Akito somehow managed to survive. After all, all we've seen of Shin's Geass is that he kills people with it so maybe his power is only useful for murder and nothing else.

But from what I understood, there is only one new Geass shown so far, which is Shin's. Leila doesn't seem to have it.

Overall I can't really say whether or not I'm liking this more than the main series, not just yet. I can only formulate a complete opinion once all 5 episodes are released.
>> ARTICLE
> But from what I understood, there is only one new Geass shown so far, which is Shin's. Leila doesn't seem to have it.

It didn't show Leila using it, but it seemed at one point (I think during the first episode) that her eye was about to activate it but didn't. I hope I'm not imagining things.


>> ARTICLE
I wrote it off as a red herring, but after seeing the preview for episode 3, I'm pretty sure she has a Geass too.

The dvd is released in Japan on 26th June I think. The 4th episode airs shortly after that.

Alright here we go. 2nd episode of Akito and the our last rewatch for this session.

It's been great fun with you all <3

---
- Recap

- Euro-Britannia ... I assume it's just the name of the Britannian territory located on the European continent and not some sort of limbo nation.

- Shin going to succeed that one guy from last time, Manfredi

- Wait, that Duke just said "the empire of Euro-Britannia", so it this more than just a colonial area? What's the political and infrastructural difference between the "Empire of Euro-Britannia" and any other Britannian colony?

- That orange-haired knight seems to be a major asshole, reminds me a lof of Luciano Bradley

- So there are 4 holy knight orders in Euro-Britannia, named after the archangels, and Shin became the head of one of them, alright got it

- Flashback

- How dare young Shin strike the Lelouch pose!!! HE IS NOT WORTHY!!!!

- I wonder if that's the exact same Geass power as Lelouch's or just a very similar. The more insteresting question though would be: Is Shin C.C.'s or V.V.'s contractor. I'll assume it's C.C.

- I really wonder what Ryo's gang is up to

- Nice office, comes equipped with posters of bikini models and lots of alcohol. And HOLY SHIT that is one big ass TV. Also Major Hammel looks a lot like Claude from Nisekoi ~_~

- I see, so I guess Akito and Shin are siblings hence the Hyuga name. And Shin probably got adopted into the Shaing family. Or is he actually related by blood, I can't really tell from his conversation with his little sister?

- Yay, another suicide mission

- Akito is a pretty straightforward guy, I'm liking him so far

- Good, at least they're thinking of using drones, even though they're not that advanced yet

- I know the crawling mode looks really cool, but I have to wonder where the practicality lies. I'd imagine that landspinners should still provide the fastest movement speed on suitable terrain and climing hills with uneven ground also isn't that hard with the use of slash harkens. 
Then again, this isn't Britannia and the standardized Europian KMFs seem to have the weaker specs overall. Maybe the Panzer Hummel - or any Europian KMF for that matter - isn't even equipped with harkens, which would maybe explain this movement option. Although this seems very uncomfortable for the pilot.

- Yep, they're trying something

- That Ayano chick looking really nice I gotta say :-9

- Crazy kid

- Leila being a pretty respectable commander so far

- A shuttle?

- A train ... could it be? THE KNIGHT OF SEVEN??? ... YES, there he is!

- Oooooooooh, Lelouch you look kinda ... stressed out. I know that he is supposed to appear but I really thought that we won't see him until episode 3. Now I'm intrigued.

- Dat changing sequence :3

- Shouldn't they be wearing at least auxiliary breathing devices?

- That ashley kid is reminding me even more of Bradley now. He even spouts dump ass questions just like that guy. Ashley Ashra, well he isn't a blood relative of Bradley it seems.

- Glide wings, that's some nice tech

- LOL first thing he does on the battlefield: friendly fire

- Nice artillery cannons

- Ok ... now using crawling mode over landspinners makes literally no sense unless their landspinner systems are complete ass, in which case I'd have to wonder why you'd install them in the first place.

- That sass. That blush.

- I assume that those are Gloucesters

- Wait that bald knight is a woman? ...

- NOW they're using landspinners. And those drive really well. Now please enlighten me as to why they always crawl instead?

- Wait, does Akito have a Geass as well? Or was that Shin's Geass flashing in Akito's mind? I'll go with the latter

- DAFUQ, he transferred his Geass curse onto his teammates?

- DAFUQ is wrong with your freaking KMF Shin???

- **Mental clouding intensifies**

- BUREIN REIDO

- Ok, I guess that's what the crawl mode is good for. Ultra erratic movement which seems kinda difficult to track. Wait, how the fuck do those things climb walls? The Amazing Spiderkknightmare???

- So I was right, that Geass flash earlier was Shin's from the flashback

- WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. A CENTAUR???????????????

- That weapon looks even more ridiculous than anything Monty Oum (may he rest in piece) could have come up if he was still alive ...

- Of all the ridiculous technological advancements I've seen in Code Geass, this fucking Knightmare takes the cake.

- There is no paving in the fucking world that could withstand a KMF like that **gallopping** on it like that.

- A new mask: Julius Kingsley

- Last episode's preview on this episode turned out to be a massive cocktease: C.C. remains nowhere to be seen. :'(

---

Ok so since now we're all on the same page because the third episode has yet to come out, it's prediction time:

C.C. contracted Shin 10 years ago. He seeks to build a new world for reasons unknown, but he killed his entire family(?) because he is crazy like that I guess. Somehow Akito didn't die so I assume that he doesn't have the exact same Geass as Lelouch.

Speaking of Lelouch. He seemed to be himself while on the Train but became Julius Kingsley when he came out. 
Based on that there are 2 theories:

1.) Charles gave him a false life as military advisor Julius Kingsley with a new fake past that still involves Suzaku as some kind of close friend. Which means that this Lelouch has already been Julius Kingsley when we first saw him in the train. 

2.) Charles planted a delayed Geass on Lelouch that Suzaku is able to trigger through yet unknown means. That means that Lelouch was in fact Lelouch Vi Britannia when he was on the train and Suzaku activated Charles' Geass before they got out.
Either way, Lelouch will be working for Britannia in the meantime. 
Taking the EU's situation in R2 in consideration, it probably means that Lelouch will wipe the floor with them.

Going even farther into the future, I predict that at the end of the series, both Akito and Shin will be dead. It would make no sense to introduce someone like Akito and let him live because the EU is completely fucked up in R2. 

This also means that it is likely that most if not all of Leila's frontline soldiers might bite the dust sooner or later, including herself. It's not that much of a strech to assume that by the end of this series, the EU will be left very weak so Schneizel just needs to come in and step on them. Remember how Schneizel once mentioned that they've made peace with France? Since one of the EU's HQs seem to be located in Paris, I can make a few assumptions from that fact.

Side note: The music wasn't my cup of tea during the first episode, but now I've acclimated to the new OST and I find it really good. It's not necessarily better or worse than the main series's OST, it's just different and I appreciate it, because this is not Lelouch's story, so an OST to go with the Europians seems logical.

The ending song is great btw, I really like it.

Anyway ... when does episode 3 come out? I know it was already screened in Japan but the BD is probably not released yet. Any release date as of now?
>> ARTICLE
> How dare young Shin strike the Lelouch pose!!! HE IS NOT WORTHY!!!!

They could've made it a little different. C'mon.

> WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. A CENTAUR???????????????

I'm done questioning Code Geass. You wanna give me a freaking centaur mech, give me a centaur mech. I'm down. And yeah, the pavement cannot withstand his galloping. Lol.

> I predict that at the end of the series, both Akito and Shin will be dead.

Good prediction. Your reasoning makes sense too.


>> ARTICLE
> NOW they're using landspinners. And those drive really well. Now please enlighten me as to why they always crawl instead?

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool

Might be justifiable as a profile-reduction technique, like soldiers crawling instead of running.
>> ARTICLE
>Wait, that Duke just said "the empire of Euro-Britannia", so it this more than just a colonial area? What's the political and infrastructural difference between the "Empire of Euro-Britannia" and any other Britannian colony?

The fact these are European nobles, or their descendants after a couple of generations, who are ostensibly reclaiming their former territories. That is why they are the vanguard of this invasion force, but it seems Emperor Charles is not very pleased with their progress considering the intervention of Julius Kingsley. He seems to be thinking about speeding up the conquest from what we can gather so far.

In other words, the Euro-Britannians are all ultimately part of the Holy Britannian Empire as a whole, but the internal administrative structure they have set up appears to be relatively different. It doesn't sound like this state of affairs will last until the end of the Akito story though.

Once again, first-timer post-episode thoughts.

* As expected, by trying to fold a nest of vipers into your forces, you're asking for trouble, and trouble is what our intrepid squad gets.  Kind of funny how they get convinced not to escape and run off by Leila and Akito promising to go in with them.  And of course the instant they get on the field, they start shooting at the two of them.  Curious how they decide to start straightening up and flying right when the Brittanians show up, rather than using he confusion of battle to run off.  Ah well.

* Castles with secret passages?  Dis some old-skool.

* So Akito himself has some sort of Geass?  He has the red-rings-of-*being*-Geassed and the flappy-wings of *having* Geass.  Wha?  And his power seems to be directly controlling others in real time?  At least till he runs out of steam and collapses?  Useful to a point I guess.  Pretty specialized ability compared to the others we've seen.

* Yesterday, I had been about to write that Leila had twintails, but then I looked again and she just has those meatball hair decorations for it.  Today we actually do go twintail mode.  I had been thinking she was going to be semi-useful in battle, given that she's all badass at hand-to-hand combat and everything.  No such luck.  At least she manages not to get in the way that much.

* The launch/orbit/reentry sequence was pretty cool, if not very relevant.  I like how they went all hard-science and put total silence on the exterior space shots.  But I don't get why they had to orbit the entire Earth just to lob themselves a few hunderd km over enemy lines.

* The fights here seem to indicate the EU manages to go more than toe-to-toe with Brittania in battle.  Helps explain why Brittania hadn't just steamrolled over the world a long time ago.

* There are a couple of Suzaku scenes that don't seem to have a lot to do with much of anything  yet.  And was that Lelouche play-acting as a weirdo visiting dignitary?

* This Ashley person seems to be channeling Bradley from the original series:  psycho in residence.

* Am I the only one who chuckled at Shin's Knightmare?  A steampunk gold centaur with a spear/axe thingy incorporating a bunch of decorative gears?  Even the name is ridiculous:  "Vercingetorix".

* There seem to be quite a few little side-storeis going on that I wonder if they're ever going to be able to cover adequately.  Like this thing with the researcher lady and her husband-in-a-drawer.  And the slovenly boss who's really a spy (using a real WWII-era Enigma machine, no less).  And Leila's family issues.  And so forth.  We'll see, I guess.

Well, I guess that wraps things up for now, eh?  I expect to see you all back here when the subsequent three movies show up, y'hear?  Till then, see ya 'round the sub, and all hail Lelouch!

> But I don't get why they had to orbit the entire Earth just to lob themselves a few hunderd km over enemy lines.

Now I'm not a rocket scientist, but I imagine that shooting a shuttle into space and have it land just a few hundred kms further away seems to be unpractical, given how sharp the re-entry angle would be. Orbiting around the globe once should take care of that problem. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the two episodes for the first time. I liked them overall, the only thing which bothered me is the centaur knightmare of Akito's brother. It just looks shitty imo.
The [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEN8rkq7Jr8) which plays during the credits is really great. 
>> ARTICLE
Not only that but that thing looks technologically way too unpractical. I know Sunrise probably wanted to spice things up a bit, but really ... enhanced custom Gloucesters, or even a Vincent, would have been just as fine. Those things are really solid all around and can be customized to a great degree for commanders to stand out. Just look at how well Cornelia handles such a machine.

The mech designs are probably the only thing that I'm disliking so far from this OVA series. They don't even look like KMFs anymore, especially the Centaur.
>> ARTICLE
I happen to like the custom Gloucesters that showed up during Akito 2.

The Centaur, as you call it, is based on these KMF designs from the Nintendo DS Game that was released around the time of the first season.  

http://www.mahq.net/mecha/codegeass/geass-ds/regalia.htm

http://www.mahq.net/mecha/codegeass/geass-ds/equus.htm

Keep in mind that Code Geass has always had a few odd designs. Remember the Siegfried? It's a spinning orange ball and far more out of place than this. In fact, I think the "centaur" motif is reasonably compatible with the medieval trappings that Code Geass likes to play around with. It isn't a mass production model either.

Personally, I feel this  isn't too different from how Gundam has had incredibly crazy Mobile Armors co-existing with more realistic designs. That goes all the way back to the original series. 



>> ARTICLE
The geass effect that Akito is suffering is really intriguing. I have three theories about it at this point:

1. Akito is defying it, because he's a [demon.](http://pics.filmaffinity.com/Chrono_Crusade_Serie_de_TV-498018542-large.jpg)
1. Akito already died, so it can't force him to die a second time.
1. It isn't the same geass that Lelouch has. Lelouch's geass makes people *obey* the command (so "die" makes them die), while Shin's makes them *pass along* the command (so "die" makes them kill, and get others around them to kill). We don't know that everyone in that childhood scene died by their own hands; perhaps Shin said "die" and they killed each other.

Based on the length of my descriptions, you can probably guess which one I'm leaning towards...

^(^But ^seriously, ^Rosette ^and ^Chrono, ^amirite?)
>> ARTICLE
I could've sworn Akito said that he already died. Maybe he has Code. Might be a little crazy to assume it so early, but I'll keep it mind.

And I like your third point. That actually seems pretty cool and fairly possible.

Akito's definitely said that he's already died. The only reason I'm leaning against it being that simple is that I don't see how it would make him become an amazing fighter.

Code is certainly a possibility. Perhaps he can tap into the shared consciousness of humanity and predict his adversary's actions that way?

#### Other Lists

I used my data set to create some other lists. I figured some of them may be interesting, though most of them turned out not to be.

###### [Weighted Favorites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=969058587)

[One person who used favorites in the past](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/) used a weighted favorites score rather than the favorites percentage that I use. This system treats each favorite as an additional score worth 11. This system takes advantage of the *MyAnimeList* score, but I don't like it because it does not get rid of the extraneous sequels on the top list.

###### [Most Scores of 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=225861329)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 10. This list ends up closely mirroring the [regular *MyAnimeList* top anime list](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) (the highest ranked series would naturally receive more 10s).

###### [Most Scores of 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=234535405)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 1. At a brief glance, it seems like there are a bunch of anime that are known for being bad (anime that people love to hate), e.g., [Mars of Destruction](http://myanimelist.net/anime/413/Mars_of_Destruction/stats).

###### [Avg. of Scores from 2 to 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=725274167)

The mean of scores from 2 to 10, excluding 1 votes. I include all votes from an anime's "Stats", including [scores that normally wouldn't count](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime). I figured that a lot of 1 scores are overreactions (and are there people downvoting sequels just to clean up *MAL*'s top list?) and wanted to see what would happen if I exclude them.

###### [Most Planned To Watch](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=332780832)

Ends up being cluttered due to upcoming releases that people are looking forward to / recent releases which haven't yet been subbed. There's no good way of automatically filtering out these released-but-unsubbed ones without doing it manually.

Perhaps a list of only TV series would be more interesting. The top planned to watch TV series are *[Myriad Colors Phantom World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World)* (remember the data is from Jan. 6, before this winter season got rolling) -- *Kyoto Animation* projects are generally highly anticipated -- and *[Aria the Origination](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3297/Aria_The_Origination)* -- it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

###### [Most On-Hold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=1990281603)

Seems to have a bunch of longer-running series?

###### [Most Dropped](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=77782877)

Not sure what the pattern is.

Shit, Mushishi Zoku rises 22 places if you remove the ones.

> it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

I didn't really think Aria the Origination was much different in quality from the first two seasons. I think Aria just tends to drop *a lot* of people along the way.
>> ARTICLE
People who drop the *Aria* series are likely drop it after *Animation*. If you can get past that, then you're much more likely to eventually get through *Natural* and *Origination*.

That's why *Natural* benefits so much from the sequel effect. It has a high score yet a low number of favorites.

However, *Origination* has both a high score and a high number of favorites, so people legitimately think that it's great compared to the rest of the series (myself included). Assuming your *MAL* is up-to-date, you haven't finished *Origination* yet -- you might just revise your opinion once you finish the series.
>> ARTICLE
K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is all about the characters slowly changing. The Origination is about them really striving to become Primas and you can see the change once you look back from the end of the series to the beginning. There's a scene with Alice in Origination that's similar to one from the first season but she behaves very differently.

There's definite change in the The Origination and a rough plot, especially in the second half of the season. It's not the same as the other two.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 10 and I'm still not really seeing any major changes in quality. You're right that there is character development that gradually occurs, but the core nature of the series is not changed.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. For me, episode 9 (10 on Hulu since it counts episode 5.5 as 6) is a truly spectacular episode and so are episodes 11 through 13 (12 to 14). The plot becomes evident around that episode, but started much earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 8 and 9 are spectacular, especially since I'm a Alice fan.
>> ARTICLE
I think Episode 9 is one of the great episodes of anime. Episodes 11 through 13 really tie everything together and wrap up the series beautifully.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to watch the rest of it. But I'm taking it slowly, an episode a day or less. I've been watching this for months.
>> ARTICLE
> K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

That's like saying "I got to *After Story*, saw no difference in quality [since the first few episodes of *After Story* are similar to the original *Clannad*], and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change."

> When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.

This is demonstrably false either way you look at it:

- For series where the TV sequels don't finish the series (e.g., *Gintama*, *Mushishi*, *Natsume Yuujinchou*), only the first season receives a high number of favorites, and the following/final series receive almost nothing.

- For series where the TV sequels end the story (e.g., *Kuroko 3rd Season*, *Fate/Zero 2nd Season*, *Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season*, *Code Geass R2*, *Bakuman 3*, *Higurashi Kai*, and many more): the first season always has the highest number of favorites.

People do not "conserve" favorites for the final season. If they like a series, they'll tend to favorite the first season.

The only exceptions are stuff like *Clannad: After Story* and *Aria the Origination*, indicating that they're better than the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
After Story is not an episodic slice of life with no real changes in quality between episode or overall story.

From the first 30.

5 are "girl shit". Anime made just for girls, most MAL users are male.

7 are "kiddy shit". Nobody really wants to watch an anime meant for elementary schoolers any more than they want to watch Nick Jr. (3 of them are forever long as well)

14 are "shit". Mixed bag between shitty CG, no existent story, wut budget, and boobs-just-for-they-hey.

2 are "no homo". Manly man shows about men doing man stuff. Probably a good show for your Harley-Davidson riding uncle.

The last two are Heroman--an American made story for Japan. Stan Lee you can't make anime. Just stahp. And Saint Seiya Omega which I call "dem rose colored glasses finally fell off lol".

Your system placed LoGH on the #1 spot. For that alone, this is leagues ahead of the current one.
>> ARTICLE
It helps that the show is not just something someone picks up unless they know what they are getting into. It's not like picking up a 12 or 24 episode show. I'm sure many people have had moments where they pick up a 12 or 24 episode show based on something small like seeing a gif from it or hearing about it from a friend but I think it's safe to say that's not enough to convince them to dedicate themselves to ~100 episodes.

This is why the top 4 are all really long shows. People who watch(ed) it either knew what they were going into or have followed it for several years so it only makes sense that there is a good ratio of favorites. Ranking by favorites is ruined by the flaw of having long running shows as they will almost always have a strong fanbase.

as a major ranked list nerd, I love you for this
>> ARTICLE
Personally I only have 4 anime listed under my favorites because I only want to include the best of the best, but other people use all 10 of their slots and as such their tastes would be more strongly represented than people like me. Unless of course you assume that people who use all their favorite slots have statistically identical taste to those who don't it, which seems unlikely. I doubt this could easily be rectified, perhaps assigning less weight to favorites from people as they have more favorites would fix the problem but that would also make the task of composing such a list much more difficult.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best way would be to adjust the weight given to favorites by the percent of shows a person has listed as their favorites (and allow people to mark unlimited favorites). This could also somewhat address the drastic rise of some of the hugely popular shounens (or if they don't actually drop, it would address the criticisms that would be placed against their place on the list).

That's an interesting way to use it. I always thought everyone used the favorites spot as a personal top 10 list. 
>> ARTICLE
>Movies suffer. Great movies like Spirited Away, Wolf Children, and Princess Mononoke drop 329, 251, and 308 places, respectively. People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.

Personally I think this is because movies tend to be more universally liked, so if I cram my favorites with 5 Ghibli movies that doesn't really say much about my personal tastes compared to having 5 different series. So in my mind I just ignore movies in that sense. Maybe MAL should have a separate favorites list for them.
>> ARTICLE
Mmh, that's a good point. It's harder to dislike movies, generally.
>> ARTICLE
Well, generally they have a higher budget and much better production values which is a big factor. 
>> ARTICLE
You have quite a lot of 10s, so I'll just throw this out there to you as an experiment:  if you were to rank all of your 10s by however you're currently ranking your favorites without regard to limits or displaying taste, how many of your top 5 would be movies?  

I'm asking because I'm wondering if the length of a series versus the length of a movie (particularly because a series will mostly not be watched entirely in one chunk) leads people to feel more strongly about them after it's over.  Say, if you loved Spirited Away, well, that was two hours that you were sitting there, it's done, and you rate it.  But if you loved Nagi no Asukara, you were watching it, going to bed, thinking about it a bit til you could keep watching it, growing more attached to it while you were still in the middle of watching it, then you finish it a few days later and rate it.  So when you think about what to put on your favorites, you were wrapped up in NnA for much longer.  

Just spitballing, I dunno.  
>> ARTICLE
>You have quite a lot of 10s

I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s. 

>if you were to rank all of your 10s by however you're currently ranking your favorites without regard to limits or displaying taste, how many of your top 5 would be movies?I'm asking because I'm wondering if the length of a series versus the length of a movie (particularly because a series will mostly not be watched entirely in one chunk) leads people to feel more strongly about them after it's over. 

Hmm well you make a good point there. While I feel really strongly about my top 2, Clannad and Nagi Asu, probably due to the attachment over time (also because I think they are just incredible works of animation) I would at least put my favorite movies in the next two spots, like Nausicaa and Wolf Children. 

I think these share at least a little bit of the attachment factor because I've seen Wolf Children 3 or 4 times now and Nausicaa has an incredible and much much longer manga which I've read twice so I think I'm more fond of it by association. 

>then you finish it a few days later and rate it.

Implying I didn't finish Nagi in under 2 days flat... :P
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your thoughts.  

> I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s.  

All about perspective here, I guess, what with my 1 10 out of 233.  Basically what I was getting at is that you had more 10s than favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
Well it seems to me like you are trying you keep your scores on a Gaussian/Normal curve.... however logically this is not a correct thing to do because you don't sample anime randomly. Instead, you watch series that look good to you or are well-rated. If you watched every single anime that came out every season, naturally it should follow a normal bell curve because most will be average, but no one does that. 

However if your rate purely for your own reference, rating them in relation to each other, not caring about their scores in relation to every other anime released, then of course it makes more sense to do this. 

Personally I care about how an anime compares to every other anime that I have or haven't seen so I rate accordingly. In this way it makes perfect sense to have many highly scored series, since I chose and watched them with those expectations. 

Although even with a Gaussian distribution, you should still have more than one 10 out of 233 so I think you are just being overly critical. 
>> ARTICLE
To be clear, I didn't intend my comment as a criticism at all - people use whatever scale is a best fit for their goals.  

Rating discussion gets really navel-gazey really easily, so sorry in advance.  That said, here's why I think my scale developed as it did:

* Months or years after watching, it's much easier to properly rescore shows to compress the scale if needed (in order to say, push everything up to accommodate stumbling across a new low that's much worse than any other 1) than to expand it if it turns out to have been too compressed (e.g., turning 10s into 9s and 10s).  
* Using the entire scale at any given time makes my preferences as clear as possible for purposes of e.g., recommendations.   

I am not aiming for any given kind of curve at all - it just happened that way.  If you look at my last edited dates, I virtually never rescore after the fact (I can think of three examples offhand, two of which were pushing 10s to 9s, excepting my original very early expansion to the whole scale about 3 months after I started when I had about 30 total entries) and if you look closely enough at the distribution it's pretty lumpy at points (say, 1 vs 2).  My only thought process at this point (and it's been this way since I filled in the last of the 10 numbers with my 41st entry) is "which set of anime (at a given score) does this anime fit best next to, as far as my enjoyment is concerned?"  I'd say that 4 is my standard for "liked and disliked this equally".

I'd love to be lucky enough to watch only 5+s forever.  But I can't predict things that will *definitely* hit that with any reasonable accuracy (outside of a one specific type of anime, which is limited enough, has enough episodes in any given entry, and has few enough subtitled entries that I don't want to overload myself with it all at once, particularly because I won't appreciate it quite as much that way).  I never watch something that I don't anticipate enjoying (though I'll leave contracts open to that possibility in the future).

Also, I tend to watch more movies and short OVAs than most people, as far as I can tell, and I'm willing to take more chances on things that short - I never expected to like my 10 *that* much before watching it.  My average score on those is significantly lower than my average series score.  

As far as my 10 specifically goes, the end of the scale gets really tricky, particularly without a series currently there, but it's so rarefied that I just don't think anything else measures up enough to Angel's Egg that it'd belong there rather than with my 9s (which I still love a lot, obviously).  I deeply loved every bit of about 83% of my strongest 9, whereas for Angel's Egg it was more like 96% of it.  So I'm content leaving it alone for now.  

Finally, I'm really not sure I agree with the idea that the population of anime will converge to a normal or Gaussian curve.  If there's a reason you think it really does, we can discuss this more in-depth, but "90% of everything is crap" is a common saying for a reason, and as far as anime specifically is concerned, people love to complain about "generic LN adaptations" or whatever dominating a given season.  So if I'm pulling from a population with a ton of would-be-very-low-rated entries based on my preferences, then the shape of my curve makes a lot of sense.  
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly why I decided to use the % of favorites as my metric. Scoring systems vary too wildly between different users, but at least the favorites vary a bit less.
>> ARTICLE
>because you don't sample anime randomly

Even if you *did* sample anime randomly, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't apply, so there's no strong reason to expect a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
Why does it not apply? 
>> ARTICLE
For it to apply, there have to be a large number of independent variables with E[X]=0 (in that they factor into the rating positively or negatively, and are expected to factor into the score in a neutral way) that are summed to form an anime "score."  This doesn't really apply (at least, I would not expect for most people).  For me, I don't take off for "flaws" at all (what matters is that *something* works, and hopefully really well, rather than that everything works).  Other people can't talk about anything except "flaws."
>> ARTICLE
For this purpose, I'm assuming that it doesnt matter exactly *how* people rate shows, rather that *people* are doing the rating and that the variables of people's specific tastes and the varying quality of anime in general are going to combine together to create a normal curve. 

Lets look at engalleon's distribution- http://graph.anime.plus/engalleons/ratings,anime 

Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution. Even if we look at [the global stats](http://graph.anime.plus/s/globals) it follows a normal curve shifted up about a sigma or so, which is expected. 
>> ARTICLE
>Even if we look at the global stats 

Ahh, but the CLT *does* apply to global stats, because individual user rating events *are* independent and have a consistent E[X].

>Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution.

Suppose "quality" is exponentially distributed (motivated, say, by that awful too-often-quoted law).  Suppose further that a user only watches a show if its expected quality is above a certain threshold (say, E[X] >= 5) but sometimes they're wrong (but not that often).  From a distance, their score distribution will "look" normal, but it's not actually.  Engalleon's distribution has a much fatter upper tail than lower tail, which is something you'd expect under my model, but not under a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
>More importantly, there are a handful of sequels which stand head and shoulders above the rest of their respective series. Clannad: After Story is a prime example -- even people who dislike Clannad generally love After Story, so it makes sense to treat the sequel as its own, separate piece of work.

That was my problem with the combined list. If the entire Clannad series were combined, I would still "favorite" it. The ending was that good. I don't think it's fair to try and take the average of my S1 and S2 scores and use it to judge my score for the entire series - if I were looking at the entire franchise as a whole, I would take a more holistic view of things. Yeah the first season isn't up to par with the second, but it's necessary to understand Tomoya's character.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of off topic, but I actually pretty heavily disagree with the comments on Clannad. Pretty much all the character development necessary for the emotional moments in After Story to work is *in* After story (and not just after story but the portions after Tomoya exits highschool which starts around episode 9 iirc). The rest of the background is somewhat necessary to set up the story, but I don't think anything significant would be lost by condensing it immensely (to say, 5-6 episodes from the current amount of ~30 episodes, removing all the side arcs and just setting up Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship). 

I also find it interesting that you say the ending is 'that good', as while many of the portions before it are highly praised the ending is often heavily criticized. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean the whole final 15 episodes.

*Aria the Origination* is actually my favorite anime series of all time, but I have to **strongly caution you**. The series is not at all easy to get into. The *Aria* series is the slowest paced series I've ever seen, and that causes a lot of people to drop the show. It's a series that can/should take months to finish.

Also, keep in mind you'll need to get through *Aria the Animation* and *Aria the Natural* before going on to *Aria the Origination*.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know that it's a slow pace, I'll remember that, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
To give some more insight how long it can take to watch this:

I've started watching Aria the *Animation* on the 21st of December 2014 and now I'm 15 episodes into Aria the *Natural*.

Then again I really want to keep this show for as long as possible, just so I can watch it whenever I'm feeling down.
>> ARTICLE
When you eventually finish Aria, there's Tamayura and Sketchbook to try. I'm on my third re-watch of Aria. There's some episodes of The Origination I think are amongst the best episodes of all anime.

I'll probably restart at The Animation once I've finished Origination. It's nice to have a show like Aria that you can turn to.
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen Tamayura, except for the most recent OVAs, and Sketchbook goes right onto my plan-to-watch list, thanks for the recommendation.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually watched Sketchbook yet, I've just heard about it and I plan to watch it soon, so I thought I'd share. I heard it discussed in the same context as Tamayura and Aria so it's a good bet that I (and possibly you) will like it too.
>> ARTICLE
Great work.  A few thoughts:  

> People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.  

I feel like a more important factor here is that people are a lot more likely to watch (and score) a movie that they don't like than to watch a series they don't like long enough for their score to count, particularly because a lot of people don't score their drops, regardless of how many episodes they watch.  

> Popular anime do better in this list.  

The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference.  Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long.  You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.  
>> ARTICLE

I disagree.

Yes, it's true that people drop movies less than TV series. However, if people don't like a movie and finish/score it, then they'll score it lowly, and this should be clearly reflected in the *MAL* score. Yet so many movies score extremely highly and rank in the top 25, so these people who dislike a movie but finish and score it are not having that much of an effect.

If you take a look at the distribution of scores from something like *[Spirited Away](http://myanimelist.net/anime/199/Sen_to_Chihiro_no_Kamikakushi/stats)* vs. *[Your Lie In April](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/stats)*, you'll notice that the distributions are really similar; *Spirited Away* actually has a higher distribution of votes than *Your Lie In April*, yet *Spirited Away* has a much, much lower percentage of favorites.

If anything, having more people finish and score a movie would result in a *lower* score because there will be more people who dislike it scoring it low, whereas people who dislike a TV series would drop it early and not have their scores count.

> The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference. Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long. You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.

Yes, it seems like being long-running has some effect. I doubt this is the main reason, however. appu1232 suggested accounting for the 20% rule by including dropped and on-hold members, and I suspect long-running series like *Bleach* will still do well.

I think it's more a matter of just being popular / something that a casual viewer is more likely to see. I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). Note that popular series like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* also have a high proportion of favorites, but they are of a standard length.
>> ARTICLE
I misinterpreted/misread your comment about movies, I guess.  What you're saying here makes sense.  

On the popularity side, I agree that that both the length and the popularity are factors - though as far as your examples go, Attack on Titan barely benefits (up 5), and Sword Art Online, as a polarizing series, will naturally benefit from this method of analysis regardless of its massive popularity.  School Days is one example of a less popular thing that benefits similarly due to the polarization.  Angel's Egg, despite being a one-shot OVA, also gets a huge boost here (though see below for another factor).  I'm not hugely familiar with polarizing anime beyond those, though, so I can't look much further.  

Another interesting thing I noticed, just eyeballing it, is that this works against recency bias pretty well (possibly indirectly through relative obscurity).  Even something as short, as not particularly niche, and as not particularly polarizing as, say, Honey and Clover benefits pretty strongly here.  This makes sense, too, in that people are a lot more to watch a given thing from 2015 that doesn't hold massive appeal to them than they are to watch something from 2005, and so the average H&C watcher is a lot more likely to really dig it than the average watcher of much of anything from 2015, even though the H&C watcher will (generally) have more anime competing for those favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool that a lot of relatively niche genres (mecha, mahou shoujo) get a better representation in the top 100. I'm also surprised to see Armoured trooper VOTOMS at #42, I should probably prioritize watching it now.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently makes #197 on the critics' list too. I haven't seen it myself, but part of the reason I made this list was to find series like this.

Do be careful though, because something being high on the favorites list doesn't mean you'll like it. As you said, there are a lot of niche shows on the list, and it's likely that they're somewhat polarizing shows and will appeal to only a small number of users (but enough to get a high proportion of favorites).
>> ARTICLE
Votoms is pretty fun! It deliberately changes itself every cours or so which is interesting, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think one important thing to note about this is that the reason shows such as LoGH, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Gintama, etc. are so high on the list is because of the shear number of episodes. It's not hard to imagine that only people who know what they are going into will watch a long running show. It's not like picking up a 12 episode show because you saw a gif of a cute girl from it or something. People who watch these anime are very likely to end up liking and favoriting it.

Personally, I think it shouldn't just include the people that scored it, but also the people that put it on-hold and dropped it too. The long shows are still going to be higher, but it wouldn't dominate the top 5 entries either I'd imagine.

That's a good idea. I'll try that once I have time later today. I suspect that it won't make much of a difference though -- something like *One Piece* will still have around 13% favorites.

I believe that it's more due to the series being popular, so casual viewers are more likely to watch it (and thus favorite it, since they haven't watched as many different shows). I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). This also explains why shows like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* rank so highly in the favorites list even though they have a standard number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The reasoning for using favorites seems off to me.
>    More intuitive: Saying that something scores a 9.2 is pretty abstract, but saying that something is your favorite is a lot more natural, not relying on any arbitrary scale.

Favorites aren't any more or less arbitrary than a rating; they are just binary.

>    Consistent across different users: One user may never give a 10, believing that nothing deserves a "perfect" score, while another user may give 10s to any remotely entertaining series. However, a favorite is an idea that's generally consistent across different people, no matter how they may score a show.

Again, people will value favorites differently.

>    Limited number of favorites: Each user has a limited number of favorites to dole out. Since you cannot spam favorites, each favorite is somewhat valuable, and people will generally only favorite something that they genuinely like.

Just looking at a fringe case here: everyone's 11th favorite show could have a 0 "favorite" rating even though it is only slightly behind 10th.

There's psychological evidence that we're better at processing smaller numbers linearly than numbers >4. (See: the subitizing range for humans and the Weber-Fechner law)

>everyone's 11th favorite show could have a 0 "favorite" rating even though it is only slightly behind 10th.

The law of large numbers is a bit of a counterpoint to this.

>Popular anime do better in this list. For example, One Piece, Fairy Tail, and Bleach rank 58, 187, and 536 places higher, respectively. Here's one possible explanation saying that casual viewers will weight popular series more highly. Then again, these series do have legitimately fantastic moments, like the Soul Society arc in Bleach.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, It seems to me that there is another bias in that shows on the opposite side of the spectrum would also benefit from this kind of list. Shows that are more of 'cult classics' with small dedicated fanbases are also going to have their rankings skewed upward (as evidenced by Tatami Galaxy, Utena, Rose of Versailles, etc. which you mentioned). As much as I personally agree that these shows should be higher up, intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

These biases could be counteracted somewhat by adding in two things:

1. A dampening effect on the percentages of shows with small popularities (similar to how MAL's current weighted formula does) - this would help counteract the pretty drastic rise of cult shows.

2. Another dampening effect on the value of favorites by the percentage amount of shows listed as favorites on a particular viewers list (lower percentage is more valuable). It'd be difficult to figure out how to formulate this, though, and it'd require we allow unlimited favorites to make things more accurate. This way when a person that has only listed 5 shows lists 4 of them as favorites (which seems to be part of the assumed reason massively popular shows within casual audiences have risen so much), those favorites are not valued as much as someone who only has 1 out of 200 shows listed as favorites. This would, however, obviously require access to the backend of MAL so it's not like we can actually make a list with this attribute.

It'd also be helpful if series were combined within MAL to begin with for favorites - this could make the data for lots of series more accurate (like Gintama, Monogatari, etc.), but it would again require full access to the backend of MAL. It would also be somewhat difficult to completely determine what should be grouped together, I imagine practically everyone would be fine with something like Gintama being all combined, but what about other series? F/Z and F/SN are related, but I think most would agree they should each have separate ratings (though their seasons should be combined within each). There's also some even murkier territory, like Madoka. I'd imagine determining whether rebellion should be considered as a part of the original series would be pretty divisive (it would probably be possible to separate things into the movie series and the original TV series here, but there are almost certainly similar cases where there isn't an obvious way out). In general, combining works of the same series will be actually much more difficult than most realize and might inspire significant disagreements (which is probably why MAL has decided to ignore the prospect).

>intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

I see absolutely no evidence for this claim, except for the surprise at the inclusion of these entries.

In fact, over the past year, The Tatami Galaxy has been climbing in a statistically significant way, not falling (I'm slightly annoyed by this fact).
>> ARTICLE
It's the trend for most shows in general but especially 'cult classics'. Sure, Tatami Galaxy might be an exception (though, it's only barely in the category to begin with), but there will always be exceptions and it's a pretty well known concept. People that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it, so they are more likely to end up rating it highly. As a more general audience watches it, it's likely that the average rating will, therefore, fall. Shows with less scores are therefore generally skewed upward a bit. It's the exact reasoning that basically *every* site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their [formula](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime)). 
>> ARTICLE
The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low).

>it's a pretty well known concept

I don't doubt this is the case for *average rating* but I'm not sure this carries over into favorites.  It contradicts my data from last year compared to this one for sure.

EDIT: Wait, I take this back.  It's hard to separate "recency bias" from this "small, cult fanbase" effect.

>It's the exact reasoning that basically every site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their formula). 

No, the reason they *should* rate by popularity is because of regression to the mean, which is formalized quantitatively by stuff like [Wilson scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval).  It's also a way to appease a userbase by pushing popular stuff up higher.  That said, MAL is not a huge offender at all, unlike IMDB, where m is over 10,000.
>> ARTICLE
>The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low). 

As far as MAL's formula goes, I can tell you for sure that the shift does *very significantly* matter. Take 'The Tatami Galaxy' for instance, since we already happen to be talking about it anyway. Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866. I'm sure you can recognize that it's listed score of 8.65 is pretty damn significantly lower. That is exactly the effect described, working as intended.

Regression to the mean isn't exactly the phenomenon I'm describing, anyway (at least in its most general form where it applies to basically all data sets). I'm talking about the phenomenon I described above where "people that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it". This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't. Thus, it stands to reason, that as a show begins to exhaust it's initial base (that is likely to favor it), a greater portion of those that newly view it will have more centered or even negative views on the work. Therefore, the average rating will also become centered over time (and the exact same logic holds for portions of favorites). There will certainly be exceptions to the rule, as The Tatami Galaxy seems to be from your data, but that doesn't mean the logic for the general case doesn't hold.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is an old thread but that's actually incorrect. 8.98 is the average when taking (votes from the stats page)/32,822

The number of votes recorded on the stats page is actually 34,354, making the user average rating ~8.58. However, the problem with both of those numbers is that only voters who have seen at least (#of episodes)/5.2 are included in the v that the MAL formula uses.  

In the case of The Tatami Galaxy this means at least 11/5.2  2.2, or 3 episodes, need to be recorded as being watched before a score is counted. In other words, only 32,822 people who have rated The Tatami Galaxy have actually watched more than 2 episodes.

The formula used on MAL is: Weighted Rank (WR) = (v / (v + m)) * S + (m / (v + m)) * C

* S = Average score for the Anime (mean).
* v = Number of votes for the Anime = (Number of people scoring the Anime).
* m = Minimum votes/scores required to get a calculated score (currently 50 scores required).
* C = The mean score across the entire Anime DB.

Assume for now that we know C. Let's say we want to know how many votes V an anime needs for the formula to have  x impact on its score. Looking at |WR - S|  x we get V = ceiling(m * (|C - S| - x) / x). Since it depends on the score, we can't use it to determine a general minimum voter count. Interestingly, when |C - S|  x we always get |WR - S|  x.

However, a more general minimum voter count can be found by looking at the weighting term m * C / (v + m). We can look at when this term  x, which gives us V = ceiling(m * (C - x) / x).

Now earlier I said to assume we knew C, but that's not true. Because of the minimum votes to count issue, it's incredibly hard to determine C accurately. According to [this thread from 2014](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1294711), C = 6.573, but that may have changed. For the sake of argument I'll look at the worst case scenario (the biggest impact this term could possibly have) by taking C = 10.

If we want the weighting term to be  0.1, we have 50*(10-0.1)/0.1 = 4950, which is pretty low. To have it  0.01 we only need 49950 ratings. We can look at this the other way round, too. The Tatami Galaxy has 32822 ratings, which means this term has an impact of ~0.015 on its score, an incredibly small difference (assuming C = 10, a much larger score than is likely).

If we redo these with C = 6.573, we instead get V = 3237 for it to have an impact of  0.1, and V = 32815 for an impact of  0.01. With these numbers, the impact for The Tatami Galaxy is ~0.0099.
>> ARTICLE
>Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866.

Whoa, I had no idea that MAL was such a bad offender with this.  What is your source on this?

>This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't.

The grounds for saying it be most pronounced with a small number of voters are really weak though.  People will be self-selecting anyway.  I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically.  In this model, you'd see the exact opposite effect--a show will rise as it accumulates more votes, not fall.  Or maybe I have a model where the first people to rate a show will be especially harsh, whereas people who rate afterwards take score cues and feel bad if they're giving a highly rated show low marks.  Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.  Now, if they're most concerned about appeasing people by filling their top chart with popular stuff that people have seen, then their strategy makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE

Yeah, they probably go a bit overboard to say the least.

>I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically.

Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

But what are the backings for those models? I don't have any hard data on the model I proposed (which is why I initially used the word intuitively), but I'd be willing to be hard data would back it up. Why would the people who watch a show while airing be generalists? The idea that people that are interested in the kind of show something sells itself to be while be the majority of those trying it still holds. 

I do agree that people 'seeking out' a show are more likely to like it, but that fits in exactly with the phenomenon I'm describing (more on this below).

>So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.

I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores (particularly since favorites don't even *imply* that a person should be trying to decide critically). As to what the actual goal is, it's hard to specify - maybe something like 'a list ordered by how likely the average viewer is to end up loving a show'. That fits in with the favorite system proposed (and the favorites system would do a better job of it than 1-10 ratings because of the critiques that have already been given about 1-10 ratings, such as variance in rating meanings).

This goal leads directly into why I say those 'seeking out' shows fits with what I'm describing. Take the very concept of a cult classic: a work that is very well liked by a smaller group but generally would not be considered to perform as well with a general, randomized audience. Such a work would have a really small base of voters, but a very high average score. If you were to randomly select people to view and then rate the work, however, the average of those would likely be quite a bit lower (precisely because they are average viewers and not people that would seek the work out). Thus, with our main goal in mind, such shows should be centered toward the mean somewhat in order to account for that.
>> ARTICLE
>But what are the backings for those models?

I was just proposing alternate models.  I have no idea, but I don't think that relying on intuition is actually all that useful here.

>I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores

Only insofar as the margin of error might be higher for binary scores, but this actually is within 1% when N > 1000.

Sure, there's a lot of nuance here as far as what favorites or a rating "means" psychologically.

I've never actually seen any evidence of a "cult premium" that you're describing.  It is a plausible model, sure, but I doubt it's an accurate one.  If anything, people's preferences seem remarkably *regular* in the aggregate (it's rare to find a movie with a significant number of votes where there's a large ratings divergence between men and women in IMDB demographic data, for instance).

Data point 2: https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/icheckmovies+-+most+favorite/

Does this look like a cult film list to you?  Does it look like a film list focused on "entertainment"?  I wouldn't expect either, really.  It doesn't have any of the usual films that are "cult films" (except Aguirre, which is hugely critically acclaimed).  It looks like a critic's list, although a very strange critic who happens to also be into anime, J-dramas, and random movies from all over the world.

Yup, that happens. There's always a vocal fanbase, even more so with media from popular series where some people will go out of their way to favorite and rate everything highly (even if they haven't consumed the media themselves).

JoJo is a fairly popular series with some vocal fans, so even though that manga is something not many people have read, a bunch of people probably favorited it without ever reading it at all.

You can see the effect in my data set as well. When I pulled the data in early January, Kizumonogatari had not yet been released, yet it already had 161 favorites with only 10 scorers, resulting in a 1600% favorited ratio.

This is why I excluded shows with fewer than 1,000 scorers. The more people there are, the less a small fanbase can skew the data.
