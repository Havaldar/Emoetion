THAT FACE IS PERFECT!
>> ARTICLE
I loved the show worth the watch if anyone hasnt taken the time to watch it.  Great cosplay!
>> ARTICLE
What show is it?
>> ARTICLE
Great Teacher Onizuka, often abbreviated as GTO. It's worth reading the manga (the anime's good too, heck the dub has Wendee Lee and Steve Blum, but the animation is quite dated).
>> ARTICLE
There is also two live-action shows (one from the 90's, another one from this year). 
>> ARTICLE
Some people disliked the fistbumps in the 2012 version, but that's like the only considerable bad point bout the live-action show imo. The live action covers stuff from GTO and GTO Shonan Days :3

And the characters look so nice :O
>> ARTICLE
The original live-action series also had a spinoff movie.
>> ARTICLE
GTO needs to be remade or there needs to be an animated version of GTO: shonan 14 days it would be a must watch.
>> ARTICLE
I liked 14 Days in Shonan, but I felt like it was a little too dark compared to GTO.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't finished reading it need to buy the last 2 volumes i think but i didn't think it was that dark, i mean I've seen worse.
>> ARTICLE
It started out as a light hearted comedy, and then all of a sudden it's touching on subjects like child rape.
>> ARTICLE
... Which chapter does that start to appear in i stopped reading it a few month ago so i can't remember all of it.
>> ARTICLE
Either volume 7 or 8.
>> ARTICLE
The 2012 live action actually covers some stuff from shonan days ;)
>> ARTICLE
There's a 2012 version?
>> ARTICLE
Where can i watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Sent you a pm ;))
>> ARTICLE
Me too please.
>> ARTICLE
Does the 2012 live action version cover more of the manga that wasn't in the original anime? The anime stopped at like, volume 14 I think, and there's 25 volumes.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I've seen the live action, but I remember it covering a lot of stories from the manga. Just give it a try ;)

Pm me if you want a link for it :p
>> ARTICLE
Eikichi Onizuka (Great Teacher Onizuka) is the only one worth remembering from the shows I've watched.
>> ARTICLE
Only reason this is not top comment and have the thread closed is because majority of /r/anime is not even born when GTO came out. Get [educated](https://youtu.be/3abL7Z4IXWQ).

Baka to test to shoukanjuu, nothing can be compared to that

Agreed! Both the dub and the sub were hilarious, though the Ghost Stories dub gets a close second place.

This to me is the benchmark of comedy. I have yet to watch an anime that has made me consistently laugh through every episode such as Baka

I didn't even realize Baka was a comedy the first time I watched it. What the h...I want to laugh too.

I have to agree, I'm actually on the last episode of season 1 right now and this show has consistently made me laugh pretty hard, especially that geass reference earlier on. I think the only thing that has come close so far, is actually another show I'm in the middle of -  English dubbed Ghost Stories. This definitely requires a certain type of humor though, but it's making me literally laugh out loud.

Plastic nee-san

[Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2605/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei). This dark, sarcastic, absurd, ridiculous humor caught me off guard, I was watching entire series with tears of joy. Though I understand that the anime is not everyone's cup of tea.

[Arakawa Under the Bridge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7647/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge) is a close second place, and I see it as a more light-hearted version of SZS (humor is pretty much similar in both). 
>> ARTICLE
SZS is hilarious, my favourite moment has to be when Nozomu talks about casual talk or the chain of stalkers.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding SZS, apparently the author told SHAFT how the series is supposed to end. This explains the bizzare  openings for the series. I just read the final chapters of SZS and oh man it gets dark.

Welcome to thr NHK makes me more depressed than happy
>> ARTICLE
Really? As someone who has issues with some similar things, I think it helps me to be able to see the humor in some of the illogical reasoning Sato uses. I also love the lack of any true antagonist, and that each character has their own problems and feels like a person.

IDK maybe it's just because I can relate to Sato. Episode 13 very nearly made me cry. It was kinda stupid,  but again, as someone who has similar issues it felt pretty emotional to me.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie High School is more or less the funniest shit in anime history. That, Golden Boy, and GTO form a sort of classic comedy triumverate.

Girls Bravo is a hysterical parody of the harem genre. Every trope is taken up to eleven. Main character gets punished for accidental perviness with suplexes and extended slapstick routines (which has traumatized him to the point that he's allergic to women). the creepy stalker character literally summons demons to aid in her conquests. And then there's Fukuyama, the richest, perviest "rich, pervy rival" character in anime history. It's good times.

Also, ranma 1/2, the only place where those tropes were actually funny at face value, is pretty great except for the entirety of the fourth and fifth seasons.

Welcome to the NHK doesn't have the most laughs, but it has some of the deepest and darkest.

pet girl of sakurasou had me in stitches.

Midori days is pretty damn amazing. also has the best bloopers.

and as far as short anime go, Senyu is just the funniest.

And Madoka, but that's just because the series was a joke.  ;)

NouKome I think although I haven't seen most of the series mentioned here.

Same, the fucking pool episode had me in tears the whole time.

Overall not the funniest show, but the first episode of Kore wa Zombie Desu ka made me laugh harder than maybe anything ever.
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test. Holy shit, that show made me piss my pants.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was nichijou. All seem faces. all dem stunts. All dem laughs.
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.

>> ARTICLE
Seitokai Yakuindomo for me. It is hilarious
>> ARTICLE
The top 3 funniest shows I've seen are [Seto no Hanayome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2104/Seto_no_Hanayome), [D-Frag!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20031/D-Frag!) and [NouCome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19221/Ore_no_Nounai_Sentakushi_ga_Gakuen_Love_Comedy_wo_Zenryoku_de_Jama_Shiteiru). The first 2 episodes of Seto no Hanayome among some of the funniest things I've ever seen.

Despite not being a full fledged comedy like the shows mentioned above, [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time) had a [couple of moments which left me in tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTzoMGAN8JE), no spoilers involved.

Honorable mentions to [Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8841/Kore_wa_Zombie_Desu_ka) and [Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10456/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon) as well.

Ben-to, wow what a great anime, i never watch stuff like that and just by a coincidence i started watching it and it was hilarious. The way they took so serious such a dumb premise couldn't be better
>> ARTICLE
Binbougami ga! and Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu are the two funniest animes I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi. The first half of that series when it was straight up slapstick/paraody made me laugh so hard I thought I was gonna throw up. 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing compares to Baka to test for me

Runners ups would be School Rumble and Hataraku Maou-sama
>> ARTICLE
Trigun - Mainly the first few episodes. Rarely does an English dub make me "lol", but there was plenty during the course of this show. 


>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk and GTO as well.
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai Yakuindomo - how come noone posted it yet O.o
>> ARTICLE
Im on episode 21 of GTO right now, one of those shows where the outdated animation doesnt even matter because it's funny as fuck

Yakitate Japan! was pretty funny.
Golden boy was more inspirational for me than funny somehow.

>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san and Nichijou for me. Always. Yuuko's freakout at the coffee shop from Episode 16 will always be hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Recent: Senyuu and D-Frag.
Older: Sexy Commando and FMP:Fumoffu
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari, i have never seen series that have made me laugh so much
>> ARTICLE
Nisemonogatari. The writing and direction had me laughing every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san, Nichijou, and more recently Joshiraku did it the most for me.
I haven't finished Joshiraku yet, so that one's quickly rising up the ladder for most funny.
>> ARTICLE
Joshiraku is amazing. The only thing that doesn't always work is that they do a lot of references to Japanese things and places.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt many will agree with me here, but Lucky Star has added millenniums to my lifetime. I still go back and watch my favorite scenes; it's so funny. Also, you should have a pretty good knowledge of anime or else you'll miss a lot of great references and parodies. Konata FTW! 
>> ARTICLE
Hataraku Maou-Sama is probably one of the funniest, heart-warming stories I have seen in awhile.
>> ARTICLE
Haiyore! Nyaruko San, and Hagani are my two favorite comedy anime. Both made me laugh multiple times each episode. 

*Cyclone!*
>> ARTICLE
Gintama, not only out of all anime I've seen, but out of all TV series and films I've seen as well. 

One of the most hilarious episodes for me was [episode 152](http://www.crunchyroll.com/gintama/episode-152-the-heavens-created-chonmage-above-man-instead-of-another-man-524632), the scene were [] (/s "Gintoki desperately pulls the Shogun's hair in an attempt to try to fix it back to how it used to be made me laugh so hard because of the facial expression the Shogun made.") I watched the episode during the night so I tried resisting laughing out loud, but I failed multiple times, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard and for so long in my life. 
>> ARTICLE
Slayers and it's sequels had me literally ROFLing.
>> ARTICLE
Came here to say Haganai and its sequel Haganai NEXT, which is even stronger.
>> ARTICLE
From the preview I wasn't expecting as much rape or gay robot sex from the series.
>> ARTICLE
Carnival Phantasm

Chobits comes to a close second
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High school Host Club! Ahhh I'll go re-watch that now.
>> ARTICLE
Kimi ni Todoke made me laugh the hardest even though its not particularly funny... I think One Piece has made me laugh the most though just because of the amount of eps...
>> ARTICLE
I think that some of those laughs were reflexive. At least for me, they were there to shock me out of my tears and give me some significant emotional swings from sobbing in shock to laughing my ass off and Pin paused mid-inanity in 30 seconds flat.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran highschool host club for me

Nichijou, I don't think I've laughed so much watching an anime. The randomness was too much for my laugh box.

Luffy is just hilarious.  
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite moment of his would have to be on Thriller Bark when he [pushes a zombie who has emerged from his grave back down into it](http://youtu.be/OXX--SaCfq8)
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Thriller bark. I didn't notice that part. For me the funniest part was when Luffy tries to train the three faced fox. Also, the armored Luffy was pretty hilarious too. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you had to have seen it. Thriller Bark is probably the most comedic of all the arcs if I had to say. The end of Usopp v Perona was also one of the funniest fucking things I've seen. God damn Oda is gifted with making up plotlines. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, it is the funniest arc I've seen so far. I laughed my ass off watching that video. Thanks for sharing.

Really gonna have to be Seto no Hanayome for me. The endless slapstick comedy and whacky characters never made a boring moment for me.
>> ARTICLE
This season ''Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou'' is really funny.

''Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to The Animation'' is also great, but it's more pervy, really ecchi and the episodes are only 11mins long, but it's really funny.

Daily lives of High School Boys and Cromartie Highschool

on DLoHSB I literally dropped of my chair, still laughing :D
>> ARTICLE
The one show that has pretty much sent me into several uncontrolled fits of laughter would be Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashia/Humanity has Declined, though it's not really a 'typical' comedy.

Nichijou is also well-executed, though it can take a few episodes for one to really get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Golden Boy
>> ARTICLE
No one can forget about Full Metal Panic Fumoffu !
>> ARTICLE
This is a weird one. I got some strange fansubs (with swearing!) for Kampfer and it resulted in me being in a constant state of laughter.

More recently though Nisekoi has a habit of bringing out the laughs. Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to is also a constant hoot.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie was pretty funny.
FMP fumoffu was my first comedy anime and was funny too
GTO was hilarious when it got weird
Gurren lagann episode 6... seriously Laughed so hard..
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to choose, so I'll list several, in no particular order:

* **Teekyuu**: the fastest one

* **Cromartie High School**: a sweet spot of bizarreness and hilarity

* **Seto no Hanayome**: lots of great random humour

* **Plastic Nee-san**: this show is [pure *wat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6A2WhUcNec)
>> ARTICLE
The ones that made me laugh most were either [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!) or [Chuunibyou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!). Hower I'm currently watching Steins; Gate and Okabe... hrmm HOUOUIN KYOUMA always puts a smile on my face
>> ARTICLE
For me it was defiantly Bobobo, that shits gotta be my favorite comedy to date.
>> ARTICLE
Seto no Hanayome. I just can't stop rewatching it and laughing.
>> ARTICLE
After this episode 15? Nisekoi for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test.  That entire class his hilarious
>> ARTICLE
School rumble
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-San

>> ARTICLE
Other than Baka and Test and Binbougami ga, i'd have to say Oh! Edo Rocket.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Watamote. I can relate to that anime so well and its legit funny.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Angel Beats, the scene with the chairs flying xd
>> ARTICLE
The first half of steins gate made me grin from side to side while watching it.

Then the second half made me cry , a lot.

Cowboy bebop had a few funny episodes , i liked mushroom samba a lot 
Ed is funny dude

School Rumble - One of the first anime I ever watched from beginning to end and god damn what an anime it was

Nichiboys and nichijou, can't do better than those.

Baka Test
>> ARTICLE
Baka to Test and Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched a lot of comedies, but the only series that has managed to make me laugh every episode was Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, very funny, but also very sad. I didn't count how many times I have cried watching this.

Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan is also very funny, but this is braindead ecchi humour with no plot and only wants to make you laugh (which it succeeds in).
>> ARTICLE
Baka to test is by far the funniest anime I have watched. Some scenes are depicted really retardedly you have to laugh. 
>> ARTICLE
Detroit Metal City. He asked for a single one, and DMC made me laugh the most.
>> ARTICLE
Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Toradora had a bunch of great moments too. 
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou
>> ARTICLE
I unfortunately have not seen Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, or Nichijou yet, so I can't comment on those.

Joshiraku is the most recent comedic anime I watched, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would say aspects of Kill la Kill were pretty humorous too (all of Mako's speeches).

I've seen lots of amazing GIFs of Plastic nee-san, so once I find a sub I'll probably end up watching that.
>> ARTICLE
GTO, Yakitate Japan, Gintama, Nichijou in no particular order!
>> ARTICLE
For me it has to be BakaTest
>> ARTICLE
For me, the king of comedies is none other than **Baka and Test**.

Holy mother of god I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. The dub is also one of the best English dubs to come out of Funimation imo.

Some clips

* [Lets play water devil!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoNxbSRWdaM)

* [King's Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_8FQchC9B0)

* [All the guys compete in the Miss Yukata contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ormk-scTmNc)

Another one of note is **My Bride is a Mermaid**. There wasn't an episode where I wasn't nearly in tears laughing.

* [First date!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj4bQXhlS5I)

* [Moe gangsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfLlm63pqEM)

* [Implied yuri!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVdYAUAlemY)


Other than that, I'd have to say **D-Frag**, **Noucome**, and **Oreimo** had me bursting in laughter all the time.
>> ARTICLE
My faves for laughs are FLCL, B Gata H Kei, Sakura Trick, and the Persona 4 anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Beelzebub is really funny
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna have to say English dubbed Ghost Stories, and Baka to Test.
>> ARTICLE
I only just finished the third episode but Jinrui had me in stitches at some points
>> ARTICLE
Binbougami ga! made me taste death with laughter at times.
>> ARTICLE
Cromartie high school anyone?

Noucome, Daily Lives of Highschoolboys, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, and Baka to Test.

Yeah, Plastic Nee-San. It's so short, but it has so much actually funny insanity crammed into it.

Chuunibyou because it was so embarrassing I started laughing (embarrassing as in digging into parts of my buried memories).

Hajime no Ippo. Especially on the 45th episode.

I haven't watched many 'comedies' but Skip Beat made me laugh so hard. Kyoko's evil laugh every time. XD
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate. It's not often that I'll genuinely bust out into laughter when I'm watching something alone. We all know what it's like - it's easier to get into a comedic mindset when you're enjoying a piece of work with someone else. But Steins;gate just had me losing my shit solo over Okabe's antics early in. The crowning moment was the famous "I am mad scientist - it's SO COOL!" we all know and love.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the jokes during Clannad got the most hard laughter out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Don't really know why you're being downvoted, Clannad had some downright hilarious moments.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, though it also had some pretty sad moments so no surprise if some people feel touchy hearing about it as funny.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-san was already said and it was so short so I will say Non Non Biyori. I frequently found myself laughing out loud at this when I watched this on a long car ride recently. Maybe it's just because I have soft spot Ren-chon but this show really cracked me up. "Didn't you own a mountain in Tokyo, Hotaru?"
>> ARTICLE
Either Oreimo, or Bobobobo back when i was 10.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is the winner for the most quality laughs. I found it a lot funnier than most "pure comedy" shows.
>> ARTICLE
**Danshi Koukousei to Nichijou**, **Clannad: After Story** & **Noucome** were series that made me laugh really hard
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, inspirational, and hilarious. It also has one of those rare things where a show is 4/4 in having great OPs and EDs. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it is absolutely fantastic. It was the first anime to give me post-anime depression so I gave it a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
read it you will like it more
>> ARTICLE
Good shit, but the manga is better.

I know the creepy-comedy thing is not to everyone's tastes, but I like it a lot. I haven't seen any anime nail it like GTO. There are a few manga that come to mind, but GTO is amazing at it.
>> ARTICLE
I love the anime, I have the manga but I haven't read it yet. What makes the manga "better" ?
>> ARTICLE
I usually like a manga better than the anime, but GTO is one of the few were the anime is better imo. Not to say the manga is bad because it is amazing, if anything you could say its better because there is so much more content.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is a 10

Manga is a 10
>> ARTICLE
I break the dvds out at least twice a year and marathon it. GTO is glorious.
>> ARTICLE
My wife and I are watching it. I'm really enjoying it. My wife isn't an anime fan, but she likes it enough to watch it with me.
>> ARTICLE
imo, manga is better, but the anime isn't bad
>> ARTICLE
Manga is G for great.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I guess I will have to start reading the Manga everyone says it is better. Oh and another question how far does the manga go past the ending of the Anime?
>> ARTICLE
To determine what /r/anime thinks of anything, go to MyAnimeList and find the score.

GTO looks to be an 8.82, which means /r/anime likes it.
>> ARTICLE
MAL is a pretty god awful indicator of quality of shows based on ratings among having one of the worst forums on the internet, I mean jesus look at how highly rated crap like SAO is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah not true. Lots of overhyped shounen aren't well-received here. Lots of  niche shows (e.g. Nodame Cantabile, awesome for classical music fans) have high ratings on MAL but aren't hyped much here.

Of course there's a correlation of quality and MAL rating, though of course exceptions exists.

Right, I forgot to factor in what's cool to hate to my formula. My entire point is ruined.

No most of those shows are well known for being riddled with plot issues particularly stuff like SAO or Naruto so any criticism by the community shouldnt simply be washed off as "cool to hate"

DEEN has made some good shows. They did Maison Ikkoku, Fruits Basket, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?, Higurashi, Ranma 1/2, R.O.D. OVA and TV series, some Rurouni Kenshin, Seitokai no Ichizon, 	
and Shion no Ou.

The animation work on R.O.D. was pretty good, especially when you consider that there's a lot of paper flying around.

-Tons of f\*\*king monologue scenes  
-Remove all emotional development and goals  
-Never explain why people are able to do what they do, they just do things  
-Appears to be animated without the use of hands  
-Producer's children do the voice acting  
-Add loud, high-pitched sound effects wherever possible  
-Fights are comparisons of basic strength, and strategy does not exist.   
-Everyone yells out attack names, often before actually attacking.   
-The last one includes sneak attacks.  
-Spirograph romance where the man *flips shit* if he accidentally sees part of a boob.  
-MC makes whiny noises all the time and can't decide about f\*\*king *anything*.  
-Blatant abuse of a particular word or phrase. Maybe "onii-sama" or "No sempai, this is our fight!".  
-THAT STUPID GODDAMN MASCOT CHARACTER WITH THE SQUEAKY VOICE AND ANNOYING PERSONALITY. It would be EVERYWHERE.

It had terrible sales, so it's incredibly unlikely.

Out of curiosity, how much it sold?

The sales for volume 6 looks I think is 388 as I can't find any numbers on weeks past the first week. The first volume was over 500, but it's pretty terrible. In contrast, in the same week the final volume of Rail Wars sold 1782.

Wow, that's crap-level of sales.

I thought the numbers were going to be low, but not THAT low.

P.A works must have lost a lot of money with glasslip.

Which they basically made back with Shirobako.

Still, it may be P.A works worst anime, speaking of sales. I wonder if they will use it as a reference of what NOT to do when working in future shows.

The unfortunate thing is that I was looking forward to it before Glasslip started. I thought that an anime about glassblowing would be interesting, but glassblowing was basically non-existent in the series.

10/100. I haven't been an anime fan for that long, plus I'm busy with college, so I think that's pretty good

Ive completed 27, and if you include shows that I have read the manga instead, or watched but drop / didnt finish because I decided to read the manga, 34.

I've seen 67, and I've still yet to get to Bebop, Beck, and Death Note (although I read the manga once upon a time, so I have no real motivation to go watch Death Note at the moment).  Kyoukai No Kanata movie is on my radar as well, even though I wasn't too impressed by the series itself.  

Its nice to see my favorite (Kino's Journey) make the list though.

I need to get around to watching Death Note. I've just heard so much about the second half ...it's hard not wanting to get invested.

Also, I'm still surprised people like Shigatsu/Your Lie In April so much. I mean I enjoyed it, but wouldn't think of it as #10 (in this list).
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Death Note yesterday actually and I can see why people enjoy the first half more but the second half is still really thrilling! 

Yeah same! I guess people really like their feels anime

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
yes. not watching bebop is a crime
>> ARTICLE
It's a crime Bebop isn't in the top 10 :(
>> ARTICLE
Bebop is too overrated and too overhyped
>> ARTICLE
its just not your taste, but im sure like 80% of people here think differently as you.
>> ARTICLE
My statement may be incorrect. Let's say that i wouldn't recommend it as a first anime to someone.
>> ARTICLE
How come? I'm curious. Especially since you gave it a 9.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Ooo boy, you're missing out.

Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Le 8.3 average rating, what a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, why did you rate Death Note a 10 if you dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

So apparently some* people think OPM is bad now. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZAfVGax.gifv

Edit: No this is not about the people who think it isn't top 10. There's a lot of anime out there so odds are there are 10 other shows you enjoyed more.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but there's also a reason why the current top 10 were loved. Besides, they're always be people who just like to shit on anything main stream. It's really good but still over hyped.
>> ARTICLE
> There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.

Who gets to decide what's top 10 material though? Wouldn't it be the collection of MAL user scores rather than just a couple of people who don't think it's top 10 material?

Oh fuck the specials are at 429. I was just making fun of the person I replied to for ridiculing the list.

It's just my opinion that the show doesn't deserve as much praise as it is given and definitely not to be the seventh best anime of all time. Would still put it in my top 40 or something.  
But hey, your opinion is different - that's fine too. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it should be seventh either but I'm not surprised about it. People like it because it's funny and easy to get into and they're gonna give it 10s and 9s. Nothing to be surprised about.

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.

I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

Edit: Got rid of an extra word word.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

I would like so much a list of these but only counting TV Series with 12 episodes or more. (Not counting, specials, movies, etc)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???
>> ARTICLE
What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.

from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?

Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off
>> ARTICLE
In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.

47/100
i need to watch more high rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haikyuu at 12

I've seen like 10 of those, lmao. I've got only about other 15 on my PTW too. TIL I'm an anime hipster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...

Recency bias :D.  And demographic bias ...

How is angel beats a rip off or Haibane renmei? They are completely diffirent and the only thing they have in common is a story being about dead people.

5 dropped.

in the end it just comes down to taste :/

It would be a whole lot simplier to sort through my list of 4 different fate seasons/films/OVAs or whatever, not to mention you don't miss an OVA or film when you were looking for an series to watch because you didn't see the others adaptions/sequels tab in the info page.

for the curious, check out legend of the galactic heroes. it's a very good scifi anime. it's dialogue heavy with a lot of political intrigue, but there's enough action to satisfy. if i were to compare it to a live action show, i'd say it's like a grittier battlestar galactica.

"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

There is a clear(and unsurprising to me) recency bias. It also seems several genres are more in the list than others, i.e. shonen, romance, supernatural and action, whereas harem seems underpresented(Monogatari and Ouran?). Theres also a distinct lack of cute girls doing cute things - anime

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

What about those school festivals when the main character's class always does a maid cafe or a haunted house. Where the hell do they get the facilities, materials, and girls willing to dress as maids, cook enough food, and serve it as a maid cafe? 
>> ARTICLE
Watch [Episode 4 of the first Season of Culture Japan (free on CR)](http://www.crunchyroll.com/media-574032/culture-japan-4), the host visits one such festival.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like an interesting show. I may have to check it out at some point.
>> ARTICLE
It's entertaining and shows some interesting things. It has a focus on the otaku crowd though, so you'll see things like "Figurine Top 10" for the current week and tons of other things for otaku (for example, they visit an *itasha* - cars with an anime paintjob - competition during one of the episodes).

The host seems to also love being an otaku, and carries around a figurine/doll of a girl with him a lot of times - when he visits the school festival he dresses up as a Stormtrooper for basically no reason. Not that I'm complaining, I enjoy the show, it's just something to keep in mind - you'll learn mostly about stuff the otaku crowd would enjoy, not necessarily what an average japanese person might.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as you mentioned Stormtrooper, I thought the host might be Danny Choo. [He's hosted a popular blog](http://www.dannychoo.com/) for quite a while now that focuses on various points of Japanese culture. His dance outings dressed as a Stormtrooper and his love of anime have been quite heavily showcased in his past posts. His office is also quite decorated with various figurines.

In Japan, it is very common for schools to have "Cultural Festivals" or "Bunkasai".
Where they prepare activities and services as classes or in their clubs. I've been to one or two of my cousin's years ago, and most anime represent them pretty well. There are cafes and places to eat as well as bands performing just like anime.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how many Japanese high schools have maid cafes and haunted houses (don't forget the occasional dramatic stage production with medieval romance themes) during those school festivals, and what else all the other classes in the school are doing. They can't all be takoyaki stands. 
>> ARTICLE
When I studied abroad at a Japanese university, there was a haunted house at the school festival. There were also several cafes, but unfortunately none of the maid variety.
>> ARTICLE
Usually, there is a budget for each class given by the school. You use that to get whatever materials you need, from ingredients to clothes. Clubs would usually get their own budget, albeit lower (you see why students are always fighting for money and budget increases?). Drama club would perform, photography club would have a gallery, etc.

- Facilities: You usually use your classroom, or the room used for your club activities.

- Materials: From budget or from personal stuff (this is why sometimes you see characters rejoicing because a classmate can bring their own costumes for use, therefore not having to spend money from the budget).

- Willingness: It's a class project. The amount of money you make during the festival can be used for your class in the future.

It's similar to how high schoolers here fundraise so that they can lower their prom ticket prices, and stuff like that. Obviously, as always, the festival is blown out of proportion, but it is certainly a festival. A lot of people come, and a lot of money is made. It's not that extravagant, but still. You don't want to double up with another class, because profit would be split.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say from a completely foreign perspective (Belgium).

School festivals arent all that odd to me. We had one every year up till 6th grade lower education (12 year old) and then one every 2 years up till 6th grade middle school (18yo).

The goals were similar (get some funds for school work/projects etc) but there is no such aspect as clubs, for the school festival ad-hoc groups would be formed with similar interests in doing something, often lead by a teacher.

For example one school festival I and the rest of the class that did latin/greek made a horse of troy exhibit with rather nice horse (could house 5 people) but next year I worked on something which the math teacher organized, so a complcetely different group of people.
>> ARTICLE
As with any country or place, there are examples of real severe bullying, with some instances turning out [really bad](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/07/kids-and-laughing-teachers-bullied-suicide-teen/). Japan, and I can say this because I'm Japanese, is a society where if one thing becomes popular, **everyone** does it. It's a very conformist society. If it can happen with clothes, it can certainly happen with bullying.

Obviously, these manga and anime fantasize these situations, turn them into good stories, and blow them out of proportions. But they do bear some truths. There are hierarchies in Japan, more extreme than in America. I wouldn't be surprised if there are secret fan clubs (although that *does* seem a bit too far) for a certain being.

Most times, these tropes exist to set the character. It's just a way to explain to the audience what kind of character he/she is. But no doubt there are school princesses and princes. I don't know if that answers anything...but yea.
>> ARTICLE
In just about anywhere else, the window office is desirable.  In most offices in Japan, if you have an outer office, you are an undesirable and not part of the work clique.  The closer you are in the inner cloisters, means you are liked and part of the social circle.  This is why you'll see on animes or tv shows people, after work, going to eat yakiniku, karaoke, or get drinks with the manager despite having strong reservations against it.

Also should be noted that a lot of times, the person at the window office is a woman :(
>> ARTICLE
Is this why loner anime protagonists have window seats?
>> ARTICLE
In schools?  yes pretty much.  Notice all of the social interactions are usually away from the windows?  Usually those loner types are looking out the windows because they would rater be elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
nope, the protagonist almost always sits in the back window seat because this is easiest to animate, you don't have to draw the rest of the class
>> ARTICLE
Plus they can then stare out the window instead of focusing on the class (which, again, would involve more drawing and voicing).
>> ARTICLE
I'm not going to argue Japan being a conformist society (who would?), but especially among the youth there is a strong desire to rebel and be different. Sometimes this rebellion is heavily commercialized and becomes "main stream" (but this happens in the US as well). 

Having taught in both the US and Japan I see very similar problems with bullying, popular kids, etc. Anime definitely blows things out of proportion but so does US T.V. shows about high school for example. There is always a kernel of truth in these events however. It's also important to remember here that I saw things from the teacher perspective and an actual student might have more input.
>> ARTICLE
I went to public schools in America, and my reaction to the level of bullying seen in some anime is always "that's just insane, why isn't anyone doing anything!"

Exaggeration is one thing, but the incidents that become public and make the news here are sunny by comparison to some of the bullying that happens in anime. The GTO scenes I was referencing... yeah. I had nightmares about that crap. 
>> ARTICLE
Bullying IS a large problem over there. Nobody is supposed to rock the boat, and teachers don't want to have to explain problems/problem-children, so they look the other way. I've even heard it said that the police get promoted based upon a points system tied to "positively resolved cases" -- so they don't want to take on bullying cases, because there is rarely a good result out of them.
>> ARTICLE
It probably depends on when you went to school, I'm 35 and went to American schools too but bullying was pretty intense and most people just turned a blind eye towards it. 

If it's the same in Japan as the US where bullying has become less acceptable it could just be the older authors and mangaka writing about their experiences in school 15+ years ago that don't really seem believable now. 
>> ARTICLE
For an idea of how much conservative social forces try to not talk about bullying - Kodansha was sued by a right-wing group that tried to stop them from ever printing any more copies of Koe no Katachi.  KnK was an award-winning one-shot about a boy who became the ringleader in the bullying of a deaf girl in his class that the other kids resented for needing extra help.  The story is really obviously not in favor of bullying, and a legal defense fund for the physically disabled joined Kodansha in defending themselves from the lawsuit, and won.  Apparently the first issue of the manga ended up selling 200,000 copies, which further speaks to bullying's current hot-button status in Japan.

The Diet passed anti-bullying legislation in 2012 in response to a highly-publicized suicide by a bullied student, the bill was aimed at increasing reporting of incidents.  Anonymous polling has also showed a pretty huge rate of bullying: The National Institute for Educational Policy Research polled 712 graduating junior high students and only 29% of them said they had never been bullied, and 28% said they had never bullied others.
>> ARTICLE
Again, it's a far more conformist society than in America. Of course there's bullying everywhere in the world, but people are less likely to act up in Japan than in America. I don't want to say "more accepted" but it's less likely that kids or even parents would speak up. A parent here would sue the school. In Japan, it's not as likely. It's why there's such a high population of [hikikomori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) kids in Japan compared to any other place in the world. This is their way of running away from their problems, and their parents sort of accept that.

Japan is just...a very conformist, yet very detached society. It's hard to explain it. Obviously, not all, but you get what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
> It's why there's such a high population of hikikomori kids in Japan compared to any other place in the world. This is their way of running away from their problems, and their parents sort of accept that.

The parents are the other side of things - from what I know, they feel like it's their obligation to protect their kids no matter what, so rather than encouraging them to confront their problems, they sort of enable them to stay shut-ins.
>> ARTICLE
>but people are less likely to act up in Japan than in America

Some things I've read about bullying in Japan were really upsetting... I don't hear about bullying THAT much in France, and when I do, it doesn't sound as atrocious as what could happen in Japan... I mean, just the shoe lockers. It's fucking insane. Even this can be used as a way to bully someone else. Drop a tack or two in each shoe and watch the poor dude have his feet bleeding... The little fuckers are so imaginative to come up with new toture methods that it becomes scary... And that article you linked... Even the teachers. EVEN THEM. Goddammit...

I don't really keep an eye on this subject, whether it be in Japan or where I live or anywhere else in the world so I don't know what's the current situation, but what I've read about bullying in Japan is terrifying... They even had a freaking survey on Nico Nico Douga for a time because of a case of bullying!...

I had a friend in Kyoto who let me stay with their family for three weeks. They had two houses on the same plot of land. One owned by the grandparents and another built by the parents. 

The room was dedicated to the grandma. Sadly the grandfather died roughly a year after I left. He was a nice man. Despite being senile he was very welcoming and let me stay in his home. Bought me peaches as well.

I was very lucky to have stayed there. The grandparents' house was quite traditional. Sliding doors, tatami floors, narrow corridors etc. The parents' house was very modern/western. All wood flooring, hinged doors, beds, open plan hall/kitchen/living area etc. 

Out front they had a small but well kept garden. Apart from how lavish their lifestyle seemed what really surprised me is how they fit two houses and a garden in such a small space.

It's called Kamidana : http://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%E7%A5%9E%E6%A3%9A&tbm=isch

I think fewer and fewer houses have them as people are getting more secular.  For the average Japanese living in cities, I guess it's a thing they don't have in their own apartment, but their parents and relatives in the country still have.

ETA: Come to think of it, I should have mentioned Butsudan : https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%E4%BB%8F%E5%A3%87&tbm=isch

This is the one that is associated with the dead in the Buddhist tradition.  Kamidana is more like a general shrine in the Shito tradition and isn't necessarily associated with the dead.

Butsudan is generally placed on the floor.  Kamidana is on the wall, preferable near the ceiling.

>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty common trope throughout young adult fiction, from any country.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't just a Japanese storytelling device though.  There's a reason so many heroes are also orphans.  Part of the reason is so they have a greater sense of personal agency and accountability.  If there was a parent around, they would turn to the parent for help instead of making a decision on their own, (This is also why the Mentor figure usually becomes unavailable after a while into a quest. Think Obi-wan or Gandalf. ) or perhaps the parent will prevent them from going on the more dangerous parts of their quest for fear of their child's personal safety.

That there are just insanely rich kids who can take their friends to mansions over the summer and shit. Apparently this is true.

For the school "prince/princess" thing, I think I can say that I've definitely  noticed a few cases of that in Japan. I went there on a 3-week exchange program, and in the school I was with, the girls were always talking and swooning about this one particular guy, and kept asking me if I thought he was cute. Didn't notice a princess but I wasn't there long enough to find out.
However, that's not necessarily a Japanese thing. Certainly it's exaggerated a bit more in Japan, but it happens in Western countries too. *cough cough* *Meangirls*
>> ARTICLE
Bullying isn't funny, like Mean Girls, it's an atrocity, like Mean Girls 2.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the "fanclub" dynamics are more WTF-ey than the school prince/princess. By itself, that's just a matter of a particular kid being extra popular.

But if a dozen kids form kind of a club devoted to following that person around and swooning like they're a rockstar, and occasionally gang-beating non-members who seem to be getting friendly with the fan club's object of affection... well, that's creepy. 
>> ARTICLE
Having taught at Japanese high schools and middle schools I would say it is on par with what we think of in the US as the "popular kids". With the occasional girl/guy combining aspects such as beauty/brains/family status (wealth)/etc. that people undeniably see them as the best at everything.

In my admittedly brief experiences, I concur. Additionally, there is also a difference between the length when the girls are in school and when they are not in school.

Hi I'm a Japanese and I'm sorry for my broken English in advance.


Actually when I was in school some girls were doing fan club within the school thingy.


However I didn't see male students doing fan club thing tho.


I went to all girls high school and I was so surprised that some girls were doing fan club thing within all girls school, too.

Things I wonder about:

* Panties? Is it such a huge deal?

* Is incest really such a big thing for japanese people? It's pretty much everywhere in anime/manga. If you happen to browse over a list of mature or hentai anime/manga 90% will have incest as a key word.

>> ARTICLE
The number of anime with incest as a central theme in the last few years is too damn high.
>> ARTICLE
low*
>> ARTICLE
I read a great article about this a while back, but I can't find it right now.  The explanation was that until recently (the last 60 yrs or so) most Japanese lived in smaller villages that considered themselves a "family" even though they weren't necessarily blood related.  So marrying your "sister" was really marrying a girl you were raised with that you thought of as your sister and who had been treated as your sister but wasn't actually your blood sibling.  She might have been your 1st cousin, but not a sibling.
>> ARTICLE
Well, about the incest.
From what I have observed, it is generally the people without siblings that are actually brocons/siscons. And with the declining birthrates in Japan, only-children are getting more and more common, and probably with a desire to want a sibling, they sorta become interested in Incest.

The other people who replied to you about this also make points.
>> ARTICLE
I think this is a bit different than the whole bullying thing, but it still is all fantasizing.

- What boy *isn't* interested in girls' underwear? And girls want to look cute to impress boys, too.

- Siblings in Japan are much more detached from each other than in American families. It's really true that some siblings don't even talk to or even acknowledge each other. People like to fantasize what would happen if their sisters were cute and friendly, and just as Americans like to fantasize about relationships with teachers, MILFs, and bosses, the same with incest in Japan.

People like to create works so that they can fantasize what they don't have in real life. Situations like harem and powers, and what not. A lot of things are affected by Japanese culture. I can ask you: "Why are Americans so hesitant to enter hot springs naked? Is it that big of a deal?" And you would have your reasons. I'm guessing incest is just a Japanese thing, just as how some things are a big deal in American culture.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone has answered about the incest, but the panties thing is legit, but a little blown out of proportion. They have stores and vending machines where you can buy used panties. The containers have pictures of the girl who wore them. It's very... interesting.

People do buy them, but it's something I'll never understand.
>> ARTICLE
* Panties

Yes.

* Incest

I'm actually not into anime/manga so I might be totally wrong on this, but I feel like incest is usually just a small category in any Japanese database-like websites, both for anime and live action videos.  So, if 90% is incest-related as you say,  I suspect that this is the bias on the part of the non-Japanese fans.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm actually not into anime/manga

Then why on earth are you in /r/anime?
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes I browse gaming subreddits that I myself and interested in, but I can't speak for Ywja.

Because I like to read discussions here.  And I now know that I can contribute to some of them, like confirming that panties fetish is real.
>> ARTICLE
It interests me that you don't watch anime, but still enjoy anime discussion. What interests you about the discussion? I actually didn't watch too much anime until I started coming here. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a Japanese therefore I've been exposed to certain amount of manga/anime.  I've found several works I like, but I'm really not into the whole field.

It's interesting to me that people from foreign cultures are interested in these Japanese things I wasn't able to like.  And I'm interested in what they have to say about the media, individual titles, and the underlying culture.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. I definitely believe that no matter who you are there is at least one anime that you'll really enjoy. So if you keep hanging around, keep an eye out for one that interests you. Who knows, you may start enjoying more of them.

As an American, anime is a bridge to a culture that I would know nothing about if not for me watching it. Anything Japanese interests me, whether it be the food, the writing system, the buildings (definitely the buildings), whatever. 

I've never thought about it going the other way around. Probably because I find American stuff pretty boring. We don't really have an equivalent to anime here...
>> ARTICLE
I myself  do not find anime interesting just because it's anime. I find it to be a complete media that has a lot of good series, so I enjoy it just as much as movies, music, video games, series etc. So I don't really call myself an anime fan at all. 

But I think doujins have a lot more character to them than other similar media in other parts of the world.
>> ARTICLE
I asked my roommate about these things since he's from Japan.

Anyways, I have no clue about the panty thing since he's not an otaku (he plays basketball, so he really isn't into that kind of stuff).  As for the incest thing, while it is true that siblings are often a bit more detached if they are of different genders due to the fact that Japan still keeps a social and gender hierarchy, you're about to find incest is as likely as in Japan as it is in any educated part of the USA.  It's heavily frowned upon just as much as it is anywhere else.  Any manga or anime (i.e. Oreimo) play upon some hidden fetishes that either the author or the reader already had.  So to answer your question, no, incest is not socially acceptable.  I believe that Japan even had a law to outlaw it recently.
>> ARTICLE
> as it is in any *educated* part of the USA

heh.
>> ARTICLE
>Anyways, I have no clue about the panty thing since he's not an otaku (he plays basketball, so he really isn't into that kind of stuff). 

The panty thing is **not** an otaku thing.  It didn't even originated in the anime/manga culture.  The single biggest influence on the contemporary fetish was Marilyn Monroe's famous skirt scene in The Seven Year Itch:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qemKO5lg5lA

I wouldn't say it was the 'origin' because it's controversial, but it had a big impact on the Japanese mind.  Harenchi Gakuen was built on this legacy.
>> ARTICLE
Let's look at the panties thing. 

There have been plenty of movies in the US (especially in the 70-80s) where guys sneak in the a girls dorm and steal panties or peak in on the girls shower room. Not too different from Japan. Also, you can go online and buy girls used panties and even at some adult stores in the US as well. 

My hypothesis is that Japan isn't too different but because they are heavily technology driven you get panties in vending machines. It's important to remember they have everything in vending machines and vending machines everywhere! Outside in the middle of a 4000 population town you will find a couple dozen vending machines. So Tokyo having panty vending machines (it's not like you can find them anywhere) doesn't surprise me.

Edit: *Have lived in Japan
>> ARTICLE
Dude. You have a bunch of redditors selling their own panties on here too.

Exactly, but people always bring up the vending machines. So I wanted to address that.
>> ARTICLE
If by incest you mean cousin relationships then yes it is more culturally acceptable although still not particularly common. Any other kind of incest is about as socially acceptable as anywhere else in the world, which is to say it isn't.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of brother/sister complex stuff as well as the first cousin stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
My theory about the sibling incest shows is that the creators are all single children, they never had to grow up with a sibling, so it seems romantic to them. Japan generally has a higher incidence of single-child families, so this is more widespread than it would be in another country. Just a theory
>> ARTICLE
I do not have a sister, but have actually asked many of my American Otaku friends who DO have sisters.

Most of them say that the "if you think incest is hot you don't have a sister" meme isn't really true. But that it really depends on the sister in question and how close you are.

Basically they can acknowledge a sexy sister, someone they know very well (better than a girlfriend), and say that the idea that someone might develop a crush on their sister is not outside of possibility.

They enjoy ecchi incest in anime, however like many things,  it is always "Just not my sister".
>> ARTICLE
I think some of the confusion may come from how "onee/onii" is thrown around.  Older women who are close to the family automatically become an aunt or big sister. Cousins who grow up together often call each other brother and sister.

A lot of what we interpret as incest may actually be extended family relationships that are not blood relations.

Of course,  there is Bro-con and Sis-con that is exactly what it sounds like too.
>> ARTICLE
I've always just imagine the "onii/onee" thing as someone calling a female "sissy" or a male "bro" casually like here. To be honest, Railgun's English dub actually made me realize that when Kuroko's "ONEEEEEEEEE SAMAAAAAAAAAAA" became "Sissy!" in English. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I could watch the dub if I miss out on Kuroko's voice actor.
>> ARTICLE
Sissy?  Is that a regional dialect thing, because that's an insult where I'm from.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's an insult if thrown at a guy because it's like saying "You're as physically weak as a woman lol." But when said at a girl, more-so when it's a girl saying it as well, it's an endearing term like they're close enough to be sisters. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never heard that before in my life in America.  Lived multiple places in the west coast and have a lot of friends from the east coast.
>> ARTICLE
How intimate is calling someone by their first name?

Do someone's first name really beat that level of intimacy as shown in anime, or does it bear some level intimacy but it's a slightly blown up?

Because from where I came from, calling classmate by their last name would be really weird.
>> ARTICLE
Well, "last name"-san is pretty much the neutral/base form of address for people you're not very close to, including most classmates. First names are usually used among good friends (still with some sort of honorific afterwards, like -kun or -chan). And, of course, if you're in a relationship, you might drop the honorific (or use a familiar pronoun like "anta").
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty intimate. Maybe not when you're in kindergarten or elementary school, but it is when you get higher. It's the norm to not only call each other by their last names, but also to add "senpai" if he/she is older. It's either "xxx-senpai" or "xxx-san". If it's just classmates, you might add a "-kun" or "-chan" but usually it's just their last name.

So when you call someone by their first name, it shows that you two are very close. I would assume that if two people are calling each other by their first names (in Japan, of course), they have a special relationship - ex: childhood friends, bf, gf, etc.

Do girls in Japan actually wear bloomers for their PE uniform or is this just for fanservice?

Speak for yourself. There are tons of clubs at my school although they're usually before school since we have sports after.
>> ARTICLE
My high school had tons of clubs too, but out of a class of 600 only about 60 of them were in a club.
>> ARTICLE
When I was in a fifth through eight grade joining an after school club was mandatory unless you have a good excuse.


Probably 95% of students were in a club, and a student who were not in a club were usually a gangs(yankii) or a sociopath.


I was in a basketball club for 3 years and switched to  (go- home club) yep I became one of 5%. Lol


In ninth grade, you have to prepare for high school's enter exams therefore no more after school club.


Joining club was voluntary at my high school.







>> ARTICLE
They really don't have much to do other than clubs, and if you don't have anything, your parents would usually put you to some kind of cram school for some extra education.

And as for sports. It's a bit different in Japan. Here you can play football and soccer, or play basketball and track, or anything if you're free for the season. In Japan, if you're in baseball, you do baseball the entire year. It almost dictates your life. In the morning, before class, you have practice. In the afternoon, after class, you have practice. It really is baseball 24/7, and the same for almost all other sports. So once you're in one club/sport, you're pretty much stuck in it (which is why some people try not to be in it).
>> ARTICLE
According to my Japanese teacher there actually is a huge selection of clubs in Japanese schools and most people join one or a sports team.

If you look back on Japan's history, you might notice that they've closed their boarders to  all outside countries on 3 separate occasions. Usually it's been after something horrible has happened to their nation and people. Mainly by outside sources abusing the privilege of being let in at all. 

Generally it was the equivalent of someone coming to your house as a tentative friend, then over-staying their welcome by running amok like a kindergarten class on free cake day.  That, however, is a pleasant way of putting it. It was far worse in reality.

What's with the huge amount of high school males who are insanely good cooks?

It's not really impossible, of course. It just really stands out.

This pretty much exactly addresses your question. And though it surely doesn't cover all tropes, it's interesting to hear actual Japanese people's opinions.

**At this point I'd also like to remind everyone**: Unless you've spent an extended amount of time in Japan (couple of months at least), unless you're Japanese and/or have a *reliable* source, you're probably not in any place to talk about this.

^^^(I ^^doubt ^^most ^^people ^^in ^^here ^^match ^^that ^^criteria)

Also, please take everything in here (and in anime for that matter) with a grain of salt, and **don't upvote stuff you can't confirm**. Nobody wins anything if we perpetuate false facts.

Beach bikini stand up comedy contests? Is that a real thing?

What about common scenes? Bath houses? Those weird water ways that are also parks? Those stone retaining walls next to roads?

Transfer students introductions?

Giving overly complex proper noun names to things?
>> ARTICLE
The transfer student self-introduction seems realistic enough (and it ALWAYS happens), although I'd bet in most real instances it amounts to nothing more than the person looking embarrassed, saying their name, and taking a seat.

Stone retaining walls next to roads are common in any developed mountainous area in the US, and I'd imagine most background art details are probably generically accurate.

I'm highly doubtful that stand up comedy contests exclusive to women in bikinis is common enough in anime to qualify as an anime specific trope, but it might have happened one or twice somewhere in the world. Probably Florida, spring break, rather than Japan, though.

Bath houses are [definitely real](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2074.html), although they probably occur and are patronized in anime far more than in reality. 

I'm not sure what you mean by either "weird water ways that are also parks" or "giving overly proper noun names to things".

Taking your shoes off before you enter someone's house. I mean, many people do it in Western countries, but judging from the number of times it shows up in anime you'd think it was compulsory.

Also, have none of these people ever heard of a mop? What's with the whole pushing the cloth along the floor thing?
>> ARTICLE
Hi I'm a Japanese and my English is not really good but I can answer your questions with my parfect EngRish.


You MUST take your shoes off before entering someone's house or even your own house, this is a Japanese traditiona.


When you are at school (k1-k12) you must change your shose to your indoor shose before entering a main building. (Each school has own regulation about shose but changing shose to indoors ones are pretty much standard)


Even a school guest have to take off thire shose before entering a school, don't have to bring own indoor shose though, there are tons of guest slippers at school but on a parent visiting day visitors are allowed to wear shose inside school.


And of course, you have to switch your indoor shoes to you gym shoes before entering a gym.


And then if you have to go to the bathroom at the gym you have to change to the bathroom slippers. 


There are lots of slippers for the bathroom at bathroom entrance so you don't have to bring own slippers.



A mop, yes we use a mop AND a cleaning rag for cleaning, we use both irl.


When I was in high school I got a punishment for didn't do my home works a lot.


One of punishments was cleaning the school gym floor with a rag.
















 
>> ARTICLE
The same thing happens in India. Why would you want to get whatever dirt (etc.) has gotten stuck to your shoes outside all over your house?

(I see nobody has responded to the second part of your comment, which I'm now curious about.)
>> ARTICLE
I have absolutely *nothing* to back me up. I can't say I'm correct, but the pushing cloths thing is very traditional. It's the way they always cleaned floors, before there were mops. You see it everywhere, especially in local, country-side places (so take Totoro, Spirited Away, Hanasaku Iroha, etc. where it's not in the city).

I think, by pushing cloth, you get a softer clean that just slabbering a wet mop all over the floor. A lot of floors in Japan is tatami, and not a lot of flooring, so there's no need for a whole lot of wiping. It's just easier to clean with a damp towel that you can easily wring water out, rather than a large mop. I also think, because Japan is such a delicate place, things like cleaning are just handled with a lot more care. Hand-cleaning is better for that.

Also, it builds character. You get more work out of cleaning with your hands than moving a mop. I think, before it was more out of necessity, but now it's to put more effort into your work. It's why a lot of school kids clean like this, rather than mops (because they don't use janitors).

So I have nothing to prove it. Just by what grandma told me, and what I learned when I grew up, before I moved to America. So yea. Just a theory.
>> ARTICLE
it is compulsory, having grown up in an asian home, taking off your shoes whenever you enter a house is almost the same as breathing. I think it has to do with keeping the house clean. If you left your shoes on you would bring in all the dirt/mess that you stepped in, inside your home. It also has to deal with the fact that in those homes you'll usually be sitting on the floor eating. No one wants to eat on a muddy/dirty floor. Also I'm sure everyone likes to keep their homes nice and clean.


[This is a good read up on the whole taking your shoes off](http://mabelkwong.com/2013/06/20/hi-im-asian-come-in-leave-your-shoes-on-or-not/)
>> ARTICLE
Taking shoes off is so ridiculously common that any restaurant that operates in a traditional style will require you to take your shoes off to enter. 

Basically any area with Tatami mats you must remove your shoes and also any home, including many hostels or Ryokans (Japanese style hotels). 

Whenever I go to Japan I buy new socks :p

Couple other things that come to mind as not true/questionable.  

Gallons of blood spurting from the nose whenever something echi happens.  

Girls dropping like flies due to anemia.  Or at least common enough to have it as an explanation to go to the nurse for.  I don't recall ever seeing something like that in the US...


>> ARTICLE
>Gallons of blood spurting from the nose whenever something echi happens. 

I've actually seen this happen to a friend of mine when I was a kid.  Just once.


>Girls dropping like flies due to anemia.

This happens in real life.  Students, not only girls but boys too, fainting at the morning assembly, while the principal is giving a long-winding speech.  This may not be happening in recent years though (teachers being sensitive to students well-being and such...).

Another trope came to mind, but not necessarily related to Japan.  Related to Detective Stories like Detective Conan.  Namely, Dude, that many people drop dead around you, either you're involved, or you're the unluckiest person to be around...

Let me ask you though. Does the huge bitch/extremely abusive female leads of romantic comedies do the same? Pretty much every romcom has at least one bitchy girl who flat out physically abuses the MC. It's *much* more prevalent than the reverse. I find it rather interesting when people talk about how wrong it is when the male is an asshole/semi-abusive, but the tons of female abusers mostly gets overlooked.

The guys in Diabolik Lovers are downright insulting rapey dickheads from what I've seen, and I don't approve this kind of behaviour...  

But yeah, I'm too used to abusive female characters now to think about it correctly. Should I see a doctor?!

Boys over Flowers is a prime example of this, although the show is Korean and not Japanese

No, it is a Korean live drama based on a Japanese manga. There is also a Japanese anime and Japanese live drama. The live drama is pretty much the most popular in Japan of all time.

Every single Korean drama has a scene where the MC's wrist is grabbed and violently pulled on by her love interest. It's portrayed as romantic, but I can't imagine anyone enjoying a broken arm.

'Welcome to the N.H.K.' made me ponder the idea; I wonder if a cute girl has ever been used in real life to lure out a hikikomori? Obviously it's a little exaggerated in the show, but it seems feasible enough that it could actually happen. It also doesn't have to be a cute girl, I just happen to have my anime glasses on whilst pondering the idea.

I have a question as to why many guys in anime cross their legs so deeply. I understand it makes you look classy, but is this a common thing in Japan?

And when the characters say that "they are going home first" or "going ahead" do they really say that? Because I am from an Asian family and have heard other Asian people say that to my family. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't take my answer as gospel. It might have something to do with how masculinity is seen in Japan vs how it is viewed in the west. I would definitely say that the west is more conscious of and has a stronger image of what it is to be a "man" than in Japan. That is why when guys cross their legs or do anything that is feminine it is kind of ridiculed in the west, but Japan... Not so much. There are a bunch of male celebrities that have feminine qualities bit are still seen as  very attractive. They are even seen as cute, which may be taken a little strange by a guy over here. 

A lot of guys don't want to be seen as cute in the west. We want to be seen as strong and reliable. Able to protect people and stand up for ourselves. Not submissive and cute. Might have something to do with it. 
>> ARTICLE
So basically. Their vision of a "man" is different than ours. Ok.that makes sense! Thank you! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious as to how truancy is punished in Japan. 
I was always under the impression that Japan was pretty tight-laced when it came to school responsibilities, but it seems like in anime they can miss as much school as they want with no consequences. 
In Anohana and Bleach, for example, the main characters can miss entire semesters at a time, and then show up at school afterwards like nothing happened. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm betting the long term truancy being ignored is more a lack of focus for the issue in anime, and in reality it probably has similar consequences and handling methods compared to most mandatory schooling in other places. 

Such as, if you literally just skip a semester of school, because your parents took you on an extended four month international business trip, you're going to be repeating that semester. Maybe if you're chronically ill, you get special consideration, have the actual schoolwork brought to you, and they let you spend whole days devoted to taking make up tests to try and keep your education progressing normally.

Since you mentioned this what it brought to mind for me, though, is the whole "gated school" with a teacher - usually the physical education teacher - acting as the gatekeeper. Sentencing students who show up late with punishments and sometimes nitpicking how they're wearing their uniform. I wonder if that really happens much.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like any home in a modern day anime has those sliding doors. You know the ones I'm talking about? 
I always assumed those door designs were from hundreds of years ago. 
>> ARTICLE
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_in_Japan

According to that, Japanese "traditional housing" is still common enough to warrant having it's own segment within the article. It also says "most" modern housing has at least one room with some traditional design elements including doors like that. And floor plans are typically spoken of in terms of "tatami" as an indicator of size.

You do see a lot of modern doors and western architecture styles in anime though. I think two things are happening: 1. as westerners we notice the traditional style stuff more because it's odd to us, and 2. it does occur somewhat more in anime than in reality because a lot of anime focuses on characters from old rich (and presumably "traditional") families, or martial arts and martial arts schools, which often have traditional buildings.

I've always had a long term goal of becoming a Funeral Director, and one of my interests was possible expansion into Japan. Having watched Departures, on Netflix, I still wonder how they see the business of being a Mortician and I'm not sure there are any animes on said subject. So I always wonder if the Japanese really are that mortified by the Dead?
>> ARTICLE
was going to make a reply based on information gleamed from watching anime but [this is more accurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_funeral)
>> ARTICLE
Well the Japanese are more perverted than some other nations. There are many stories about women being molested in trains. There are also Japanese men who would sneak up to a woman wearing a skirt and they would put their phones under their skirt and take pictures of their under wear.

There anime's really shows their i guess more perverted nature compared to other people. Now almost all their anime's has to have something demoralizing women in some way unless the demographic of the anime is for girls.


>> ARTICLE
While I agree they might have strange fetishes and chikan is beyond my comprehension... I think you would want to chose your words more wisely (or even make sentences that make sense in the first place)... 

I mean, you say that as if they were all creepy perverts whereas, just like everywhere in the world, it's only a relatively small part of the population...

They're not more perverted than the rest of the world, their society has made it so people are less likely to voice their problems in order to not bother the people around them. 

I can imagine why a woman getting groped in a train full of people would rather keep quiet. She can't prove that guy groped her, screaming would only bother people around. They'd think she's a liar (and maybe a dirty woman...). Sure, it's pretty shit, but when you think about it, it's understandable. Group > Individual. And you also want to keep your image in the society clean ; this is what they call "tatemae", a faade.

Also, they most likely use anime and manga as a outlet (just like music can be for example). You'd never rape, have your way with a child, a member of your family, or anything like that IRL. All those fetishes/crazy situations you see in hentai manga and anime, why d'you think they exist? Fucking fantasies. You never thought about having your way with the prettiest girl/guy in the world? I sure do, at least once in my life and I have yet to live even longer... 

Ecchi/Harem anime are just a toned down version of these things... 
>> ARTICLE
I have said that the Japanese seem more perverted than SOME other nations. I know that almost the whole world are perverts in some way I am not saying that there not.

I also do not believe that they use anime/manga as an outlet but more as a mean for the creator to tell his or her story, but the question was "Which highly questionable Japanese cultural anime tropes that are true, or untrue?". Which I answered that a lot of them are perverts and that's true. So i do not understand what you are trying to defend the fact that they are perverts or that we're all perverts because it's still true either way.

Forgive me on my bad grammar English is'not my first language.
>> ARTICLE
> Which I answered that a lot of them are perverts and that's true.

No, it is not. As /u/zenoob just said, it's still a small fraction of the population; people just speak out against it (in public) less. There are perverts in every culture; you might just be less likely to be called out on it at the time in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
>his or her story

Weeeeeell... You could basically tell any story ever without showing a nipple.

>**seem** more perverted than SOME other nations

They 'seem', yes. Because the only thing you're exposed to and that comes from Japan is anime (and maybe manga).

It's almost like saying "Oh French people drink red wine and eat baguette and frogs everyday because that's what I've always seen in movies". Hell no, we eat almost the same shit as everyone else in the world, and if you drink red wine everyday, you'd be dubbed as an alcohoolic.

Also you say it like its a bad thing, usually there is a good reason why something is popular and well received
>> ARTICLE
>go to other anime sites and these anime always come out at the top

Maybe, maybe not. As /u/Eminoi said, when /r/music did this the albums were very mainstream for Redditors, but not so for communities like 4chan. It's not impossible for the same thing to happen with anime, even if many of these shows are highly rated on MAL (and we all know how reliable MAL ratings are).

>Also you say it like its a bad thing

Well if you thought that I'm sorry. What I meant was that I wasn't really surprised that these titles won in the first place, given that they are the most lauded and talked-about series on this sub. Even though OP said that he had a relatively small sample size (which I agree with), I don't think the results would have changed that much even if more people voted save for the close ones like Hibike - Oregairu or Ping Pong - Shirobako. 

But then I wonder about Code Geass R2. I have no idea how the fuck that happened other than Lelouch.


>> ARTICLE
Code Geass considered the top anime for two years. Yep, that's /r/anime alright. I get why people like CG, I just honestly cannot fathom why people consider it a good show. It's a lot like Pacific Rim IMO, it was fun and I enjoyed it, but I'm never gonna put it on any top 10 lists. 
>> ARTICLE
You're definitely in the minority there. When I look at most top 10s or people's MAL it's ^almost always up there. I don't know about other people but for me the: action, drama, dialogue, suspense, shock/twists, plot, ending, theatrics and characters are what make CG great for me. Another factor of it's success is that it has aspects that appeal to all sorts of people who watch anime. You say you can't fathom why people consider it a good show but then you go on to say you enjoyed it. For most enjoyment is the biggest factor.

I'm curious as to why it wouldn't be on anyone's top 10. My guesses are that they did not like the:

- character/s (mainly the MC)

- theatrics or how the MC solved problems

- action

- animation
>> ARTICLE
> You say you can't fathom why people consider it a good show but then you go on to say you enjoyed it.

I explained this with my Pacific Rim example. I've always found it funny how the anime community uses ratings more than anyone else, yet are the least critical. I think the key point is that this  is a poll asking for the "top" anime, or in other words, the best. If this poll was "what is your favorite anime", then I would have no qualms with any result, as that is a subjective question. 

And honestly when I said I enjoyed it, I was basically lying through my teeth. I only add that in when I'm critisizing Code Geass so I don't get ridiculous downvotes like I used to, but I did NOT enjoy this show. I think if I had seen it when I was a teenager I may have liked it a lot more.


I also really like how you are asking why people don't like it, then list basically every aspect of the show. Well, you got it, the show did  very little right.

>> ARTICLE
So you did not enjoy it but managed to go through 2 seasons of 50 episodes. I don't know whether that's obsession with completion or masochism ^^^^^^or ^^^^^^both .

I don't mind that you disagree, but I just want to know why. "I did not enjoy this show...did very little right." Pick any of my points and give me something specific to deal with... Was the MC unlikeable? Was the action too much? too little? Story over done? Is it too over the top?

If you don't want to be specific about CG tell me something another anime did right in comparison to it.

Here's an example: I did not like NGE because the animation hasn't aged well, the characters are crazy/whiny, the story is messed up and the last 2 episodes are low quality/vague/doesn't give closure/leaves people to their interpretations and generally a big middle finger. I'm so genuinely curious, and it's a little annoying when people just say "oh yeah didn't enjoy it. It did very little right" and just leave it at that.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I've never dropped anything. 

> The main problem for both seasons are the characters being absolutely flat apart from Lelouch and to a lesser extent C.C. Season 2 was just bad. The sword of akasha or w/e it's called arc was just so out of place, IMO and all the fights became less of Lelouch outsmarting his opponents and more of "HOHO I have the best mech now! So I will win this specific battle until you upgrade your mech!!11!" The ending was quite good, but it didn't redeem it fully. Basically it's my least favorite anime because I feel cheated. It could have been so much more, but it seems the writer's care more about absurd plot twists over character development and it really shows. Especially suzaku. Seriously fuck suzaku, what a poorly written piece of trash. "I'm not gonna let good things happen because the end doesn't j ustify the means" and he stays with that mantra for the entire show, showing 0 growth.

This is from an old, old, old thread, which outlines a few of the problems I found. Apologies for how poorly written it is, but it should give you a glimpse of my grievances. Oh and by the way, this got like -7, even though I was directly contributing to conversation.  
>> ARTICLE
> I'm curious as to why it wouldn't be on anyone's top 10

Ignoring "chasing dog" episodes I can pinpoint to you exact moment the show went unrecoverably downhill for some people. It was [](/s "episode 22 of season 1 - 'kill all Japanese' incident"). After that it was only exercise in total absurdity. Total absurdity is not a bad thing per se, but CG still insisted on treating itself seriously.  Ending redeemed the situation, but only very slightly (edit: and it still was ridiculous bullshit). It could be still entertaining watch, but CG being 'genuinely good show'? No way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for me I just found that Lelouch tripped too many Mary Sue flags during my viewing. I bailed out after episode 10 where IIRC Lelouch intentionally lead his troops into a trap, and then not only secured their complete, unquestioning obedience *after admitting he lead them into a trap*, but also managed to roflstomp the opposing army lead by a supposedly extremely competent commander. Everyone just loses 50 IQ points as soon as they go near Lelouch and it was enraging to watch.

Like, the show looked alright, had a great premise, and had some likable characters (Kallen, Euphy, Suzaku). I just wish that A. they had skipped all the high school bullshit B. Lelouch had actually faced some consequences for failure at some point in the first 10 episodes (I remember one time he got caught in the middle of the enemy army and Cornelia was ordering everyone to open their mech cockpits, but then C.C shows up dressed as Zero to ass pull him out of the situation) and C. he didn't have so many blatant Mary Sue traits.

They did their best to eradicate the "evil" in the world and start on a clean slate. Lelouch talked about it with his parents. What charles and his mom wanted was a world without conflict, where everyone could be connected with each other at all times. Lelouch denied that world in favor of something more uncertain.

I always feel so happy when I realise that others thought Ping Pong the Animation was amazing as well.
>> ARTICLE
same! iirc, it didn't get much attention (in terms of popularity) when it was airing though the attention it did get were extremely positive
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like it for the first few episodes either. The art style was off-putting, there seemed to be close to no story, and being already negative, the MC just seemed annoying. However, down the line I started to realise the beauty of the show.

My favorite scene by far is the first battle between Kong Wenge and Kazama. The artstyle works beautifully in this battle, and I really felt overwhelmed and small after seeing Kazama play, just like Kong Wenge. 
>> ARTICLE
I gotta give my favorite scene to the final battle of the show. Amazingly done and still gives me chills. I hold it as my standard for enjoying a show. If any show can give me chills it automatically gets at least a 9/10
>> ARTICLE
I like how you call the matches battles. :) Every time I pitch the show to someone, I like to say: "it's a show about ping pong as a tool for duels between heroes".
>> ARTICLE
They really are all heroes.

Given Oregairu's popularity, I'm surprised it didn't win best of 2015 so far.   
  
As I haven't seen that, I will say that Hibike! Euphonium is one of the best works I've seen in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Hibike! Euphonium was surprisingly good. I watched it all in one seating two nights ago, it was just that good. I'm here hoping for a season 2 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The drama in the middle did annoy me a lot, I was seriously confused about why that girl was so upset over her senpai not being soloist more than senpai herself. 
>> ARTICLE
Hibike! Euphonium is the epitome of style over substance. Great art and animation, yet very shallow. Oregairu isn't much better, with all the unfeasible high school drama.
>> ARTICLE
> I will say that Hibike! Euphonium is one of the best works I've seen in anime.

Can you elaborate on this for me, I'm reading through the comments and i can see it's really popular. I just don't see it, ignoring that its hard for me to relate, and since its only 12 episodes long i guess the shitty pacing can be excluded. Again for 12 episodes long they went into a decent amount of character backstory and development but it was still choppy, The main idea for me was, let's get better and win this competition and they mainly seemed to just focus on the drama of the characters which many issues were brought up and unresolved. The ending tied in with a beginning so I can't give it much crap, but it was still unsatisfying. For 12 episodes, with my elaborating and while typing this I've rewatched a few parts and take back my comment I made a few minutes ago below, that It's not above average, it definetly is, but only in terms of a 12 episode series. You saying it is one of the best works I've seen in anime, seems like an extreme exaggeration or maybe you haven't seen enough? If you enjoyed it that's what matters - I sincerely mean that but i guess my pet peeve with anime is *Even if i enjoy something, ***DEFINITELY** *does not always mean it is a good piece of work* end rant.

Tl;dr: For 12 episodes above average. one of the best works in anime IMO is an extreme exaggeration, to each his/her own, if you enjoyed that's what counts.

  
>> ARTICLE
Surely! (Warning: Spoilers galore ahead)  
  
Here's the thing: For me, I think relatability is a terrible, TERRIBLE way to rate something. I mean seriously, just because something is relatable doesn't mean it saves a trash work and failing to be relatable doesn't take something that was good and make it bad. That said, I can see why some people didn't like it, and why my comment might come off as off-hand or not thought out.  
  
To preface, I've watched my fair share of anime and TV shows and consumed more than enough stories (though definitely pales in comparison to many others on this site). What I loved about Hibike! Euphonium was a combination of factors: art, writing, character development, and cinematography.   
  
Let's talk art: The visuals were, of course, beautiful and astounding. It's amazing that they were able to get so much done consistently throughout the series, but it's more than just the budgetsmile.gif or the water flowing in the background. To me, it was the way that everything felt natural, how it became an active part of the story without just taking up space.   
  
That leads into cinematography (I'll save the writing and character development for last). The camera work was phenomenal, and I loved the small touches they had here and there; in episode 8 I believe, when Hazuki-chan is tearing up, the camera blurs out with her. How on the train, the camera lurches along with the passengers on the rail. The sweeping shots of the band, the intimate looks between friends, the far off shots to make you realize just how , in the grand scheme of things, small and insignificant these kids can be even in their own town.  
  
And that then leads to my favorite aspects: writing and character development. For me, main character narration is either hit or miss; if you're just using them as a mouthpiece to show what's going on, you're failing to utilize a potentially artistic aspect. Hibike! Euphonium knows this, and when they use Kumiko as the narrator, notice how she's not just reiterating what's going on. The way she jumps from thought to thought (with Aoi-senpai's departure, she talks about summer and the changing of seasons before leading into how the band falls apart) and the way she brings up other stories and metaphors to express feelings she can't quite convey (when walking up to the shrine and talking with Reina, she brings up the story of the Ice Spirit and mentions that this is how it felt to be okay with losing your life). These are not things that the viewer can pick up normally; they are subtleties that can be addressed, and add only to the experience when addressed.  
  
And that leads to the final point: character development. You see, in my estimation, Hibike! Euphonium is not an anime about band. It's not about cute girls doing cute things. It's not even about yuri bait. It's about the time in everyone's life when you realize that there is a void in your life: that you will one day have to do something from now until a considerable later time. And you have no idea what it is. Some of us know what we want to do when we're five, but many of us are lost. Kumiko is someone who's lost. In the beginning, she has no real motivation. She attends Kitauji because she likes the sailor uniform. She says she won't join band because Tsukamoto says he will. She rejoins band because her friends want to. She doesn't want to play euphonium because she always played euphonium. She plays euphonium because her senpai asks her to.  
 
Notice here that in EVERY INSTANCE, Kumiko has no agency. She's going with the flow. Even in the flashbacks, we see that Kumiko picked up euphonium because her sister did. She didn't feel particularly attached to band (did you really think we were going to nationals?) and had no real direction, as we can see from her spacing out at the parent- teacher conference.  
   
But as she meets Reina, she changes. Kumiko has a purpose, she sees what it's like when someone whats to be someone else, when they want to be something else. She witnesses what can drive people to greatness, to obsession, and she realizes that she needs to feel that empty void in her life and SHE wants to be the one to choose it. And choose it she does: she wants to be able to play the euphonium and become great at it.  
  
Only the path is difficult and full of disappointment. She is told by Taki-sensei to not play the part, and she's mad. She's crying tears of frustration. This is a MARKED difference from the Kumiko we see early on, yet over the course of 12 episodes it feels natural. The girl who didn't raise her hand in the beginning on whether or not to go for nationals is the one girl who stands up and gives Reina, the girl who clearly aces the solo audition, a standing ovation. She is the deciding factor, she believes in herself, and in such a small world and small way, she is learning what it means to grow up, to be human, to love and care about someone and something with all your heart.  
  
And that's why I love Hibike! Euphonium.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to know someone else feels the same way about Hibike, I only wish it had gone on to 24 episodes. On a side note, love your raildex reactions!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I really hope they do another season! And hopefully today's reactions will be good too haha
>> ARTICLE
I think Oregairu probably got more downvotes than Hibike.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm. It was lower on the thread than Hibike was.

Though both had their fair share of downvotes. Probably due to circlejerks.

I like oregiaru more, but they're both fantastic shows so i don't really care that much.

TIL that I really need to pick up Shinsekai Yori
>> ARTICLE
imo i watched it last week, here are reasons why i would rate this a 7 or 7.5/10, without any spoilers:

* the pacing is wonky and there are too many deus ex-machina moments.  It often gives you the answers to every mystery up to that point all at once instead of pacing itself.

* the major revelations aren't predictable, but they aren't gasp-worthy either 

* The world created for this anime could have had SO MUCH intriguing backstory, but they chose to keep everything vague.  

* Their powers are not explained well, nor do they have any scientific references or techno-babble to associate this world with reality.  

* There's a specific biological alteration in this society that is utter bullshit and lacks consistency throughout the story. 

* The art SUCKS.  I remember distinctly commending an episode on the drawings (i think episode 5, around the campfire).  All the kids had cool facial quirks going on and the coloring was great with the background, but that level of animation didn't show up after that episode.

* The dialogue keeps secrets from the audience that were already heavily foreshadowed by close-ups of faces (and names).  It lacks subtlety.

* Not every question is answered by the end, and not in an open-ended way.  More like, this part was a bit mysterious and they never went back to explain the whole thing, even though it didn't really matter to the whole story.

* The characters were fine, probably the high point of the series, but i thought they could have been a bit more charming.  This is indeed nitpicking haha

* 
* After it was over, i was just like "that's it?  that's what everyone was circle-jerking over?"  I think if you're a younger teenager and haven't seen very much you'll think the characters are bombastic and the thrilling parts are very exciting.  If you have an expansive knowledge of literary themes, tropes, story-telling, you'll probably think it was average like me.  There are great points to the series too, which is why i gave it a 7-7.5, i just wanted to share my negatives on a series that people have been calling perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree. SYY is a great example of sci-fi in anime. And I say this as someone who can't stand the original GITS, TTGL, etc. as basically the passe and generic shit they are.
>> ARTICLE
Lauding SSY as good sci-fi and GITS as generic? That hurts my soul, man. GITS was first of it's kind then and it's still one of the best now. SSY boils down to yet another dystopia, which is way more generic.
>> ARTICLE
GITS is generic. Deal with it. It was only 'special' because it happened to be released in a media which was starved to a bunch of people unfamiliar with how unoriginal it was.
>> ARTICLE
I'm willing to listen, if you cite why. If you just look at technology, cyborgs and fancy tech, yeah it's nothing special. But the way they impacted the story and themes are on a different level and scale of ambition than ssy. Trying to answer questions like where is the human soul and how technology changes the way we think and act.
>> ARTICLE
Because those were all cliches by the 90's.
>> ARTICLE
In other mediums maybe, you said it youself. Gits was still a first. What has ssy done?
>> ARTICLE
> here's a specific biological alteration in this society that is utter bullshit and lacks consistency throughout the story. 

what alteration?

>  too many deus ex-machina moments

what moments specifically?

> Not every question is answered by the end

really? what questions weren't answered by the end? I personally found this story one of the most conclusive.

> If you have an expansive knowledge of literary themes, tropes, story-telling, you'll probably think it was average like me

You are self-assured, that's for certain.
>> ARTICLE
ex-machina moments:

* any time Shun talks to Saki in her head, giving her correct instructions far beyond her imagination

* Saki happening to remember sharing her mantra with Satoru, the one person she had consequently split up with, causing him to regain his cantus and keep them both from dying.

* Saki's narration as an adult infers that she never dies on her adventures, cutting the tension in almost every scene.

* The walking library giving them a bunch of information, leading to a bigger mystery for the scooby and the gang.

* Tomiko spilling all the beans to Saki because she chose her to be the next leader of the civilization (on what grounds again? having a level head?)

* The pseudo-science of death feedback, where even if you believe you are of a different species, your subconscious mind can cause your body to shut down based on changes in your DNA.  If you want me to be invested in the philosophical questions like "what makes humans human," don't add an implausible device to explain why the cantus users can't kill each other without dying, but they can kill rat humans with only a little physical grief, and vice versa.  I don't understand how this keeps fiends from experiencing death feedback while they rampage.  If it's an innate reaction to killing, then whether you think the target is queerat or human shouldn't matter because they are both human in reality.  Perhaps I missed an explanation, but between 2011 and present there were a lot of changes in society that were left unexplained.  "The scientists divided the cantus users from the non-users, and both sides had their DNA modified"  Okay, great.  Mind elaborating a bit?

* It seems very convenient that the queerat that helped/abandoned/helped again Saki and Satoru ended up being the one who sought to forcefully end discrimination between the races.  Couldn't he have explained to Kiromaru his intention and reasoning well enough to get him to fight on his side?

* I want to say there are more, one dealing with the giant explosive fishes that could somehow be controlled by the queerats to wreak havoc in the waterways.  Those things did not seem sentient or easily captured and moved.  Just one of a couple random occurrences to create instant conflict. 

* All of the knowledge and tactics the queerats gained is meant to be assumed.  We have no idea if they're capable of anything but shooting arrows and pillaging their enemies territories before the first time skip. They could have extracted more thorough information from the library that would have helped the viewer get a better understanding of the world's history. 

questions i had at the end

* How did Squealer know Saki was going to Tokyo?  By smell? Did he know that there was a fiend-killing bacteria hidden in the depths there?  Does that mean he actually did find a library? 

* Why were there libraries walking around?

* Why did all of the queerats look the same except for a few who look like they're a different species?

* Didn't the townsfolk have Cantus powers?  Why were they unwilling to defend themselves during the queerat raids?

* If Maria's daughter was always a fiend, wouldn't she have tried to kill one of the queerats at some point while growing up?  she would have died based on death feedback.

* Why did the board of education head have two pupils in each eye?

* Weren't there ghosts at some point? Were those hallucinations?

* Are we supposed to assume Maria and Mamoru died?  How come they weren't strong enough to fend off the queerats?

* Was there a reason this society abstained from using electricity in everyday life?  Seems inconvenient, and though solar power is able to be used for libraries, people somehow don't find it to be useful enough to have solar power in their homes.

* Saki's sister was left a mystery.  Did she only have one sibling? 

i liked the show, honestly!  I just wanted the story to be something different than a queerat uprising because the world seemed much more interesting than an avoidable giant massacre.  I still plan on reading the novel for a better understanding of everything. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to discredit you out anything, but I believe the general opinion around here is that the characters were actually one of the weakest parts of the show.
>> ARTICLE
It's all opinion, and this comment does have spoilers.  I thought they were going for realistic personalities, which fit really well with the setting. Growing up as isolated as these kids did would make them boring and naive, but book smart and curious.  Their personalities changed as they learned more about their civilization and grew up.  Saki grew up to make a lot of commendable choices because she had made mistakes as well.  The whole story was from Saki's perspective anyway, so I'm surprised more reviewers don't view it as a good character-driven anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just take a llisten to it's second ending, Hanazawa is a god.

Do it! Just finished it yesterday and I guarantee you it's worth the watch.

I really regret dropping it after 3 episodes when it first came out. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm about to watch episode 11. Personally I am not seeing what everybody loves about this show yet. It's like a 5/10 for me right now
>> ARTICLE
That's honestly how I felt about it and I thought it would come to fruition somehow. It didn't really for me. The ending was one of the highlights of the show, but I still would give it a 6/10 overall, maybe bump to 7 for how ambitious it was. In the end, worth a watch. That's it. 
>> ARTICLE
As a recommendation:

A personal favorite: [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) is a Science Fiction, Psychological Thriller created by the animation studio A-1 Pictures (other known works are Sword Art Online, the fairly recent Shigatsu Wa Kimi no Uso/ Your Lie in April, Anohana, and Fairy Tail). Emotionally gripping and provocative with its moral stances, Shinsekai Yori delivers a 25-episode journey focusing on Saki (main character) and her friends' interactions with the utopian-like society she is residing in.

I haven't seen Hibike, but Shinsekai Yori is really fucking good. It's my second favorite anime ever.

Well UBW was even more hyped along with Danmachi and Oregairu yet Death parade beat it for a spot 2015.

That's fair. If I had to interject my personal opinion into this, I'd say UBW really isn't a top anime. *But* considering how much UBW is heralded on this sub, it really is surprising that it didn't win or at least get a spot in 2015.
>> ARTICLE
I dont really consider Parasyte,UBW great animes either. for 2014 I both rated Parasyte and UBW S1 at 7/10 which is good but not great  in my score. Second cour  of UBW i rated 6/10

Over all Parasyte was not as good  on its second half  that is why its not as popular so its no surprise  but still a good show to me.  Bahamut was actually my aots that season when UBW,parasyte and Bahamut all aired surprisingly .

I dont think UBW is herald here at all most think its a 6/10 or 7/10 unlike Fate/Zero where this sub really worships that show as some 10/10 masterpiece. The one Im suprise is there is no Jojo in 2015 since its was highly rated and most enjoyed it. But The Fate series in general is just popular here.

>> ARTICLE
Good thing
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect some of those picks.

1995 - Eva is one of my favorite series, but I have to say GitS is a lot better put together and polished. And I don't even like GitS.

2006 - I'm surprised Code Geass beat Death Note. I gotta say I prefer Lelouche as the mastermind because he actually failed at points and adapted his plans and Light seemed to be able to predict events that probably shouldn't have happened. The real question though is, how did Haruhi lose? It's one of the quintessential animes.

2008 - Code Geass is my #1 of all time but I don't think Super Mecha Gambit Pileup Time beats Mercantilism 101.

2011 - Holy shit that was a good year.

2013 - I'm surprised the Devil is a Part Timer did that well. I love it, but it's pretty niche.

tl;dr: Apparantly the stuff I like is what people like even though I don't think the stuff I like is the best.

It's to be expected when Bones adapt an unfinished series. Fullmetal Alchemist, Noragami, Eureka Seven. Even Chaika to some extent. Anime-original ends are just their thing, and I kind of prefer them to the more conventional "...But our fight continues!" endings that go nowhere.

I can guarantee it was because of downvotes from people who are against it being so popular (due to the recent best girl debacle)

Hibike Euphonium... not much hate against it I assume.

EDIT : The fact that you get downvoted for mentioning it, proves it. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime loves KyoAni in general, which is understandable.

I personally can't say anything about Euphonium because I haven't watched it myself.
>> ARTICLE
Eupho not only had one of the most beautiful animations i have **ever** seen (this can be easily noticed on the rainy episodes), since its a music anime (that is actually about music!) the OST is pretty outstanding compared to other anime OST.

And of course, the character development and all that.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the yuri baiting
>> ARTICLE
I watched both. Euph is pretty solid. The animation is gorgeous, the music is good, and the story is your standard stuff (minus a few stupid things here and there, especially regarding the music teacher). But definitely Zoku for me. Euph I would describe more as cute and all, but not too much else.

imo its because some people are voting as if the question is what is your favourite anime of that year, death parade has a really interesting premise and universe behind it and not bad character development so i can see why its easily some peoples fav anime that year, thought obviously not the best

Looking at these results, 2011 and 2005 were probably my favorite years in anime. 2011 had Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica, and so much more, While 2005 has Eureka 7, Blood+, Honey and Clover, some of my all time favorite shows as well.

Nice to see some of my favourite anime here (Code Geass, Steins Gate, Death Note) but I'm disappointed with no Fate/Zero

Easily better than Shinsekai Yori, Psycho Pass and Hyoukai in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Of course Eupho was the best of this year.

Even if the year hasn't ended, its pretty safe to say no other show will reach **that** kind of quality (OST, animation and subtle character development) on what is left of the year.


>> ARTICLE
What subtle character development are you talking about? I thought that hibike's character development, while excellent, wasn't even it's main draw. In terms of subtle character development among this year's anime, oregairu wins by a large margin. For me, hibike was all about the atmosphere(animation, character interactions, music). 
>> ARTICLE
I think that a lot of people might disagree with you on that, buddy. :P

At least for me, I would go with Yurikuma Arashi, Death Parade, Maria the Virgin Witch and (depending how it ends) Blood Blockade Battlefront as my bests of the year so far. Miss Hokusai might be there if I come around to watch it and it happens to be as good as it seems.
>> ARTICLE
Owarimonogatari? Or One Punch Man (at least for the first two categories).

I personally think Durarara would be a contender too once Ten is over.
>> ARTICLE
Im going to be downvoted for this but whatever.

Monogatari franchise, regardless if it is good or not (im not going to argue that), is over-hyped by /r/anime.

Can't compare an over-hyped franchise with a "standalone" anime *no one knew anything about before it aired* like Eupho. 

It wouldn't be fair to rely on the franchise popularity to beat "standalone" anime.

And OPM...i read the manga and webcomic, its pretty good but from the PVs i think the animation will be sightly above average. Nothing to say about the OST because its just a PV.

Kyo-ani went as far as animate **dust particles illuminated by the sun**, **rain drop falling in the glass**, and **pollen particles of the flowers** when doing eupho episodes. 

You don't see that kind of animation detail every season.
>> ARTICLE
Given how you described the animation I might have to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoani makes very pretty shows and I wish I could like them. But a show about girls playing brass instruments just isn't for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
> Can't compare an over-hyped franchise with a "standalone" anime no one knew anything about before it aired like Eupho.

Why not? Does it matter than no one knew about hibike before it aired? I also completely disagree with that statement because there were tons of people who were hyped for hibike well before it aired.

Why not just compare them based on their own merits? Hype shouldn't have anything to do with your comparisons.

>Kyo-ani went as far as animate dust particles illuminated by the sun, rain drop falling in the glass, and pollen particles of the flowers when doing eupho episodes.

Fawning over things like this seems overly pedantic. Just knowing that they animated dust particles doesn't tell me anything. Using that fact to describe how kyoani went to excruciating lengths to create an amazingly detailed and immersive world is much more substantial. 
>> ARTICLE
WOOO DURARARARARA! For as much crap people are giving this summer season, Durarara Ten and Gangsta are total contenders for me. I understand that these two shows aren't for everyone, which is a damn shame because these two have some of the best storytelling/crafting this year.

TFW Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't ping pong deserve it?
>> ARTICLE
It's nice and all that they went for something new but I just don't think it was all that enjoyable. I feel like all of the show's appeal centers around its originality and story. Were it to be animated normally I believe it'd be unpopular, even though the quality of the content wouldn't change much. 
  
The story was good, I agree, but from a visual perspective it was awkward. It felt like taking a best-seller and animating it without any real value being gained from the change in medium.  
  
TLDR; It was a good story but it didn't feel like it capitalized on the medium at all. 
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of that, these contests are based on popularity so even if you believe what you do, many others wouldn't 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong's sales placed 42nd for its year. 
>> ARTICLE
I was talking about popularity on this sub 
>> ARTICLE
When you realise that after 2015 was the worst year so far
>> ARTICLE
This is actually a pretty good list
>> ARTICLE
I recall the live action GTO being pretty good too if you're looking for another dose of Onizuka.

>> ARTICLE
The original 1998 live action series was excellent. The ending was fantastic (wish they ended with that over the ending in the movie), and Takashi Soramachi nailed the role of Onizuka.

The 2012 remake isn't as good as I don't think Akira is as good of an Onizuka.  The recent Taiwanese live action drama is terrible. 
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to the 1998 version as I didn't even know there was a 2012 remake lol. Haven't touched any live action stuff in ages. Thanks for the heads up though!
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching it right now, actually. I'm on episode 18 and LOVING it so far.
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing.  Honestly, I can't find words to describe it right now since I just finished it today.  I wish I could rewatch it without knowing anything lol.
>> ARTICLE
If you like manga, read Rookies. Somewhat similar.
>> ARTICLE
I will look into it.  Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
There are some differences, especially in the ending, but AFAIK, it doesn't *continue* it, but is about the same events. I could be wrong though, seeing the manga kept going for a couple of years after the anime ended. Hm.

BTW, there's also a manga covering the period from *before* GTO, following Onizuka and Ryuji, clled [Bad Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Company_(manga\)).

Fixed. The secret is to have \ before the penultimate closing parenthesis. Inserting a link via RES usually does it automatically.

Sweet, thanks!!  I look forward to reading it.  I feel lost right now...you know when you finish a great show and feel empty inside because it is done?  fuck
>> ARTICLE
The manga most certainly extends far beyond the anime

and it's amazing
>> ARTICLE
Really?  What chapter should I start the manga if I finished the anime?
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend reading it from the beginning since there are some differences in the chapters prior to the ending. Since the anime came up with an original ending it altered some parts of the story to fit it.

If you thought the anime was good the manga is _even_ _better_
>> ARTICLE
Alrighty, I will trust you and read the whole thing!
>> ARTICLE
DO IT!  I remember going to the library and renting out all 26 volume and finishing it in a day or two.  It's THAT GOOD.

Edit: I meant 25 volumes.

it's been awhile since i've read it

>> ARTICLE
this was the show that got me into anime 

It's still one of my favorites too.
>> ARTICLE
I can see it being my favourite for a very long time too!
>> ARTICLE
I loved GTO so much that I ended up buying the DVDs! The opening and end themes are all so good. Do you also think the ending was a bit sudden? I wish the last arc had a little more substance...
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it wasn't a typical ending for an anime and it did feel kind of rushed compared to other animes, but in comparison to the rest of the show i feel as if it suited it.  Of course I wanted it to be as long as possible, though, just like most fans lol.
>> ARTICLE
Basically the Onizuka timeline for the manga series goes like this: Bad Company, Shounan Junai Gumi (aka GTO Early Years), Great Teacher Onizuka, 14 Days in Shounan. Although fair warning, not all chapters for Early Years are out yet. There are giant gaps online because Tokyopop went to the shitter a few years back. This series is my all time favorite. Have a fun read!
>> ARTICLE
You made things so easy for me now...thanks!!
>> ARTICLE
No prob
>> ARTICLE
Here are the manga all related to GTO:

[Shounan Junai Gumi:](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/shounan_junai_gumi/)
This is before Onizuka became a teacher.

[GTO:](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/great_teacher_onizuka/)
This is Onizuka as a teacher.

[GTO Shounan14 days:](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/gto_shonan_14_days/)
This is Onizuka in the middle of GTO, a side arc.

[GTO Paradise Lost:](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/gto_paradise_lost/)
This is Onizuka after the GTO arc, brand new.

All the manga are great and I really enjoied them, the live action movies are great as well! Although I read mainly off of [MangaHere](http://www.mangahere.com), I know that you can probably find these series on different host sites. Have fun!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the anime but the manga is up there in my favorite shounen/comedy. I've read it 3 times and it has never failed to make me laugh. Definitely recommended.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this show as well. Fuck was it good. Sent my heart flying during every climax and had me loling during the funnies. besides this show just being the best, another thing i really noticed is that the music NEVER got boring. Even when it was a long series like Naruto, whos konoha theme makes me insane. I also think the ending was absolutely perfect for the show. Wasn't to over the top, but wasn't too boring. It was like the absolute epitome of what a teacher could do for his student. GTO! GTO! GTO! GTO! GTO!
>> ARTICLE
The art is the manga is better (cleaner, more detailed), and the facial expressions are more expressive. The anime does okay in capturing the style but sometimes the faces are contorted in such ridiculous ways that the anime just can't keep up. Since the art is great the manga ages better than the anime, which can look rough at times.

If you don't want to retread the same story then pick up at [Shonan 14 Days](http://myanimelist.net/manga/14531/GTO:_Shonan_14_Days) which is sequel-ish.

There's also the prequel [Early Days](http://myanimelist.net/manga/445/Shonan_Junai_Gumi!) which is Onizuka's gangster days when he was young.

Hellsing runs into a similar problem. Hellsing Ultimate is very admirable, but there are just some scenes in the Hellsing manga that rely on being still-images with exaggerated poses and strange bodily contortions that are just impossible to animate naturally or frame properly.

Before people call me a manga purist I think Attack on Titan's anime exceeds the art of the manga in every way possible.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet!  And regarding Shonan 14 days...I don't recall in the anime where Onizuka went away for 14 days.  Could you refresh my memory and tell me around what time in the anime that he disappeared?  I look forward to reading the two that you mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
copy/pasted from MAL:

This is a spin-off story of the manga GTO (Great Teacher Onizuka) that takes place directly after the Teshigawara arc.

> After Eikichi Onizuka was shot by former teacher Teshigawara, he was sent to the hospital. Shortly afterwards, he escaped and spent 14 days that no one knew about. Strangely enough, when he returned, a wanted poster appeared with a man that resembled Onizuka. What exactly did he do during these 14 days?

Teshigawara is [this guy](http://c.mhcdn.net/store/manga/39/19-155.0/compressed/GTO_v19_102_103.jpg?v=11192605605)
>> ARTICLE
(/s"I don't recall Onizuka getting shot by Teshigawara in the anime...they didn't show who shot him so that is why I was a little confused hah")

I am excited for that manga though

edit: can someone tell me how to post spoilers.  I googled it but it taught me something else.
>> ARTICLE
Try (remove the "{}") "{[GTO spoiler]} (/s...}" you need to specifically follow the spoiler format. Also, this has been previously discussed on this page, so there is no need to do a spoiler warning.
>> ARTICLE
thank ya!
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know about the manga Breaker? I haven't read all of it, and am fairly at the beginning but it's exactly GTO so far.
>> ARTICLE
To add what everyone else has said, the manga does continue past the series. It's been years since I've read/watched GTO, but from what I remember, some parts of the manga are good and give you more closure with certain characters such as Miyabi and Noboru, but I felt like a few of the arcs near the end (the Angels arc) is tacked on without purpose.

Anime adaptation doesnt really reflect its manga. Example, Gate: 
>> ARTICLE
Anime and manga both are adaptation. Gate: is a novel.
>> ARTICLE
Oh TIL.  So, comparing the manga to its novel how far the violence got diluted? 
>> ARTICLE
Violence getting diluted doesn't really detract from the story for me. Spice and Wolf for instance has Holo on her wolf form just running around and people fall to the ground just because when they're in the sewers. On the LN, a lot of people got ravaged on that scene.

I mean, that rarely ever affects the story, so why bother?
>> ARTICLE

lmao

I know, but still, someone CAN actually be so addicted to the manga to go the stretch and say it'll be good no matter what... right? I mean, if they announced a season 3 for S&W it probably would be an auto-include on my 10 list because of the content of the LN :D.

I'm actually surprised Hunter x Hunter is second on this list, especially when it lost to Spice and Wolf in the Best Anime bracket. I feel like it's always mentioned on this sub but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
> but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 

Really? People talk about CA like it was the pinnacle of fiction.
>> ARTICLE
I meant it doesn't have a huge circle-jerk going for it to the point where it dominates every bracket.

And I've never seen the CA arc brought up without a mixture of praise and criticism. 
>> ARTICLE
Its kind of the same with Steins;Gate and FMA:B, I don't think that people rave on about it too much because they are very secure that they are regarded as good shows, they don't need to convince other people that it is a good show just to reaffirm their belief. I fucking loved HxH, but I anit gonna preach the shit out of it and put people off, not what I want to do at all.
>> ARTICLE
This is what initially turned me off of HxH, that and the episode count.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everyone who watches it ends up loving it, but a lot of people are turned off the either its length, art style, or beginning that make it seem like it's an anime for kids. It is pretty damn hyped in the comment sections, but that's simply not enough to boost it above other really popular anime with broader appeal in contests that have thousands of voters.
>> ARTICLE
It was a 9/10 for me... until the ant arc. The change in tone, ridiculously slow pacing, overpowered (dues ex machine) enemies ruined it for me. It took like 40 episodes for anything to happen and once it started it was so over narrated and over explained ever little detail. Until that point everyone  was strong because they trained and earn their power. The ants also felt so cartoony and out of place in what had been a dark Shonen. The mc's anger felt so forced and blown out of proportion.

/end rant 

Edit:Downvote isnt a disagree button. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with everything you say lol. A lot of people think the ant arc was the best.
>> ARTICLE
There's many that considers it the best arc of any shounen.
>> ARTICLE
did you watch the show while it was airing or after it finished?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after it was finished and thought the ant arc was the best by far, albeit it started off rather slow.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched it while it was airing, you would realize how bad and slow the pacing was. They basically copy pasted the manga, they showed whats going on, AND the narrator explained it. Which imo is bad in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Animes are much better when you can binge watch them though, chimera ant arc might have been really slow when it was airing but it would have had an extremely different feeling if you had been able to see everything at once, I was watching 40 episodes a day so this made it definitely one of the best arcs of any shounen to me.
>> ARTICLE
that's my point, many people ignore the terrible pacing of shows because they binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't the majority of anime created to promote the source material anyway? I'm also sure a good portion of the people that watched it (including me) didn't even touch the manga so it was a new experience to them. As far as the pacing, I already admitted that I also thought it was pretty slow, but the second half more than makes up for it imo.
>> ARTICLE
the second half is where it was slowest, 6 episodes for 3 minutes. Also that isn't an excuse to have godawful pacing, they promoted the manga by completely ending the show in a satisfying way so for the people that want more, they need to read the manga (even though there isn't much material).
>> ARTICLE
When it was finishes, and i'm used to shounen pacing. I loved it from the first episode as i knew it was going to be an epic journey. I'm glad they did it after the manga, that's the only way anime should be done.
>> ARTICLE
which "dues ex machine" are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
The people who comment on shit are different from the people who'd upvote shit. People who've watched HxH will have very strong opinions about it
>> ARTICLE
This is true. There are >300,000 subscribers here, but I'd say there's only around 500-1000 of us that regularly comment. What we tend to think of as "the /r/anime community" is only a tiny sliver of it. This is also a big part of the reason you'll see a tremendous outpouring of love for certain characters in the contests' comment sections only to have them get absolutely mutilated in the results.

that's much cleaner. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda of curious on what makes Steins;Gate that good. I finished it last week and it was really good, but I feel it's a bit overrated. Maybe I was a bit overhyped on how it was going to end, but the ending left me kinda underwhelmed. Intro and outro songs are really awesome, I like the lyric change at the final two episodes and what the lyrics of the intro have to say, real interesting and ties in well with the story. 
>> ARTICLE
 Steins;Gate has various elements/genre in it, the characters aren't all that interesting but the amount of human emotions mixed in, all the feels, driving each one to their own desires, characters development. I'm assuming that you have watched both the OVAs and the movie, you would only not like it if you don't understand jack shit. I personally don't find anything lacking in Steins;Gate. 

But yeah overhyping it might be a factor, when does the real thing meets your expectation when you overhype, really?

ANWS DONT YOU FEEL THE PAIN OKABE IS GOING THROUGH


>> ARTICLE
Tu... tu... ruu
>> ARTICLE
I'm not talking about /r/anime folks but the general Steins;Gate audience: If you think from the perspective of a random adult you'd run into on the street in the Western world, Steins;Gate is the only show they might like out of the top 10 shows. The other 9 are extreme levels of "okay wtf am I watching?" to those outside of fantasy/fiction/anime culture.

For that specific non-anime audience, it would be a toss up between Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note. Steins;Gate would win the popularity contest because the other two are older series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat. I recently watched, too. And enjoyed but overall ranking in mine is not so high. I also wonder what makes it to the top. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Steins;Gate is a lot better when it's the first anime you've seen because it's more accessible to a western audience. It was the first anime I ever saw and I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread; I recently *rewatched* it a year after being introduced to anime and whilst I still thought it was great, it wasn't as incredible as I remembered it being. 
>> ARTICLE
It has good character development, a time travel mechanic that makes sense and is explained well, and isn't based on magic. 
>> ARTICLE
[We also had a Best Anime bracket just a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32yq8d/ranimes_favourite_anime_of_all_time_and_the/)

Yep, and I did this anyway since the results could be different due to that one being a head-to-head tournament kinda thing and this just being raw favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It's nice seeing Higurashi, Mawaru Penguindrum and Great Teacher Onizuka on this list. Looks like r/anime's taste isn't so bad after all. 

How many votes did each of the Fate series get individually OP?

>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure, I was too far into it before realizing I should have kept track of them individually. I think it was about 40% F/Zero, 30% UBW and 30% F/SN
>> ARTICLE
>30% F/SN

That doesn't seem right... Maybe it would get like 5% vote if we were just talking about favorite in the Fate series, but favorite anime, on /r/anime? Nah, no way man.

EDIT: Okay i've decided to count up all of the Fate votes using Ctrl f.

Fate/Zero - 54 (I searched for "Fate/Zero" and "Fate Zero" and "F/Z")

Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works - 14 (I searched for UBW, Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay Night and Fate Stay Night)

Fate/Stay Night - 2 (Although one didn't specify if UBW or DEEN.) and (I searched for Fate/Stay Night and DEEN)

There was also one vote that said "Fate Zero/sn" so I don't know who to give that to...
>> ARTICLE
Well at least I knew zero was more popular than the others :P haha
>> ARTICLE
Because it's by far the best.

Prisma illya says Hi 

Also the fights in Prisma illya>>> Fate/zero Batcave and Unlimited flashy works final fight. Ufotable can learn from Silver Link.

But don't people usually say the popular stuff is shit, like sao or naruto? So shouldn't that mean that fate/zero is actually the worst, because it's so popular?

popular irl =/= popular on r/anime

Just occasionally something becomes popular because it is actually good. And it's not as if fate/zero is mainstream.

Not Naruto and SAO level, the stuff that even people who hardly watch any anime at all know about.

You'll be able to dig out flaws in every show if you look for them, and besides, when has a list like that ever been more than a popularity contest, anyway? It's not as though anyone's claiming that Steins;Gate's a flawless masterpiece.

maybe a lot of people had it on 3?

Yes, steins;gate was more commonly 2 or 3 than 1
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the list would be more accurate if you had counted 1) thrice and 2) twice.

That would have been a lot of work though :O
>> ARTICLE
A weighted system, like CFB AP/BCS rankings instead of just a "mentions" poll. 
>> ARTICLE
That's subjective. I enjoyed the show a lot and loved the characters, and imo the pacing was good for me. I liked it more than Madoka, and Mawaru. No one's claiming it's flawless, but that it's a fantastic show (I mean it's #2 on MAL).

That feeling when the top 3 are in you're too 5 (or will be when I see the last few episodes of HxH)

Well from what I put in that top 10 thread the other day only one of my top 10 aren't on this list.  And it's a stand alone movie, so...

Firstly, nice work in compiling the data together (manually, I assume?)

In terms of feedback, I have two things: one, when reporting the results, identically numbered items should be tied in rank with each other. So instead of having the shows with count of 4 being ranked 76-91, they all would be ranked as 76th (or 76th-91st if you want to be technical about it.  
Second, I think that a weighting system would be more ideal for doing tiebreakers if you wanted to bother (but then you would have to list those results to show why they ended up separated in rank).  
So the "sort order" if you will, would be Total Count > 1sts > 2nds > 3rds. Rank by Total Count, if group tie, rank within group by 1sts, and so on. I know it's a quite a bit more work for the all of the inevitable ties, but more transparency ~~will muffle the salty /r/anime users~~ is always awesome.

>> ARTICLE
People are usually responsive with great fervor when others bring it up but I can't help but ask:

What's so good about Steins;gate? I watched it and it was good; I rated it 8/10. But it really wasn't anything above that for me. 

The drama (character death(s) or separations) did not give me a suspension of disbelief, meaning the writing behind it wasn't the best. I'll explain what I mean: in the best works of fiction, the setting and characters are presented in a way that can get the viewer invested in the events of the series despite being aware it's fiction. Like in Hunter x Hunter, Meruem and Komugi; or in Anohana, most characters. I won't spoil them, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you've watched. I never felt like I cared about the character(s) dying or being separated from Okabe in Steins;gate.

Speaking of characters in Steins;gate, they are interesting to the point where they are **not** a bore to watch. That's fine if the goal is to be just a decent anime. But they really weren't anything deeper than that. The character development was more about their individual circumstances, and less about how it affected their mentality, as I would have liked. For example, the unfortunate distancing between Feyris and her father. Sure that's kind of sad, but we don't see how it affects her character by having that problem. She's the same with and without the circumstances. Maybe she's good at hiding her sadness via a facade, but at least give the viewer an idea of what ways it affects Feyris's mentality. A great example of such a thing being done correctly is from Hunter Hunter: the childhood flashback of Gyro (the NGL king/druglord) and his alcoholic father. You're clearly shown what kind of devoted child Gyro was, and the events that made him change to who he is. This is just a side character and Togashi gave him such a powerful backstory. Netero's training in the mountains for his change was also superb. An argument against this is, Steins;gate was too short-running to develop its characters much. Then you can compare it to Cowboy Bebop or even Toradora, both of which give a lot of emphasis to why characters became how they are.

I have issues with the plot, although those complaints are more subjective than the above (I was annoyed that Okabe spent the entire "death repeat" arc learning there are consequences messing with time, only to be able to change the past as he pleases in the end with **no** consequence; what was the point of his learning then?!) . Some people may prefer a happy ending at the expense of abandoned development, so I can't criticize the anime on that part.

Overall the show was enjoyable, but I'm very confused how people treat it as a masterpiece. People imply it's a very cerebral show, like western television's The Affair or Mr Robot, but it's really not. It's a show on the level of things like Code Geass or Afro Samurai. It's a fun watch for many people, but none of the plot or characters are anything beyond that. 


>> ARTICLE
I find it odd you mention Feyris. The effects on her mental state are very clear. [spoilers](#s "The change from the loss of her father literally warps Tokyo. She loses herself to the moe because she has no other way to escape the guilt. It is not until her interaction with Okabe that she is ever able to accept it and move on.") Mind you, they don't explicitly spell this out for you. It is what you infer from her actions and the affect on the environment.

What it sounds like is you just don't like the characters. That is the common breaking point when people don't like the show as much. People who love the show are also the ones who adore the characters. This is personal preference more than anything. I watched a lot of Hunter x Hunter and I never got invested in the characters. But I didn't like them much in the first place, so it colors my opinion. Same thing, different show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really care about Steins;Gate characters at all, I rated it 9/10 for the excellent and original plot. Maybe if you think about Steins;Gate as a pure sci-fi show, it would be much more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is my top anime, I disagree that the characters need to be deeper than they were in the show. To me I really like smaller scale stores that are about the characters in circumstances, this is what makes the show shine to me. The amount of anime that just scale out of proportion compared to the start, or even from the beginning, cause me to lose interest. Love the characters, well thought out plot, for me it was well paced and held my attention. Further on wanting deeper characters, a lot of people like how they don't all just have some dramatic backstory that shaped who they are but are just friends only just finished school.

I don't know what could be number one that would make everyone happy because no show is perfect, I don't think all the people who have it at number 1 think of it as a masterpiece just their favorite show. What show would you even call a masterpiece and expect people to agree with? Do you expect everyone to like something more than just the enjoyment they have from watching it? 

I think maybe your just expecting the number 1 for most people to be more than just the show they most enjoy, and expect the audience to want more than just enjoyment of a show. A lot of people just enjoyed watching it the most and don't care about appreciating some show because its a classic, or has some deeper level to it.

Is HxH really that good? It's on my plan to watch but ep count kind of makes me put it off every time I check to see what to watch next.

Does it have fillers and meaningless episodes like other long, fighting anime or is it more like FMA where every episode has meaning to it?
>> ARTICLE
HxH doesn't have any filler (except for 2 recap episode, 13 and 26 I believe) and you should skip those. It's praised mostly because it breaks the shounen mold of bullshit powerups and other things.

It's way less about the fights and has a really good story (especially the chimera ant arc), but the fights are still great and well animated anyway.

Just don't go into it with too high of expectations because it'll ruin it (along with literally any other show ever, assumptions ruin things).

/r/anime shit fucking taste confirmed

Man, those top 10 are (mostly) representative of everything wrong with this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly good top taste in the top!
>> ARTICLE
Watamote not on the list.  Is broken.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't know how to feel about Your Lie in April being that high up there...

It's recent, and the animation/story was good during a relatively unexciting season schedule. So the hype is real here!

Is it wrong that I refuse to Code Geass because I can't stand the art style?

>> ARTICLE
We actually already had a [contest for this](http://animebracket.com/results/-r-anime-s-favourite-anime-of-all-time/?group=finals)
>> ARTICLE
The results for that were utterly different from this though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it also included a larger amount of people which would explain why it was different.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that is how it works. The sample size is large enough to consider it a reasonably accurate.

Brackets operate differently to just straight up voting for your favourite anime, HxH didn't do so well in the brackets, but is no.2 over here. Brackets are more 'do you like anime A or anime B more?', people that may like anime A may REALLY like it, but people that like anime B more may just, *kind of* like it, while this is a straight up, what is your favourite.

A good example is AoT, ranks 33 on this list, but it beat out Toradora in the contest whilst Toradora ranks 20 on this list. Admitedly, results come out simular, but they are taking different types of data here.

edit: Too simplify it, this is taking a tally of how many people consider each anime their favourite anime.

Anime bracket did a vote of how many people liked anime A over anime B, not what was their favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not a good argument, simply because of how the brackets are organized. The way it works is that the entries with the highest seeds go against the entires with the lowest seeds first. Meaning the ones who were voted in more, go against the ones who were voted in the least.

Besides, we can just look at the seeding for each show either way to nullify that argument.

1. Steins;Gate

2. FMA:B

3. Code Geass

4. FMA

5. Gurren Lagann

6. Fate/Zero

7. Toradora 

8. NGE

9. Kill la Kill

10. AoT

Considering the contest had a larger amount of people, rather than just regulars of /r/anime I believe the contest more. The problem with the OP's list is that its literally just people giving their top 3, and a lot of the time it wasn't even just that, they would list their top 10. Shows like Toradora and Hunter x Hunter have proved time and time again that their audience is just a vocal minority, in the contests they always get knocked out and aren't seeded as high as you would believe on /r/anime. However, shows like Steins;Gate, FMA:B and Monogatari have consistently gotten to the top in every type of contest with a large amount of people here. Then you have shows like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z which have fanbases larger than you would imagine, given how poorly /r/anime will talk about them sometimes.

Though keep in mind i'm not saying that contest voting is the best way to gauge what a group of people think is the best, but I believe its more accurate than the way OP tallied up the votes- no offense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just pointing out this is a different type of Data that has been collected here. 

If you had to answer what was r/anime's favourite anime, then the bracket would probably be your best bet, it is a mash up of everyone's opinion from r/anime.

If you had to answer what is the most common anime people consider their favourite anime on r/anime, this 'tally' would be more accurate. This is a different, there is no better or worse system between the two.
>> ARTICLE
My top two are the exact same as r/anime in the same order, I must have good taste.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad? Wait what? I hear NOTHING but how much people hate that show, but it's top 10?

Also, I really need to get around to watching FMA and the rest of Stein's Gate.

[Naruto (original series): Sadness and Sorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ug070QK674)

I know reddit doesn't love Naruto.  It can be very cheesy, immature, and the plot is all over the place.  Kishi doesn't always seem to know where he's going in terms of story.  But if we're talking nostalgia.... Naruto was the show I watched growing up.  I didn't watch One Piece, Bleach, or Cowboy Bebop. I watched Naruto.  It was awesome, it was funny, it had an amazing soundtrack and a cast where any character could be my favorite.  This is the song that still gets me. 
>> ARTICLE
'Lonliness' from the early Shippuden OST does something funny to me...
>> ARTICLE
It's just painful. You can really feel the emotion. Shippuden had so many amazing pieces. Samidare, Tragic, Despair, Kakuzu, Senya, just to name a few. I think I need to listen to the whole soundtrack again. 
>> ARTICLE
I know just how you feel. I've long since dropped Naruto (because of the reasons you mentioned) but it was one of my first exposures to anime when I was growing up. At convention dances (well, AX and Fanime at least), they always have the obligatory Naruto main theme remix. And every time I hear that, I can't help but feel chills remembering those days when I'd dreamed about a world that seemed so much more compelling than reality.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that what it's all about though? I really, really love original naruto.  Post  time skip just isn't the same for me...
>> ARTICLE
I think as I started to watch more anime, the things that bugged me about Naruto just started standing out more and more until I gave up. For me, as it was my first anime (besides the English dubs of Outlaw Star and Gundam Wing when I was reeeeeally young), the world Kishimoto built really was a fantastic place. I loved the battles of the Chunin Exam arc (Shikamaru vs Temari was my favorite, followed closely by Lee vs Gaara) and the interplay of strengths and weaknesses of different techniques (even if it was something as silly as Naruto farting on Kiba). I'd spend hours daydreaming in class about my own ninjas and what techniques they would use.


Heck, even post-timeskip had its compelling moments (Chiyo controlling Sakura to take down Sasori was pretty sweet, and as a Shikamaru fanboy, the fight that led to Asuma's death and then Shikamaru's revenge was awesome). But it just felt like Kishimoto drifted away from the strategic nature of the earlier fights and focused more and more on granting Naruto and Sasuke godmode powers. That world at war that had felt so compelling to me was significantly cheapened when faced with the reality that these two characters were just so much more powerful than anyone else due to shonen plot no jutsu. It just feels like the anime turned into more a power level comparison than a clash of varying ninja styles and techniques. 


2 years of fillers didn't help also. :P


I still read the manga now and then to catch up (and I feel like I've come this far, so I might as well see it through to its conclusion), but I definitely don't feel the attachment to it that I remember from my younger days. Hearing the soundtrack, though, brings back the memories of that irrationally strong bond that first introduced me to the world of anime. No matter how terribly Naruto ended up turning out and how much hate it receives (sometimes deservedly), it still gave me a sense of wonder that I truly do appreciate.


And that's my wall of nostalgia about Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
You literally just described exactly how I feel.  From start to finish this embodies my feelings about naruto.  I'm moving my way up in the manga after watching Naruto all throughout my late childhood.  I lived for the strategic battles.  Shikamaru was the best, but I loved all the characters.  The Sasuke retrieval arc was amazing.  Like you said, there was even some good fights in shippuden.  You mention Chiyo and Sakura, and I'll point out Gaara and Deidera.   I think that fight (and a couple other akatsuki fights) were some of the best post-chuunin fights in the series.  I used to think all day about who would win between two different ninja.  What will be the next cool power Shikamaru will get? How could anyone HONESTLY defeat Shino!?

It just feels so generic now.
>> ARTICLE
In reality though, very few fights in Naruto are actually won through sheer power. Most are fought through actual strategy. The latest manga chapter was fantastic in this regard.

Even during the last time Naruto went berserk, against Pain, nothing actually happened. He saw Hinata getting stabbed, went crazy, and attacked. But nothing came of it. That fight was ultimately won by Naruto calming down, thinking things through, and creating a battle plan around Pain's recharge time.

Kishimoto might have scaled up the grandness of the battles, but the strategy remains the same.

I won't argue against the thematic weaknesses and the lack of character development for certain characters. But the fights in Naruto are among the best fight I've seen in any anime or manga.
>> ARTICLE
I can't deny that - you can still see the effort Kishimoto puts in to try and at least get the fights to make sense. It's just that at the current moment, Naruto and Sasuke are on a whole different level of power from the rest of the non-Madara/Kage ninjas due to their innate abilities (Nine-Tailed Fox and Sharingan). To me, it just feels sort of "cheap" that Kishimoto granted them near limitless power when in the beginning of the series many of the techniques introduced had limitations. So even though the fights do have some thought behind them and are on that grand scale, they just feel empty compared to something like Lee vs Gaara.

Eureka 7 has a pretty nostalgic soundtrack for me, these two are the first that come to mind:

[Outlaw Star opening.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0N3L-pcGdc) It's after school and time for TV from 4:30 to 8:00.

>> ARTICLE
Sukima Swiiiiiiitch
>> ARTICLE
The Azumanga Daioh soundtrack feels so... 90's... though technically it's from 2001.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna go way out there with pretty much any song from the original Bubblegum Crisis, either in Japanese or the hilariously reworked English versions of the songs.  Kon'ya wa Hurricane, Mister Dandy, and Soldier Girls were especially catchy.  I was a child of the eighties.  It's embarrassing, but what can I say?

More recently, I can't think of too many that induce nostalgia for me.  But, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is pretty unforgettable.

Other than that, I shy away from j-pop and anime soundtracks in general.  Nothing wrong with them, but I'm more in to funk, rock, jazz, or bluegrass and you don't find a lot of that in anime.
>> ARTICLE
[Noriko Sakai - Active Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_2isD-yu8) Just oozes nostalgia.

Oh my goodness yes. That, and the [Buster March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxKhhMdbU5I).

[Skyclad Observer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYTZcuDZrr4) - Man, it feels like it was just yesterday when I was watching this show. The revelation of Operation Skuld and then this coming on. Ahhhh.

[Mosaic Kakera from Code Geass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNMKVdxFoS4) - It was a very snowy winter when I watched this. Every time I hear this, I think back to that time. That Post Anime Depression, walking in the snow often. Man, time flies by.

And lastly, anything from Naruto. It's kinda silly now, but I spent a good 3 years watching it and loved most of it. Brings back good memories.

[FMA: Brotherhood Opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uq34TeWEdQ). 

Shit get's me 'erry time.
>> ARTICLE
The Big O's opening, the first Flash Gordon ~~rip-off~~ influenced one. Hell, pretty much the entire soundtrack can count for me...Especially since it was heavily influenced by western works, there's a lot to find nostalgic if you catch any of them. Particularily 'Stand a Chance'(Sounds like Blade Runner's Vangelis), and 'Brick Ballades'(Dat smooth jazz and piano).

Serial Experiment Lain's opening was pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
After you mentioned it, I had to go back and watch the opening on YouTube.  Googled the director to see if he'd been involved in anything since Lain that I might be interested in and found that he died in June.

*Edit: of course, then I had to Wikipedia the guy, Ryutaro Nakamura, and find that he directed Kino's Journey and an episode of GiTS: SAC, two of my other favorites.  Sad to hear he's gone.

now watch the GTO live action version from 2012. great stuff. *dont watch the 2014 sequel though. just a warning.*
>> ARTICLE
Is it just bad, or is it some spoiler? Just curious.
>> ARTICLE
The 2014 live action series is rushed, no source material to work from, confusingly directed and bad story telling. I only watched the first ep but apparently the pattern goes on throughout the second season. The first one is gold though.

2nd season is terrible. Like someone came in and tried to copy all the same emotional beats, but without any character development at all.

can someone explain to me why all the comments are basically one word that has a good meaning liek good or cool or sweet?
>> ARTICLE
**Rurouni Kenshin**. 

It was originally made by Deen and it suffered from having too many fillers (manga was not complete on that time) leading it to be cancelled before the manga ending. Its live actions movie are doing great sells wise (the one I watched I also enjoyed) so it is also a plus.


>> ARTICLE
Ufotable pls. 
>> ARTICLE
Please no. Ufotable would filter/special effect it up the ass. Rurouni Kenshin needs that raw and unaltered look.
>> ARTICLE
Trigger, Shaft, or A1 would work well too. 
>> ARTICLE
Trigger would make it to funny weird, A1 would start strong then shit on its second half like it seems to love doing, and shaft would just fuck it with its super artsy penis of death
>> ARTICLE
I think Bones or Madhouse might be the studios fit for Kenshin
>> ARTICLE
I'd feel Bones could do Kenshin justice. Swordplay in many of their anime just looks fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Trigun.  I love it as-is, but to see it with a sexy new style (similar to how Hellsing Ultimate looks orgasmal compared to the original) would make me so happy.
>> ARTICLE
yes. this show did not withstand the test of time.
>> ARTICLE
There was that movie that came out a few years ago.  *[Trigun Badlands Rumble](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4106/Trigun:_Badlands_Rumble)*.  It was pretty good, nothing great.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps a Hellsing-Ultimate style remake, not just visually, but adapting the entirety of the manga as well?
>> ARTICLE
Having never read the manga, I was unaware that Trigun wasn't a full adaption.  Would definitely be cool to see then.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the Original Mobile Suit gundam? The animation aged horribly at it suffered from a lack of maturity in the directorial style. If it got a proper update to look really nice I think it could really be a nice way to get people into UC gundam. I realize that Gundam Origin is in the works but I'm not sure personally how similar that is to the original. Most importantly could someone watch Zeta after that series? That's what I'm mostly curious about. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Origins is only covering all of the character back story stuff, so it would still require watching the original before Zeta.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I thought. I think it will be too Char centric and not cover enough of the one year war to give enough context for Zeta. Ergo we a proper 0079 remake. 
>> ARTICLE
One can never have enough of Char though!

You could say we are not weighed down by Char's awesomeness

>_<. That joke though.

One day someone will think I'm funny.

[Bubblegum Crisis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1347/Bubblegum_Crisis). I have nothing witty to say, here. Just Bubblegum Crisis.
>> ARTICLE
wanted to make sure this was in the list somewhere; just the original. Don't care about 2040 as much.
>> ARTICLE
Bubblegum Crisis by ufotable would be damn near perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
I have this on my PTW list. How is it?
>> ARTICLE
Very 80s, and didn't age as gracefully as say, Gunsmith Cats (same manga author, btw), but also short enough that there's really no good reason not to give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I figured. I saw the age and mostly just added it for something to watch when I didn't want to get into something longer.
>> ARTICLE
It was very good at the time, but that was a long time ago. What's the oldest thing you've seen?
>> ARTICLE
The original MSG compilation trilogy. 
>> ARTICLE
[edit: never mind, it's Mobile Suit Gundam, right?] Did the dated animation lessen the experience for you?
>> ARTICLE
Indeed it was. It did at first but it was still was pretty great. It wasn't that huge of a deal. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
[2040](http://myanimelist.net/anime/568/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040) was pretty good, but yeah I could totally watch the original again if they remade it.
>> ARTICLE
2040 isn't exactly a spring chicken either. Just saying...
>> ARTICLE
Holy Shit you're right, it's as old as GTO. I thought it was mid 2000s. Christ I'm getting old...
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna be that guy and say I really want Ufotable to do a proper adaptation of the Fate route. Saber fans would lose their shit in the best way possible.
>> ARTICLE
Stay night has already had so many adaptations it ridiculous at this point
>> ARTICLE
Fate only has one adaptation by Deen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but, ughhh.

Fate route. The route where Shirou is the most unlikable PoS ever.
>> ARTICLE
He's pretty shitty in his attitude towards women but you could certainly finagle it easily I think.

I think Yu Yu Hakusho would do pretty well.  Though a modern remake would lack the amazing fashion choices such as http://imgur.com/QslHTQC

Yeah I would love a remake of yyh , funimation still hasn't licensed poltergeist report.

I agree hell just look at HxH's popularity. It's almost the exact same situation. The author of both of them is the same and HxH had a remake that went really well. 
>> ARTICLE
This is another I would totally watch if they remade it or revamped it. Was one of the first anime I ever go into.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't need to be remade; it needs to be continued whenever the author writes more source material. The anime is up to novel 3 of BotS iirc, and novel 5 just recently came out after a multi-year hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
Going through it right now and loving it. Only seen Crest so far. 
>> ARTICLE
It really is. I was looking for a recent one to pick up and they're pretty much non-existent.
>> ARTICLE
I would love seeing Berserker remade and completed as an anime after the manga ends.
>> ARTICLE
Hah where the story is at the moment, and how long it is I can't possibly see the manga ending any time soon.
>> ARTICLE
Beck. Just Beck. With full story this time please. And don't change the old songs, they were pretty enjoyable.

God I'd love to see the entirety of Beck made. My biggest gripe with the show is that it ended and glossed over the entire trip to the US.

This, I would be so happy if that happen.

Well fuck, guess I was wrong. Sorry!

A remake or a new story or another adaptation of the novels; whatever it's supposed to be, something was announced earlier this year.

Please don't touch Lain, it's as perfect as it needs to be.

Agreed the animation still looks fantastic and interesting. No need to retouch it.

Saber marionette.

It would teach a lesson on how to do a Harem correctly

I remember buying the VHS set at my first anime convention in 98' or 99' and on sale it was $120 (saber marionette J). I still have the VHS cause it was expensive and my first purchase. 
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion..... is that cheating?

I think Cowboy Bebop would do very well if it was updated with full HD as long as it retained it's original style. That's about all I've seen that I would consider "older". 
>> ARTICLE
How would you want Evangelion remade? Possibly editing the end of the tv series and EoE together so it has a better conclusion? 

[It is getting an HD remaster release at least](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/12/01/evangelion-tv-series-and-movies-remastered-for-blu-ray-boxes)
>> ARTICLE
I kind of called it cheating because the Rebuilds are technically remakes... technically.

I would love for it to be edited together, that would be the main thing I want changed. The TV ending was honestly dumb, it was pointless and draws no conclusion even though it serves a purpose. Editing it in with EoE would do the series a lot more justice as far as an ending goes.

I can't wait for the HD release, I saw it over in /r/evangelion and then again here..... my body isn't ready but I will embrace it!
>> ARTICLE
Aren't the movies kinda what you're looking for?
>> ARTICLE
That's why I said it's kind of cheating since they are technically remakes.... I'd rather have the series remade though
>> ARTICLE
No! Cowboy Bebop is so good because is so 90s. Leave it like it is.
>> ARTICLE
A new film along the lines of **["Knockin' on Heaven's Door"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop:_Tengoku_no_Tobira)** would be nice though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually still watching Bebop so I haven't seen the film yet.
>> ARTICLE
Ah. It's basically an additional episode of the show, but it is given more story and background, more action and development, as well as a much higher budget in order to become a movie.
>> ARTICLE
i saw the film recently i agree its animation and directly were amazing. 

the story and writing was shaky at best.


>> ARTICLE
Sounds like Bebop on steroids basically, I'll have to check it out!
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Evangelion would do really well no matter when it would be released.
>> ARTICLE
I'd love to see the original Dragonball remade... the art and animation didn't age well, but it's such a great story!
>> ARTICLE
Ya there's a reason you haven't heard of [Dragon Ball Kai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22777/Dragon_Ball_Kai_%282014%29) (It's garbage)
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was the remake of DBZ though? I like the original dragonball more, I would just love to see that updated
>> ARTICLE
Monster, maybe? With a newer art style and better pacing.
>> ARTICLE
[Voltron!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1448/Hyakujuu-Ou_GoLion)
>> ARTICLE
Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibken I really want this one 
>> ARTICLE
There are many, many older titles which people would enjoy if they got traction today, even without a remake. And lots of them have beautiful animation.

But I can think of things which would benefit from being re-made, and having some limited surgery done on their plot, in the same vein as Yamato 2199. Zambot 3 comes to mind. As do the Nagahama robot shows that preceded it.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno, GTO had a really unique style.  Not sure if HD'ing it in 2015 would be a benefit.

Same with Cowboy Bebop.

The Trigun recommendation in this thread, I could see.

I think that the anime with fighting and action could really benefit from modernization -- Yu Yu Hakusho, with significantly compressed episodes (like a 60ep series rather than its ~108 or w/e), or Rurouni Kenshin with less filler / compressed filler.

Edit:  To expound, I literally just got done with re-watching YYH last week, and the "speed lines" and slow-paced (compared to contemporary anime) action were really grating if I didn't hit "skip forward 3 seconds" every 5 seconds.  The still frames and such were just everywhere and action just wasn't action (compared to current anime).  It could really benefit from an upgrade.

LoGH sure, simply because the animation is *so* freaking dated it's almost painful.
>> ARTICLE
I think a few companies could take GTO's style and polish it up without really losing the feel of it. The crazy expressions and over the top stuff could be modernized to give the same expression but cleaner.
>> ARTICLE
I agree to some extent, but I'm envisioning that a GTO 2015 would look exactly like the original except in higher resolution for example, and maybe better frame interpolation.  It would be more "GTO remastered" rather than a remake/modernization.
>> ARTICLE
Lain. I'd shit my pants.
>> ARTICLE
I've always kind of wanted a remake of Macross.  The original holds a special place in my heart, but there's a distinct lack of itano circus these days.  Plus, since it's hypothetical, I can dream that it'd all be Macross zero quality.
>> ARTICLE
I don't advocate remakes, but [Danguard Ace](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1986/Wakusei_Robo_Danguard_Ace) would be nice.
>> ARTICLE
Saber Rider & The Star Sheriff @ Star Musketeer Bismarck. As long as they retain the original western version of the epic [OP song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKxWl4PcBY4) & Peter Cullen as the voice of [Ramrod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71NDVOsFnmw) (I couldn't care less if the rest of the cast are Japanese or dub). With writings that are more modern and suitable to it's currently more mature audience, I'm sure it'll be one hell of a nostalgia trip.

Both 2013 gems (speaking of Kyousougiga and Uchouten Kazoku) aren't very popular on here. Kyousougiga is the flashier of these stars but overall Uchouten Kazoku resonated with me more and I like its ghibliesque sense of mood and magical realism.

[81.7%](http://myanimelist.net/profile/juiceshow). 

I noticed you didn't have the [Oregairu S1 OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18753/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru._OVA), [Nisekoi OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24227/Nisekoi_OVA), [Nekomonogatari: Kuro](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15689/Nekomonogatari:_Kuro), or the [Saekano Special (   )](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29317/Saenai_Heroine_no_Sodatekata:_Ai_to_Seishun_no_Service_Kai). 

If you liked any of the base material, the specials all add more of what you loved. Neko:Kuro was far from the best of the monogatari series, but I liked it all the same. 

That being said, if I had to recommend anything I would wholeheartedly recommend [Shokugeki no Souma](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28171/Shokugeki_no_Souma)

Not really ranked, but here's some of my favorites/that I've really enjoyed:

* Monster 
* Space Brothers (Uchuu Kyoudai)
* Noein: To Your Other Self
* Probably anything by Satoshi Kon (Paprika; Tokyo Godfathers)
* Dantalian no Shoka (guilty pleasure favorite)
* Tatami Galaxy or Katanagatari probably
* Humanity has Declined
* Seirei no Moribito (possible favorite)
* Texhnolyze (not finished but so far it's a probable fav for me)

Other anime I like: The Bakemonogatari series (I respect and appreciate 'em but I just don't see them as a favorite); Black Lagoon (pure entertainment), among others.

Something like that, anyway. I just want to get to know people, y'know?

I find it difficult to make a top 10 so I'll just list my top 3:

1) Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V

2) K-On!

3) High School DxD 

Here's my profile - http://myanimelist.net/profile/T912938
>> ARTICLE
You're the first person I've seen who likes Arc V
>> ARTICLE
It's a really great show, and compared to other YGO series I think it's the best out of them all (including the "original" Duel Monsters). Great pacing, soundtrack, characters and story. You should check out my [WT! thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/30z6mi/wt_yugioh_arcv/) if you're interested. :D 


>> ARTICLE
I've always put it off because of all the hate I've seen but I guess I'll check it out. (I'm a big fan of the card game)
>> ARTICLE
Here on /r/anime? Most people here just hate it due to "muh nostalgia". They read the plot summary or even just look at 1 or 2 pictures and immediately say it's terrible. I think the plot summaries don't give a great description of what the show's about so I'd avoid them.

On /r/yugioh they have weekly episode discussions and even on 4chan's /a/ board they have daily discussion threads. No hate there, just here on /r/anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online/stats
>> ARTICLE
I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
[](#nozakishock)

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Redline scraping by in photo finish.
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.
>> ARTICLE
I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Thanks for making yours man, otherwise I wouldn't have made this one! I like these kind of things so it was fun. I'll be looking forward to the ones you have planned.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.
>> ARTICLE
In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good 
>> ARTICLE
I loved all of it, really enjoyable
>> ARTICLE
Though I knew about it, you're right, it's almost never talked about. I was surprised by its rank too.

It's like ever only brought up when people are looking for [OPs sung in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOcEiC8hlkU).
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit.

I feel like I need to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
You should, it's pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

[](#yousaidsomethingdumb)
>> ARTICLE
IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?
>> ARTICLE
Yep, sounds like you understand!

Thank you very much for improving off of the original! This is really nice to look at, and it also shows me that I have A LOT of classics/ anime in the top 100 that I still need to watch!

Thanks a lot for putting movies in here, weve had this post before (a long time ago, don't worry Im not criticizing) but they didnt have movies included.

I see the merit in separating them, they're kind of hard to equate with series. But MAL doesn't separate 'em and you actually end up with a nice variety of both when you condense it like this so I thought it made sense!

They're not cannon but they still count as much as the Steins;Gate movie counts :/ unfortunately 

Edit: jk read the list wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Keep in mind these aggregate lists do not necessarily indicate quality, only shows/movies that are widely accepted. People should not treat these lists as "ranks" or anything short of "100 most popular anime."

Eh it's also not popularity, or http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin would not have made it up there.

If you want to be really accurate: it's a list of shows/movies people enjoyed enough to rate highly after they watched them.
>> ARTICLE
Reborn! at 86 is a nice surprise. I think Naruto part 1 deserves to be in this list but it makes sense that it isn't, considering the hate it gets on mal. The top review there complains about its popularity in its first paragraph.

From my quick scan it seems like I only got 30/100.

I don't believe the scores I gave them were that great anyways so I don't feel too bad about missing out on the rest of the top 100.

Well actually they come out to 5.3 which is slightly above my average. Guess they did a lot better than I expected.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

Seriously? I don't want to say it's overrated especially after seeing the thread earlier about calling something overrated but come on. If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.

I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.

I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?

So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.

Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?

I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

[you have](/s "fantastic taste")
>> ARTICLE
What are the bottom row ones?

Kino no Tabi, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Sora no Woto
>> ARTICLE
All that good taste. I thought it would be nice to try it here for a change since /r/anime seems to attract a wider range of viewers. It'll make a nice change from the 10 milliong eva, texhnolyze, mushishi, hainabe renmei and madoka 3x3's that /a/ usually attracts. Not that any of those shows are bad btw.

Oh, a good old 3x3 thread. Wait where am I again?

gah Aria.

I've been *trying* to force myself to watch the show and i'm at somewhat like.. episode 8 but i just can't watch it any more. I just don't find the point of watching it, it seems like nothing interesting happens.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's an iyashikei (healing series). It's definitely not for everyone, but watching one-two episodes is a perfect way to end the day and go to sleep. That's how I watched it.
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of people with Aria on theirs... It seems I should watch this.
>> ARTICLE
I remember when I first joined AniDB, I saw that picture and wondered why the last season, Aria the Origination, has so high score (9.1/10.0 if I remember correctly). After finally watching the entire series, I have no doubts that it's absolutely the best.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first 3 eps and didn't have the time so I dropped it. Might as wel pick it up again.

It's a very feel-good, slice-of-life anime. Very enjoyable when you just want to relax and feel good about the world.

Geass. Didn't care for it. Haven't seen Katanagatari or Evangelion (nowai rite?) but I plan to sometime this month.

Surprised was expecting Mirai Nikki of all things, though I have always felt quite indifferent about Code Geass. Mainly because of the direction the second season took which I really didn't like. Oh and make sure you do give evangelion and end of evangelion, it's a very love it or hate it show but I still think of it as required watching just because of the shows reputation.

Theres probably a few i like more but this was on the top of my Head

TRUE TEARS - I dont want to go into details " kinda forgot a few about this anime " But this anime had me... like the title... crying ahhaha

NISEMONGATARI - In all honesty i think what won me over on this was the OP. Best op in a LONG time. I skip every single OP almost after 1 viewing in most of my animes except this one. The story about the sister and phoenix was amazing too.

CLANNAD AFTER STORY- seriously had my jaw open and couldnt stop watching for obvious reasons 

ANGEL BEATS - In all honesty i think this is my number 1 anime. I would kill for another season or a extended version.

TORADORA - If it comes to pure romance i think this is one of my tops. (also i think theres a reference to this anime in sukiite ii but ill post that soon )

Darkness Ru - I know most people are going to think harem and nudity but in all honesty i love this animes story so far.. The other 2 were little episodes and fun but this one seems darker and you really get a depth of the peoples characters... Say what you want i actually liked this series plot..and boobs ahah

sukitte ii - A new one i saw last week but finished in 1 day and have rewatched... AMAZING romance anime

Hunter x hunter - I believe this is my favorite of the shounens at the moment ( not sure if tis a shounen ) 

Slamdunk - classic

Alot has not been on this... like i loved 

Sora no otoshimono
brotherhood
initial d
one piece
etc.... i need to look at my list to see what im missing but yeah...

Also, WHY do people decide, "This is in my Top 9," before it even finished airing? Sakurasou is only halfway through. Don't get your hopes up that the ending will be satisfying. It's exactly what I thought with SAO. "It's A-1. They won't disappoint me!" Boy was I wrong. But that's 'another' topic. Get it?

So because the show hasn't finished airing yet means it can't be my favorite? Right now it's one of my favorites, and I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to make it one of my favorites.

I wouldn't because it makes about as much sense as people who review shows on MAL a few episodes in.

It's apples and oranges, really. The rest are way more focused on lust than love, to various degrees. Floating Material and Sora no Iro, Mizu no Iro are probably the closest to it in terms of content.  I don't believe any of the other eight have any yuri scenes, though.

>> ARTICLE
I think the just shooting is much better. It was funnier, and it fit Harrison Ford's character much better
>> ARTICLE
Harrison Ford wasn't injured, he drank the local water despite the warnings and spent a majority of the non-filming time on the toilet. While they were filming that scene he had to go again and didn't want to film the scene so he just pulled out the gun and shot the guy. Nobody else knew he was going to do this, not even the other actor that he shot, the guy just went with it in a perfect moment of improv and everybody loved it and kept that version of the scene in the movie.

I stand corrected, I knew it was something related to his health.

But it is not a cacophony of [sad or melancholic whines](http://i.imgur.com/Py78U6w.gif) that accompanies it as it moves on from this world, but [a symphony of cheers and sweet, wonderful blessings](http://i.imgur.com/uVBKPnJ.gif) that are serving as angels to carry it to its slumber. [All men must die, and all men must serve](http://i.imgur.com/l8t0Zdz.gif). I request a toast, everyone. To Monogatari, the [once and future queen](http://24.media.tumblr.com/1a08c24d7ff7bf882e19f2831f285220/tumblr_mvtlzsHGGZ1rb06tgo1_r1_500.gif) ^of ^Chinese ^cartoons. [May you rise again one day.](http://i.imgur.com/J88gfy7.gif)

That being said, it is not over yet. Here, the finals, is where the fate of this [wretched world](http://31.media.tumblr.com/66a961f06e9ce4f55fdc30094b930c06/tumblr_mr03maiHM71qdsh8vo2_500.gif) will be decided upon. The world ends here, with us, and on this day a new age will be born [from blood and fire](http://25.media.tumblr.com/a5eff05fe94bc3a7bb7f507af2b70590/tumblr_ms7rvmbG271r0p39zo1_400.gif). As the sky bleeds and the oceans weep and the [swords clash among the fallen men](http://38.media.tumblr.com/ef86253d7b2685aacfbbae3fe7f16708/tumblr_n84437sXLe1toqhwfo1_500.gif), may we finally conclude this ~~moderately-sized favorite anime contest~~ tournament of champions.

**-- THE FINALS --**

Well, to put it bluntly, I'm voting for Steins;Gate. [And this here is the reason why.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140316140252/dragonball/images/6/64/We5ikbG.gif) Well, that and the gorgeously well-done plot, the endearing characters, the marvelous visuals. But mostly that.

The biggest thorn in Code Geass's side is the particular uniqueness of its visual design and art style. Mostly due to how some more critical anime fans may consider Geass's characters resembling anorexic, high-school-student-cosplaying Slender Men more so than human beings. Shit's kinda iffy, in my personal opinion, but I could see the appeal in it. 

Both series are known for their complicated and interwoven plot points, their captivating characters, and, most importantly, their fucking kick-ass endings.

With that, then, I'd see the main advantage that Geass has over Steins is that many people would probably see the ending to Geass as better and more well-done than that of Steins.

But, is that going to be enough to give Geass the edge overall? My apologies, but I really would rather think not. Personally, Steins;Gate has an iron grip on my heart, and I think on the hearts of countless others. It has its reputation for a reason, and it wholly deserves it. I think Steins;Gate is going to take this tournament, everyone. And if there had to be one series I would rather have win this thing other than 'Gatari, it's Steins;Gate.

[**Steins;Gate has come here to drink Dr. Pepper and kick ass, and it's *all out of Dr. Pepper*.**](http://31.media.tumblr.com/7fa63887e0e008a65a84004c8a499c3d/tumblr_mxtp6lAxct1r3rdh2o1_500.gif)

Good game, would play again, now it's time to strategically retreat back to /r/araragi and [lick our wounds](http://24.media.tumblr.com/de0ad06cf58a7beef2b2636bd9fbeb4f/tumblr_mr0bf7bTyg1rbtx3po1_500.gif).

Also, to anybody who hasn't seen the top four shows yet, you need to get on that. They've survived through this bloody battle royale for a reason, alright? I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari *are* among the best anime has to offer. (EDIT: Although there are other amazing and fantastic shows that just haven't been able to garner enough attention to popularize themselves, mind you.)

And I would really like the idea of a movie-exclusive tournament, although I don't think I'd be able to contribute very well to it. Outside of Satoshi Kon, Makoto Shinkai, Ghibli, Summer Wars, and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and the quintessentials like Ghost in the Shell and Akira, I must admit I'm not too well versed in the realm of anime films.

Others, like [Tsumiki no Ie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5365/Tsumiki_no_Ie) or [Harmonie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20903/Harmonie) or the regrettable [Eikyuu Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1106/Eikyuu_Kazoku), are shorter and more OVA-like. So I'd probably be more informed about the movies than I was about the series... Plus, it's easy to just sit down and have a movie night. 2 hours and done is much simpler to organize than the 4-to-6 hours for many full series runs. That should make for interesting nights as a decent percentage of /r/anime get together and watch movies for a week or so.

> I'm hoping that this tournament can serve as a pointer or guide towards the best that this amazing medium of entertainment called anime has to offer, and Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bakemonogatari are among the best anime has to offer

While I do agree with this, I also think some of the best shows anime had to offer got unceremoniously crushed, while some of the mediocre to downright bad shows made it pretty far. But of course these are opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was definitely thinking about that, take a look at the edit.
>> ARTICLE
of the 4 I hadn't yet watch 'gatari yet. It seems from MAL that the 3rd season is the best. I'm almost done with the first, and dang I find it draining just to watch. It's good...but exhausting. 
>> ARTICLE
Good but exhausting is exactly how I'd describe the show, yeah :P

Make sure you're watching everything in the right order, including the last 3 unbroadcasted episodes of Bake (they aren't on Crunchyroll). It might be annoying if you've already been filled in on this, so sorry, but Bake > Nise > Nekomonogatari: Kuro > Monogatari Series Second Season, in case you haven't.

Also, tell me what you think/thought of episode 12 of Bake when/if you've finished it.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Bake like a week or so ago. Watched it on CR.

The show had something interesting happen in almost every episode, and at times I was very interested in what was going on. At others, though, I found myself a little bit bored.

It was a very weird show, if nothing else. I'd have a very difficult time describing what it's about if anyone was to ask.

I find I have trouble understanding Japanese dialogue a lot of the time. What I mean by that is, a lot of the time in anime characters will have an exchange and then one of the characters will have a reaction that to me makes no sense. They'll act as if they were just insulted, or they'll get a bit upset, or they'll make an exaggerated EHHHHHHHHHH?! face or whatever and I'll be like "wait what? why are you reacting this way?"

Anyways, the 'gatari series seems to be a very dialogue heavy show and so instances like this occur a lot more frequently than in anything else I've watched. I've never really hard anyone complain about this so I assume it's not a common problem. Also I'm a bit slow in general; I didn't understand that in the first like 8 or so episodes that Senjouafesafdrgahara was flirting with and interested in Araragi, and I find I don't 'get' or appreciate a lot of the 'witty' dialogue.

The point of this post, really, was to ask: based on this information, should I continue watching? I really wanted to like this show as much as everyone else seems to, but after season 1 it really seemed just 'okay.'
>> ARTICLE
Well, personal tastes vary so it may just not be your kind of show. With that said - a lot of the wit in the dialogue comes from puns made based on the structure of Japanese language. For example, at one point Araragi is talking with Hachikuji (whose name roughly translates to "89 temples" - this is important) and then fools with her name, for example calling her Shichikuji - this would alter the interpretation of her name to mean "79 temples" - with each mispronunciation, he is, essentially, devaluing her.

So a lot of this is going to get lost in translation, and things like that you can't really help. I feel like the banter is pretty witty on its own English merit, however, although it can indeed be hard to follow.

Ultimately, whether or not you continue watching depends on how much you enjoy the show. If you still think it's an enjoyable show even if you can't catch everything that goes on then sure, keep watching. But if you spend your time confused and lost, then no matter how much I like the show, I'm not going to continue to encourage you to watch it. Go find something else that you can actually *enjoy* watching, because ultimately that's the entire point of any entertainment medium.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for sure. Thanks for the response! I was mostly wondering if it gets notably better in the later seasons, or if its just more of the same.

Overall I guess I enjoyed it, but found it to be nowhere near 'masterpiece' or even 'really good' levels.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really say, myself, because I've just finished Bakemono and nothing else. I'm going to keep watching, and I'll most likely enjoy myself. Same to you though - if you can definitely say you liked it, then I don't see any reason to stop. The opposite is also true though.
>> ARTICLE
I was in the middle of 12 when you messaged me, lol. 

First, someone really needs to teach shaft how human heads work, I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke. 

12 seemed fine. Though I feel that all the "romance" in 1-11 was almost tongue-in-cheek or parody-ish. It was a more "proper" romantic episode. Mostly dialogue, but that's par for the course in this series. Is there something in particular I should be noticing? 

Also, on the site I'm at, I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?
>> ARTICLE
> I had thought the head tilt thing was an exaggerated joke.

The worst part is, I think that Shaft still does think that.

>Is there something in particular I should be noticing?

No, nothing in particular, really. It's just that that episode is considered generally one of the better ones of the series until pretty much all of the Second Season arc finales, and a lot of people really like the ending  of the episode. I really liked it myself.

>I see 15 eps for Bake, are there 18?

No, you're good. Only the original 12 episodes were broadcast as part of the series on television (did you think at all during it something along the lines of 'man, this seems like it could work as a finale'?), and there are 3 final episodes that finish the Tsubasa Cat arc that Shaft set aside to release by themselves, combining to form 15 total episodes. It looks like the site you're using has everything in order, and saved you some work.

When Ushio died, man, that was harsh. After that it got a bit confusing with all of the feels going on at the time. I thought it could've been done differently but seeing the family together was amazingly satisfying and tearjerking.")

> 64- Space Battleship Yamato

Poor Yamato, even getting beat by some pretty terrible stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Poor availability really hurts that one just in terms of likelihood that anyone outside of Japan has actually even seen it, which is a shame because Yamato 2199 is a fantastic show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anyone that hasn't seen it but has seen whatever it's up against would certainly vote for the other one, especially if there's no talk or hype about it.
>> ARTICLE
Even when 2199 came out, there wasn't really all that much interest in seeing the classic. Which is too bad, as it is one of the better anime that came out in that entire decade. (Plus, unlike most people on this sub, I was actually alive when the original Yamoto came out. I wasn't yet out of diapers, but I was alive.)
>> ARTICLE
At last we come to the final round of the Chinese Cartoon Grand Prix. In a result no one was shocked by Steins;Gate and Code Geass move on to battle each other for the coveted /r/anime crown. As much as I hate to admit it the result of this match is pretty much determined already with Steins;Gate as the victor. Unfortunately for Lelouch strategy means nothing when your opponent is a mad scientist, and to be honest I'm not even angry. I'll take second place with pride as I retire to work on my orange farm, good on you Steins;Gate. 

The movie tourney sounds like a great idea. I quite enjoyed this one and you did a wonderful job running it. Looking forward to more.
>> ARTICLE
I know which one im voting for :)
>> ARTICLE
Rest in peace FMA and Monogatari. You fought valiantly, but you were merely lambs led to a slaughter.

Your comrade, Code Geass, will be joining you in this cold dead grave shortly.

All in all, I quite liked this tournament. Steins;Gate did its stereotypical run and there were a couple of close matches.

[NGNL rustled some jimmies.](http://i.imgur.com/aLhZiGi.gif) It probably got as far as it did due to it's "fresh" factor, but it isn't a TERRIBLE show as many people make it out to be. If you started watching the show, you were given it at face value. If you expected any significant character development and no otaku pandering, you came to the wrong place.

Yes there's excessive fanservice, and there might be a certain crossing of lines, (I'm looking at you Shiro) but it's a fun show to watch if you can not get hung up on the "[Super Healthy Space](http://i.imgur.com/L04VDI3.jpg)". It's no great work of art, but it's a show you can enjoy the ride for. 

----

For future tournament formats, I would love to see one excluding the "super popular" franchises so it would be much more volatile. (e.g. no Steins;Gate, FMA, Code Geass, etc) An underdog tournament if you will.

I was pleasantly surprised that Kill la Kill and SAO ranked so low (still pretty high all things considered), but I guess they couldn't beat out the classics such as Angel Beats, Clannad, and Samurai Champloo.

Since we all already know the flaws of the shows that got shot down in this tournament. What does Steins;Gate really fail at? What blemishes could have been improved or was it an untouchable masterpiece? 

One of the major plotholes I see is that "Time travel will ALWAYS have a problem, whether in the future .... or in the past".

Thanks for reading my musings, and I quite enjoyed this tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate*

sorry, it really bothers me
>> ARTICLE
Sorry about that.

I thought I caught all of them >_>
>> ARTICLE
I admit, NGNL being ranked so high maxed out the rustle meter on my jimmies. I agree with what you're saying, it's not a bad show. It knows what it's doing and who it's doing it for, and it executes that particular flavour of entertainment pretty well. But god, reading testimonies of how it's up there with the fucking titans of animation just gets my blood boiling man.

I know, I know, I shouldn't care. Enjoy what I enjoy and leave it to that, but WHO IN THEIR FUCKING RIGHT MINDS COMPARES MADOKA AND NGNL AND DECIDES NGNL IS THE BETTER SHOW OH MY GOD I'M SO MAD ABOUT SILLY JAPANESE CARTOONS.

I realize it's stupid, but I guess I just want my viewpoint to be reinforced by the community I feel a part of, and it hurts seeing a show that I feel is so painfully, painfully mediocre and striving for nothing but, get above what I consider truly meaningful pieces of art. 

EDIT: stupid typo, thanks Arbalor
>> ARTICLE
Meh. Some shows just need to be taken at face value.

If you overanalyze your run-of-the-mill anime, all you're gonna get is bored. It's just a fun anime, and should be viewed as such.

Yes many of the "great" anime tackled great questions and were meaningful works of art, but NGNL is NOT one of those. Not by a long shot. 

Just accept that it's never going to make you question your world and see reality in a new light, and accept it for what it is. Pure unadulterated fun and stupidity. 

Arkada who does Glass Reflections for anime similar to this style. (along the lines of Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) Stu-fective. Stupid yet effective. Stufective. It's not any literary masterpiece, but it sure as hell is fun.

Just don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine. If you want some more intellectual fare, I would suggest Steins;Gate, Ghost in the Shell, or Welcome to the NHK. This is not one of those, and there are MANY more that are better at conveying a message and being a piece of art.

TL;DR Don't overanalyze it. Sometimes the curtains are just blue and it doesn't mean anything. Your AP English teacher can try to convince you that it represents the melancholy that pervades the human spirit as much as she wants, but sometimes the author just means that the curtinas are f*cking blue.
>> ARTICLE
I accept all that, trust me. It's just that, to me anyway, for a piece of art to cross a certain quality threshold, it needs to attempt to tell me something important in a unique way. So when I see a list of "top anime", it bugs me to see a show that I don't consider having crossed that threshold for me personally. Again, I fully acknowledge I'm in the vocal minority on this, and am probably being a humbug. 

And also, I feel KLK and TTGL did stupid fun a lot, lot better than NGNL. I think it did stupid fun with an interesting twist, with unique characters and beautiful animation, and a plot that wasn't centred around weekly doses of deus ex machina.

To be honest, analyzing shit is what I enjoy the most about entertainment. I like shows like Breaking Bad, I like movies like Memento, I like feeling like I'm not only being entertained, but I'm also being taught something. I think that feeling is really, really cool. I don't think that's the only way to enjoy art, or the 'right way', but it is definitely my way. So a show like NGNL that offers nothing beyond the surface at all, bores the utter crap out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Meehhhhhhhh. To each his own.

I totally understand your desire to search out entertainment which also can be thought of on a deeper level. It's a personal choice and it's a great way to judge/enjoy those works.

But trying to apply that to every product of entertainment isn't going to work out well. Intellectualism isn't the focus of any series the majority of the time and judging them on the scale of Breaking Bad and Memento is unfair to all shows in general. They simply aren't geared for that type of audience.

They're for a more juvenile crowd which just doesn't need as much in terms of deep thought. 

This is not a list of "top anime". This is literally a popularity contest in every way shape or sense of the word. This is your high school student council elections all over again. The most popular person wins and the same will be applied to this "tournament".

This is NOT an accurate representation of the "top" anime. It's simply a bracket system which pitted anime of differing caliber against one another and was sorted by the amount of votes.

This isn't indicative of much besides how /r/anime feels about these anime in this particular instance of time.

I agree that analyzing shit is fun, but if you try to analyze SpongeBob Squarepants you're just wasting your time. It's meant to be a source of entertainment with little to no substance (deeper logic, social critique, etc) 

Not everything has to be a piece of art, just the exceptional CAN be. Only the top 10-20 percent of shows have this aspect and I believe it's extremely unfair to judge the rest of those on that standard. 

TL;DR NGNL is entertainment NOT art. Anime can be art, but the vast majority of it is just there for fun/sales.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka is a much better anime than NGNL. I honestly had more fun (enjoyment) watching NGNL. IDK if most people voted on their objective best or what they had the most fun watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Really just depends how you are comparing them. I loved madoka but not as much as the average anime fan apparently. Ngnl however I thought did stupid, ridiculous and hilarious fun amazingly. I couldnt get enouth of it and personally got enthralled in it more so than madoka. Probably in the minority though lol

I'd say you are in the majority. It is just the loud minority that hates NGNL.

WHAT!?! BUT FMAB IS AMAZING!?
>> ARTICLE
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood was amazing, but Steins;Gate is by FAR the standout anime at this point.

Unless you're talking about something else entirely, I don't think that FMA truly beats Steins;Gate in many categories. 
>> ARTICLE
I think its safe to say that there will always be flaws in every show but i feel like the best are the ones that make you overlook the flaws without a second thought. I felt like FMA brotherhood did this the best for me(which is why it is my favorite anime, and one of my all time favorite shows) but the fact that some other people feel that others did it better is fascinating.

Im in the middle of Steins gate and i can say it is spectacular, but it was this subreddit that made me watch it because it wasnt on crunchyroll. I only recently got into anime(only used to watch toonami and adultswim back in the day) and i kept seeing it being praised here and then people were betting on it to take the win against great shows like fma and code geass? "Well shit, now i have to watch it."

Ive put quite a few other shows on my to watch list because of this tournament so i really enjoyed it. And Super Healthy Space too fkng good lol. Kind of annoying that people are hating on it for being good at what it tries to be:fun. 
>> ARTICLE
I quite agree that great shows will be the ones that make you overlook the flaws.

Everyone remember's their first time watching Stein's Gate and I hope you enjoy it as much as many of our other members seem to have. Don't forget to rewatch it to see what you may have missed the first time through.

Recently getting into anime isn't really too much of a problem in my opinion. It's about what you get after you come here. There's a niche for almost everyone, and I'm sure you'll find your stay here quite enjoyable.

I agree that the Super Healthy Space was hilarious. Some times you just need to accept something and move on. If you take things too seriously, then it just gets ruined. Shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill would never be good. NGNL isn't quite on that level, but you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.

It's not MEANT for you to take it as a social critique of child pornography. It pokes fun at fanservice by going excessively overboard with their fanservice. (Notice they removed all genitalia and nipples, common points of censorship) If you take it at an intelluctual level it has gone a couple miles over the line. (11 year old pedophilia much?) 

But it's meant to be a fun show that shows off how brilliantly amazing these shut-ins are and how even magic and [furries](http://i.minus.com/iVPXhWiVv9zSz.gif) can't stop their quest for world domination.

It's an otaku empowerment anime and the otaku pandering is almost a given.

I hope that you enjoy the rest of Steins;Gate and you find many more things to watch in your adventures as an otaku.

Could I get a name or two of shows that are on your to-do list? You don't seem to have a MAL or anything, and I'm quite interested on what you will be watching!

Thanks for the conversation and I hope you have a great day!


>> ARTICLE
Ive been binging quite a bit of shows on crunchyroll whenever i get the time and im getting around to starting jojo, log horizon, and twgok because my friend recommended them. But from the good things ive heard and their placements in this tournament ive decided to check out Haruhi Suzumiya, Angel beats, Hunter x Hunter, spice and wolf and psycho pass. Ive seen most of the other entries.

Yeah its a lot now that i look at it lol. This is going to take a while considering ive got League and a few currently airing shows to keep me occupied. Oh and real life too lmfao
>> ARTICLE
Looks like a pretty good lineup!

Log Horizon is great. I finished marathoning it in like 3 days. And there's a fall season coming up soon!

I haven't watched Haruhi yet, but I have experience with most of the others. It looks like a good list to go on thus far to be honest. Angel Beats pacing sucks quite a bit though so just power through it. The feels you get are pretty worth it.

Spice, JoJo, and TWGOK are pretty niche series, but if you liked the initial premise it shouldn't be too bad of watch. 

League is great, and this season's currently airing shows are pretty amazing thus far. I followed the manga of Akama ga Kiru and I hope that the anime adaptation does it justice.

[Real life is just a video game with shitty gameplay.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/48/486b454f99e9a1962b3defc0b5d5338348214aade0d97b33b231537e87a23b6d.jpg) Seriously though, enjoy your summer. I might give SAO 1&2 a whirl if you really like the concept of Log Horizon. Latter half of SAO1 was mediocre, but the new season is looking pretty amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ive seen SAO1, i enjoyed it although i definitely prefer badass asuna to damsel in distress asuna. 

Im one of those people who will usually like a good show if it has at least some enjoyable qualities, regardless of how niche. And im pretty good with shows with slow pacing, for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its magic/science really interesting.

I have high hopes for Akame ga kill, havent read the manga because i just dont have the time, but from people who have all i hear are good things about it. Zankyou no terror is shaping up to be pretty great too. Im going to wait for a few more weeks to decide if im going to pick up any other airing shows.

Good talking to you though. Enjoy your summer as well.
>> ARTICLE
> for example i am STILL watching Mahouka simply because i find its ONE TRUE TATSUYA IS MY ONII-SAMA

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the original can still hold. I'm interested in Mahouka from the worldbuilding perspective (and will probably start reading the LNs after the show is over) as well as because of /r/onetruetatsuya, so it doesn't need to be an either-or scenario...
>> ARTICLE
I mean i watched it, had fun and all, but 6th place against all other anime ever made? uwot

Can someone explain this hype to me
>> ARTICLE
The hate for NGNL is seriously getting absurd on here. Like jesus Christ. Is it THAT hard for you to grasp that a show meant for fun and enjoyment CAN STILL BE REALLY GOOD. Why is this so hard to grasp? A show doesn't need to be morose, dark, sad, or any of those just to make it into the top. NGNL did what it intended (for many people) perfectly, and that's why it's at a top spot.

Where's your bitching and whining about TTGL winning top 5?
>> ARTICLE
Because like you said, a show meant just for fun and enjoyment without much in the way of depth or meaning can still be really good and enjoyable.

The difference between TTGL and NGNL is that TTGL was really good and enjoyable. NGNL wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe to you. I found Gurren Lagann stupid. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah and you allso have a  shit taste, move on
>> ARTICLE
This is all turning into a circlejerk. Why not accept both shows were most likely placed high for good reason?
>> ARTICLE
Ughh the point isn't that it's a bad show dude. The point is that it's undeserving of its standing. Call me in a year's time when it doesn't even make top 64. That's the whole point. Yet because it's fresh, it beat out classics like Clannad and Madoka. Of course people are going to shit on it.
>> ARTICLE
Which I disagree with. Especially because TTGL made the list, while nobody had a problem with that being there. 
>> ARTICLE
It is 7 years old. I'd say it's passed the test of time.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, great hype is usually followed by unwarranted backlash. Both will balance out eventually, and people will see it for what it is. I wasn't part of the anime scene when TTGL aired, but I'm sure it garnered similar reactions at the time. Just gotta play the waiting game. 
>> ARTICLE
it was pretty easy to get into so lots of people got into it
>> ARTICLE
Nomination topic got downvoted pretty hard and the nominations were limited, so we can't say "against all other anime ever made" first of all. Secondly it's new and popular, and there are a lot of new anime watchers on /r/anime. I think I saw an age poll where the average was around 17 or 18. If this was an older audience, or this poll was held a couple years later, I don't think it would have done nearly as good.

Maybe this poll should be an annual or bi-annual event, it would be really interesting to see how much the standings change.

If it makes you feel any better, I have Ping Pong down as one of my Top 5 anime. Its one of five that I've ever given a 10/10.

Why shouldn't you skip the intro? Did I miss something?

I never skipped it because i love it but i noticed that as you watch it, it changes it's meaning, adding to the show quite a bit. There is also a new intro on the last 2 episodes
>> ARTICLE
oh gotcha. yeah i agree, it's meaning does change as you learn more. I never skipped it either, but I thought you meant that there was something different in them that I never noticed.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Steins;Gate twice, and though I watched the intro most of the times I never really picked up on it being different. Any of the lyrical changes would just be using different parts from the full Hacking to the Gate song, right? Maybe I should have paid attention to reading the song subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
Changes in the last 2 episodes from the full song, yes
>> ARTICLE
The song stays the same but it conveyed more of a message as you go through the anime, giving meaning to the lyrics. Perhaps i'm just kinda dumb... Could be that
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I should pay attention to it when I inevitably watch it for the third time. But that won't be for a while, I feel content having experienced the series (dub+sub), movie, and visual novel (which is even better than the anime IMO).

Well I guess I overestimated this sub's love of Monogatari. I had it beating S;G in the finals, but as I have said before, I would not have been surprised to see S;G, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, or FMA win either.

I do find it interesting that Code Geass and Steins;Gate are battling for the top slot. There are a lot of similarities between Hououin Kyouma and Lelouch, and these shows have two of my favorite endings of all time. In fact I once wrote a [large post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1kv16a/a_deeper_look_at_steinsgate_spoilers/) talking about these two very things, and using the similarities to analyze Steins;Gate a bit.

Steins;Gate and Code Geass are two of my favorite animes but...

Congratulations to Caleb for winning the [Bracket Challenge](http://www.bracketmaker.com/predict_list.cfm?parent=883051). If I did my math right, the closest competitor will still be 2 points behind him no matter what the outcome. For the late people, there are dates next to each entry. Just compare yourself to those that entered at a similar time to see how you did.

I would be thrilled for the movie contest to be done as a condorcet method type vote ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method ) such as ranked pairs or schulze method.

Such a method produces much more "accurate" results, and determines every position rather than just first.  The drawback is it is not quite as fun since you do it only with one complex vote rather than many simple votes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh geez, I remember doing something like this for a math competition. To be honest, 64 votes are going to be intimidating for most people to do.

Perhaps do the Condorcet method in the first round, then use the results of that to make seeds for a bracket-style tournament?

It doesn't even matter who wins this.  I love them both!

welp anyway it would be glorious have another tournament :)
>> ARTICLE
I think it would be fun to have a tournament with anime that don't get much attention on reddit. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with this would be in the voting phase. "I haven't seen either." would stomp both of the two competitors each time. Even with the popular anime in this tournament, that was a pretty common choice that racked up about 20% of the votes. I don't know how fun it would be for the majority of people to vote in something where they haven't seen many of the shows.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if we're given a wider timescale to work with... Ain't nobody got time to watch 8 full series in 24 hours like these polls gave us, so either you saw it before the ball opened or you had to pick None Of The Above. 

Maybe announce the vote on Monday and hold the actual vote on the following Sunday? That might give people enough time to find those less-popular shows via their usual *"perfectly legitimate means"* (*coughcough*) and give them a good watch before the poll opens. Also, too: Make it 4 shows per week. Again, that way we can give a full watch of whatever series we find interesting.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Guess a 1v1 voting system wouldn't really work. Personally I never voted "I haven't seen either", I just skipped voting when I hadn't watched the shows.

Wouldn't really be a tournament, but having a survey format could work. First survey you get to pick 3 anime. New survey for the top 20, limit it to 1 pick and there you go. I am just excited to see the results of who won, personally I don't really care about the 1v1 matchups..
>> ARTICLE
There's no way I can choose between these two...they're both among my very favorites and I've watched each of them 4 times, more than any other anime except for Cowboy Bebop. They were both extremely compelling binge watches that gave me major cases of post-anime depression. 

In the end I'm going to vote for Geass...only because I think Steins; Gate will win this and I want the vote to be as close as possible. 

It's been a fun tournament! ^^^Except ^^^for ^^^NGNL! ^^^I'm ^^^still ^^^salty!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, FMA:B vs Monogatari was the hardest choice I've had to make this whole tournament, they're both 10s for different reasons.

I think for me though, FMA just edges out by the smallest margin imaginable.
>> ARTICLE
It was sad seeing FMA lose, but both it and Steins Gate are great shows. However for the finals I can see Steins Gate winning hands down, primarily due to Code Geass' overall weaker second season. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Steins;Gate...but the one thing I felt is that some of the characters are just **too** strange.

I got used to it as the show progressed, but starting the show and seeing Mayuri, Okebe, and Daru be the way they are is odd.  They are very different.

I really did enjoy Steins;Gate though and I am only on R1 for Code Geass so I will not vote, I am fully loving Code Geass though.  These two are very good, and it was almost predictable that they would be finalists.
>> ARTICLE
If anything I'd say R2 was better than R1 for Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I actually preferred R1. The show devolved into "new, more powerful mech of the day" in R2 which kinda turned me off. Plus I was very disappointed with the resolution with Charles near the end. Too abstract for my tastes.

yeah it's a good show. the brother sister thing really isn't as bad as it was in other shows. it has lots of fanservice (it's ecchi like sekirei, High school of the dead)

watch up to episode 3 and decide for yourself.

If you don't take it seriously, yes. It's a great show.


>> ARTICLE
Against Reddit opinion, I really liked No Game No Life. It hit my top 5 and the unorthodox drawing style made it even better for me. There is a lot of fanservice, but since I watched it in a group that just added humor at times.

I thought it was a very shallow show, but the hype train rolls on.
>> ARTICLE
Agree on all counts that Steins;Gate deserves this win, it's of my top 3 shows for sure. Code Geass is amazing too. Sure, many fault the second season for this that and the other, but other complaints could also be said of Steins;Gate's first half as it isn't terribly interesting in isolation.

We should do this at the end of each season for that season's shows. It'll be a but short and maybe we can do double elimination for more accurate results

This is outrageous. How did Code Geass make it this far?

Because it is one of, if not the best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
You could not be more incorrect. 
>> ARTICLE
What did you not like about it?
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch
>> ARTICLE
Why didn't you like Lelouch? He was the ultimate anti-hero. He was an excellent military strategist, he was charismatic, he was everything you could want in a character. [ R2 Spoiler](/s "And he ultimately sacrificed his own life, and his legacy to make the world a better place") If you watched the english dub, Johhny Yong Bosch did a fantastic job voicing him. What's not to love?

>> ARTICLE
That shit he pulled with Schneizel was a real ass-pull, though. I won't go into details, because I'd rather not have an entire paragraph of spoilers, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about and you've probably heard the same complaint before, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't really Lelouch being a bad character, so much as lazy writing. I agree that the whole thing as complete BS, but I still think overall, despite the sometimes lazy writing and deus ex machina stuff, Lelouch is one of the most well developed, and amazing characters out there.
>> ARTICLE
Of course this is all personal opinion but I felt like [Spoilers](/s "his character was far to unlikable for me to root for him in any way. I don't think he was the ultimate anti-hero, nor excellent military strategist (just pretty clever, but a bit dues ex and a bit douchey haha) and not even charismatic (he's just fake, nothing charming about his character at all).")[](/s "His actions were a little too unbelievable for me to really immerse myself in the show, and Suzaku's terrible character along side him just made it worse. I didn't enjoy the show anywhere near as much as other people because quite frankly I hated a lot of the characters and I was happy to see them stuck in shitty situations because of their so called "great leader". ")[](/s "Anyways, I still feel the show wasn't incredibly intelligent, just very well written. These two things can be mutually exclusive. Well written shows tend to flesh out everything nice a cleanly with characters that have depth (even if they are unlikable). I just don't feel like it was intelligently written. Half the time I felt like all of the plans on Zero's side were far too luck based or flat out suicide. Not to mention he got intercepted quite a few times. While this makes for a believable scenario, I feel like it costed the MC's integrity far too much. It could've been handled better. I enjoyed lots of the exposition and world building more than I enjoyed the actual interactions between Keikakku MC with his godawful leadership skills and his army/anyone ever. It was even more disappointing how the story just fell apart in the R2. It's been a long time since I've seen the show (watched it while it was airing way back in 06), I just never felt like it was worth a rewatch. But you know, regardless of how much I actively disliked Lelouch as a character, I still enjoyed the show, I just don't think it should be anywhere above the Monogatari Series." )

EDIT: ~~oopsie forget to close the parenthesis.~~ Spoiler tags do not work on giant blocks of text.
>> ARTICLE
I can respect your opinion I guess. What made him unlikable? He was pretty douchy at times, but he was smart, and he worked towards a good goal
>> ARTICLE
Being an awful leader. I thought he was a shitty leader.
>> ARTICLE
In the first season, he was a fairly good leader, and even at the beginning or R2. He gave Kallen the Guren, because she is a better pilot, instead of using it as protection for himself, and he wasn't a dictator or anything, he listened to the other members of the black knights. [R2 Spoiler](/s "He was still a good leader at the beginning of R2. In the second episode of R2, an ordinary soldier was trying to sacrifice himself to give Zero a few moments to escape, and lelouch tried to talk him out of it, and to not think of himself as disposable. About halfway through R2, he realized that in order to change the world, not just japan, he needed the entire world to hate him, and so he made several decisions to do so, he betrayed the black knights, and betrayed the country of Brittania even. If anything, I think this makes him a fantastic leader, he gave up his life, and his legacy for the benefit of the world")
>> ARTICLE
I'd said its worth a rewatch.  Maybe the show is just better marathoned.  If you ever do rewatch it, I highly recommend the english dub, the VA really increased how  much I liked Lelouch. I agree with almost everything you said, except for Monogatari being better than Code Geass.  I'd say the Monogatari series is probably my second favorite show of all time however
>> ARTICLE
I watched it in english while it was airing. And Monogatari is my favorite, personally I feel like it surpasses Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Really? It's a fun, campy show, but calling it "the best anime of all time" is a fucking delusion. A good analogy would be calling a cult-movie like Starship Troopers "the best movie of all time". (and I love starship troopers and I don't mind geass).
>> ARTICLE
"Fucking delusion" is a strong phrase. Perhaps you don't feel that way, however considering it's battling for the top spot in 'this' poll means that he's not far off calling it at least, 'One of the best anime of all time' 
>> ARTICLE
Most popular =/= best anime of all time
>> ARTICLE
The difference being? What we consider best is generally directly related to the most popular anime. When you consider that like the top ten anime left on this list are also probably the top ten best anime and the most popular. 

Unless we all just agree "best" is entirely relevant to the viewer and therefore there is no such thing as best anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Example: NGE can very well be considered one of the best anime of all time by many people (critics and the seasoned anime watchers alike!), but it's not even in the top 10. Just look at the sheer amount of reception it's gotten worldwide. It's no secret that NGE was a groundbreaking show that is a true representation of how anime as a medium can successfully convey such controversial, yet well thought out themes and still also appeal to a large audience, yet it's not even in the *top 10* when it very well should be.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, just look at how far TTGL made it. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it's the best show of all time, it has a few too many flaws and plot holes for that, but it is hands down my favorite anime. Lelouch is an absolutely amazing character, and the plot was excellent, but the art is a bit odd, and there are some unnecessary filler episodes from here to there, and R2 started to stop making sense. R2 also focused too heavily on the mechs themselves, as opposed to Lelouch's master strategy.

YES! My favorite two anime in the final! Sorry Code Geass, but Steins;Gate gets my vote today.

Also it might be fun to have a "greatest episode contest", where rather than the whole series you judge based on a single episode.

Last chance to put in your votes.

Man Hunter x Hunter and Code Geass are gonna be paired up against each other very early on. That sucks considering they are both great although Code Geass will probably win because Hunter x Hunter is pretty underrated(not many people have watched it). Code Geass had the best ending of all time but my vote is still for HxH its still the most unique shounen I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
HxH is unique as a shounen, but shonuen as a group are not unique. (I have seen all of both shows and HxH manga) That's the problem. Code Geass was incredible in just about every way, with some of the craziest plot twists and best characters I've seen. Not to mention the animation quality and just how damn good the show looked and sounded.
>> ARTICLE
You think that's bad, next round of voting is going to feature Psycho-Pass vs Attack on Titan. Even worse is the fact that Ping Pong had to face Code Geass in the first round. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong out this early is a travesty
>> ARTICLE
1\. Code Geass versus Ping Pong - *Why*?! Why must you do this to me?!

3\. Great Teacher Onizuka versus Haruhi Suzumiya - This is interesting. A much older show that remains commonly referenced, or the newer, hyper-popular show that's rarely mentioned these days?

7\. It was nice knowing, you, Kill la Kill.

8\. Hanasku Iroha versus Gurren Lagann - I'm fine with either of these.

Day 2 Results:

Not surprised about Clannad versus Index/Railgun, but still a bit sad. Well, it's also an uneven franchise. I'm really glad Shinsekai Yori won, but while sports shows are still popular on this subreddit, considerably less than elsewhere I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I was also sad to see Railgun lose, but also a bit happy... because all the other 7 I voted for won so if Railgun won it would have been 8/8 and I would have been the definition of popular mainstream taste.  My hipster card would have been revoked.
>> ARTICLE
I know right? I have to vote ping pong, not that I think it has much hope against Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I voted Ping Pong too, but if it wins, it'll ruin my bracket. >_>
>> ARTICLE
My bracket is sitting happily at the bottom. I just went for whatever I was going to vote.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised, at this early juncture, at how close Kill la Kill and Evangelion are.
>> ARTICLE
Just goes to show how bad the community's taste can be. (Not that Kill la Kill was bad by any measure, but definitely not better than Evangelion) 
>> ARTICLE
Define bad taste? Other than people liking shows you don't like, or rate highly of course. Because that's absolutely idiotic, people predominately watch anime for entertainment/escapism, not to distinguish what's the best on offer within the medium or to please short sighted people. It's that shallow mindset which stops a lot of people from getting into anime.

Ping Pong is going to get absolutely smashed in those match ups despite it not even being bad, but simply because the majority of people pegged it as simply a sports anime and didn't bother picking it up. That's understandable. I could easily say that even with Evangelion being a huge anime, it's not as easily accessible nor it is something you try to introduce a casual watcher with. Whereas Kill la Kill is the exact opposite, it's easily understandable why things are winning here, it's not majorly due to 'bad taste'. Whatever you believe that to be. I'm sure many of the Kill la Kill watchers could easily enjoy Evangelion, if they'd even seen it, and they'd seen enough anime to understand why it's so good. It's the same exact reason GTO is getting smashed, not as easily accessible as Haruhi, nor is it 'new'. I've never seen GTO on sale in any place I live, Haruhi is always there begging to be bought.

This is a poll of favourites, not what is better. I thought that was absolutely evident with the amount of fantastic shows left out of the poll, apparently not?
>> ARTICLE
What stops a lot of people from getting into anime is the garbage ecchi and moe shows that become popular now turn most people away. Bad taste would be someone who likes a show that is not good for an invalid reason. (Such as for escapism or guilty pleasures) It introduces people to anime that are meant to be watched for these reasons, creating a worse community,  and therefore worse future products. It saddens me that people would want the anime industry to turn into a bunch of No Game No Life's and Kill la Kill's over a Monster or a Welcome to the NHK.

Depends what you consider as 'garbage'. Again you're only focused on what you like. I introduced a friend to anime through K-ON! They've went on to watch tonnes of great shows. The easy to digest ones you seemingly put down are great for bouncing people into better crafted anime.

> Bad taste would be someone who likes a show that is not good for an invalid reason. (Such as for escapism or guilty pleasures)

God knows how you consider escapism and guilty pleasures to be an invalid reason for enjoying shows. You've ruled out an enormous amount of people who watch any type of entertainment... again, short sighted.

How is it creating a worse community? Explain. Because you've just essentially insulted half the subreddit by saying they have bad taste, and what? That makes you the 'better' part of the community? You think you're better than them because you watch different shows? Get over yourself.

I'd take Monster or NHK over KlK or NGNL any day, but I wouldn't put other people down for doing the opposite, it's just bad manners and a disgusting attitude which puts people off going further into anime and its community if they get shit on for enjoying something.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair people who literally stop enjoying something because of what people on the internet say are thin-skinned as shit and have obviously never been on the internet for longer than five minutes.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the question isn't what's a better show, but which one did you like better.  I can pretty easily understand why someone would like Kill la Kill better.  There's probably some availability bias as well since I can't think of anywhere to legally watch Evangelion and cant possibly be the only person who avoids watching shows illegally whenever humanly possible.
>> ARTICLE
With Evangelion, there aren't even any reasonably priced dvd's. I'll probably buy if it gets a rerelease.

I had to use a new site because of the pay wall on the last one. This one has the bonus of letting you see the results live, but unfortunately I had to make a different page for each poll. I tried Google survey, but it doesn't track IPs, so one person could have spent 5 minutes and voted 50 times.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I know this might seem like a big ask. 

The first set of voting had an extremely small sample size of 66, in voting session 2 you have hundreds of responders. I know the results are unlikely to change too much for session one, but what do you say about redoing it with the strawpoll voting, just to add some validity and credence to this data?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. Already having one set of results out might effect how people vote in the second go around. Also day 2 may just be an anomaly as far as voting numbers go. If the topics don't get the same amount of upvotes to keep it on the front page, they'll get sub-100 votes again. Naruto and NHK fans will also be howling "rigged tournament!" if they pull the short straw the second time.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, thats a fair response. I hope these atleast make front page, no idea why they are getting downvoted.
>> ARTICLE
Guys, upvote this thread so that people can see it. The larger the sample size the better.

Yeah seriously. Over a hundred people have voted and the thread only has 20 upvotes. Either people are not upvoting or tons of people are downvoting for no reason.

> Code Geass vs Ping Pong

I know that on such a large scale, there are going to be definite flaws in the voting system, but isn't it sort of unfair to put something that's been considered a classic for 5+ years against a show that, while incredible, had only just ended about a month ago and hasn't really had the time to gather a large fanbase?

I'm aware that you could say the same thing about No Game No Life vs Dragonball, but unlike Ping-Pong, which is a smaller niche show, NGNL is straight off of a massive hype train. I don't think it's much of a surprise that something that's been filling a large portion of r/anime's front page  won against a juggernaut like Dragonball/Dragonball Z.

One has to wonder how that specific poll would like like in a year, once the hype has died down a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Suprised that NGNL beat out Dragonball by that much. Nice to see that OHSHC and YuYu were close. 

Edit: On a side note some of these were incredibly hard to answer...GTO vs Haruhi? Damn, you dark. 
>> ARTICLE
I just hope the NGNL crowd doesn't beat Madoka.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Ngnl was cool, but madoka will still be relevant in 10 years.
>> ARTICLE
And then we get fairy tail vs k-on...
>> ARTICLE
Funny thing is I've only seen k-on and SAO of those choices
>> ARTICLE
Started out a little slower than yesterday, but it looks like we're going to reach around the same numbers. I thought Bleach and One Piece would be a little closer, but I guess since Bleach concluded, it lost some of its steam. Kill la Kill and NGE is still too close to call. I've been rooting for Kill la Kill. Definitely the more entertaining series in my opinion. I've only seen the original NGE series though. Maybe if I saw any of the movies I'd have a better opinion of it. The biggest surprise for me is that SAO is losing. No one can say now that the series with the higher viewership will always win. SAO more than doubled Fate/Zero's viewership, but it's getting destroyed.
>> ARTICLE
It probably has to do with the fact that both SAO and Fate/Zero are fairly popular (and recent) shows, so there's an actual competition rather than "what genre do people watch more?" Emphasized with Hansaku Iroha vs TTGL, but I think options for "I've only watched x" would have been helpful at the start. Just to see what people who've watched both really think. 

Also, the general attitude toward SAO on this sub...
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, I can already see Madoka and then Shin sekai yori/Clannad losing to NGNL, lets hope the hypetrain falls off till the next voting.

On an unrelated note, can't we sticky these threads for greater visibility? 
>> ARTICLE
KLK and NGE are nearly equal in votes.  

Absolutely disgusting to the highest degree
>> ARTICLE
NGE pretty much got me into anime and I found KLK mediocre at best. I'll be so bummed out if NGE gets eliminated. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't like either one, I couldn't stand the art style in KLK and NGE I just found boring. However if I were to pick one I think KLK would be my choice from a personal standpoint despite knowing NGE is superior when it comes to quality.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh, I hate when other people like different things than me
>> ARTICLE
Elitism is a way of life, amigo.
>> ARTICLE
So I couldn't vote for one of these. The third option should be "I have not seen one or both of these shows". I hate Haruhi but have not seen GTO, so I had no option to pick (As much as I would have liked to say I have not seen Haruhi). Also people really should not be voting unless they have seen both shows anyway, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Picking between Kill la Kill and NGE hurts my soul.
>> ARTICLE
It pains me to vote against GTO but TMoHS is a top 5 for me.
>> ARTICLE
3. I know both shows are pretty well known and well regarded for obvious reasons, but I am kind of surprised to see Haruhi holding its own against GTO. 

4. One that is surprising me the most at the moment, I honestly didn't think K-On had a chance, but it looks to be holding its own. Still pulling for fairy tail though.

6. Really wish I could have voted for One Piece, but no matter how  much I like one piece, I can't vote for it since I have not seen Bleach yet. 
>> ARTICLE
K-On!'s too cute to lose. I should have picked it in the second round as well.
>> ARTICLE
But....Fairy Tail has cute characters too. There's the snowman,the cat people, a flying owl man and a goat in a suit....that can push them to victory.....
>> ARTICLE
Hang on a minute, 21% have not seen *EITHER* One Piece *OR* Bleach? How is that statistically possible on the Anime sub?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen either. Their length is too intimidating to start, and Dragon Ball is the only power-up shounen I need.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they have seen some of it and not all of it? Or at least not enough of it to pass a judgement ?

RIP Hanasaku Iroha

I'm surprised to see Kenshin losing to HxH.  I guess HxH is winning because it is currently airing.  Kenshin though has some of the best fight scenes out there, and good characters/drama/story to match.  Do yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't.  Not hating on HxH at all, I love it too, but Kenshin is definitely my pick here.
>> ARTICLE
Aww, sorry to see raildex out so early. I liked those.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, did my civic duty and voted for Eva, for whatever good it will do.

A shame Ping Pong gets sniped early by one of the heavyweights, but it was never gonna win, so eh. We might actually have the deciding vote long before the final - Madoka versus NGNL.
>> ARTICLE
Voting time is almost over. Get those last votes in!
>> ARTICLE
**Code Geass** vs Ping Pong - Ping Pong was a good series but Code Geass is sure to become a classic in the near future. It has a great ending and is generally considered one of 2006's best shows and as I am personally of the belief that the importance of endings is quite large Code Geass was a no brainer here.

**Hunter x Hunter** vs Rurouni Kenshin - I enjoyed Kenshin and all but HxH is a very unique and good shounen series. While I do find it has major flaws I still think it's one of the best shounen series out there.

Great Teacher Onizuka vs **Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu** - I personally watched both for quite a while but I couldn't get into GTO and dropped it after 20 episodes while Haruhi was quite enjoyable all be it somewhat confusing.

**Fairy Tail** vs K-on! - I thought K-on! was very meh... nothing special really however Fairy Tail isn't all that special either and if it would be only the 2014 version I would've surely selected K-on! but the first season of Fairy Tail is somewhat enjoyable so I gotta pick Fairy Tail.

**Fate/Zero** vs Sword Art Online - Quite honestly in my mind this is a question of general quality versus target audience so Fate/Zero was a given.

**One Piece** vs Bleach - A nice matchup but in my eyes not close what so ever mainly thanks to the comedy of One Piece which in my eyes makes it superior, I also believe One Piece to have more interesting characters and Tite Kubo's writing to be pretty crap.

**Kill la Kill** vs Neon Genesis Evangelion - Now I don't really like either one of these series however my reasoning is different for not liking them. With NGE I found the series to be boring and bland and I couldn't stand Shinji or Asuka. But with KLK I dropped it simply because of the art style and as such I've made KLK my choice.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann vs **Hanasaku Iroha** - Honestly this one was finished at the announcement of the matchup but I believe Gurren Lagann to be among the most overrated series in anime and that is the only reason I went for Hanasaku Iroha.


From day 2 I'm a bit surprised about the votes on Ouran Koukou Host Club, I thought it was more popular than that. I'm a bit sad that Kuroko lost out as I'd love to see a matchup between my two favourite series (Kuroko and Clannad) but aside from that 3 other series in my top 6 advanced to the next round so I'm quite pleased with the results.

>> ARTICLE
ping pong is extremely more quality than code geass, code geass is mostly a hollywood-action style series that promotes flash over substance, while ping pong is a phenomenal character study. it's probably easier to watch code geass, but i'd recommend ping pong over it 100/100 times.
>> ARTICLE
Idk... I liked Ping Pong but it had a lot of areas it was lacking in as well.
>> ARTICLE
like what exactly? hardly anything was less than stellar in that anime
>> ARTICLE
Well a given is it's art style, very off putting and hard to get used too.

Other than that I'd have to say that the OST and general SFX were nothing special at all though I did take a liking to the opening.

The general story wasn't strong either, the show felt more character driven.

The characters however were very good, especially Peco and Smile.
>> ARTICLE
alright i can respect what you sayin, but in general i think that anime characters are so badly written that ping pong is a huge breath of fresh air, and everything that came with those characters was icing on a delicious cake 


>> ARTICLE
Gonna have to vote SAO over F/Z. Fate/Zero might have been technically better, but I just couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't stand most of the characters and it was trying way too hard at being all grimdark. SAO I at least had fun with. (especially the first half)
>> ARTICLE
That's going to be an interesting matchup...

SAO has hype over Season 2, but it's got a great amount of people who dislike it and would vote F/Z just because it's NOT SAO. 

On the other hand, F/Z is absolutely amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the results of last round, it seems we will have the two of the most overrated shows in the history of this subreddit going at it.
>> ARTICLE
Which in particular are you talking about? 
>> ARTICLE
Not the same person but if I had to guess I would say he means NGNL vs Madoka
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't see how people can call Madoka overrated to the degree they are. It's a fantastic show and it's super well done. I'd have to say that I think Gurren Lagann, KLK, AoT and NGE are all way more overrated.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren lagann and especial evangelion earned their position you can't say one of the most influential shows of the past 20 years is overrated 
>> ARTICLE
Idk I mean... Evangelion does have it's credibilities but in all honesty I don't find it anywhere near as good as people claim. The only reason I tend to mention it is because it's a classic. Gurren Lagann however is a different story as it can't really be said to hold the value of a "classic" yet... In my eyes atleast and especially here TTGL is looked upon as some divine creation.
>> ARTICLE
How exactly did Gurren Lagann "earned" their position? Eva is influential, but so is Madoka. It has also won more awards than any other series beside Eva and broke many records with its releases.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann I'll concede but Madoka may be popular but it hasn't had the impact of Eva nor did it inspire as many copycats so Eva is in no way overrated 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't say Eva was overrated. 

I'm simply saying it is hard to call something overrated when a series is loved by both fans and critics alike.

Read a lot of doujins before. Particularly liked Takuji's (Number 2) style. Read all of his Oreimo doujins, but I wasn't really interested in the series much, they just had cute characters. Friend insisted I should check out anime so I decided to check it out and first result that popped up for anime was Crunchyroll. On the front page they had an ad for Oreimo S2, and I recognized Kirino. I liked her design so I started to watch Oreimo S1. I enjoyed it, so I kept watching, and after it was over I felt kind of empty inside. No animated show had made me feel like that before. I did some research, read interviews with the author about the end, and read the light novel, but I still wanted more. I heard very good things about Angel Beats and Toradora from my friends, and they seemed to be highly regarded online, so I watched them too. And that is how I became hooked. Still have many great shows to watch and catch up on, but I'm getting there.


TL;DR: Recognized a character from a doujin, started to watch. Stayed for the emotions, story and differences from western animation. ^yes ^I ^did ^it ^backwards

That was interesting and rare as fuck.  I never thought I would ever read something like that.

I watched Attack on Titan and SAO.

My friend who already was into anime said "Dont be a filthy mainstream anime watcher."

Thanks to him I actually have sense in what I watched and don't just praise the shit out of AoT or SAO.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you for being one of the reasonable ones.
>> ARTICLE
Can you explain what you meant by that comment?

I'm a little bit tired and my brain did not understand what you meant by that comment.
>> ARTICLE
Half jest. However, to be blunt, a noticeable amount of people who heap praise onto AoT and SAO are weaboos. You sound like you are being critical of what you watch, and don't immediately fangasm over everything anime, and react poorly when someone has a differing opinion from yours.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair though, I feel like this phenomenon has kind of gone full circle - people are afraid to mention their genuine like for SAO and AoT because of the backlash they'll receive at how mainstream those shows are seen to be, which is a shame. If you like a show, you like a show. 

Personally I think SAO started off exceptionally well but rapidly got worse (2nd cour onwards), such that I do think it is overrated and I wish Japan wasn't so into it so they could support other projects.

AoT on the other hand, I honestly thought was excellent - mostly because of the stellar soundtrack. I think praise can be justified regardless of how big the fan following is. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes very true, I noticed people who watched only "mainstream" stuff tended to act that way almost all the times I talk to them.

However I really need to thank my friend on this one, I feel like I would be on the same boat as those other weeaboos had my friend how opened my eyes and showed me more into anime.

>and react poorly when someone has a differing opinion from yours.

I'll still bitch if you talk shit about SHIROBAKO though :p

Funny story...

Was playing League of Legends with a mate and he pressed Zhonya's Hourglass and yelled 'WATCH OUT FOR THE GOLDEN BOY". I thought it was a reference of some sort (it wasn't) and looked up Golden Boy on youtube where I found a hilarious dub clip of the Golden Boy anime. Finally found the full series and watched it all and loved it. 

Around that time I was lurking around some anime groups as well and picked up Welcome to the NHK which is still one of my favourites today. That same friend also told me to watch Clannad after I got him to watch NHK and I guess the rest is history. 

For a while we'd watch a series every weekend but after my internet couldn't handle it and since we finished school we've kinda just gone our own ways in terms of watching anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah when I was still in high school I watched just about every anime and now I hardly have the time to watch anything. 
>> ARTICLE
Watched a ton of anime on toonami back in the 90s (g gundam, sailor moon, dbz) but I didn't really get into it seriously until around 2007 when I watched Haruhi and the then airing Lucky Star out of boredom. After that I started keeping up with currently airing stuff as well as going back to watch classics like cowboy bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto was my gateway series. As a new anime watcher at the time, I was stunned by the scale and drama of everything. But more than that; the sheer emotional/philosophical maturity of it compared to your average western cartoon. I hadn't watched animation like it - it had depth and meaning. It wasn't just vapid entertainment for children. 

I mean, I'd watched stuff like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh when growing up, but I guess I never really "counted" them.

Anime seemed to value all the things in storytelling that appealed to me, so I was hooked. 
>> ARTICLE
Ever since I was a kid, I had watched whatever anime that were aired on the television regardless of the genres. The anime filtering was quite strict in my country and most that got through were the mainstream one.  
  
During those time, I didn't have computer, internet nor channel subscriptions so the options were very limited for me. I remember watching a Gunslinger Girl marathon, an all nighter, at my cousin's house that has Animax. My thought was it would be a waste if I didn't use this chance to watch something new.  

The turning point where I became serious was when a TV channel made a special midnight segment for anime. Although it only lasted for a year. It started with Trinity Blood, Shakugan no Shana, Jigoku Shoujo, Suzumiya Haruhi and ended with Basilisk. All of it left a deep impression towards me as it deviate from what I had already watched in the past.  

I wanted more so I saved my school allowance to buy anime dvd. Since then, I never looked back again. I was a rather picky when choosing what I want to buy as it must worth the money I spend. Each time I went to buy one I will read all the synopsis of all the available anime and carefully evaluated them, except for Spice and Wolf because I only need to look at Holo to know it was a good bargain. 
About half a year ago, I had managed to afford a computer and it has become easier for me to follow the season and other great series that I haven't managed to watch yet.  
>> ARTICLE
A whole bunch of my friends back in elementary were all really into DBZ. I pretended that I was super into it too, because it was the cool thing to like at the time. Eventually I got sick of having to pretend like I had watched it, and got my hands on the first season. Been hooked to anime ever since. (Around 11 or 12 years at this point.)
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana. Not to say I didn't watch anime before, since I had previously watched shows like Death Note, Soul Eater, Reborn, Bleach, etc. (all the shows people were raving about and pressured me to watch), but it was the first show I "entered" myself. Also, it, Haganai, Mayo Chiki, and Clannad were pretty much my only sources of media while I was without internet for 2 weeks. It really set my anime love into overdrive. Unfortunately, I turned really critical over time. Now, I have a nicer balance between critical and lenient, and I can tolerate/enjoy a lot more shows (although it also helps that the anime well has run pretty dry).

Back when Sci fi Channel was called Sci fi Channel, they would apparently show anime late at night on the weekends. This was before they had a dedicated anime block, mind you. Anyway, 16, at a friends house who actually had cable, I did what anyone in my situation would do and watched cable tv all night long. The show was Galaxy Express 999. They were running some kind of marathon or something because it was on until about 3 or 4 in the morning, at which point that programming block began reairing from the beginning until about 7am. I was kind of hooked after that.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the mainstream american ones like pokemon, yu gi oh, digimon. I watched season 1 of code geass and then later on both seasons of k-on. Loved k-on. But I still didnt really get into anime yet or made a MAL.

Then I watched Clannad.

The rest is history.

Totoro about 25 years ago!  Started to watch other Ghibli films and the occasional Doraemon or Dragon Ball soon after.  Around 5 years later I saw brief glimpses of Ghost in the Shell before I was swept away because of the nudity in it.

Probably need to tackle this as a 2-parter.

1. Code Lyoko, for being the first show I continued to watch online after it stopped airing on TV.

2. Music that I played on my ocarinas.  Specifically, music by Joe Hisaishi (for Studio Ghibli), Yuki Kajiura, and Lillium from Elfen Lied, which all got me interested in watching the associated shows/movies.

I had a hardcore otaku as a friend in 6th grade, and when ever I went to his house (which was often) he would turn on funnimation channel and we would watch whatever was on (usually Soul Eater or Ouran High School Host Club). Later, I had a different hardcore otaku friend who was reading Death Note, and would let me borrow a volume here and there (I read volumes 1, 3, 5, and 8) and so a few years later I got back into anime by watching Death Note, been a filthy casual ever since

Well, like many other people, I started already as a Kid. 13 Years ago, when I was still 8, Digimon, Pokemon and Dragonball Z were all over the Channels in my Country, and obviously, Friends were talking about them, so I had to watch them too. But due to several private Circumstances, I could not watch Anime for a long Time and lost gradually interrest in it.

Around three Years ago, I read several Posts on an Off-Topic Thread on a Gaming-Forum about how this or that Anime is awesome, and remembered how I watched Anime as a Kid. In a fit of Nostalgia I asked them what a good Anime to start would be- and then they recommended Fairy Tail. now, 3 Years later, Ive watched around 60 diffrent Series, OVAs and Movies, and own over 350 Manga-Volumes.

I knew the existence of anime for years previous just due to whatever aired on TV but I was "formally" introduced by a friend I met in a young peoples theatre group I was in after I had finished high school the year before.

One of the first ones he showed me was Bleach and every so often I would go around to his place to watch anime and it progressed from there. 

10 years later and it has been downhill ever since ;)

A scene from Sekirei where Minato wakes up between Kazehana and Uzume's bare tits that I saw on Megaporn (Old website that was part of the [Megaupload websites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload#Company_and_services)).

I got interested in the series afterwards and got Bleach suggested from a friend after he saw me watching Sekirei. The next school year a korean guy who was into anime enters our class and he suggested me a lot more series which then slowly got me into anime. It also helped that I was familiar with them from my childhood.

Started in the spring of 2013. Got into anime through 4chan. If you browse 4chan daily for long enough, you will eventually give anime a try no matter how against it you may be at first. Took me like 6 years but I was finally converted.

Watched Death Note first, marathoned it because I was so into it. Got hooked from there.

Oreimo was my second anime, due to its popularity on /a/ at the time. Quite the jump in genre, I know, but I really liked it (   )

Man I remember playing the flash game for Love Hina and always wondered what it was from and ended up finding the anime.

I was always vaguely interested in the badly-dubbed shounen anime on morning TV back when I was younger, but I never managed to catch a full episode before leaving for primary school. The first series I properly got into was Death Note, back when the dub was airing on ABC2 or SBS (I forget which) in 2007-ish. 

I didn't really consider watching other anime for a while until some time in late 2009, when I was bored during my summer break and decided to see if there were any anime streaming sites. Somehow or other I found the subbed version of Love Hina, which is probably what really got me into anime - it was my first subbed anime, it introduced me to a lot of the usual tropes, and I marathoned it over two days. I slowly started branching out via recommendations of similar shows, marathoning a few more things straight afterwards, and after years of expanding into airing series, online communities and so on I've ended up as a fan.

98 and 99 are the only two years where I've seen all 3 of the top 3. I was 2/3 for 97. I've also seen more Anime in the top 3 in the 90s than the other decades. Weird since I didn't start watching Anime until 2004 or so. 
>> ARTICLE
As was 1988. Also, 2008 is generally considered one of the stronger years iirc. 

I guess 2018 will be a year to look forward to.

1998 Masterrace!

Now I love InuYasha, it came out at the exact right time for me to love it, but is really the third best anime to come out in the year 2000? Guess Ill have to do some investigating.
>> ARTICLE
If you love InuYasha, have you explored the previous Takahashi Rumiko series like Ranma and more importantly Urusei Yatsura? Or Maison Ikkoku?
>> ARTICLE
In 2000, we didn't know that the story wasn't going anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
The manga ending was cute
>> ARTICLE
The list excludes sequels, so yes and no. Banner of the Stars, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2, Detective Conan Movie 04 and Vampire Hunter D (2000) were left out. I guess it depends on whether you count seasons/sequels separately, or just count entire franchises/series as being one anime

Hell yea, Dougram and Votoms made the top three of their respective years. Ryosuke Takahashi banzai~

Hell yeah Space Cobra! My mother was huge fan, as a result I watched a lot of episodes with her when I was younger and it was awesome. The rugball arc was one of my favorite thing as a kid
>> ARTICLE
Your mother (and by extension yourself) is a damn cool lady.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first season of Mushishi with a friend in the last few days and I have to say it's one of the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. It just sucks you into this world and you want to know more about the Mushi and everything surrounding them. To everyone who wants to see and anime that is athmospheric and tells beautiful stories of a rich world go and watch it!
>> ARTICLE
And I have effectively seen 0 of them, except for those that aired on TV. Great times.

Good to see patlabor there.

This list reminded me I still need to finish Monster. So much anime, so little time :(

Thanks for doing this.  I'm fairly new to anime, so I'm always looking for more titles I should watch.

Shoutout to Kino's Journey for top anime I've seen that nobody else has seen.

I haven't seen much of it, but I fucking love it.

Episode 2 was just... Woah.
>> ARTICLE
don't be silly, it's quite popular
>> ARTICLE
On here? Not so much I think. It's pretty popular among critics and bloggers though.
>> ARTICLE
firstly, I addressed someone who claimed *nobody has seen it*

secondly, here I believe it belongs to the broad category 'upvoted while regularly mentioned as *not popular, yet fantastic*'
>> ARTICLE
Okay, semantics. It might be popular but not many people have actually seen it, which is what he was trying to say in that "Shoutouts to" meme-hyperbole I think(only 38k finished it on MAL).
>> ARTICLE
Lots of great shows I recognize here, and lots of shows I guess I need to check out. Hopefully more people will watch Planetes and Princess Tutu, and other, older shows as a result. Anime existed before 2007 :D

Thanks for the list, very useful! I would've suggested also adding the English titles where applicable, though :)
>> ARTICLE
I was pleasantly surprised to see Princess Tutu up there. Didn't think it had a wide enough appeal for it to rank like that.
>> ARTICLE
Wide appeal is more about how popular it is, but how can you watch that show and not like it? I'm actually of the opposite mind - recommended it to some older friends with kids, like Avatar - everyone can watch it, and there are multiple layers to engage with it on, so the more you put into the show, the more you get out of it. Something for everyone to enjoy and appreciate without feeling like you're "watching down" or missing stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that in 1970 the top 3 is spots anime.
>> ARTICLE
Urusei Yatsura!

Kimagure Orange Road!

Interesting to see how many full-length movies are in the top 3 over the years.
>> ARTICLE
No Ranma?
>> ARTICLE
It's there, under 1989.
>> ARTICLE
I guess 1972 was a down year for anime, considering the top entry is ranked #2763.

Well, it's either that or nobody's really seen any of the shows that aired in 1972.
>> ARTICLE
MAL's demographic includes few Japanese people and few people who were even alive in 1972, and not much of the anime from back has ever been exported. [Muumin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8235/Muumin_\(1972\)) for example was *super* popular in Japan, but has less than 500 completed watchers on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
> MAL's demographic includes few Japanese people and few people who were even alive in 1972

This. Absolutely, this. Basically no one in Japan uses MAL- why? because it is not IN JAPANESE. Nevermind there are many other anime info services for Japanese users...

Huh, I wonder if Dougram really is considered that good or if it's just #2 by virtue of being alright. Downloaded it a few weeks ago.

Gintama in most planned to watch doesn't surprise me one bit. It seems like quite the mountain to tackle, but it pays off!
>> ARTICLE
I started it a few months ago but couldn't get past the episode after looking at that huge number of episodes even though I've watched the big 3.
>> ARTICLE
some people say it starts to get better at 25. I definitely liked the episodes before, but you might wanna try to hold out that long. Obviously if you notice that it's not for you you shouldn't push yourself
>> ARTICLE
I've heard that too but I didn't have the motivation back then to watch it. That changed since back then though so I might pick it up again soon.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it.  I watched 74 episodes and I find it...  Okay nothing really special.  Just most of the comedy in it is not for me I guess
>> ARTICLE
Is it true the premise combines sci-fi with samurais? Oh did I get that wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
well in theory yes, it's sci-fi with samurais. but it's much more. It's the comedy that makes the show, so the setting doesn't matter all too much  (it's still very well used). So you see loads of aliens showing up in feudal japan with spaceships. Just see for yourself, it's tough to describe.

201

You're wrong its more than 201 its 260-ish

You're talking about different series. Gintama has 201, Gintama' has 51 and Gintama Enchousen has 13.

Its still Gintama? 

When we talk about Naruto we talk about Naruto and Shippuuden they're the same show just with a little pause between them.

Not to me.

So you think Gintama' isn't a part of the Gintama series?

he did say *over* 200

It was most likely due to the first four episodes, which were so bad that their director [was fired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Star_%28manga%29#Anime) over them.

I don't know how much effort it would take, but it would be interesting to see these figures adjusted for popularity.

If show X is in 100 peoples lists, and 90 dropped it, while show Y is in 1000 lists, and 91 dropped it, it obscures the relative ratio.

I am unsure why this sub takes such a disliking to ecchi. It's just another genre, granted catered to a certain age, after all.

Well the main reason is a large portion of it's "fanbase" just use it as masturbation material.

Wait there's a censored version? Well I guess that makes sense.  For when it aired or something
>> ARTICLE
How do you put Hellsing Ultimate on hold o.O
>> ARTICLE
probably because it took like 6 years for 10 episodes to be aired at a pace of 1-3 episodes per year. some people just got tired of waiting and haven't bothered to finish it yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming there were a lot of people who put it on hold because they were waiting for the last 2 episodes to be dubbed and haven't gotten around to watching them yet. (I'm in this exact situation)
>> ARTICLE
But... there are subs.
>> ARTICLE
The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.

And Crispin Freeman as Alucard.  It's why I watched it dubbed

Man Romeo's Blue Skies is amazing, although I guess I can see why people wouldn't like it. My parents got me into classic literature at an early age, so I'm a sucker for stories like this.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Sorry for not being really that helpful.

Death note getting put on hold and dropped this much....I guess this is what happens when people over hype the shit out of a good show.

Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit.

Really impressed with Parasyte popularity rise .  surpise no Bahamut in there .  
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Parasyte
1. Psycho-Pass 2
1. Log Horizon 2
1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
1. Trinity Seven
1. InoBato
1. Grisaia no Kajitsu
1. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.

It's mostly because I was getting through a big break up at the time, and spent my nights watching episodes on YouTube on my Wii. The chorus was just really powerful to me; it was kind of like my breaking through and realizing I was better off or something. Either way, that time of my life ended making FLCL my favorite show ever. I don't know how many times I've watched the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I can relate. Though it didn't make me cry, GTO the manga really made me think and realize more than I thought it would when I started it.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I cried during the first episode of Stellvia when Shipon's mom gives her the jar of konpeito. I think I was just feeling very vulnerable that day or something, since there really wasn't any chance for the series to establish any emotional connection or anything.

Occasionally, I kind of get in a shitty, melancholic, and sometimes teary mode watching anime that features extraordinary people doing extraordinary things as well. I don't necessarily mean superpowers and feats of those kinds, but more like Hikaru no Go or Hajime no Ippo. Normal but talented people who find a lifelong passion and pursue it with everything they have. Or even kind of "chosen one" story lines where people are given a quest of importance to complete and the assurance that they have the potential to do it. It's hard to see that kind of passion and purposefulness when you're feeling particularly directionless and unremarkable. It rubs at the framework of escapism and causes unease and anxiety.

I started to watch it a while back after my cousin recommended it; it was actually hilarious and I was enjoying it, but over-time I kind of lost interest and ended up dropping it.

I think part of it is because I just had a hard time getting past the animation just because it's older, 1999 I think? It's not even like the animation is bad, far from it, it's pretty unique and awesome (especially the hilarious facial reations); I think I'm just too picky when it comes to nice looking animation, so older stuff is a little tougher for me to get into.

It's a terrible habit I gotta break, I'm undoubtedly missing out on great anime. I mean I had a hard time getting into Higurashi purely because of the animation, but I ended up thoroughly enjoying that once I stuck through with it.
>> ARTICLE
Watched it, was great. One of the best comedy out there (at least for me).

 If you liked it, you should read the manga. The anime isn't a 100% adaptation
>> ARTICLE
I watched it some months ago and i really loved it. It is IMO the best Comedy anime I've ever seen and it did a really good job to how almost every character changed through out the series. i really loved it. I will probably read the manga soon
>> ARTICLE
One of the best comedy anime ever produced.  You'd probably also like Golden Boy and Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
It is amazing, I really enjoyed it. I'm guessing the reason it isn't talked about here is due to its age (Summer of 1999).

Great Teacher Onizuka is one of the most unappreciated shows. Such a good anime, gave it a 10/10. It's sad that it doesn't get a lot of buzz on this subreddit, it's anime was just as good as the manga which is touted as one of the best of all time.

Although more people might've seen Spirited Away as kids, so it may have a nostalgia factor.

I've seen Spirited Away several times but never Mononoke. I think Spirited Away is more popular, especially with a general audience.

Oh man, you have to see Princess Mononoke. I'd say it's the best Ghibli movie I've seen, and my second favourite after Nausicaa.

Idk how someone could down vote you. Mononoke is a must see ghibli film, nausicaa is in my top 3 for miyazaki also.

It's probably not widely viewed enough to do well considering you have to watch a whole series before you can watch it.

I'll hijack the highest comment to ask why is S;G so beloved by people in this subreddit, over on MAL and pretty much everywhere.

I get it it's a good anime and the dialogues are pretty good but from that to the best anime ever I feel like it's a long road. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
People like tsunderes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going out on a limb here and saying it's because of the characters, and the plot.

The characters, especially Okabe first of all, are college students, and nerdy ones at that.  I mean, you're literally making the protagonist be the main anime audience, let alone the main reddit userbase (college-age males.

So you've got college nerds as characters, and then you give them a [spoiler](/s "time machine").  Just that alone would make it a top-popularity anime in the US.

But in addition to that, you throw in very nice, funny dialogue, a really great dub, emotional and highly serious plot, convoluted twists and drama, a slow and unorthodox path to romance (and a good one at that), references to memes and current international internet pop-culture, a kick-ass opening, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgouXrkye20#t=00m12s), and you've got a very good anime.

Sure, many people would say, for instance, that Cowboy Bebop is a better anime.  I might agree with that statement.  But "better" does not equal "more popular".  Shows like Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, and No Game No Life might not be as "critically acclaimed" as Madoka Magica or Cowboy Bebop, but they're sure as hell more popular, numbers-wise.

And in the end, this is a popularity poll.  What can we do.
>> ARTICLE
Cool Lab Coats.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Finally an answer that actually makes sense. I've been trying for a while in other forums and between my friends to figure out why my opinion was so different from the majority and all they could say was something on the line of "It's good".

I was even starting to think I might have watched it "wrong"...
>> ARTICLE
Well that's not to say Cowboy Bebop or Madoka magika are even better shows than SAO, SnK, NGNL, etc.  On the contrary -- more people enjoyed these highly popular shows than the lower-rated shows.

It's all part of the spectrum between art and entertainment.  Popular shows just strike a perfect balance to make the most number of people like them.

I'm watching it now and I have to say, it's the slowest anime I've ever watched. It seems as if the characters take forever walking anywhere or doing anything.

> so I'll take 64 nominations this time instead of 24 nominations/40 top-rated anime like last time

Good, I had no interest in this tournament due to 40 of the nominees coming from MAL.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it's because his nomination thread got downvoted into oblivion and no one saw it.
>> ARTICLE
The nomination format was set before the downvotes came.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, as far as I know he originally planned for /r/anime to only nominate 24 anime. Also I wouldn't really call [positive points](http://puu.sh/afY3w/c232e6dc98.png) being downvoted into oblivion.
>> ARTICLE
ah, I had never actually seen the thread, just he mentioned getting very few responses for nomination and days 1 and 2 due to lots of downvoting.
>> ARTICLE
I talked about in previous topics. My original expectations when I made that topic were that 15 or 20 people may participate, and I'd probably get at most 40 or 50 nominations. I actually got considerably less than that. I think there were only 4 or 5 nominations that didn't make the tournament. Taking those expectations into consideration, I figured the top 40 of MAL would be more representative of /r/anime than than 15 or 20 random people's suggestions. I expected less than 100 or so votes per poll, and maybe 15 or 20 bracket predictions (I got 9 before the deadline). So I think you guys should be able to understand why I originally didn't plan to take 64 nominations. 

And the topic was downvoted more than that picture shows. It was at 0, and never came close to making the front page. It's been linked in every topic since, so it gained a few extra votes.

Now that the last poll received almost 2500 votes, I feel the next nomination topic will be popular enough to make a quality list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
You should post around 11:00 PST or twice so both Europe and NA have a chance to see it

I see, perhaps when the movie tournament is finished, you could try to redo the series tournament?
>> ARTICLE
This tournament was really fun and I hope you will remake it in the future!

But for the next one I would suggest that you do double-elimination brackets. I know it's gonna be harder to do but it seems more fair since there are quit a few animes that would place higher but got top 4 animes in 1st or 2nd round.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaand Steins;Gate takes the crown. May its reign be long and just, its banner strike fear into the very hearts of its enemies, and its dynasty last for countless golden ages.

^(guess what movie I'm voting for) 
>> ARTICLE
I can never get over how amazing the art is, and the feels that rise up every time I see it.
>> ARTICLE
Question about the Movie Bracket, how will you approach a movie series like Kara no Kyoukai? Will it just be all 8 individual movies? Will you lump them together? Or just not include it since it's technically a series?
>> ARTICLE
I thought about that. Movies are all about doing the most you can within a relatively short amount of time. Keeping that in mind, I will not be lumping franchises together. If someone wants to nominate Garden of Sinners, they have to nominate a specific part of it. Also to have as much variety as possible in the final 64, I'm only allowing one movie from a franchise to make the final list. For example, if Castle of Cagliostro and Fuma Conspiracy (both being in the Lupin franchise) each get nominated, only the highest vote getter will get into the tournament. This will let us avoid having a bracket of 3 NGE movies, 3 Madoka movies, and like 6 Garden of Sinner movies taking up all the spots.
>> ARTICLE
> If someone wants to nominate Garden of Sinners, they have to nominate a specific part of it

That's easy. No question about it, movie 5 is by far the best.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say by far the best, though it is my choice for which one to nominate
>> ARTICLE
>3 Madoka movies

I don't think that movies which are literally the series in movie format (ie: The first two Madoka movies, the first NGE rebuild, etc) should be allowed.

>> ARTICLE
I guess that makes sense. I never watched any of the Madoka or NGE movies, so I have no idea what they're about. I guess I should ban AnoHana as well since that was just a recap. Everyone else agree with banning recap movies?
>> ARTICLE
Yep yep, I agree that recap movies should probably not be a thing. Only original material.
>> ARTICLE
I feel there's some gray area when it comes to movie recaps. Eva 1.0 focuses on its latter half while sacrificing it's first. Eva 2.0 is something like 25% similar to its series counterpart. Madoka is similar enough to its series IMO.

I think you could allow them to be nominated, and request discussion for recaps that you are unfamiliar with.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you should only allow for one movie per franchise since sometimes the fanbase can be divided or even opposite, like Madoka 3 vs the first 2 and EoE vs the Rebuilds having only one might not be representative of the franchise since things don't always play out the same and while it may make sense with KnK it doesn't apply to all.
>> ARTICLE
It would be cool if we could do this every year at like the start of summer season and use a variety of different new and old... Of course details would need to be hammered out but this concept would be really cool.

>> ARTICLE
It pains me to see Lelouch lose but oh well.

El Psy Congroo beat the Geass
>> ARTICLE
How are the movie polls going to work? Hopefully they will be for standalone movies and exclude ones linked to series or from Ghibli, otherwise we might just end up with just Eva or Haruhi movies decking it out against Miyazaki, which isn't very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Why would you not include Ghibli? That's like holding a "best movie" tournement and then not including Spielberg movies.

edit: i do agree on not including movies that come from a series though.
>> ARTICLE
Well, mainly because these tournaments are far less interesting when the results are quite predictable, as in your other comment, Steins;Gate was a likely win from the start, and with Ghibli movies included I would pretty much guarantee a finale like Spirited Away vs Princess Mononoke. 

Without them in the equation, things would be far more shaken up. Anyway its just a suggestion, OP is the one who's making the decision.
>> ARTICLE
Then someone will say we should also take out Satoshi Kon movies because they'll run away with it. Then they'll move on to the next most popular director or studio, maybe Hosada with his Summer Wars and the Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and try to get them banned. There's always going to be a favorite no matter what you remove. At least if you leave in the favorites, you have the chance for exciting upsets.
>> ARTICLE
We could just have a vote for which film should represent Ghibli, so the tournament doesn't get completely dominated by their movies. 
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense when you put it that way. This is why you are in charge of the poll and not me :p
>> ARTICLE
This was fun, can't wait for the movie polls. These polls are load of fun, we should have some for specific categories/genres instead of it being so general.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll have to put Code Geass on my list.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a fantastic anime, and IMO it deserved to win. Though, I also think FMA should've come in second, so yeah.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed NGNL and its a fun show, but there is no way it deserves a spot in the top 16 even. 

I think the main reason it's so high up there is the hype coming off of it as a recently aired show.
>> ARTICLE
This is a popularity poll, not a critic's poll.  In a perfect world, Cowboy Bebop would be closer to the top, but critically acclaimed shows are often not as popular as simple "popular" shows.

And NGNE, by both being a really popular show and by having very recently aired, is in a perfect place for this poll.
>> ARTICLE
I've been salty about that for awhile. This massive overachievement in the poll is probably the result of a lot of newer anime fans, who have seen few anime aside from NGNL, voting in the poll en masse for the flavor of the season. Give it a little time and the hype will fade away. 
>> ARTICLE
According to this, Steins; Gate is the best anime.
As for every other one, i felt that they deserved the spot that they were at.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I'm being uneducated as I still am in the anime world, but I'm surprised No Game No Life is so high up.  I've heard of it but I know very little about the anime
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a lot of fun to watch (watched with a group) and it has a very unique art style (as far as I've seen).
>> ARTICLE
It's very popular.

People will say what they want about it, but No Game No Life is really fun to watch.  Probably the most fun I've had watching a series for a long time.  
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if you've already covered this, but what do you think a voter should do when faced with two options, of which only one is familiar? I feel the "popularity contest" aspect could be reduced with choices of "Only seen A." But then again that could really restrict the vote count.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah vote count would be affected, but it will also make people feel like they can't participate. I mean I watch **a lot** of anime (400 and counting on MAL) and I haven't seen nearly half of the shows that were in the current tournament. I think I watch more than the average /r/anime member, so the average member would have even fewer matches to vote on. I'm of the opinion that if you really liked the show, vote for it. If you hated it, vote against it. If you had no strong opinion one way or the other, abstain from voting.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really understand why people got mad over this tourney, it clearly said in the nomination thread to vote for your favorite, and your favorite doesn't exactly mean what you think is the best (or maybe I'm a lonely guy who thinks that way)
>> ARTICLE
This is actually a pretty awesome list!  Especially the top 20.
>> ARTICLE
I like many other users of this sub didn't vote in any of the rounds so don't worry about the implications of the popularity contest on the taste of the sub.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised with how many from the top 20 I've actually watched. Only missing 2 (Champloo and Bebop).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much for hosting this tourney. As someone just getting in to anime, stuff like this is a big help so I can nab some of the popular stuff so I can keep up with the average thread. 


>> ARTICLE
Yep, this list is pretty reddit-core, seems pretty accurate. NGNL seems pretty out of place, it should be much lower on the list IMO but  still deserved a spot regardless cause of popularity.  

Also I'm telling you right now the movies contest is going to be pretty sad. It's going to be 50% or above "I've never seen it" for every movie but Ghibli stuff.
>> ARTICLE
NouCome shouldn't be there, Oregairu and D Frag were both funnier and more entertaining 
>> ARTICLE
Funny. Out of the top 32 I've only not seen or aren't watching 10, but out of the bottom 32, I've only *seen* 8. I guess I watching a lot of the big names but I still have plenty of depth. 

Well I really should get around to watching Toradora soon considering how high it ranked on this poll and the fact that I really liked Golden Time.

Great tournament, although I'm sure most of us realized that Steins;Gate was gonna win from the get-go. I mean just look at any thread about "your favourite anime" and S;G is always near the top. The movie tournament should be a bit more up in the air, but I think Princess Mononoke will take it. Personally, I'll be voting for Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, as it is my favourite movie. 
>> ARTICLE
Well there was a prediction challenge, and only 2 people that entered brackets before 7/10 predicted Steins;Gate to win. I don't think it was that obvious actually. Personally I had it losing to Spice and Wolf because you know the way /r/anime raves about Spice and Wolf.

Sacrificing one of his arms as well, he used alchemy to bind his brother's soul to a suit of armor. This lead to the beginning of their journey to restore their bodies, in search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone.

Just a heads up, Brotherhood has a movie too: "The Sacred Star of Milos".

Oh, you are right. Added.
>> ARTICLE
7 episodes left of Brotherhood; easily the best show I've watched in a long time. Gonna be sad when it's over :(
>> ARTICLE
If you intend to watch both, start with FMA. Watching FMA:B first will make you feel that FMA is crap compared to it. If you only want to watch one of them, FMA:B is 100% the best one. This is coming from someone that saw FMA then FMA:B and enjoyed both of them.
>> ARTICLE
I think FMA does some thinks better than brotherhood. FMA:B has a longer and more comprehensive plot but it sacrifices some character development for it. I just don't really like the ending for FMA as much but otherwise it was fine.
>> ARTICLE
Ye, that's why I suggest to watch FMA then FMA:B, not the other way around. I really liked both of them, but the end of FMA was kinda anticlimatic and I felt it was not made optimal. FMA:B gave a perfect ending, so going from that to FMA is not a really good idea.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I do agree with the order I just don't think FMA is crap after watching both.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so either, though a lot of those I know that watched FMA:B first felt that way about FMA.

I think he was trying to say that if you watched brotherhood first you would think it's crap compared to it.

Was there any denying that this show would be at the top of this thread? I've finished FMA, and that was really great. Right now I'm 26 episodes through Brotherhood and starting from episodes 18-19 it *really* started picking up to be also incredible.

These shows man. They're half of what got me into anime (along with Cowboy Bebop). They're nearly perfect to me! Especially Brotherhood!

However, when he's suddenly caught in a battle between two more powerful Magus, Shiro finds himself performing a spell above his expected ability, summoning the beautiful spirit warrior Saber to protect him! But safety is only momentary as Shiro and Saber now find themselves thrust into in a secret world of dark magic and deadly challenges: a no-holds barred duel to the death known as the Holy Grail War! At stake: a prize of unimaginable power. But can the inexperienced Shiro and Saber survive long enough to even enter the contest? First they'll have to withstand waves of treachery and assassination, even as Shiro scrambles to learn everything he'll need to know to stay alive as seven teams of Magus and Spirit Servants face off in mortal combat! 

> **[F/Z]** Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven magi summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the "Holy Grail," which grants a miracle. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.

> Founded by the Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka families centuries ago, the Einzbern family is determined to achieve success after three successive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the hated magus killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs whatever he can use to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person comes at the cost of another's life. For the sake of humanity, he will ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.

> However, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new familyhis wife Irisviel and their daughter Illyaand what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who cannot find any sense of fulfillment in his life and sets his sights on Kiritsugu as the possible answer to the emptiness he feels.

Not that it matters much, but Fate/Zero Season 1 is 13 episodes.

I've only seen Fate Zero, but it's one of my favorites. I didn't really understand the ending (I've heard that gets covered by Fate/stay night) so I'm trying not to dwell on that too much. But the ride was awesome. All of the characters had some sort of charm to them (except maybe one pair...) and I actually felt for the characters.


>> ARTICLE
Derp, I thought that seasons of F/Z were equal in number of episodes.

Anyway, if you plan to watch new adaptation of Fate/stay night then you will understand the ending of F/Z for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm debating whether to wait it out and just watch the anime or to play the Visual Novel.
>> ARTICLE
watch the anime and play the VN.  that's what i'm doing (on the third route now).
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed both F/Z and F/sn, but I enjoyed Zero much more. F/sn made Saber a more feminine type character and I like the development of her feminine side over the course of the series, but Zero made her look like such a badass character without the need for love and was able to perform tasks without hindrance or hesitation (except at the end because of Kiritsugu of course). Besides that, the story telling in both stories was highly thorough and well executed, along with great soundtracks and awesome fight animations. This is an anime really worth watching. THe only problem was that I watched Zero before sn, so I didn't get the same feel from sn as from Zero, but still enjoyed it. Another difference would be that while F/Z focused more on every character and their goals, F/sn focused more on the relationship between the MC and Saber, as well as some of Rin Tosaka's conflicts and feelings. I enjoyed F/Z much more, but that is just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best survival game anime out there and a fine addition to the Nasuverse. The story is intriguing, its got some great concepts and ideas that are well executed, the animation is magnificent and a prime example of how far Ufotable can push the boundaries of animating tv anime series, great soundtrack and the fights are breathtaking. I also liked how the ending transitions into FSN so we could get the upcoming remake and the only issues I had were with the characters and the exposition heavy first episode.
>> ARTICLE
> One of the best survival game anime out there

i think it's worth a 10 on my scale just as a "how to do survival game right".  it wasn't explicitly clear who was going to win throughout the show (unless you already read fate stay/night) the way it was clear in, for example, mirai nikki.  that's the greatest weakness of the survival game, imo... you know that the main character is going to win, so it's hard to build tension.
>> ARTICLE
While Zero did a pretty good job of being accessible without experiencing F/SN, you should really read F/SN first. And I mean read, because the 06 adaption didn't really do any of the routes justice. While I have high hopes for UBW in the fall, I don't know if they'll be able to skip Fate while still doing Saber justice, and I'm not sure how a movie or series of movies will work out for Heaven's Feel.

If you have ANY interest in F/Z or F/SN, please read Stay Night first. Your experience will be much better.
>> ARTICLE
I followed that advice a week ago and started reading F/SN. If you do not explicitly like hentai/ecchi or haven't played a VN before, you should consider installing a patch that removes those scenes. I'm serious. 

The VN is incredibly fun to read and the story is great, but it took me a lot to get over the first h-scene and take the characters seriously again.
>> ARTICLE
yeah the h-scenes really are terrible.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you can always hold ctrl to fast forward the text and effectively skipping those scene. That's what i did.

But yeah, for you guys that want to start reading, go install the Realta Nua patch.
>> ARTICLE
I.... didn't know that. Wish I had that information before, the scene was just too damn awkward and forced.

I have read around 22 hours now, would you still recommend to install the patch?
>> ARTICLE
That scene when the group is running away from Berserker, damn. Really stupid.

Sure, with the patch you will get full voice acting, new opening sequence, and some new CG. So that's cool.

I think that the fact that it happened in HF route is kind of necessary, so you might want to look into it. The scene itself is stupid like any other one, though.

But to make matters worse, Naota's world is totally turned upside down when he is run over by a woman on a Vespa.

FLCL is arguably the most hate it or love it anime around here. One half of the people regards this show as one of the best anime ever, and other thinks that FLCL is a pretentious piece of crap. Here is my little story of how I completely changed my mind and from the latter group went to the former.

I heard a lot of polarizing opinions about FLCL but nevertheless wanted to give it a try. I was young and nave (around 10 completed shows) and it was one of the most strange anime experiences that time. I understood little to nothing, everything looked crazy and, most importantly, didnt make any sense. Robots, giant iron, insane girl on a bike who (girl, not bike) smashes everyone with her bass guitar, schizophrenic atmosphere well, I didnt like it. I thought it was something something not for me. Maybe it is a really good anime, but I was not sold. And I forgot about FLCL for several months.

Time passed, many interesting shows were watched, it was a day when I had nothing really to do. Then I set my eyes on FLCL one more time. Well, why not? Its so boring anyway, so Ill give it another try my thoughts were. I was hooked almost immediately and held my breath for entire three hours till it was done. After that I recovered, thought about it for a moment and watched it again. Paid attention to every single detail, made different notes and had immense pleasure. Okay now *thats* why many think it is so phenomenal.

So what is FLCL? FLCL is a story about young boy Naota who desperately wants to be an adult. He has cynical views on life, dates with a girl who is older than him and doesnt like bitter drinks. But everything changes when he meets Haruko, a girl on an old Vespa with a bass guitar and got smashed by her. Soon enough tumor emerges from his head and giant robot is coming out from it. Haruko, who already have settled in Naotas house, tries to help him or does she? Are you already lost anyway? 

FLCL is a wonderful coming of age story in disguise of action/mecha/romance/putanotherrandomgenrehere. This is a highly experimental show with a really weird and confusing approach. Story is told from Naotas perspective, remember, a young boy. Everything (Medical Mechanica, Atomsk, Harukos personality) doesnt make sense to us because they dont have sense to him. Yes, he desperately tries to be and act like an adult, but hes still a little boy. He doesnt understand this world of big children, or maybe hes not even trying. Instead he focuses on other things, which are more appropriate for a child: hanging around, pretending hes a mature person and, of course, first love.

I said intentionally big children. There are no sane adults in FLCL and thats one of the reasons why Naota despises them. They act stupidly, have ruined lives and crushed hopes and do everything in the most bizarre way possible. Haruko is a highlight of the cast  she behaves so odd but so compelling that you have no choice but to believe in her weird goals and ideals. Shes also one of the rarest examples when you can truly talk about charisma with regard to an anime character. Mamimi is also a very strong character with unhappy past and even more desperate present. She has great development and her story is convincing. But they are just tools to develop Naotas character that grows up immensely throughout the series.

And everything is covered in only six episodes. FLCL has insane pacing and it is the only way to tell us everything we need to know. The main goal watching FLCL is to discard everything unnecessary and focus on the main character(s). But when you thought you understood everything in this anime, it opens in different light and talks about other themes. The town where Naota lives is depressing and hopeless place to live, iron is a symbol of equality and hive mind, adults are really stupid and childish. All these topics are also presented in FLCL and shown with a crazy style.

Talking about style  its amazing. FLCL is one of the most easily recognizable anime and has distinctive visuals. Every action scene is a joy to watch and animation is great in all parts of the anime. And, of course, music. FLCL has one of the best soundtracks ever in the history of anime. The Pillows fast and atmospheric rock works marvelously and fits the overall style perfectly. Its a pleasure to listen to it again and again as an OST. [Ending of FLCL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCKtq_hANrw) is an iconic video and one of the greatest (if not the greatest) endings ever.

I may sound like an elitist, but still  FLCL is an anime for an advanced anime watcher. Any newcomer will be overwhelmed by crazy pacing, characters, literally *everything*. Dont watch this show if you are somewhat new to the medium, but do yourself a favor and pick it up later  its that good. **I recommend this show to anyone who is already familiar with anime and doesnt mind craziness.** It's my favorite Gainax work to date, my current rating is **8.9/10** and it may go up when I will rewatch it. Again.

>> ARTICLE
It's got its fair share of action and comedy. The main character Sousuke is very straight-forward and serious, which contrasts the setting of the high school life Kaname is used to. I'd definitely say the comedy is the highlights of the show, as well as the characters and their interactions. There's some mecha involved, but it's not Gundam-esque where it's the main part of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my first 3 anime that I knew was anime (Zoids, Trigun, FMP) and all time favorites.

Season 1 was a great mix of comedy and action, fumoffu was basically straight comedy, and the second season was just straight action/seriousness I always found that wierd

Either way it's all great, especially fumoffu, it's the only anime besides The Daily Lives of High-school boys to make me laugh out loud basically every episode.

My life for a continuation.

I watched the original version of the movie and thought it was pretty mediocre at best. Does the new edition really improve the movie that much?

Yes, as several scenes are reworked and added. Basically... they plot actually makes sense and Cloud doesn't seem like he's insane/out of character the whole damn movie.

I never treated the movie like it was anything beyond good FF fighting fanservice, to the extent that I would rewatch only the fighting scenes on later plays. But this makes me want to check that out eventually.

It blows my mind that this is rated better than FLCL.  This film was such utter garbage.  An hour and a half of substanceless and emotionally hollow glamour shots, vogue poses, merchandise tie-ins, and glitzy explosions.  You know those characters you loved from FF7?  Let's take away every single nuance and depth they had, back-track on all their character development, and render them as one-dimensional parodies of what they were.  It's fan service in its ultimate form.

The first in the series has kinda difficult (and incredibly Japanese) but funny to understand jokes, while the second one is more straightforward and more slapstick-y. They're both 3D CGI made by Disney (don't let that scare you off!) and the first one looks a bit dated (there is little to no scenery), while Charming looks like what you'd expect from Disney. There's little else to tell you about this series. Just watch them, it's just an hour of your life!

Fairy Tail?
>> ARTICLE
My best friend and I have wildly differing opinions on anime. While I like more in-depth things like FMA, Madoka Magica, and No Game No Life (to name a few), he prefers lighter and more "one-shot" stuff like Nichijou and Space Dandy. We agree on almost nothing when it comes to anime. We have watched entire arcs of Fairy Tail together. That is the best way I can recommend Fairy Tail to almost anyone. Seriously, try it if you haven't.

Others to try if you like Fairy Tail (Basically silly yet serious at times action anime) - Soul Eater, Kill la Kill, Sword Art Online, and Fullmetal Alchemist (either is okay, Brotherhood is better).

As a non-mecha fan, I still cannot allow you to live without going through **TTGL**...  and maybe giving **Code Geass** a try.  

Other than that, I do not see a whole lot of Slice of life/romance/drama in your list... so then there's the obvious **Toradora!/Angel Beats! **recommendation.   
  
If you liked Elfen Lied, you will probably like **Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni**, it will make you WTF quite often, but keep going...  
  
You may also like **Fate Stay/Night**.. (watch this one first, then go for **Fate Zero**, even though this one is a prequel)  
  
There a lot of series out there, specially the ones named here quite often... that are really enjoyable. Please also give **Steins;Gate** a try, it starts of kind of slow in my opinion, but it builds up momentum and you reach a time where you can't blink until you finish..  
  
If you want any more opinions just ask, but remembers, they are always *opinions...*

It's poorly paced and the cast is handled badly, i.e. they try to do way too much for every character and end up falling short in everything. The animation is okay while the soundtrack was very good.

Yes, the anime was mediocre compared to the VN but the VN was really really good. I was going to make a LotR analogy here but the anime wasn't good enough to warrant that. It's still better than 90% of the shounen/seinen action shows though. Maybe more like harry potter movies. They're not great but it was still fun watching it regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend someone who liked Fate/Zero, is interested in Fate/Stay Night, but does not plan on playing the VN in the foreseeable future (due to pathetic attention span and school issues) watch the anime?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, if you've already started on fate/zero it defeats the purpose of having to put up with the anime since it's mostly about getting to appreciate some of the character development and what to focus on as well as the tidbits of new information they throw in. VN's are obviously good and it's also because the story was designed to be told in three different arcs, each adding its own element of twists and plot devices. It's really hard to appreciate the Fate route (the one the anime is based on) if you don't see the alternate settings, character interactions and how the differences in the arcs add to the whole presentation.

that said, it's honestly not that bad. by the same token, shows like claymore i would consider "awful" shows too but i enjoyed both nonetheless. as standalone anime i'd actually put those two pretty close. all people are saying is that it's not GOOD, but it's still fun to watch especially if you like the setting/genre. give it a try i'd say. it's not like it starts out too slow early on anyway
>> ARTICLE
It only covers about 30% of the VN, changes certain parts, wrecks certain characters. The only good thing about the anime adaption was the OST but that is because they remixed a lot of songs from the VN. 

The anime will just leave you with a bad impression so I would recommend playing through the VN at your own pace and finishing it when you can because it is *vastly* superior.

However if you truly have a low attention span and rather not play the VN(it is 3 times longer than Lord of the Rings novels), then I suppose it is decent enough to warrant a watch but only after F/Z finishes(due to spoilers)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I would use "pretty mediocre"... It certainly isn't one of my favorites, but I enjoyed it. The good thing about it is that you don't need to get half-way inside it to know if you will like it... and as for me, the plot is interesting from the start.  On the other hand, I was not really fond of the movie **("Unlimited Blade Works")**, which describes another path inside the VN, even though it provides a little more info regarding some of the pending subjects within the series.

Madoka Magica is such a must. Don't let the stereo typing deceive with this one. It is a magical girl anime, but the art, style and characters are all extremely well done while the plot will keep you hooked and interested. I could not recommend this one enough. Also if you want something a little less try Nichijou. It's a gag anime about high school life and it really is quite funny. But in the other direction entirely. you could go big with the violent and bloody Deadman Wonderland about a prison in Japan that is a also a theme park.

Gundam unicorn is a pretty entertaining watch simply for the fantastic animation. You've been busy in 6 months! Darker than black is another I'd recommend (if you get into this, be careful about watching the second season. As of right now there are no plans to make a third and... well... that will be very disappointing news for you if you choose to watch both seasons). Bakemonogatari is entertaining if you're willing to have a philosophical string of thoughts for 30 minutes mediated by a bland but at the same time fascinating animated conversation (this show is honestly completely what your mind makes of it). Oh and gungrave. Seriously no one will recommend that, but I very highly suggest you check it out. If you do listen to me, please do me a favor and stick through the first 10 episodes, it might be a bit rough because the opening episode sets you up for a bunch of action that really only takes place in the last few episodes but if you do take your time and wait for the story to develop you'll be highly rewarded. This is the only anime I would recommend watched dubbed.

Wait a minute.  After reading this over, I realized that none of this makes any sense.  Your premise starts out decent, but it collapses really quickly, somewhere between 2) and 3).

>  It may seem like AssClass is doing the same thing, but in reality it doesnt. We dont know anything about Koro-sensei, he is a mystery, and even worse, a plot device, and an objective. Heck, he doesnt even look human.

Sure.  This is fine, I suppose, but it's really just rehashing something you else you said in a wordier manner:

> There is none of that in AssClass. The premise of having an alien teacher who wants to blow up the planet, helping his students to kill him, makes no sense. This renders meaningless whatever is going on in it, because once again, the viewer has nothing to begin understanding the story.

Bull.  What is there to understand?  The premise makes perfect sense:

- There is a school in Japan.
- The school has internalized classism, or at least intense disrespect for Class E using an educational system determined by the headmaster (which makes sense, even if it's pretty dickish).
- Koro-sensei showed up for some reason.  Why?  Who cares?  We know what he is trying to do, and we know how he is trying to do it: teach the students by using the assassination theory as a staging ground.
- The students in Class E were all failures in some way, shape, or form and Koro-sensei is interested in seeing if he can turn them into not-failures.  Each of them has their own personal failing, and his goal is to overcome that.

Plenty to work with here already.  You decided to equate a strange premise to a nonsensical premise, and as soon as you decided to say "oh look, it doesn't make sense!" you missed the forest for the trees.

---

> We dont know anything about Koro-sensei, he is a mystery, and even worse, a plot device, and an objective...He is a terrible focal point, since there is nothing to understand or build upon.

There is plenty to build on, because unlike what this post would say there's a lot of time spent discussing Koro-sensei *as a teacher* and comparing him to the other three teachers you see in the school.  You learn about his teaching style, his preferred subjects and silly ideas, his strengths and weaknesses, and what earns his respect and dislike.  Despite him not looking or acting human, one of the major points in the show (that happened to be glossed over above for some reason) is that he is emotionally very human.


> Even when the focus tries to switch to the students, who look human and are not a mystery, it happens in an episodic fashion. There is little to no time to understand or like a character before we move to someone else...Therefore, the show fails at having a proper focal point.

Hm, I am reminded that the show has a tentative main character who tends to guide the narrative (Nagisa) with a secondary "antagonist" (Karma) to push along.  More importantly, you learn about the characters as you go - the important characters get an arc, less important characters get a few minutes of time and some defining factors.  This series is, contrary to what's being stated, a good example of *how to prioritize development in a series with a lot of characters*.  If y'want to look at something that collapsed under the weight of it's characters I'd look at **Negima!**, not Assassination Classroom.

> It also doesnt help how despite having dozens of students, they all share the same objective, which is killing the teacher. This completely trashes the concept of individuality, since despite having different personalities and goals, they are all forced to walk the same narrow path. So why do you need 40 of them, if they all do the same thing? GTO and SZS had no such objective, and thus every character was doing his own thing.

Plot twist!  This series isn't GTO or SZS.  Just because they're vaguely similar doesn't mean that they have to follow the same storytelling style.  The goal of Assassination Classroom is that it's an entire class of losers united in one goal: to get a shitton of money by killing Koro-sensei.  Also, to earn the respect of their peers, or family.  Also, to defeat their own personal inner weakness in order to achieve B) and to get stronger at their own personal strengths in order to achieve A).  Oh, and to make interesting memories and hang out with people because that's how school works.  So, in other words, to be themself in interesting ways *while still being focused on an end goal*.

> Also, without a focal point, the story will end. It makes it sound like we can have a show for as long as they fail, and end it the moment they succeed. And as if that wasnt enough, there is also a timer. If the students fail for too long, then the whole planet will blow up. Thus no matter what will happen, the ending is bad. Nobody wants the planet to blow up, and nobody wants the teacher to die. Its a lose-lose situation, which doesnt motivate the viewer to keep watching. Therefore, the show has a terrible objective.

Good stories end.  That's what they do.  They end in interesting, conclusive, satisfying ways.  Assassination Classroom will *probably* end with them killing Koro-sensei and saving the world.  But we don't know that for sure, and Koro-sensei certainly has his reasons to do what he wants - we clearly know that he's a nice guy.  Lose-lose situations are one of the most important literary devices in all history: present someone with two shitty choices and examine how they grow by which choice they take and how they get there. As far as I can tell, this whole thing is "I don't like how it was laid out and putting a deadline on a story is boring, so it's objectively shit."  That's not how any of this works!

> There is none of that in AssClass. The premise of having an alien teacher who wants to blow up the planet, helping his students to kill him, makes no sense. This renders meaningless whatever is going on in it, because once again, the viewer has nothing to begin understanding the story. No matter what happens at the end, it will be equally nonsensical. Why do you need so many characters for a story that is all over the place? You might as well have a few, just so they will be memorable, instead of the forgettable bunch that is this class. Bobobo for example was the king of randomness and could pull it off for a hundred episodes with just a handful main characters.
We can also assume the story will make sense in later seasons, but even if that happens, the story will still be problematic.

Like I said earlier, there's no reason to throw an easymode explanation at the viewers to sate the interests of the pedantic that want everything laid out for them.  It's a character-driven show, and the goal is to lay out a scenario and watch the characters grow as that scenario runs its course.  Assassination Classroom is not at all random or based around slapstick/visual gag humor like Bobobo was - it's based around a bunch of people who are in a classroom.  Fortunately, it prioritizes a central cast so we have our memorable team and then the rest are explicitly supporting cast.  After all, Nagisa is clearly the main character.

As a for-the-record thing, as of the current manga chapter I believe all relevant mysteries in the story have been solved and everything makes sense except for some wonkiness regarding mechanics.  It's not Incredibly Deep And Compelling Plot but it's pretty solid and not at all problematic.

---

Anyways, I don't see much reason to go further here.  I agree that the cast of Assassination Classroom is very large and it can be difficult for the viewer to keep straight, but it's not *that* sprawling when you consider that the series handles the characters with reasonable screentime prioritization.  Some get more, some get less, and the ones that get more are more important on average.  There are certainly arguments to be made against large casts, but I don' think they apply here - the premise would make absolutely no sense with a smaller cast, and it would make the school seem a lot less coherent (since one important core in the series / in Asano Gakuho's education strategy is that anyone who is weak or unwilling to cooperate gets sent to class E, so if that was not many people his motivating strategy would be hollow at best).
>> ARTICLE
> Koro-sensei showed up for some reason. Why? Who cares?

And that is why what I wrote is correct. If you throw in a "who cares" then nothing matters. Including the wall of text you wrote.

> We know what he is trying to do

No we don't. Does he really want to destroy the planet? Does he really want to die? Does he want to make the students feel they are not failures because that is what he is?

>  You learn about his teaching style

Students must carry guns and kill teachers, or they will die

> he is emotionally very human

He only has one facial expression. 

> a good example of how to prioritize development

There is no development.

>  The goal of Assassination Classroom is that it's an entire class of losers united in one goal: to get a shitton of money by killing Koro-sensei. Also, to earn the respect of their peers, or family. Also, to defeat their own personal inner weakness in order to achieve B) and to get stronger at their own personal strengths in order to achieve A). Oh, and to make interesting memories and hang out with people because that's how school works. So, in other words, to be themself in interesting ways while still being focused on an end goal.

And that makes no sense. Sounds like a gangsta's wet dream, a very ill themed premise, and the show treats it as positive.
>> ARTICLE
I mean; I can't tell if your  trolling or just extremely close minded and don't like to read between lines or not have everything spoon fed to you...

I mean early on it explains why he is there;  he is answering the final request of someone who he may have or may not have killed maybe someone he cared about.

From that we know he is there to teach them and to help them and one way to get everyone to work together is to unite them with a common enemy or objective which is him.

We know he is a good teacher capable of all types of teaching styles, he is clever, an expert at assassination techniques, we know he is capable of manipulating people to where he wants them from how he handles the students and assassins. 

We see multiple emotions from him, so I think the word you want is expression? And even then you would he wrong. The class clearly develops as they go through the struggles, teachings and situations. 

I could answer all your questions about koro too including his reasoning and everything thathappened. 

Edit: Have you read Journey to the west, heroes of the marsh, romance of the three kingdoms? 
Cause: I feel you wouldn't be able to appreciate 'classics' if you are bogged down by the idea that... things happen over time? And you don't have to be told the entire store at one time.. like - at the end of the first part of Romance of the three kingdoms I didn't have to know every reasoning behind Cao Cao's actions or why he was kind of a dick or what the future would hold for him.
your complaints seem... silly to me because of that.


>> ARTICLE
Journey to the West is great but it does kind of frontload its exposition.
>> ARTICLE
This entire post is mostly just convincing me that you watched the first episode, decided to write an essay, and buried your head in the sand while shouting LA LA LA LA LA whenever anything that didn't support your point showed up.

Literally the entire show is dedicated to Korosensei's teaching style.  When he is giving them tour guides and planning a school trip they are not carrying guns and trying to stab him.  When they're in the middle of studying for a test the guns and knives have nothing to do with it.  Hell, they learn really early on that carrying guns and knives to try and get rid of him - the thing you're accusing the show of being all about - *is pointless and not worth doing because he's too fast/skilled*.  It's debunked in like episode 2!

> And that is why what I wrote is correct. If you throw in a "who cares" then nothing matters. Including the wall of text you wrote...
No we don't. Does he really want to destroy the planet? Does he really want to die? Does he want to make the students feel they are not failures because that is what he is?

That is called character development and characterization, which I know is something people like to have in their series.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with a premise that lays itself out over time, which is what happens here.  Whining that we aren't explained everything upfront pretty much explains that this entire essay is just "I don't get it and my brain can't accept that I don't get it."

> He has only one facial expression

There are infographics and shirts [devoted to Koro-sensei faces](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d6/00/6a/d6006aa1d00553cb35e4a3a4f6810575.jpg).  His facial range is both very silly and very consistent.  It's designed to be a parody of human faces while still being non-human.  In fact, his facial range is widely accepted to be both very well-done and a [great running joke in the show](http://40.media.tumblr.com/8627f24c56f5bcfd949933331cd78ff0/tumblr_nk1xim9kWE1tmthnoo2_1280.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I think another thing is that at the start it seems like they're trying to look at each of the students and what makes them special (like in GTO) but then they give up on that. They got maybe 5 characters in and then stopped, causing you to not even care about the other students. Even without the focal point being Onizuka/Koro, if they actually developed the characters that were going to be in the story in AssClass it would have been more bearable. Like in GTO, the students who weren't against Onizuka didn't get any/much screen time, and that didn't matter because they were irrelevant. In AssClass however, they tried to put students in the main story when they barely even introduced them, let alone made anyone care about their character.  

And although you could place that on the focal point being for all 40 students having to kill Koro, they still could have focused on the more important characters and left the unimportant ones to be supporting them rather than half-assedly trying to make all the students important. The important characters then would've been more developed, and you could see the support characters as what they are, support characters.  

**TL;DR because I'm bad at writing: Most of what you said were problems could have been kept the same if they had decided to present the characters better.**
>> ARTICLE
The anime skipped out on a few individual student focused chapters, and there are only 28 students

Whoops.. No idea where I got 40 from it was just sitting there in my head lmao.

Which was unfortunate.  They should have been better about the individual-student chapters, but they still handled it decently imo.

Probably needs 2,3 more episodes to fit them in. Dunno why this is only 22 episodes

I don't know where season one ended in the manga but season two is coming. Who knows, they might give proper introductions to the other characters.

That's pretty much what they did, though.  You have a central cast of teachers: Koro-sensei, Karasuma, Bitch-sensei, and Asano Gakuho.  Then you have the main student cast, Karma and Nagisa.  Then you have the primary supporting cast, Kayano, Terasaka, Kanzaki, and Itona.  Then you have everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
still, no focal point
>> ARTICLE
Your using that word but I don't think you know what it means... "the center of interest or activity." Which is clearly present in either koro sensei or the classroom or the main characters. 

>> ARTICLE
The sensei is a blank state, so not a focal point. The classroom has too many characters that switch every episode, so again no focal point. There are no main characters.
>> ARTICLE
Lolwut I clearly just read his story and his feelings and everything.

Also so your saying that because the focal point changes every episode there isn't one? 

Also Nagisa is actually the main character;  I actually can't fathom how you don't understand that.

>> ARTICLE
He isn't. There is no main character since the focal point switches in every episode.
>> ARTICLE
You just said the focal point switches; so you now agree there is a focal point?

Make up your mind please. 

But no he is the main character;  Touma doesn't have to be the focus of every episode of index to be the main character
>> ARTICLE
Touma is the focal point. A point that constantly switches is not a steady focal one. 
>> ARTICLE
You never said anything about a 'steady focal point ' I mean I can go quote you now if you want.

I mean: if what your saying is true then you are saying Liu Bei isn't the main character/protagonist of Romance of the three kingdoms and that Sun Wukong isn't the main character of Journey to the west?
>> ARTICLE
There are no main characters? What would you call Koro-Sensei and Nagisa? How are they not the main characters?
>> ARTICLE
Plain characters. The story never focuses too much on any one of them, nor does it build up.
>> ARTICLE
How can you say with a straight face that Nagisa and Koro-Sensei are not the main characters? And what do you mean by plain? If you think they are one-dimensional, then you just paid no attention. 
>> ARTICLE
Except they had episodes dedicated to members of the support cast, as if to try to make them seem important when they weren't. Like chemistry girl, baseball guy and 2d computer girl, and then none of these characters where super important again, except maybe baseball guy for the baseball match episode.  

Also was Kanzaki even relevant after the Kyoto trip? That's the sort of thing I'm talking about, she was relevant for a few episodes then forgotten. (I admit I haven't finished the series yet, but so far she's barely shown up)
>> ARTICLE
It's very hard to call anything important in a show that has no focal point.
>> ARTICLE
> Ritsu

> Not important

Her story touches on the one central theme in this series btw
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I'm phrasing badly. What I mean is, after her arc, she barely seems important throughout the rest of the series, making it seem like a wasted character. Like yeah her arc was important, but what about after that? All of the characters I listed have important arcs, it just seems that they're forgotten after that point.
>> ARTICLE
Yet she's so vital in n the last arc as well, just that we got used to the convenience she provides
>> ARTICLE
Ah yeah, fair enough, I haven't finished the anime yet, I'm just basing what I'm saying on what I've seen so far.
>> ARTICLE
>We can assume many will be watching the show, so they can find out who and what the teacher is, or if the students manage to save the planet without killing him. Even if you try to see it from this perspective, it still doesnt work.

Why wouldn't it work? Even if you know the ending probably results in either the earth ending or the teacher dying, why does that make the objective of the story not work? It seems like it would still be interesting to watch, otherwise there would be much less people on this subreddit who watch it
>> ARTICLE
It is a problem if what you are looking for is wishful thinking and even that can only happen at the very end. You want to prove the show's promise wrong, instead of understanding what it tells you in the meantime. 
>> ARTICLE
Uh.... -reads manga- 

The stories not complete and so I assume you are taking an unfinished story and yelling about how it doesn't have an ending? 

Like- what are you even arguing here?
>> ARTICLE
I am talking about the first season
>> ARTICLE
The first season of a still ongoing series....?

Like I didn't pick up a book read the first one then yell about not understanding everything when it gets explaining in the sequel... that is already being made or planned...
>> ARTICLE
Are you saying the second season will fully adapt the manga and answer everything, or will it be more of the same?
>> ARTICLE
It depends entirely on how much they adapt. 
But I know for a fact everything you just said about koro ssensei and the ending is explained. 
So... 

Also you are aware the down vote button isn't 'I disagree' but a 'doesn't add to the conversation' button right?

Cause I get it your mad salty about being questioned but... your using it wrong
>> ARTICLE
Until I get the full picture of what koro is, I say it is all wishful thinking and unreliable narration, and I am free to not like it for keeping everything in the dark for no reason.

With no focal point.
>> ARTICLE
So... your saying that your wrong. But your right because...?

Like your argument is 'I don't know something and I am ignorant so the show is awful." That's actually stupid. 

If i knew how an anime ended at the first episode I think the show would be pretty bad

I think a show that tells me how a story or a trilogy ends when it's not complete is worthless because there's no point continuing it.
>> ARTICLE
You are using excuses for prolonging a story indefinitely. Next thing you will say is that Aizen's plan can't be called bullshit until Bleach is over, so keep watching Kubo trolling for 20 years until it's over and it proven to be bullshit all along.
>> ARTICLE
You will always find a lot of people watching any airing show on the subreddit, honestly. I am not saying your point is wrong, but your argument does not really have any weight.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think you're right considering there isn't a lot of people watching the show to prove it's success
>> ARTICLE
Do you have any thoughts about Durarara? One of the biggest complaints about the show is that there are too many characters.
>> ARTICLE
The story is complex enough to deserve a big cast. The problem the show has is its lack of focus on anything in particular. The characters lose their importance because there is no focal point. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't see it as a bad thing at all. All of the characters have their role in the story and it just fits so well.

The difference with Durarara is there is no "Main character". Every character is very important in some way.

It also helps that most of the characters in DRRR are just great. 
>> ARTICLE
> It also helps that most of the characters in DRRR are just great.

Subjective. I personally don't care about remembering any of them. The only things I remember is archetypes, goofy attitudes, school uniforms, and some headless biker chick. 
>> ARTICLE
Well every form of art is subjective... so yeah...
>> ARTICLE
Cant argue with that but i'd definetly like to see more of the "main" characters as in mikado, anri and kida.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean since I myself would technically consider Mikado the Main character, but then there are people out there who believe that Celty is the main character, and when you think about it she might be since she seems more involved in every situation than any other character. When you think about it like that, you realize there really is no definite MC. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep i agree with all your points.
>> ARTICLE
It was a little awkward in that Celty (+Shinra) / Izaya (+Shizuo) probably took more of the spotlight than the Main Three but the storytelling supported it fairly well.  The seven characters above are pretty much the central cast of the show, and the series was pretty good about focusing on them without excluding side cast development.

Personally, I felt that a few arcs (particularly near the end of season 1 when the Scarves were relevant) didn't really make great use of the side cast by popping up too many random mooks but it wasn't awful.  Baccano! felt like it handled a large cast more smoothly, but Drrr! had more people if you count relevant-but-unnamed side cast. 
>> ARTICLE
But they all get the spotlight and have a purpose.
>> ARTICLE
No focal point characters are the main problem of the show
>> ARTICLE
Youre definetly not wrong, but in my opinion the main characters that the show is supposed to be following often get overshadowed by the rest of the cast which i feel is pretty awkward.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The problem is that they tried giving us a MC in the first place when the story is executed in such a way that there really shouldn't be any main character.
>> ARTICLE
A focal point is still needed, MC or not.
>> ARTICLE
How do you feel about the large cast management in Hibike then?
>> ARTICLE
It's moe, you need lots of them as waifu material. What the story is about does not matter (it is very simple anyways). Being a band, thus needing at least a dozen, means nothing. 

And that is why once again Hyouka is the best Kyoani show. Not many waifus as bait. 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually stunning how for every one good thing you say, two pieces of idiocy stem from it. I don't understand you. I want to but I can't.
>> ARTICLE
He just dislikes high school shows. And shows that rely on having cute girls to entertain the viewer. That's just his taste. I don't see why it's so hard to understand.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between it being "his taste" and writing the show off in the story department just because of what category it falls into. It makes zero sense. Why are you trying to defend that?
>> ARTICLE
So in a way you've basically said that the cast management in Hibike is quite okay then. That was some round about way of saying so tbh.
>> ARTICLE
>It's moe

&nbsp;

>What the story is about does not matter 

[](#facepalm)

I was thinking in argue the moe part, but then read the second quote.

There is simply nothing i can say after reading that. Literally can't find an argument to convince a person a show is not bad when he/she thinks story doesn't matter.
>> ARTICLE
It's a slice-of-nothing-ever-happens-life there is no story to speak of. It's just K-On again. /Snob
>> ARTICLE
Can't find an argument for good or bad with that statement...lol.
>> ARTICLE
I feel so confused when you write a somewhat nice post like this, and then drop a comment like that.

Don't degrade yourself like this.
>> ARTICLE
He turns his brain off when he comments...don't we all?
>> ARTICLE
He hates the whole idea of cute girl high school idea. That's just his taste. 
>> ARTICLE
Every time something doesn't fall into his "taste" he writes it off as a bad literary piece instead of acknowledging that something can be good that he dislikes. Like his comment above. 
>> ARTICLE
He totally does. The man knows what he likes. And... that's just how snob is. It's his whole persona. You might not get it if you don't check out his youtube or his older posts but he basically trashes anything he thinks deserves it and calls those who like it casuals. Whether it's a joke or not, who cares. It's just the persona he has established for himself. He typically holds off on it here in recent times though.
>> ARTICLE
Technically his post (this one, I found some of his other posts to be quite interesting) does not seem really nice. It did not convey properly why a big cast is a problem, it is more of a rant on AssClass, the big cast being one of his point in the rant, followed by an explanation on how the plot makes no sense and how the show is lacking character development. The big cast is almost use as a rant device if I may say.
>> ARTICLE
It's easy to just write shows off as "Moe" based off the character designs, but the characters in Hibike! are actually quite interesting and multi-dimensional. They feel very "real" and it came as a big surprise to me how well-written some of the characters in that show are. Noticing that it is based off a real novel series (just like Hyouka) and not an LN, which we don't see too often, made the clear difference in tone from other similar shows quite apparent. 
>> ARTICLE
And the skirts are too short!
>> ARTICLE
I personally think AssClass is close to having too many characters, but doesn't quite get to that line. I think the number of characters it has is manageable (I pretty much know who everyone is and still care for the characters). A better example of too many characters in terms of recent anime would be something like Tokyo Ghoul.
>> ARTICLE
TG suffers more from bad script that many characters. Unlike ASSCLASS, it doesn't even know what to do with them.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats had pretty much the same problems. So many characters, so little time. On an unrelated note, I'm curious, did you like Bobobo then? 
>> ARTICLE
As the king of randomness it was the greatest mindfuck anime comedy. But I prefer a good plot over that, so I lost interest after a dozen episodes. And not because the comedy was getting repetitive. 
>> ARTICLE
That sounds about right. Then again if you ever want a good laugh, watch a random episode out of context. It's hilarious, but it makes *even less sense*, if that's possible. Nice write-up btw!
>> ARTICLE
I do that actually. People say you can do the same with Gintama, but I came to despise references of any kind.  
>> ARTICLE
I agree with the part about there may be too many student characters in the class, but your whole point about Korosensei I shall agree to disagree. You don't know about anything about it yet, simply because the authors decided not to reveal it yet. There are many other shows where the story does not seems to make much sense at first either.
>> ARTICLE
> There are many other shows where the story does not seems to make much sense at first either.

Name one that did it right. And "at first" implies that 20+ episodes are not enough to establish a focal point.
>> ARTICLE
How do you feel about the way they handled all the characters in Shirobako?
>> ARTICLE
Not Snob, but if someone asks for an example of an anime that handled a large cast correctly I think Shirobako is what I would point them to.  Great prioritization, great depth on the important characters, interesting minor characters that get about the right amount of screentime, and a good story that lets the viewer understand what each character does in context.  It helps that there are good references because you're given a splash of each person's job, but many of the characters that ended up being well-developed are unexpectedly brilliant (see: the entire "drawing horses" arc) and given excellent closure.
>> ARTICLE
I also really liked how they displayed their names, it helped us keep track of who's who. Not that I'd know, I only watched 5 episodes lel.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, that's the little "splash page" I am referring to.

Finish Shirobako, it's amazing!
>> ARTICLE
oh whoops. and I don't plan on finishing it soon, I sort of lost interest.
>> ARTICLE
I like that they always flash the characters' names up when they first appear in the episode. I actually tried remembering everyone's names at the start, but by episode 2 I gave up and just remember their faces and roles, e.g. fat director guy, red hair seiyuu from the anime club, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Which is totally fine!  As long as you can sort of remember people between episodes you'll learn their names as you go.  What you'll see a lot of is what they do, which is perfectly fitting for the series.
>> ARTICLE
I recently read Mahou Sensei Negima, which also has a teacher and about 30+ students. In that series, the way they handled it was that they started with a core of a few students who kept popping up, and then gradually introduced more and more over time. It also helped that most of the students had very distinct character traits, e.g. ninja, kungfu master, mad scientist, cook, hitman, etc etc.
>> ARTICLE
> very distinct character traits, e.g. ninja, kungfu master, mad scientist, cook, hitman, etc etc.

These are not even traits, they are quirks. You cannot build a long story based on quirks, much less 40 characters who are nothing but archetypes. 

Also, Negima is to its core a harem. It has lots of simple-character girls for the sake of waifu material. It was a mistake to think you can have a huge harem cast and a plot in the same story. 
>> ARTICLE
Negima! is probably my go-to example of a series that was horribly crushed under the weight of its characters.  It worked out for a while, but during the school festival it started straining and during the magic world arc Akamatsu split the party and the story pretty much shattered under the strain of trying to keep track of so many people.

Very sad in retrospect...
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. The concept was extremely interesting and the execution at the start was brilliant. However, I agree that things started coming apart during the magic world. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was down with it for a while.  It was straining during the festival but just blew apart during magic world unfortunately.  Sad because magic world had some great moments but by the end the series was just shredded.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Magic World arc is what he always wanted to draw but had to build popularity first by doing the cliche classroom stuff first, and by then there's just too many things to handle

Have you read UQ Holder yet?
>> ARTICLE
I have, though I haven't seen an update for it in ages.  It feels more coherent than Negima was but I can't say much about it.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the opinion of the majority. It could be said of several anime/manga, after some time it feels like they take the direction "let's add characters to create more arcs and artificially lengthen the anime/manga". Nisekoi do it too, and is pretty systematic (add new girl, reset all relationship, build relation with new girl/maybe with former girl, rinse and repeat)
>> ARTICLE
You've been doing a really nice job with these write-ups lately.  
>> ARTICLE
Eh this one was pretty bad.

Extend the range to 20+ years, and I've got way more.

I'm not a big Miyazaki fan, or even a Ghibli fan other than Mononoke and Grave of the Fireflies. Paprika I've seen but it just struck me as bizarre and surreal. I probably need to watch it again to decide if I like it or not.

Ever try Howl's Moving Castle? I enjoyed it! It may be third or fourth in my Miyazaki films list.

Funny. Bizarre and surreal are the exact reasons I loved Paprika. :p

Seconding:

* Azumanga Daioh
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Mushishi
* Any Makoto Shinkai Movie (Voices of a Distant Star, Place Promised in our Early Days, 5 Centimeters per Second)
* Kino's Journey
* Baccano!
* Spice and Wolf
* Nodame Cantabile
* Kaiba
* Minami-ke

Adding:

* Gankutsuou (This does not get enough love)
* Hajime no Ippo (One of my personal favorites)
* ef - Tale of Memories & ef  - Tale of Melodies
* Akagi (This anime I consider as proof to my thesis that an anime on any topic can be riveting.)
* Honey and Clover
* Sayonara Zetusbou Sensei (Very hit or miss for some people, but I love it)
* Infinite Ryvius
* NANA
* Aria (the Animation, the Natural, and The Origination. Very mellow and saccharine, but surprisingly enjoyable)
* Mai-Hime (with the caveat that you shouldn't watch any of the other series that spin off from this)
* Dennou Coil
* Ginga Eiyu Densetsu (Not from the last 10 years, but it's something everybody loves once they put in the time for it)

Avoid:

* Death Note (if you stop around episode 26, it's a fairly acceptable show.)
* Suzumiya Haruhi (I personally am still a fan of it, but the second season does take a giant drop in quality for the sake of their performance art torturing the audience. It's a hard pill to swallow for some.)
* Naruto (DBZ v2.0)
* Bleach (DBZ v3.0)
* Witch Hunter Robin (Just not a particularly good series, despite all the press it gets)
* Code Geass (If you **really** enjoy Death Note, then you might enjoy this. The second season is so completely over the top and ridiculous though, that it's almost impossible to take any of its big dramatic moments seriously.)
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is one of my all time favorites too. Have the second season, will work on getting the first when I can!

Thanks for all the great suggestions! I liked Death Note up to a point. Never got around to finishing the manga. Naruto and Bleach I watched for 70+ episodes then they got licensed. I didn't miss them.

I really enjoyed Code Geass. I love super over the top cliffhangers. It may not be believable, but they live in a world where they drive super mechs so it is fine.

where the fuck is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann? Mushishi?
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it? Buhhhhhh. 
>> ARTICLE
You mean to say that out of all the anime you've watched you haven't seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann? Even the reddit alien dons the glasses of Kamina. It's like listing the best pork products of the 21st century and failing to mention bacon.
>> ARTICLE
Macross Zero was alright, wasn't a big fan. Its art was beautiful but the story wasn't enticing to me. I will probably grab it for archive though. 

I kind of liked Ergo Proxy, even though it was kind of hard to understand what was going on. Thank you for the suggestions!
>> ARTICLE
Macross Zero in my opinion wasn't that great of an anime. But I think it was the Studio's last macross project so it's really well done. Same thing with the original Gunslinger Girls anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Kin's Journey is pure gold!
>> ARTICLE
I would have put up almost exactly the same stuff. I just don't like death note and texhnolyze, I'd have Mononoke and Mushishi up there instead

Claymore was great, but the ending was a bit so-so. They either need to make a second season or I need to read the manga =).

Which Full Metal are you talking about? ;D

Thank you for the suggestions!
>> ARTICLE
To me the ten best anime of the decade were the ones I had the most fun watching or felt the most compelled to watch, flaws and all.  It turned out that all of those were well known, and presented no real surprises.  The Claymore anime did end less well than I expected it should have, but I really loved the show.   Full Metal II is better than I in my opinion.  * Next time you should compile a list of hidden gems.  For that I think you'll get a much more interesting response.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really loved Claymore and its exploration of Claire, and her relationship with Rakki and Teresa. Great set of characters in the single-digit Claymores, too.

Are you talking about Full Metal Panic? If so, I agree that the second series was better than the first. A lot more mature and dark, I think.

F-M-Alchemist.  Panic was fun, but not in the same league in my opinion.  I do not know why these two anime have such similar names...

My personal top 10, although I'm a fairly recent convert to anime:

* Azumanga Daioh
* FLCL
* Cowboy Bebop
* Minami-Ke
* Welcome to the NHK
* The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
* School Rumble
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Death Note 
* Kanon (I liked it more than Clannad)

Also I'm not quite finished watching Genshiken, but it's quite excellent. Planetes deserves an honorable mention as well- I'm not finished with it either.
>> ARTICLE
Planetes is so great, it's on my list of top ten anime from the last ten years that isn't even ten yet.

Planetes is so ten, it's on my anime great list of last years that isn't last even great anime list how did I get here where are my pills
>> ARTICLE
My personal favorites are:

Buso Renkin

Gun X Sword

.hack//sign

Fullmetal Alchemist

Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (and Higurashi no Naku koro ni Kai, the second season)

That's just my list off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember if I watched Gun X Sword or not.. it sounds familiar but I will look into it.

.hack//sign was excruciating for me to watch. I don't know why. Thank you for the suggestions!
>> ARTICLE
Gun X Sword is lots of fun.  Same director as Code Geass and Planetes.
>> ARTICLE
No one seems to have said:

* Scrapped Princess
* Soul Eater
* Jyu Oh Sei
* Zegapain
* Noein


>> ARTICLE
Soul eater was flippin awesome.  I'm surprised it doesn't get mentioned more.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for these! I've actually seen Scrapped Princess, Jyu Oh Sei and Noein and enjoyed all of them. Thank you again!
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome. If you like Eva or RahXephon (or honestly, the matrix) then check out Zegapain. It starts slow but is quite philosophical in nature as it continues.

Also, if you like Law and Order stuff, let me recommend the anime "Monster." It's an excellent crime drama. Very well animated/well written. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't really watched anime in ages. I need to catch up on it myself (it's just hard to sift through all the awful, crappy ones) but here are the ones I enjoyed. (I'll probably forget some.)

By: **Mamoru Oshii**

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence

Not sure who these are by...

* Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
* Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig.

* Castle in the Sky
* Grave of the Fireflies
* My Neighbors the Yamadas
* Whisper of the Heart

By: **Katsuhiro Otomo**

There. That's all I can muster up for now.
>> ARTICLE
Battle Angel is awesome, but only covers the first Manga, and there are over 20 now.

Mermaid Forest/Scar are both awesome and older stuff by Rumiko Takahashi, so you can't really go wrong there.

Lain is one you'll want to see soon. It really is one of the quintessential series out there.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that's an amazing. list. Thank you for your time! 

Highly recommend Last Exile! Thank you very much again.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. :) I love that you made this post. Favorite-ing it for reference whenever I need to consume more anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just in case you didn't catch it, I have ALL of the suggestions given thus far and eliminated the duplicates for easy searching in list form in my original post. =)
>> ARTICLE
Make sure you watch Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust. Not just plain Vampire Hunter D, it's AWFUL! It's right up there (or down there) with M.D. Geist.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who can't enjoy M.D. Geist isn't someone I want to watch anime with. M.D. Geist and Fist of the North Star are the great dark comedies of anime as far as I'm concerned. They're a lot more fun than what passes for comedy today.  =P
>> ARTICLE
M.D. Geist is great "camp" anime, but cannot take it seriously within it's intended genre. FotNS on the other hand, I cannot watch at all. I will also def. agree that alot of the new stuff is REALLY weak. If you want funny, watch Excel Saga! Funniest anime ever!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I actually did watch Vampire Hunter D. I was expecting sweetness like in Bloodlust but... meh.
>> ARTICLE
Cue a lot of suggestions from longer than 10 years ago.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for posting this so I don't have to point out each person with poor reading comprehension.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to give a slightly different list.  

Just fun to watch (ie. funny and somewhat endearing):
Devil Hunter Yokho;
Ranma 1/2;
Those Who Hunt Elves;
Sorcerer Hunters;
Cooking Master Boy

Over the top fighting:
Fist of the North Star; 
Baki the Grappler;
Trigun;
Hunter x Hunter;
Hellsing;
Bleach;
Rorouni Kenshin;
Shadow Skill;
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan;
Shura No Toki


>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestions! Cooking Master Boy reminded me of one of my favorite anime, Yakitate!! Japan. If you haven't checked it out, I highly suggest you do!
>> ARTICLE
I have just finished watching the first 10 episodes of Yakitate! Japan.  I love it.  Thanks a ton for suggesting it.  I loved Cooking Master Boy because it was like an anime version of Iron Chef.  Yakitate! Japan is similar but has a comedic twist that I love.  Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Yakitate Japan is super over the top in its creations, but it's so hilarious. Glad you're enjoying it! It will just get better =)

I'd recommend Summer Wars, its an Anime Movie~

Yozakura Quartet. I rarely see it mentioned. Also Mnemosyne.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestions! I will add those to the list. They sound extremely interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I sincerely hope you enjoy them. They are both quiet short, which is how I prefer my anime (at least compared to 70+ episodes filler-fests).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, after about 80 episodes with no ending in sight a la Naruto and Bleach, I just quit and don't miss them at all. 

The only anime I finished that had over 100 episodes with lots of fillers (albeit great fillers), was Prince of Tennis. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my all time favourites is Beck. 
>> ARTICLE
I will be adding this! Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit....now I've got that full moon sway song stuck in my head.
>> ARTICLE
Not surprised that no one has said this, but the Seikai series (Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars I/II/III). One of the most underrated anime in my opinion. Some of the later series come under the 10 year mark, but it started in the late 90s-early 2000s.
>> ARTICLE
I think Princess Tutu deserves a spot on this list. The name may be deceiving, where at first I thought this series would be a flowery, over-the-top magical girl series, it turned out to not be an old, clich stereotypical magical girl anime at all. The plot was creative, the atmosphere was sinister and magical, the characters fresh and multi-faceted, and the art stunningly beautiful.

EDIT: And it's one of the few dubs that I find enjoyable. I got both seasons on DVD and watched the entire dubbed anime, and I loved it. Please check it out!
>> ARTICLE
I will add this. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
**Death Note**

**Code Geass**

**Elfen Lied**

**Full Metal Alchemist**

(I'm not sure if you actually meant 10+ as opposed to 10-, but **Serial Experiments Lain** came out in 98 and is damn good)

I don't get why so many people are listing Eve no Jikan when it's only had like 6 episodes released so far. It doesn't start off too bad, but how can you even judge it at this point?

edit: Also, I recommend checking out [Anime News Network's ranks](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?top50=best_bayesian&n=100) as a starting place to look for anime you might be interested in...
>> ARTICLE
Eve no Jikan only has 6 eps.
>> ARTICLE
Now I feel stupid. I only watched the first four... how the hell did they wrap it up in the next two?
>> ARTICLE
Eve no Jikan isn't a linear epic like typical popular anime. It was almost like a collection of short stories.
>> ARTICLE
What he said~
Still very enjoyable though!
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I did say 10+... =)

I have all of FMA Brotherhood.

Will look into Elfen Lied! Thank you.

My own suggestion is a show I haven't seen and is languishing on my hard drive.

[The Vision of Escaflowne](http://myanimelist.net/anime/182/Escaflowne).
>> ARTICLE
I remember watching a few of the episodes when I was like 7 on Saturday mornings. I always thought the [Fox Kids OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ZXbrqPjKM) was the shit but watching it now I'm like WTF kind of Opening is that?
>> ARTICLE
Do not ever watch the drivel that was the Escaflowne movie. They tried (and failed, horribly) to condense the series into a single movie.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it a condensing of the series. The story was different as well as the art. If I recall correctly, the movie was made with a Western audience in mind.
>> ARTICLE
Nice choice, this might actually knock something off my backlog.

[Giant Robo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2321/Giant_Robo)
>> ARTICLE
[Serial Experiments Lain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain), the anime poster-child for archetypal mind-fuckery.
>> ARTICLE
I had a feeling going that after I blacklisted Bebop and Evangelion, the most likely winners would be Lain or Utena (or maybe Sailor Moon because people want to rewatch it before the remake airs?).
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Utena or Lain. 
>> ARTICLE
I would've nominated Utena if TrueAnime hadn't already done it rather recently.

My second choice was actually Escaflowne, but you beat me to it.
>> ARTICLE
I would love to see this one, been on my list of plans to watch!
>> ARTICLE
Oshit, didn't even realize this came out that long ago. I'd love to see this one chosen.
>> ARTICLE
Allow me to interest you in [Brother, Dear Brother](http://myanimelist.net/anime/795/Onii-sama_e...).
>When starting at a new school, Nanako is thrust into the world of female rivalry and love. She is choosen into the Sorority, giving her an enviable postition according to all the girls left out. However, since Nanako is not from a wealthy family, most girls find it unfair that she was choosen. Nanako is left to protect herself from wicked rumors and mean plots to make her leave the school. Along with her best friend since preschool, and new friends made along the way, she uncovers the past of some of the more popular girls in school and on her journey through highschool she learns of love, loss and her own family's secrets... 

Why this? Aside from being a source of inspiration for Utena (a 90's series I may have nominated were it not for /r/trueanime's club watching it recently), it should prove to be interesting. Considering it's a shoujo series, it's not aimed at [most of /r/anime](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=345x150&chco=0000e0&chl=Male%20%5B1656%5D%7CFemale%20%5B109%5D%7COther%20%5B12%5D&chd=e%3A7oD7Ab). So I figure it's probably new to most people here. It's also an adaptation of a 70's shoujo series written by Riyoko Ikeda, a mangaka who was one of the [Forty-Niners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_24_Group). You should expect to see social commentary (drug use, sexuality, class divisions, etc.). The show inspired later, more popular works, but why not come see what they were building off of?

How about just to the end of the Dark Tournament arc? That's about where it gets best.
>> ARTICLE
This. I like this. Though I worry people may not be as into this idea as it is a little long.
>> ARTICLE
I don't look forward to testing the provisions regarding 3+ cour shows...the provision of holding a vote to determine whether we continue was a stopgap to not prohibit long shows, without thinking too hard of how that vote would be carried out, or what kind of conditions would be required to keep going with the rewatch...there is very little chance of the club being able to handle four consecutive months of only watching Yu Yu Hakusho and still managing to have discussion after that period of time. People who didn't want to watch it are going to get fed up waiting for it to end. The alternative is starting watch #4 while YYH is still ongoing, which is probably what would have to happen.

I'm curious for opinions regarding this. Cardcaptor Sakura would have to undergo a similar process, being 70 episodes (YYH is 112). Also GaoGaiGar (49) and Brother, Dear Brother (39) and Gundam Wing (49)...and probably others I haven't looked at.
>> ARTICLE
A simple "yes/no" vote sounds good, but as Bobduh [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1d3dho/anime_club_voting_for_monthly_movie_2_completed_5/c9mj4lu), there's a disconnect between those who vote for something and those who follow through on it. You could seek to remedy that somewhat by limiting the pool of voters to only those who had already participated. Although that's not a perfect solution, it would help. But, considering you currently automate vote tallying, I'm guessing this might complicate the matter. Manually counting such votes remains a possibility, but as numbers go up, that increasingly becomes more of a pain.

Still, the policy itself makes sense. You don't want to pick a 112 episode series only to realize most people have lost interest 20 episodes in and now the club's just dead for months. But you've already seen the obvious benefits and drawbacks of your proposed alternative. Considering activity has been shown to dip perilously low at points, splitting the attention of the club is likely to be a bad idea, unless the audience for one watch and the audience for the other is mutually exclusive. If people already take issue keeping up with one watch, keeping up with two isn't going to be any easier for them.

But if we *don't* hold two simultaneous watches, that's its own problem. As [you noted](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1aoduf/anime_club_voting_for_monthly_movie_1_is/c8zeie6), we've already seen that anime will win with only a plurality of the vote rather than a simple majority. So we might end up spending months watching something only a majority of the minority wants to watch. And that would then leave the majority out in the cold. (What an odd situation, where absolute democracy has lead to minority rule.) This presumes we limit the voting pool to participants, as I suggested earlier. If it's open to anyone and everyone, they might well vote to continue the watch even though those who will actually be participating don't want to.

Yeah. I can see why you wouldn't want to have to actually deal with this. Every choice seems flawed. I do not see an ideal solution, so the question is what the better alternative is. If you held two watches, you could slow down both to make them more manageable, but that's still undesirable. And consider the nightmare situation: What if we pick a long series this time, and then the next watch is also a long series? Would you then want to open the process up to three simultaneous watches? I recognize this isn't likely, but it's still a consideration.

Either way, people are going to be unhappy. Either the club will spend a while watching something theyre not into, or theyll have to choose between two simultaneous watches to give their attention to, ultimately harming both. We could put a hard ceiling for episode count to just avoid the problem altogether, although that would forbid some series that maybe the majority truly does want to watch the entirety of.

Since I see problems with every option, I know the one Im ultimately settling on proposing has problems as well, but I think it works out the best. Id combine the popular vote and the simultaneous watches. Make the vote to continue the long watch exclusive to participants (if feasible) while also letting another show get watched. After thinking about the pros and cons, thats what I think would produce the most efficient and equitable result.
>> ARTICLE
>The alternative is starting watch #4 while YYH is still ongoing, which is probably what would have to happen.

This is probably the best plan. Maybe a kind of show of hands could occur to find out whether enough people want to keep watching it to generate meaningful discussion, so we're not posting a bunch of empty threads if most people decided to drop out. But certainly I don't think more than two months in a row of the same thing would be good for the overall state of the club.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that I have a problem with having more than one at once, but I then run a conflict of pacing. I don't want to have to slow down the watches much more than they are now (we might retreat to 3 per watch because of the complaints of pacing), but it's clear that watching two or more at once will make it hard to keep up.
>> ARTICLE
You have a point. Between ongoing shows, 2 or more club watches, and whatever people are watching on their own because they just want to, I can see the non-NEETs among us getting stretched for free time.

Personally I have very little interest in getting into something with more than about 50 episodes at this point, so hopefully most people feel the same way and it won't be a huge issue.

Which continuity? Maybe the [Ryo-ohki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/539/Tenchi_Muyo!_Ryo-Ohki) OVA? Or one of the others... I don't remember which is which that well.
>> ARTICLE
I was suggesting the original Tenchi Muyo. But it would be neat to compare and contrast some of the different continuities (ie. Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi Universe, etc. ). 
>> ARTICLE
If it can be at all helped, we're not watching more than roughly 30-ish episodes, for the sake of time. So we could watch those three 6-episode OVA series plus specials, or that Universe TV series, but not both.

Of course. The three 6-episode OVA series plus specials would probably be best.

I would go with Turn A or G before ever going with Wing. Wing is horrendous. Poor writing, ridiculous characters, impossible physics. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It's a japanese kung-fu movie with giant robots. It isn't supposed to be super serious and deep. Nor is it meant to be taken seriously, that is what makes it so entertaining. If you watch it and try and take it seriously you won't enjoy it. As for Wing, no matter how you look at it, the show is terrible. With G you can laugh at it, it's ridiculousness, it's corniness, and it's racism. It is comical. If you can't tell after the first episode that G is supposed to be light-hearted and ridiculous then there is no point in watching it. The show was made to be a 20 minute weekly model commercial, and they did not try and hide the fact. G gundam is far better than many of the gundam series.
>> ARTICLE
>impossible physics

...Giant robot show, not sure what you're expecting.

I've heard good things about Turn A, but I haven't seen any of it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't even vaguely understand the Gundam universe, but I assume that Gundam Wing is completely self-contained right?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It's an AU Gundam series so it's very much self contained. No need to have prior knowledge of Gundam anything to enjoy it.

I don't really pretend to understand the overall Gundam universe either, but according to wikipedia, Gundam Wing occurs in its own separate timeline/alternate universe.

[Those Who Hunt Elves](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1045/Those_Who_Hunt_Elves/)

Thank you! :)

Glad you mentioned Build Fighters, it really doesn't get enough credit. It sounds and looks absolutely amazing, probably the best animation I've seen for a TV series.

Though I'm a bit disappointed that you left out Gunbuster! Maybe it's just me, but the music is such a massive part of why Gunbuster is my favourite (along with all the other amazing stuff in it). I know Gunbuster is your favourite too so I was hoping you'd mention it.

Most of your songs are openings/endings, so include singing and have been noted for my collection of them. Your selection of OST's has been noted, thanks!

Ok - I'll fish some non OP/ED OST out of the playlist as well - you seem to imply those are missing -  I just took whatever I liked the most the first time around ;)

sorry if I replicate some of the first one's, I'll try to make sure I don't!

I'll clean it up a little better than the last one, too.

Bleach: B13a, Soundscape to Ardor, On the Precipice of Defeat

Death Note: L no Shisou, L no Nakama, Mello's Theme

Gokukoku no Brynhildr: Brynhildr In The Darkness

Kuroko no Basuke: Sessen, Notice Iribe

Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei: Universal Use, Magical Chase

Monogatari: (kaiki themes) Ominous, Imitation

Naruto: Sasuke's theme, Sasuke - destiny

One piece: The The The Strongest, Luffy's Fierce Attack, Three Towers, Luffy Gear 2nd, Karakuri Castle Transform!, Giant Stronghold. Takeoff, Karakuri Defense System Deploy (I know they're quite a lot, but each one of theme is a masterpiece, to me)

White Album 2: Todokanai koi (piano version)

Do you think we can make a playlist out of this? Spotify or anything else, online.

edit: added tracks.

Order of tracks is in no particular order.

**Giant Robo The Animation:**

An absolutely amazing combination of both opera and orchestra pieces. All tracks are done with an orchestra, as far as I know. It's an absolute crime that this anime isn't more well known!

1. [L'esiler D'Amore - Una Furtiva Lagrima ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3uij4CF9H8)

2. [Cataclysm Over Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPlQiOJFpyg)

3. [Rush! Issei & Yohshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG_0fak-7y4)

3. [Arrival of Giant Robo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnr2-l4j2-k)

4. [Historys' Greatest Decisive Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juWAvmuefyE)

**Gunbuster:**

You can't really explain how amazing Gunbuster's OST is without actually watching the series. It's just too perfect. Some incredibly moving and somber tracks combined with HOT-BLOODED ACTION!!! If you haven't seen this, you should. It's only six episodes.

2. [Noriko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_hYYoB3fw)

1. [Fly High!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEEPosF-tNU)

3. [Toki no Kawa wo Koete...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33Rv2Z-4iI)

4. [Gunbuster March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxKhhMdbU5I)

5. [Ketsui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBKDeztJnmU)

Also both soundtracks for Zetsuen no Tempest is great. All orchestral stuff, no vocals that I recall.

And Kids on the Slope soundtrack is good. The [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOf3MVMPGOc) is on the sound track, with no vocals either.

Erm, this is for OSTs, Button.

That was one of the few I recognized immediately :)

Correct!

[9](/s "Attack on Titan")

[16](/s "Kaiba")?

[21](/s "5 Centimeters Per Second")

[30](/s "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann")? If not, then I really feel like I should know it.

[34](/s "Monogatari. Do I have to correctly guess the part? Nise I guess.")

[40](/s "Dragon Ball Z")

[14](/s "Fate/Zero")?

Alright 14 is bothering me way more than it should.

Correct!

Edit: #9 is correct too.

Edit2: Oh man, #21, #30 and #34 are also correct(#16 isn't though). Good job!

Just gave it another listen and 36 reminds me so much of [36](/s "Steins;Gate")

I guess the Science fiction genre can be felt in this track, it's not from Steins;Gate though.

I'm just editing more in as I go, if that's not a problem.

[1](/s "Hitsugi no Chaika - Aria")
>> ARTICLE
Lol, I took it from your channel.

The Chaika OST is very content ID heavy, so I can understand if nobody takes the time to upload it in its entirety. I just uploaded the four tracks I liked the most.

And [8](/s "Code Geass R2 - Check Mate")

I see. I though it was a track from Aria the origination in the beginning.

And correct again.

Both are correct! The name of the first track is [](/s "Kaze no Densetsu") though.

Yep, good job.

omg, [32 is](/s "Detective Conan"). So underwatched in this sub. I can't remember the track name though.

This was a hard one, only a handful I was sure of with a few I have a gut feeling too. Also it seems ours got really mixed up as you planned on using King's Plan and I used #15 and #16..

I'll make another one if the future if no one else steps up, I got a guy who might make one at some point as well.
>> ARTICLE
You got #10, #13, #37 and #39. Surprised many didn't recognize #28. I didn't notice you used those two tracks, but it's understandable since both are one the most famous tracks of their respective series.

I usually catch the few last ones that haven't been found but this time everything was found when I checked the thread.

Also, that Guess #2 is still torturing me. Will you add any more hints? :P

\#2 is also present in this edition, and #28 is a sport anime.

I usually go directly to the video when i come late to the party, it's still entertaining to guess before checking thee answers.

[12](/s "Parasyte")  

This one was really hard, I got at least 5 answers in the last 2 IIRC.

A lot of the shows I just hadn't watched (as usual), though some - like the one you mentioned, of course - I immediately recognized.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah when I do these I tend to start thinking I'm making it too hard and include more popular series, do you prefer it harder or easier? I'll try to keep it in mind as I make my next one and make it harder should you prefer it.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer them easier, it's not fun when you can't guess any at all although it could turn into first come first serve if it's too easy. I would also suggest trying out [Sporcle](http://www.sporcle.com/) for this.
>> ARTICLE
I tried Sporcle once but couldn't get it too work, I prefer it this way either way.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Is it really ? I almost used only animes mentioned at least once here.
>> ARTICLE
Mainly ratings or expectations of ratings.  

_GTO_ was based on a manga that had previously been adapted to for live action television, and the finale was, at the time, the single highest rated TV show in Japan. FMA is based on an incredibly popular manga.  

Also lots of shows are created for marketing purposes, to promote a manga, line of toys, or a novel series.  Other shows are created with an eye to future DVD sales. These aspects can come into play in planning episode counts.

Finally, the high episode count shows are often aimed at general audiences, whereas a lot of the shows with shorter runs are aimed at otaku audiences, and aired late at night.  
>> ARTICLE
I also would like to know how much cost an average One Piece episode compared to a Fate/Zero episode...  
Make more than 26 would be crazy...
>> ARTICLE
This is, in my opinion, the correct answer. It's a risky move to plan a 2 or 3 cour series if you have no idea how well it'll do. It would be much easier to just add another season once you see that the dvds sell well. If it doesn't, you can cut your losses.
>> ARTICLE
There's also a difference in who's paying for what.  Most late-night series are "sponsored" by the studio and the distributor (e.g. Shaft and Aniplex paid for MBS to air Madoka); they're generally taking a bath on broadcast costs in hopes that they can make it up on BD and DVD sales.  That's also why ecchi series are increasingly resorting to over-the-top censorship, which is removed for revenue-generating channels like premium cable, streaming and disc releases.  

Meanwhile, the TV networks do more to subsidize or sell ads during daytime or prime-time shows, which lightens the load on the supply end and lends itself to longer series, even up to the ridiculous extremes of Naruto, Detective Conan or even, dare we say, [Sazae-san](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazae-san).
>> ARTICLE
Yes yes. Profit model and expected audience must vary a lot.

Since Sazae-san has been invoked, I feel it's worth linking to [this](http://www.awesome-engine.com/2010/03/06/what-anime-actually-looked-like-in-2009/) and [this](http://www.awesome-engine.com/2010/12/20/what-anime-actually-looked-like-in-2010/).

I think these posts point out that (1) a bunch of stuff airs during the day & is pretty mainstream--this is where you find a lot of long-running shows, some of which completely pass the English-speaking internet by because they get no fansubs/streaming;* and (2) change happens faster in the world of niche-audience anime than it does in the world of mainstream-audience anime. (IIRC the main long-term change that that writer notes in mainstream titles is the decline of mecha, or the metamorphosis of mecha into anime which is--even more--directly about toys.)

No doubt that's a very broad-brush division which could do with a lot of detailed shading-in, detailing exceptions, crossover successes &c &c. But I think it's useful.

*No doubt in some/all cases this is because no one is interested in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
12-14 or 24-26 episodes has been the norm for a long time.  More than that is the *exception*.
>> ARTICLE
12 episodes is already quite long: it's four hours of show.

In the 1990s, the norm was short OVAs, with at most two hours of show.
>> ARTICLE
My real question is why aren't *any* US shows made this way? Instead every single series is made to run indefinitely, until they stop being (perceived as) profitable.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows have done it, but the vast majority are just sitcom style with episode/monster of the week and those far out number the ones with a defined "end".

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Aw, even gems like House? There's always good canceled shows if you hate indefinite lengths like I do, like Firefly and Terriers.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say you've been missing out then. There's a reason a lot of people are calling what we have now a new golden age in television. If not network stuff, then at least the cable programming.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because the us networks don't get a bunch of new shows every seasons. So less risk.
>> ARTICLE
1) Adapt Light Novel or Manga into 12 episode anime.

2) Merchandise the fuck out of it. Figurines, Bluray discs, DVDs, OSTs, OP/ED Singles, Character songs, Drama CDS, Body Pillows. EVERYTHING.

3) Milk franchise for all it's worth. When sales drop, forget about it, and restart process with the next new series.
>> ARTICLE
It's always been like this. This is not something new. It's just nostalgia bias.
>> ARTICLE
Cost to produce vs potential profit.  Committing plot-wise to even a 26 episode show is sketchy in the current economic downturn.
>> ARTICLE
I think it is mostly so that we don't get any meaningless and drawn out sequences. Think back to Dragonball Z. It took fucking forever just for them to actually start fighting and finish. Not hating on Dragonball Z or anything, cause I love it, but I think it could have been much better had they cut down the drawn out sequences and got to the fighting more. What 12 -24 seems to be the perfect duration for anime that wants to get to the point so that it retains our attenttion, but at the same time be long enough to develop characters and the story.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting point, it makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
shows that end up becoming more than 24+ episodes are generally very successful and very long manga. Dragonball is written in a way that could end with each arc, but Shounen Jump asked for more and more was given. 

A lot of Shounen Anime from Shounen Jump or Shounen Sunday's end up becoming 50+ anime due to constant flow of new material and a steady general audience which has a guaranteed viewer ship which in turn equates to profitability.

> we don't get any meaningless and drawn out sequences

Explain that to Gintama (300+ episodes), Hayate the Combat Butler (150 episodes), and Sket Dance (50+ episodes).

Welcome to the NHK!

Cowboy Bebop

Samurai Champloo

Speed Grapher
>> ARTICLE
For TV series, Scrapped Princess and Cowboy Bebop come to mind.  There are plenty of OVAs and movies with actual endings. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know exactly what genre's you enjoy, but I'll try to make a few suggestions. 

Please note that **these are not in any particular order**

First, my favorite, and thus I am obliged to offer it, is 

**1) Rurouni Kenshin**

Historical/Samurai genre. It's a 90-some episode series with a couple of the best OVAs ever made in anime. 

I'd normally recommend to only watch the first and second of the three arcs, as the last arc was filler (but pretty good, by filler standards.. just loses the same feel). And after the first two arcs, when your appetite is whetted for more understanding of Kenshin, watch the OVAs. 


**2) Last Exile**

Steampunk-like drama with excellent character development and an excellent ending.


**3) Great Teacher Onizuka**

Real Life/School Life genre. Also known as GTO, this anime is guaranteed to make you cry. It's short, sweet, and has a beautiful Live Action to go with it that's every bit as good. It's about a motorcycle-gang-member turned teacher and how he connects with the students.


**4) Monster**

Psychological Thriller genre. This is a 70-some episode series, where the main character featured is a doctor who saves a child patient with brain surgery, that turns out to be a psychotic serial killer. This series has amazing character development, very complex and dark story lines and an excellent  and satisfying conclusion.


**5) Samurai Champloo / Cowboy Bebop**

Historical/Samurai and Space Opera/Drama genres. Both these anime were made by the same guy. They have very similar story arcs and episode formulations. Each is very enjoyable, has good character development and interesting story telling techniques (especially Champloo). The final plots of each are tearjerkers, but they're excellent conclusions to the story.


**6) Trigun**

Kind of a Post-apocalyptic/Western (like cowboys) genre. Very fun beginning, very moving ending. Very meaningful, excellent closure.


**7) Wolf's Rain**

Post-apocalyptic/Super-natural/Drama genre. Incredible anime all the way through. Final episodes (3 of them) will require an entire box of tissues. Probably one of the best endings ever.


I hope you'll find these suggestions helpful. They're certainly several of my favorites. I tried to narrow the list to animes that had very concrete and satisfying endings.. but most of them are sad, though I didn't get the feeling from your post that you meant non-sad endings - just ones that tie up all the loose ends in a satisfying way.

He died. I promise. :)

**SPOILERS**


1) Rurouni Kenshin

Your kidding right? Kenshin dying of AIDS at the end i don't really consider a good ending. He should have died in a epic sword duel or something. 
>> ARTICLE
High 5 for Wolfs Rain!! I saw it pretty recently so I didn't realise about the episode time gap. I loved the ending to that because iof the way it bookends. And definitely a tear jerker!!
>> ARTICLE
GTO does not have closure.
>> ARTICLE
> 2) Last Exile

> Steampunk-like drama with excellent character development and an excellent ending.

I disagree with the way they rushed the ending.

> 6) Trigun

> Very meaningful,

Knives was a neat character but the ending and "meaning" was pretty sloppy and disjointed.  The action scenes were great but the rest leaves you scratching your head.

> 7) Wolf's Rain

> Post-apocalyptic/Super-natural/Drama genre. Incredible anime all the way through. Final episodes (3 of them) will require an entire box of tissues. Probably one of the best endings ever.

The original series lacked an ending so they tacked a few eps at the very end.  They were very ambitious with the premise but I can't agree that it was "one of the best endings ever".
>> ARTICLE
i got into anime *because* of Rurouni Kenshin! 

Edit: to add: i was 12, totally new to the anime scene and the songs Heart of Sword and Fourth Avenue Cafe blew my mind :).
>> ARTICLE
"horrible feeling of emptiness as you try to work out what just happened to the characters you just spent 26 episodes getting used to. I dunno if this is just bad writing (which seems overt in the more over stylised anime)"
Were you talking about Cowboy Bebop?

Also Rurouni Kenshin manga had a better / different closure than the anime+oav...

I thought the last couple of episodes of Last Exile were really bad since they really didn't explain anything...
>> ARTICLE
Nah I felt alright with Bebop because I felt Spike completed his journey, tho I hear there's a manga that continues from that point onwards (though it may not be canon)

I've never heard about Kenshin having a different ending in the manga though... that'll be one to check out!!
>> ARTICLE
I have to strongly disagree on Last Exile.  This was one of my favorite anime, but I thought the end events were not explained at all, at least as far as revealing the backstory.  I was also bothered by a character apparently coming back from the dead for no explained reason.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of the things that really pissed me off about the ending to Eden of the East. Fat boy was dead. It said so on the computer.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with ScarletEmerald here.  I don't remember the ending very well, but it was pretty wtf.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Great anime, weird ending.
>> ARTICLE
Give 'Ghost in the Shell' a shot, I love it.
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't be anime if it had a good sense of closure. ;)
>> ARTICLE
Now and Then, Here and There.

I thought it was amazing, and only 13 episodes.  Very dramatic, but also uplifting.  I thought it had one of the most satisfying endings as well.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a storytelling difference. Miyazaki once said "happy endings are a product of silly western minds" or something like that.

Death Note has an ending that's very concrete, but not necessarily "good" depending on what you were feeling the whole anime. Chrono Crusade is in the same boat. I really liked the ending to the Inuyasha manga, but it hasn't been animated yet, and the manga's over 500 chapters long

Watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann first.

Some anime that give decent closure:
Ghost Hound, Ah! My Goddess, Hajime no Ippo (need to watch 2nd season, as well), Genshiken (definitely check this out, if you haven't already), Zipang
>> ARTICLE
I strongly urge everybody to watch *Bible Black*. It slides along a wide range of emotions and touches on a variety of philosophical and sociological themes. Literary penetrating the cinematographic media, it incorporates the best elements of virtually timeless classics such as Homer's *Illyad*, Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey* and, a more recent, *A Beautiful Mind*. It also bears strong resemblance to *Serial Experiments Lain* and *Neon Genesis Evangelion* in embracing the challenge of tackling the quest for one's inner and outer identity over and over again. A truly juicy piece.

What you described is the bittersweet ending. Elfen lied, Sola, you know Cruel Intentions style. It pisses me off too but I learn to just shrug them off as shit even though they were entertaining. If you want a anime that pulls a good ending try Kanon 2006 its nice and sad and every episode is watchable with no fillers. The ending will make you happy and not yearning for more. 
>> ARTICLE
Full Moon O Sagashite. Both the Manga and the Anime are excellent. I think the Manga has more closure than the anime though. 

Card Captor Sakura, DN Angel, FMA with the movie, Hand Maid May, etc etc. You can find them all here: http://getfansub.com/wiki/Category:Anime

A lot of the 26 ep animes are based on a much longer manga. Fruits Basket is a great example of that. Fruits basket is pretty long in the manga, but the ending is good and gives a good sense of closure. 

You should look up scanlations of the 26 episode anime series you've seen, and the manga is most likely finished or still going.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy crying, try Kanon. The ending wraps up the whole series really nicely.
>> ARTICLE
Princess Nine.  I also found it very entertaining, and I have almost no use for baseball, never watch it!
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo - A real ending. Good artwork and characters.

Cowboy Bebop - DUH. And watch the movie after episode 22 or 23 too.

Bokurano - If you aren't hooked after 3-4 episodes, pm me and i'll send you a cookie. LOADS of closure with this one.

[Barakamon!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon) It's about a calligrapher who was sent to an island after punching a calligraphy vet who called his work unoriginal. It's incredibly heartwarming.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! This sounds good!
>> ARTICLE
This post is practically fishing for a ["Shirobako"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'll check it out!

Servant x Service. From the creator of Working!, well worth the watch. 

Working! is as well actually. There are high school students in the show, but its a good mix of high schoolers and "adults", and its set in a non-school environment.

Both slide more towards the comedy side of slice of life.
>> ARTICLE
For a show that is *literally* about civil servants working at a low level bureaucratic position, *Servant x Service* was possibly one of the best comedies of that season.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'll have to look those up!
>> ARTICLE
[Planetes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) is about garbage collectors in space.

[Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon) is about a calligrapher.

[Shirobako](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako) is about people working in the anime industry.

All have an adult, working-age cast (though Barakamon involves a bunch of children as well).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Both barakamon and shiroboko had been recommended on here already, so with two votes i think I'll have to watch them :-)
>> ARTICLE
Be careful with Planetes though. The set up is amazing but there's a certain character that tends to get in the way of enjoying the show fully. Fuck you Tanabe.
>> ARTICLE
haha, thanks for the heads up!
>> ARTICLE
Eh don't mind that comment.  Planetes is a damn fine show, the dub is really great too.  Tanabe can act like a nuisance but is in no way a bad character.
>> ARTICLE
Sure she's a fine character later on but her wide eyed idealism in the beginning of the series is not only grating, it's cringe worthy. If you can get past the first four episodes it's a fine series but until after the [](/s "Coffin escapade") my god is she just horrible. You don't think she can get any worse until she ultimately does.
>> ARTICLE
[Planetes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) and [Space Brothers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai) are a distinctly sci-fi twist on slice of life conventions, but are basically excellent stories about adults living their day-to-day lives at their jobs, which are framed within the confines of realistic relationship growth and pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Plantetes was recommended by another user, so I'll definitely check it out! I like the idea of space garbage collectors. 
>> ARTICLE
Hm.. not sure about that specific age range, but can suggest a few aside from Shirobako and Barakamon, both of which are also good:

* [Rec](http://myanimelist.net/anime/710/Rec) is a series about a young adult voice actress, as is [Sore ga Seiyuu!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29163/Sore_ga_Seiyuu!)
* [Kimi ga Nozomu Eien](http://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien) is a drama that starts in high school but has a time skip to several years later with working young adults a few episodes in.
* [Natsuyuki Rendezvous](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13585/Natsuyuki_Rendezvous) is a romantic drama involving a woman running a flower shop.
* [Emma: A Victorian Romance](http://myanimelist.net/anime/345/Eikoku_Koi_Monogatari_Emma) is... exactly what is sounds like, though it's mostly a slice of life about a maid and a member of the gentry in Victorian England.
>> ARTICLE
Working is half high schoolers, half adults, but its one of my favorites.  


And Space Brothers is amazing, especially if you're as exited about space as I am.  The pacing is painfully slow sometimes, but I still give it a 9/10

Barakamon

Barakamon fits the best as many other have already said.
So I'll just add to Gin no Saji (age range is high school students) - it is nice SoL about agriculture.

[Hataraki Man](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1592/Hataraki_Man)
>> ARTICLE
[Patlabor.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patlabor)

It's about a police unit in Tokyo that use mecha set in the (at the time) future years of 1999-2002. The mecha aren't the focus, it's more about the characters. There are two OVA series and a 47 episode TV series. There's quite a bit of comedy, but there are serious episodes, too. 

[The first three episodes of the TV series are on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/OFTs97NpnUo)

*There are also two superb movies that are not to be missed, as well. These are completely serious in tone, with just a tad bit of humor in the first movie. I haven't seen the third movie, so I can't couch for it. Patlabor: The Movie 1 & 2 are amazing!

It's a great series, one of my favorite "slice-of-life" series ever. It's out of print, so 40 bucks is a steal. If you want a slightly unusual take on the school-life comedy, it's totally worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's all ten volumes too
>> ARTICLE
can you manage 30?
>> ARTICLE
It's the Anime
>> ARTICLE
Its one of my favorites. 
>> ARTICLE
try to knock it down because it did came out a while ago but the anime is freaking amazing, loved it.
>> ARTICLE
only anime i watched more then 2 times. also the newer version of the live action has a pretty badass onizuka in my opinion :D i would buy it! if you are not sure check out the first episode somewhere........i think i might watch the pilot again i just love the facial expression and the humor of GTO
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen the live-action movie where he saves "Canada Town"? I thought that was pretty hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
it's on my watchlist, it's a bit older right?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it is a little older. Probably late '90s early '00s I think. It was one of my favorite live-action adaptations. Second only to Shaolin Soccer's movie.
>> ARTICLE
okay i think i saw the intro to that one, guess i will put it on a higher defcon for my watchlist. (shaolin soccer was awesome especially the mihimaru gt song)
>> ARTICLE
I would jump at it for just 40 bucks. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait, the manga? If so, I'd take it.
>> ARTICLE
You are in /r/anime, remember? :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, when he said volume, I immediately thought of volumes as in books, lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's the Anime sorry I wasn't clear
>> ARTICLE
I personally wouldn't. I liked the manga much better. It's honestly up to you. If you're a big fan of it, go ahead and take it. Maybe try to haggle for a lower price first.
>> ARTICLE
You can't say an anime isn't good because it's not as good as the manga, because if that were the case, you could easily say that no anime are good because almost no anime will be as good as or better than the manga series. You can only compare it to other anime.
>> ARTICLE
Uh what? Yes I can. It's all a matter of opinion, what the heck? I think some animes are way better than their manga counterpart. wut

There are also a lot of animes of which the general consensus is that it's not as good as its manga/LN counterpart.

I just happen to dislike the GTO anime, hence the "personally wouldn't".
>> ARTICLE
I get what you're saying. And I wasn't trying to try to invalidate your opinion, I meant that when *someone in general* makes a judgement about an anime, I think it's best to compare them based on it's own merits, rather than it's inspiration. 

For instance, let's theoretically say two manga series are adapted into anime, one is ranked A, and another is ranked C. Now both of the anime are B in quality, and very comparable in terms of enjoyability. By your standard, the one that was based on Manga C is a better anime than the one based on Manga A? Doesn't seem right to me. That's what I was getting at.
>> ARTICLE
How is that not right, though? Some bleh points to mention about your example is, if they're both B animes then that's that. If C ranked manga gets A ranked anime, then it's just a better anime; I don't get the problem. It just so happens that the adaptation did something right that the manga didn't.

Also, for your example, you're digging way too deep and missing the point. It just so happens that I didn't like this particular anime. By no means did I say this was my standard.
This example is so far off the tracks :|. Just to get it off my chest, I don't know any "ranked C manga" that received a very good anime adaptation. It's either a popular series is good or it's not. That's basically it. I'm still kinda confused with your example :|
>> ARTICLE
Maybe that wasn't clear enough. A and C were the ratings of the hypothetical manga series before adaption. Both Anime turned out to be B in quality, and equally enjoyable. By your standard, you think that the anime based on the C rated manga was better, even though relative to each other, than anime are equal.

Whatever, it really doesn't matter. Logically though, it doesn't make sense to compare anime to their manga counterparts when determining if the anime was good or not. If you cared about being logical.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not really my standards, I just like whatever I like.

And it's perfectly valid to compare to the manga. Are the animations good? Is the VA good (mostly applies to dubbed animes)? Did they skip major parts of the stories? etc.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, if you want to say that an apple tasted better than an identical tasting apples because it came from a worse tree, that's your prerogative. 
>> ARTICLE
That is a silly question. Sasami-san@Ganbaranai would not feel right if it were remade with a more generic art style, and it is still airing! Same with everything else Shaft. KyoAni's shows wouldn't look right if they were drawn in like it was still the nineties. YuruYuri drawn like GTO would be really weird.

This is purely a nostalgia trip on your part, OP. A well produced and directed show should have an art style that fits the show. If anything, computers and modern techniques have made that far easier to achieve (e.g. Gankutsuou). There are not many old shows out there with great animation (as opposed to art). Irresponsible Captain Tylor is fine example, but modern shows have, in general, much better animation than older shows.
>> ARTICLE
Good response, and slightly off-topic, but is your username a reference to horizon?
>> ARTICLE
Congrats. Yep. Or should I say "judgement"? In two months, you are the first and only person to comment on it.

Although that probably has a lot to do with me only commenting in /r/anime starting a couple days ago...
>> ARTICLE
I love horizon so when I saw it I just had to ask.  A friend and I are eagerly anticipating any news of s3.  It's just so good, although very polarizing.  A show that deserves a lot more attention nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about the attention part. It's an atypical show. If it were the sort of show that would be beloved by a huge number of people, it wouldn't be so amazing.

I don't want to think about season 3; the wait is too painful. I just want it to be there, one day, and then I will watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you mean about the attention. But more people knowing it exists is more what I meant, as opposed to like bleach/naruto/one piece popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Inb4 GitS
>> ARTICLE
Serial Experiment Lain. There's something about the artwork that just fits so well with the story. Modern animation techniques and bright colors would ruin a part of it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, those shadows.
>> ARTICLE
I think yu-yu hakusho would be strange redrawn.
>> ARTICLE
It would undoubtedly end up without all the glorious shading in the original. YYH looks fantastic in that respect.

If you're looking for some episodes that really stand out, watch episodes 58 and 74.
>> ARTICLE
I have it in blu ray, so I will watch them tonight.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno. It worked for Hunter x Hunter. Same mangaka. But I guess Hunter x Hunter is still going. But it's SO OLD, respective to most adaptations nowadays.
>> ARTICLE
I didnt know one guy did both, wow.
>> ARTICLE
Goodness, very much so. I'm really attached to how they look, especially Kuwabara. I don't know why, but I feel like he'd be the most different-looking of the bunch if redrawn.
>> ARTICLE
Dat hairdo...
>> ARTICLE
A lot of iconic shoujo from the 70s/80s like *Rose of Versailles* or *Oniisama e* would just look odd in the moefied landscape of contemporary anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well penguindrum did a hilarious spoof of it that proves you point very well.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think if it were redone today with staff that had a bit of common sense, Rose of Versailles would look a *lot* better. I remember cringing watching horses "gallop" across a field. If a studio like Madhouse were to attempt a modern remake of the show, it could be potentially amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, it's the common sense part I worry about. Imagine stuff like that being thinly/poorly cel-shaded cg. 

A *Rose of Versailles* remake directed by Sayo Mayamoto, with perhaps some of the same staff that worked on *Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine* would be a sight to behold.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop. 
>> ARTICLE
I sometimes wonder what Dragonball Z would look like if it was animated like Angel Beats...
>> ARTICLE
I heard Infinite Stratos was getting a remake.. that series doesn't need one :(
>> ARTICLE
According to this old [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15ltv5/infinite_stratos_project_reboot/c7nn15v) on this subreddit, apparently it's for a new light novel volume but that's still just speculation.
>> ARTICLE
I just saw [Tekkonkinkreet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831888/?ref_=sr_1) for the first time the other day and at first the character animation seemed sloppy and careless. Now I think it is some of the most beautiful, thoughtful and expressive animation I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it, give yourself a gift by sitting down to watch it. Such a wonderful, moving film. Cannot recommend it enough.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're mistaken man,I think you're generalizing today's "art styles" into one, Idk what exactly you're thinking on, but even if it was back in the days, GTO has a certain style and some other style from the same time would've looked weird on it.

GTO could be perfectly done today, it just doesn't need to have flashy colours, degradades and some other shit that you might get to see on certain animes today.
>> ARTICLE
It could be done the same today, but it probably wouldn't be done the same way. It probably would have all those things that you mention that other anime have today that you call shit. Which is why I asked the question.
>> ARTICLE
>  It probably would have all those things that you mention that other anime have today

Why? Those are only some vague examples of what I think you might be thinking on, but like I said, that's only because those animes are like that for a reason, being how they are has a purpose.
The are a lot of today animes that don't have whatever you're thinking on or that style you're saying.
>> ARTICLE
JJBA would like to have a word with you 
>> ARTICLE
Yep may be the most fabulous and manly looking anime in quite a while.
>> ARTICLE
[Yes. Join us, GTO. Join us](http://imgur.com/aPECzjc)

Flame of Recca, Bubblegum Crisis, and the Project A-Ko series of movies.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely hoping that LoGH wins, but it's probably gonna be Bebop or Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
You say that but Heidi's on that list and it's gonna demolish the competition.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but I've never heard of that show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah most people on the sub probably haven't. It's just too old. And it's nothing special by itself really, just an anime that's more like an actual cartoon for kids. It's just that it's one of the precursors of the era  and since it was a success abroad, it is very famous among many adults as something from their infancy. A true classic in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
That might be, but if it's unpopular it's gonna lose, sadly.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's kind of a waste that nothing else even stands a chance.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I've only seen about 20 of these. I feel like a complete noob.
>> ARTICLE
No need to, a lot of people are new to anime, I've been watching for 11 years and I've not seen even half of these.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen pokemon at some point, and a few episodes of digimon 10 years ago. Get on my level.
>> ARTICLE
My votes for a lot of the matches.

**Bebop** VS Green Legend Ran - I adore both of them, but Bebop's on another level. Tough luck for Ran. It really is a great sci-fi.

Rose of Versailles VS Infinite Ryvius - Infinite Ryvius has some of my favorite characters. It's really strong on the character development front. I haven't seen Rose, but I can't imagine it being better.

**Castle in the Sky** VS Cities of Gold - Only partway into Cities, but the first few episodes haven't impressed. Going to vote on the Ghibli classic.

Nausicaa VS **A Wind Named Amnesia** - I'm probably going with the worse choice, but I doubt anyone else will vote for it, and I did enjoy watching it.

Sakura VS Dear Brother - Ouch, another one of my favorites going against a powerhouse. ;_;

Outlaw Star VS **Anne of Green Gables** - One of my favorite shoujos. They really gave Anne a tremendous amount of personality.

Slayers VS **Blue Submarine** - Slayers has the better characters, but Blue Submarine has the better story.

Barefoot Gen VS **Future Boy Conan** - Toughest choice yet. Gen had the bigger effect on me, but Conan is definitely the more enjoyable watch. The animation in that is amazing considering it's from the 70's.  

Pokemon VS **The Door into Summer** - Heh, it doesn't stand a chance over the nostalgia monster, but it was a hell of an interesting movie. Forbidden love always makes for an interesting story.

**Porco Rosso** VS Nemo - Another solid entry from Ghibli. If you have kids, they'll love Nemo though.

**Galaxy Express 999** VS The Dog of Flanders - Tough choice. A little more substance in the former.

**Dragonball** VS Venus Wars - I'm usually a sucker for sci-fi like Venus Wars, but it felt very hit an miss. Dragonball was just plain funny. 

**Princess Mononoke** VS A Little Princess Sara - My second favorite Ghibli film! I did like Sara, but not as much as some other WMT series. It's another riches to ruins story. Lots of drama and suffering. Sara was a bit *too* perfect for me though.

**My Neighbor Totoro** VS Memories - Another unfortunate match up. I think Memories could win against a lot of this list, but not Totoro.

**Escaflowne** VS Yokohama - My favorite mech of all time! Yokohama's more like an art house film. I rated both highly, but I enjoyed Escaflowne a lot more.

Akira VS **My Daddy Long Legs** - Judy is one of my top 10 favorite female characters ever! Akira's going to win this one easily, but at least I was able to put in one vote for the opponent.

Fist of the North Star VS **Yawara**  - FotNS just wasn't my thing. I guess I'm not into GAR

His and Her Circumstances VS **Romeo and the Black Bros** - If the former had more than 10 frames per episode, and if it wasn't 25% recaps, and if it had even a slightly decent ending, it'd have my vote. Romeo was good, but it suffered from the same problem that A Little Princess Sara had, in so much as Romeo had no character flaws at all.

**YuYu Hakusho** VS Wings of Honey Mayonnaise - Yuyu didn't have great writing, but it was damn entertaining. Wings had some amazing animation, but it fails to really capture your full attention. I will say that Wings has one of the most disturbing scenes in anime.

Here's a tip for future reference OP, since this is a new contest and no doubt a lot of people have different interpretations on what's a classic can you include a description part which properly describes what series classify?

Seriously though, Blue Submarine No. 6 has been in my top 3 since I first saw it on Toonami in 2000. It's a short, great series. It does have it's downfalls like it's pacing issues and lack of explanations, but I still think it's a damn fine series!


Oh, and the [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83TzooHQ3ps&list=PL97B8E6E4ED00FBA2) is fucking phenomenal.

Different time range and it was only open to television series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a good list of anime. I've seen 67/128 of them, and I've enjoyed most of them. Topics haven't been trending very well, so I don't expect many votes. However that just means that your vote is just that much more important. I imagine a lot of these matches will be very close.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 27/128, but they only make 3/64 pairs. I don't feel qualified to vote at all lol.
>> ARTICLE
Rose of Versailles vs Infinite Ryvius on the first round is sinister, but great list overall. what was the cutoff year for this? 2000?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it had to finish airing in 2000 or earlier.
>> ARTICLE
I think I've only seen like 2 of these.  I should really watch more of the classics.
>> ARTICLE
Ouch. Not happy about having to choose between *Perfect Blue* and *Gunnm* in the first round.
>> ARTICLE
Lodoss vs Nadia will be a tough one.

Yamato vs Area 88 OVA will be also interesting. Area 88 is really good but Yamato maybe has advantage in the eyes of the fans for it's very successful reboot version.

Berserk vs Candy Candy - talking about polar opposites. While Candy Candy is the first anime series that was shown in my country (not entirely sure) and will forever remain a positive experience of my childhood memories, I have to give vote for Berserk, the best dark fantasy anime although it isn't complete.

Outlaw Star vs Anne of the Green Gables - I really don't want Anne to go out so early, but it seems that it will probably lose this one.
>> ARTICLE
Digimon! Digimon! Digimon! (Just kidding, who even watched that?)

Looks like I missed the elimination round. I'm a bit disappointed and surprised that Touch didn't make it into the main tournament. I would think Touch to be a much more well known title than some of the ones that made it.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised me as well. I wish I knew how to view the vote counts for the elimination round, so I could see which shows just missed the cutoff.
>> ARTICLE
No Inuyasha :L
>> ARTICLE
Too recent.

Are these all from before 2000?

The shows could air in 2000, but no later. Basically just 20th century.

Thats... a whole lot of stuff that only a handful of people on this sub might have heard of much less seen. I don't even think it's all subbed either. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairly certain they all have subs. They might not all have great subs (Anonymous Russian Rippers bleh!), but they're all fairly easy to download and watch. 
>> ARTICLE
If Slam Dunk's inside this competition I feel that Captain Tsubasa should be too. It's a classic as much as SD.
>> ARTICLE
Should have nominated it then.
>> ARTICLE
I missed the nomination period :( Would've nominated touch and h2 too
>> ARTICLE
Touch was actually nominated. You can find it in the [full character list](http://animebracket.com/characters/classic-anime-tournament-favorite-anime-of-the-20th-century/). I was surprised it didn't get enough votes to make it through the elimination round. It's fairly well known.
>> ARTICLE
When looking at the results page, the number is the over-all voting rank, right? Because there's no way something like Cowboy Bebop has only 1 vote.
>> ARTICLE
The number is the anime's seed in the tournament. Think of it like the NCAA basketball tournament. The 1 seeds are the best teams.
>> ARTICLE
Anime ends at volume 13,chapter 106.there are total 200 chapters and no they don't date.manga is better than anime IMO.
>> ARTICLE
So would you suggest reading GTO from the very beginning?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah read from beginning.its really good

>> ARTICLE
Looks like I'll do that then thank you. I really wish they could re-adapt GTO and do the whole source material as an anime in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I would personally read it from the beginning. There are many scenes in the anime that were executed differently or different altogether. I started with the manga and I enjoyed it a lot more than the anime (though the anime was still good).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks.

Pls i need to know

what
>> ARTICLE
I think he means the problems the kids face in the show are realistic. Suicide/Bullying/Daddy problems/ ect
>> ARTICLE
I remember this stuff, was pretty fucked up, and tbh was surprised to see it in a show generally described as a comedy
>> ARTICLE
Slice of life* 
FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Wait what? You are calling GTO a Slice of life series? I have the entire manga and anime series here and I always laugh my ass off if i read or watch it. 

It has some harsh stuff, sure, but its no where near a slice of life series! The last arc (without spoiling it) has some fucked up shit, but everything is wrapped up in some good comedy making it easy to read. Cant wait for my kids to get reading it. GTO is one of my favourite manga.
>> ARTICLE
on MAL it's labeled as a slice of life o.o
>> ARTICLE
Well that was a good episode of that anime. I was bullied until my junior year of high school. all the bullies from the past had came into good terms with me over the past years. I think as the the episode perfectly states bulling is made when the aggressor demands power over a victim. The girls in that episode wanted power over the poor defenseless boy.

They stripped him to ridicule him emotionally. 


>> ARTICLE
When I first moved to a new junior high school in a different state there was this one kid who always harasses me verbally but i mostly just ignored him.  One day as we were waiting for our teacher to come in he decided to sweep everything on my desk onto the floor.  I picked up my pencil and attempted to stab him but he blocked it with his hand and he started bleeding really badly.  Afterwards no one in school dared to fuck with me again for the next 2 years until high school, but that's another story.

[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou). It's cute girls doing bizarre things.

Yuru Yuri, School Rumble, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.
>> ARTICLE
Watched Gekkan Shoujo, though I'm a bit curious about School Rumble.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man. I died watching both of those. School Rumble takes a few episodes, in my opinion, for the appeal to really hit, but afterwards you get this constant stream of just hysterical slice of life comedy.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Nee-San. The whole series is 28 mins long, you have probably watched most of it through .gifs on here. For a full length series try Sabagebu, D-Frag, or Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda Plot.

Ghost Stories

[Good Luck Girl!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13535/Binbougami_ga!)

You might like Arakawa Under the Bridge.  It's similar to Working in that all the comedy is from ridiculously eccentric personalities.  

School Rumble and Ouran High School Host Club are great also but have some slight romance elements. (Still mainly comedy for sure though--similar to Baka and Test in terms of amount of romance vs amount of comedy)

I would recommend you watching Yuru Yuri. Its basicly Cute girls doing normal aktivities but its so hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
Umm, no offense, but from the title, it kinda sounds like a yuri anime, and I'm not really into those, but I don't like judging something by its name, so could you elaborate a bit more?
>> ARTICLE
Well its hard to explain like the anime has a few yuri parts but there are more likely made to be foolish like funny daydreams etc. I really recommend checking it out. The best part about is you dont have to rush it at all, like 1-2episodes per day should be enough for a good laugh.
>> ARTICLE
1) Full metal panic fumoffu ( Recommend watching first season first)
2) School rumble ( pure comedy :3 )
3) Ouran Host club

Will name a few more when i remember :).

Watch Mushishi
>> ARTICLE
i tried watching the first episode a month ago. i really love the art style, its' originality and storyline. I understand why people like it. I just didn't continue watching the series because I thought it was a little boring. I almost fell asleep watching it. Sorry if you think otherwise but that's how i feel. 
>> ARTICLE
Under the assumption that if it *had* been watched, clearly it would have ranked. I like your style. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch Mahoraba. Then read it. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree.  And don't confuse it with Maburaho.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot the "repeat" part. That's the most important step.

I don't share your taste in certain things.  However, most of what is on that list is pretty popular so there isn't much to comment on.

A few missteps here and there (Death Note?) but for the most part all of these are good shows.

hey, i love death note as much as the next guy but after L died, I just didn't like it as much

Call out Death Note and turn a blind eye to High School of the Dead?

If you're talking to me, I hated High School of the Dead at first but at the end, I enjoyed watching it. For Death Note, I'm not calling it out. I don't see how people think I rated it that low.

It sucks ass. Nah, just kidding. You have some good ones on there, others I don't care for, and several I've never seen. Not sure what else to say.
>> ARTICLE
I like ur list, I would move some titles around but a solid list. I would add Yu Yu hakusho, Hajime no ippo and gundam on my list though
>> ARTICLE
Someone obviously haven't seen Kaiji.

Or Mushishi

Hajime no Ippo...Gintama...?


I still don't get the Ano Hana or Spice and Wolf hype though. Didn't like either of them.
>> ARTICLE
One day I'll watch Kaiji or Hajime no Ippo ^_^ In terms of Gintama, f@ck that because it has over 200 + episodes. I've watch some episodes though. I must say that I laugh my ass off watching them. It's just that I don't have the time to watch all of it. For Mushishi, I don't understand the hype for that. I tried watching the first episode but I thought it was a bit boring. I understand why people love that show though and I completely respect that.  I wanted to quit watching Ano Hana but the last episode was fucking memorable. For Spice and Wolf, I just love the chemistry between the two main characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess there must be a huge untapped market of people who are looking for romantic non-comedies. (What I thought Ano Hana looked like)

Spice and Wolf has a lot of fanservice hype, though, so that's easy to do. Also, apples, right? Bitches love apples.
>> ARTICLE
Summary:

I've seen bits of 5 of these shows.
Of those 5 shows:
I especially liked 0 of them.
I saw the pilot for 1 of them and thought it was going to be horrible, and never watched the rest.
The remaining 4 were okay, I guess, but I would not go out of my way to watch them.

The remaining 20, I have not seen.
Of the shows I have not seen, I have heard of 11.

Maybe you can extract some statistics.
>> ARTICLE
what are those five shows you're talking about.
>> ARTICLE
The ones that were on Adult Swim all the time, and Ano Hana*, which was the one that had a very discouraging pilot episode.

I haven't seen much of FMA: Brotherhood, the original didn't seem like my thing.

Edit: * I get Ano Hana and Aoi Hana and Bokurano mixed up a lot. I was thinking of the yuri one that's like, "Fumi-chan, you're always crying". In retrospect, it might have been a good show, but as a man I can't allow myself to feel emotions other than bloodlust while watching a show.

The show with the ghost girl was sort of interesting, and I watched a few episodes, but did not like where it was going.

I can't remember what the third one was. brb tvtropes
>> ARTICLE
Each to their own I suppose, can't say I've seen that much anime, of your list i've seen 24, 21 and 1 and I've read Death Note.

Personally I found Highschool of the Dead to be pretty poor all around, it tries to set a scary, serious tone and then ruins it with excessive fan service, annoying characters and a love story that seems a tad out of place. I guess I just prefer my zombie apocalypses Max Brooks/J.L Bourne style.

I'd also add K-ON!, Toradora, Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka, Darker than Black and Usagi Drop to the list but maybe that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
I watched K-ON. I love that show but it wasn't good enough in my opinion to be on the list. For Toradora, I didn't like it the first time I watched it because the ending was completely shitty to me but I decided to watch it again and I liked it but i didn't like it enough to be on that list. For Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka, I totally forgot about that show. Also, I totally forgot to put The World God Only Knows. That show and maybe Zombie Desu Ka would slip into that list. For Usagi Drop...never heard of it :P
>> ARTICLE
Love Baccano! so I'm very glad to see it high up there on your list. If you haven't seen the following, I highly recommend them: 
Avatar: The Last Airbender (tv show not movie, and don't let the "cartoon" mislead you, I swear they made it for adults),
Darker than Black, 
Fruits Basket (less action, more heartwarming drama, be warned),
 Noein, Ouran Host Club (SO. FUNNY.)
>> ARTICLE
Well, Avatar is one of my favorite cartoons of all time but I didn't put it on the list because it's not anime in my definition in which is Japanese animation. If I made a list in which anime is defined as any show that deals with animation, i would of added Tom And Jerry, Family Guy, South Park, Futurama and Avatar on this list. I've heard of Darker than Black but I've heard from my friends that it wasn't that good. For Fruits Basket, at first I liked it but over time, I just didn't think it was that good. For Ouran Host Club, I don't understand why people think it was funny. I watched the first 5 episodes and not once I laughed at it. I just don't understand the humor. For Noein...never heard of it :P
>> ARTICLE
your list is very lacking.
>> ARTICLE
can you explain to me why? 
>> ARTICLE
Dango.Dango. Dango. Dango. Dango Daikazo-WAIT! Clannad isn't number 1? Bullshit...
Kiddin, but I hate Full Metal Alchemist and Clannad is hands down my favorite, so slightly disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
After finishing it, I highly recommend you to watch **Golden Boy**.
Same kind of humor, a little more ecchi. Also hilarious.  
**GTO** really had it's moments. Specially on the first half.
>> ARTICLE
After you finish watching GTO, I highly suggest you make Golden Boy second priority and read  GTO: The Earlier Days and the sequel to GTO. 


>> ARTICLE
follow this list and you never regret :

http://myanimelist.net/animelist/ViSaoSang

GTO is hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I think we enjoy the same stuff, here's mine, I hope OP finds it helpful :)

http://myanimelist.net/animelist/k4ntratm

Edit : Actually I have a lot more [Romance/Shjo...](http://images.plus613.net/images/9/4/a/9/www_plus613_net_IRegretNothing.gif)

>> ARTICLE
Yeah it seems that we enjoy the same anime. I'm suprised you haven't seen Samurai Champloo though. May I ask why you gave Monster a 6? I heard that anime was a masterpiece. I was planning on watching it soon. 
>> ARTICLE


http://www.animenewsnetwork.com.au/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?top50=best_bayesian


monster has a good rate, i have watched at least 50 episodes but i decided to stop since i don't like it at. Reason : TOO MUCH irrelevant talking... made me fall asleep lol. That was the first time i have to skip an anime.


I dont watch anime much but when I want to watch it, i will select good quality (good rate) anime. If you want to watch something hilarious go for:  Historys Strongest Disciple Kenichi so FREAKING FUNNY ( high rating also).


p.s I forgot to add samurai champloo lol.
>> ARTICLE
I see so Monster wasn't enjoyable despite watching 50 episodes? Kenichi's already on my to watch list haha. 
>> ARTICLE
Well If you can enjoy the dialogue instead of waiting for the action yes monster is a masterpiece, It is one of the few shows I gave a ten. A solid murder mystery that is incredibly compelling, slow paced though. 

Edit: Just looked at your list, you gave the tatami galaxy a high mark, you are not afraid of dialogue so go for monster. And also look up the guys who made the tatami galaxy and look at their other works, each one has even more crazy animation and is awesome. 

Edit 2: Your plan to watch list is very comprehensive, if you want to mix it up with some sci-fi, ghost in the shell is the way to go. Then you are also missing Gainax shows. Gurren Lagann, FLCL and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
After you finish watching it, you might want to give the live action series a try. It stays quite close to the GTO spirit, and has a really awesome ending. In fact, the final episode was the most-watched television program ever in Japan (according to Wikipedia/Tokyopop).
>> ARTICLE
I always watch GTO In english... It is a so bad its good dub, considering about 4 people voice half the cast.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm watching it in dubbed right now just for the lulz. Steven Blum is my favorite voice actor and that's probably the only reason I'm watching it in dub but all the women in this anime are just so poorly voiced that sometimes it makes me want to be deaf.

[#8:](/s "Mushishi?")

[#11:](/s "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind")

[#22:](/s "Anohana?")

It's the first Guess the soundtrack I catch and not asleep/at work! Though I'll check these again tomorrow it seems, since I have to sleep soon.

Also, another  :

[16](/s "Oblivious is the track")  

>> ARTICLE
[#27](/s "Steins;Gate")
>> ARTICLE
[#5](/s "Great Teacher Onizuka")

Edit: Well I found only #5, #11 and #28 (I used that track in the last game) since they are the only shows I watched in this selection according to the answers. Nice tracks though! Also summoning /u/Cryzzalis.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I'll be giving this a shot soon.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I actually made the video without looking what tracks were used in the previous games... which was probably a silly thing to do. That's the reason why there's a track in this one that was also in the last one anyway.
>> ARTICLE
[#6](/s "Yosuga no Sora")

I'm aware some of these have been guessed but I like trying them myself.

[#1](/s "I recognize this so much but I can't put my finger on it so random guess, Shuffle!")

>> ARTICLE
Oh snap. For once, not all of them have been guessed by the time I see the thread.

...Now if only I could recognize the unguessed pieces. #9 does seem vaguely familiar. Though judging from the fact that I haven't seen most of the series that the already-guessed songs are from, I'm probably off on that, too. I don't think I've seen any of the other unguessed ones (1, 2, 7, 8, 17, 18, and 29), though I will feel foolish if it turns out I have seen them but just forgot.

I do like the background image from Tatami Galaxy. I recognized that immediately. (...None of the songs are from it, though, right?)

There's no tracks from the Tatami Galaxy, I just thought it made a nice background.

That it does. :)

Surprised nobody linked Attack on Titan's OP1: [Guren no Yumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMXgHfHxKVM) yet. Considering it [literally goes with everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1cwq91/shingeki_no_kyojin_opening_goes_with_everything) and has been [pariodied into the ground.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoParody) Until things got [way too meta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUySqz10MQQ).

Have some of Soul Eater's first OP, [Resonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9RzFsWttY), for some cool action and a catchy beat with a hint of creepy visuals.

> Avatar the Last Airbender, #13

I am personally happy with this, fantastic series, would have it #1 on mine if it was an anime/on MAL.

If I counted correct, I have 50/100 either completed, watching at the moment, or on hold. 
>> ARTICLE
It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).
>> ARTICLE
Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default
>> ARTICLE
>If it's animated then it's anime by default

Yes, but anime is the japanese word we use to describe japanese animation only. Its not about cartoon vs anime, its about making clear what is what.

Personally I like IMDB lists that combine animation across mediums for this reason--get to compare great shows across cultures.

> 20\. Gate* (+276)

Holy cow Gate

That looks like a grand case of hype-train and airing bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.
>> ARTICLE
It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed
>> ARTICLE
lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.
>> ARTICLE
You must be thinking about another site, I don't think Hummingbird has x/100
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I'm more happy with Bebop in the top 10 or salty AF that OPM is above Hunter x Hunter...so conflicted.

[](#WRYYY)
>> ARTICLE
It's only natural for the greatest anime of all time to be above a generic battle shounen [](#smuglancer)
>> ARTICLE
But Steins;Gate is always above Hunter x Hunter

[](#trollarcher)
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako, not on the list, for shame Hummingbird.
>> ARTICLE
How did Gate and Assassination Classroom jump so much?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's new season bias personally.
>> ARTICLE
The following were anime on the myanimelist top 100 that were not on the hummingbird top 100:

Katkyo Hitman Reborn! (rank 100 on MAL)

Honey and Clover (rank 99 on MAL)

Detective Conan (rank 98 on MAL)

Ashita no Joe (rank 97 on MAL)

One Outs (rank 96 on MAL)

Kyoukai no Kanata (rank 94 on MAL)

The Tale of Princess Kaguya (rank 93 on MAL)

Rose of Versailles (rank 92 on MAL)

Beck (rank 90 on MAL)

Sakurasou (rank 89 on MAL)

Ouran High School Host Club (rank 88 on MAL)

Higurashi (rank 84 on MAL)

Angel Beats (rank 83 on MAL)

Tsubasa (rank 82 on MAL)

Kemono no Souja Erin (rank 77 on MAL)

Shirobako (rank 73 on MAL)

Romeo no Aoi Sora (rank 68 on MAL)

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

Kingdom (rank 46 on MAL)

Rainbow (rank 34 on MAL)

Personally, I agree more with the MAL top 100.

_______

How many have you seen out of the hummingbird list?

I have 50/100. Exactly half.
>> ARTICLE
68 seen or attempted, compared to 53 from the corresponding condensed MAL Top 100. Maybe I should switch over.
>> ARTICLE
only 13/100
>> ARTICLE
38/100
>> ARTICLE
Next we'll get to see an adjusted score combining the MAL and Hummingbird to see where a lot of shows even out.

Seems like Fate/Zero jumped the most & Gintama (instead of multiple shows) went lower.
>> ARTICLE
Why does Hummingbird, an anime website, have series that aren't anime?
>> ARTICLE
Why does MAL, an anime website, have [series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29876/Chu_Feng__BEE) [that](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16756/Kuiba__Zhi_Shiwanhuoji) [aren't](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4801/Suhoyojeong_Michel) [anime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/548/Wonderful_Days)?

>Avatar not an anime

But...but :(
>> ARTICLE
I don't care about the random shows that don't belong, but Magi at #71 is just insulting. No way is that show any good at all. What kind of person actually gives that trash a good rating
>> ARTICLE
I liked magi... :(
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.
