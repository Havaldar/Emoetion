A really good series. Really couldn't stop watching it, made me very sad when I no longer had anymore episodes to watch... 
>> ARTICLE
That's why I've spread each season out so far.  The thought of no more Natsume overrides the need to keep watching, at least for me.
>> ARTICLE
I can't do that :( I'm obsessive. 
>> ARTICLE
You should pick up the manga! 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, I was planning on writing a WT for Natsume.  
>> ARTICLE
I think this is the second one. You can always write a third :P

Here's a [link to the first one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vayoz/wt_natsume_yuujinchou_an_amazingly_sweet_and/)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think WT have to be one-and-done though, really. Obviously a flood of them for one show is bad but having two or three to a show, especially one like Natsume, is not a bad thing.
>> ARTICLE
You should write one too! Seriously, more publicity would be amazing. I would love Natsume's face all over this subreddit. 
>> ARTICLE
This anime. This. So much. I remember watching the first season every week for a new episode. Then I didnt follow season 2 and 3. Especially season 3. Every episode was a punch in the feels. The more you watch the more Natsume has a grip on you. Till the end of s3 it still seems that we have much more to know about him.  

Especially the episode of the forgotten god where he diminishes in size over time. It just... Gets to me you know?   

It is also one of the animes that I dont skip the OP and ED. The other animes I listen the OP/ED to are Sakamichi no Apollon, and Cowboy Bebop.

>> ARTICLE
When I first saw this show recommended and someone said it was like Mushishi, I gave it a shot. The first two episodes didn't kill me, I believe it was on the third episode (might be another episode) but yea the forgotten god episode, was in which I finally said wow this is good. That episode was just so damn well written and made. I've put the show currently on hold due to having a bunch of shows that i'm currently watching and haven't finished Mushishi (1 slow relaxing show at a time is perfectly enough). But definitely going to watch it! 

P.S: Already bought the figure based on that one episode and an impulsive moment haha.
>> ARTICLE
Haha! Great to know! What figure did you buy?

>> ARTICLE
Twas this one: http://myfigurecollection.net/item/198656


>> ARTICLE
Fuck, this is the first time I'm genuinely interested in a figurine. Shit.. How much did this cost you?
>> ARTICLE
Around 80 something ish with shipping, I think now its sold out in major stores so price went up a bit, but wait it out a little (follow the comments on it/ebay) etc... you'll probably find a used one for less than what i payed and still in really good condition! I haven't removed him from his box yet since I'm not sure how much I enjoy this show yet + don't have the room atm. so I can't tell u how nice he is etc... plus I don't want to get you into such an expensive hobby xD. But in all honesty i love collecting figures brings characters alive for me... and supports the industry! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's kinda pricey.. but man my heart fluttered when I saw natsume and madara! Ah..
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, I love figures but damn the nice ones are always pricey sigh... guess the broke life is the life for me.
>> ARTICLE
> It just... Gets to me you know?

Exactly this. The whole series.
>> ARTICLE
Especially the ending song. It makes every episode seem like there's an intangible longing for something. I can't put my finger on it, but the whole show dances with the spectrum of the human emotion. 
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujichou - For those who found Mushishi too serious and Monogatari too harem/ecchi

Still a really good show, definitely worth watching for fans of SoLs


>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite series.  There is actually a WT! for it already if you check out the way back machine (aka search bar) but yours is better, anyway.I think the general feeling of the series that you're referring to could best be described as "bittersweet."  Often, over the course of an episode, Natsume is forced to revisit sad memories from his past in the process of helping his friends, both human and youkai.  His struggle to let people in without pushing them away, or to protect them by not letting them close is handled very succinctly, and feels true-to-life, despite his fantastic situation.With regard to your "bad stuff," I think *Natsume,* despite being episodic, does an admirable job of mixing up its formula.  There's no set pattern on which the series relies too heavily, which keeps each episode feeling like a fresh experience.Favorite episode: *Natsume Yuujinchou San* Episode 4, "Young Days"
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei is best Tsundere. 

In all seriousness, the first episodes bored me to death since I was a bit underwhelmed. As I got used to it, however, I was able to fully appreciate how simple and beautiful Natsume Yuujinchou was. 

It's one of those anime that is almost like a comfort zone. Nothing mindblowing, nothing superincredible, nothing crazy. But when it's over, you feel much better for it. 

They almost feel like shows I would see on PBS way back in the day, personally..
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei is awesome.  I have a large Nyanko plushie :D
>> ARTICLE
Sounds awesome! I'd like a beanbag-chair sized Nyanko if possible
>> ARTICLE
Nyanko-sensei totally is. And yeah it definitely sneaks up on you. You relax and enjoy all these characters and their stories and all of a sudden its over. It was then for me that I realized just how much I'd fallen in love with all the characters.
>> ARTICLE
The show is available on crunchyroll, and because I agree with OP that you should go watch it here are some guest passes.

Everyone should try Natsume Yuujinchou, it's really good.

As far as you not noticing my WT! - I don't mind, yours is more indepth and better written anyway.
>> ARTICLE
If there are people who have dropped along the way, be warned: the series does get better with each season. At least that's what I think (and most people who've watched it think). 
Then again, if you didn't like it enough in the first season, I doubt you'd like it in the second season onwards because the thematic approach is pretty much the same. 
>> ARTICLE
Am watching the fourth season right now and am already devasted to know that I've only got 6 more episodes to go. I would put Natsume Yuujinchou a bit below Mushishi and Kino no Tabi since fans of one of those series almost always enjoy the other two, but I still like it a lot and can't get enough of it. The entire cast is likeable - of course Takashi and especially Madara take the cake, but I can't say I dislike any other character in here - or episode, for that matter. Can only highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
The last episode of S4 is just absolutely heartbreaking.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished episode 8 of S4. Episode 4 of Shi's my favorite so far (the one with the Youkai that could imitate voices), but I'm excited to see what it still has in store for me.
>> ARTICLE
When I was reading the manga (before S3 or 4 aired) I specifically remember thinking that the chapter that episode is based on would be a great way to end the series. And then they did it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes! This anime is great, I almost finished It I just can't bear to watch the last episode, because it will be over :'(
>> ARTICLE
> In much the same manner as Mushishi I think it's basically impossible to binge watch

People always say this. Don't get it 'cause it certainly isn't impossible. I *always* binge watch both Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi!
>> ARTICLE
Haha then you're definitely a different kind person than I am, which is pretty cool. In the future this just means I'll have to be careful not to make such blanket statements.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a very "gotta do everything in one go" type of person. I even do the same thing with incredibly long series (like One Piece) and video games.
>> ARTICLE
I binge watched Mushishi too. Re Natsume, its on hold for me. Mostly because Madara is just silly.
>> ARTICLE
I watched this on your recommendation! Wow.. it's so good. I didn't get into Mushishi so this was a surprise for me. Natsume Yuujinchou was more likable because it has a bit more comedy thanks to Madara.

Hotarubi no mori e (by the same mangaka) is also just as beautiful. Thank you x
>> ARTICLE
That's awesome! Im glad you enjoyed it. Its my favorite for a reason :D

I was considering putting this on my PtW but the shoujo put me off a bit. I did now and will probably watch it before the spring season starts.

Off topic, we have a ridiculously high compatibility rate:

> I was considering putting this on my PtW but the shoujo put me off a bit. Aside from most of the male characters being semi-bishounen, it really doesn't adhere to any of the usual tropes found in the shoujo demographic.  The source material is published in a magazine targeted at girls.  That's why it gets the tag.
>> ARTICLE
> but Ive never seen one on Natsume Yuujinchou.

Ehh, before making statements, please, [use search bar](http://redd.it/2vayoz).
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't seen that, but neither did I look, dang. I'll link to it in the post above.
>> ARTICLE
That would be great, thanks. 

Dear writers, please, check up if there already was a [WT!] thread for the anime you're going to write about. Several [WT!] threads for one anime do speak for the anime's popularity, but I'm not sure if writing about the same thing is a great idea anyway.

Disregarding that, I liked your post very much, good work and crisp writing, see you in a compilation [WT!] thread.
>> ARTICLE
Is is a full story? Does it have a resolution?
>> ARTICLE
It does as far as the tv series is concerned I think (I haven't read the manga), and its absolutely worth watching. I believe there is an ova that came out following the final season but I haven't watched that and so I can't comment on it but the series itself does have a resolution as far as I'm concerned.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks! I've been meaning to get on this for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Yuujinchou's story isn't really what progresses more than what grows. It's not something that is extremely obvious but it's not very subtle either.  
  
Natsume's story progresses in a way that 'flows', instead of "we achieved X in ep Y, now the story goes Z" you get a story progression along that is less appearant.  
  
It's difficult to explain, but the story is essentially a story of growth.
>> ARTICLE
Feel like I should add my two cents. IIRC the ending of the anime is certainly satisfying, but it is not the complete story. The manga is still ongoing and as such the anime doesn't reach what I imagine would be considered the logical ending point of the story. However, considering the type of story Natsume is, that shouldn't feel uber important anyway.
>> ARTICLE
The OVA episode is quite good, but it's basically an extra episode of the anime.  It could have aired in the middle of *Shi* without seeming out of place.  Same goes for the Nyanko-Sensei special, though that one was a bit more comedy-focused.  They're simply "more of the same," which in this case, isn't a bad thing at all.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I've watched the first three seasons already and what bothers me is that the MC keeps saying how weak he is and how he needs to protect people, but never does anything about it. I keep hoping that he improves himself by learning the arts of dealing with the creatures. I guess the main part of the series is the character development of him learning to trust people and whatnot due to his childhood, which is good, but still... Maybe I'm just too used to shows targeted for males.
>> ARTICLE
The way he "protects people" is by keeping them at arm's length.  That way they aren't (at best) forced to believe something they can't see, or (at worst) dragged into the world of youkai - either physically or through worry for Natsume.  It's the slow lessening of the emotional distance Natsume has with those around him that is the ongoing focus of the series.  He starts to allow others to get close to him, which was impossible for him in the past.  It's a subtle growth, unlike the typical battle-shounen MC, and *Natsume Yuujinchou* (especially in later seasons) portrays it very well.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... well its certainly different than what I experienced. [Spoiler maybe...](/s "The romance thing is something I go back and forth about. I don't think it would've been a bad addition to the show but neither do I think it's necessary. I don't think it would've really furthered their point by including romance, but I certainly see the angle.") I don't know if thats a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I am a guy and I can relate to Natsume Takashi. Not every guy is interested in having a romantic relationship with every girl he meets. 
>> ARTICLE
Especially someone with Natsume's trust problems. He's just getting used to having friends I think romance is a little far off for him.
>> ARTICLE
Erm... I'm a guy and I found him extremely relatable. So I suppose you can think whatever you want about me based on that haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean sure he is somewhat feminine but he is still a properly written male.
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree.  First off, not everyone subscribes to an "alpha male" ideal.  I certainly don't.  Natsume is a unique character, neither dense nor aggressive.  He just has other priorities.  Keep in mind that Natsume didn't have a "normal" upbringing or form any lasting friendships / attachments until high school.  Now rethink if he behaves normally.And one of Natsume's normal friends does, in fact, show interest in female characters.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

I love how the the top ten illustrates everything you need to know about anime. There's a semi-educational Engrish sketch show, a show about two rabbits in a Soviet prison, an epic space opera, a show about giant robots that fucks with your head, a show about magical school girls that fucks with your head, and a high school romcom featuring ghosts, gods, titties and wordplay. 

Anime gives you everything you need to laugh, to cry and to curl up in a little ball and wonder just what it is we're all doing here in the first place.

I think you might enjoy it if you took the time to get in to it.
>> ARTICLE
I watched a couple of the first episodes, really wasn't my thing :3
>> ARTICLE
I was the same at first, I could'nt get in to it. 
It really took off for me in the second or third season.
But okay, I appreciate you replying though. :)
Not going to try and force you to watch it, as much as I'd love to. :P
>> ARTICLE
People trying to force me to watch a show on my blog this morning really annoyed me. Yes, you like it, no, I said I am not giving it another chance not because I think it sucks, but because I'm busy, and it's not as good as the stuff I'm keeping >.>

Sheesh!

;-)
>> ARTICLE
I hope I did'nt give off a similar vibe, haha.

I hate to be the pushy fan.
>> ARTICLE
Most people wouldn't watch the second season if they couldn't even get into the first one. What made you watch the second season?
>> ARTICLE
I guess I phrased it poorly, I mean it was slow going.

And I was sorta pushed in to it by a friend of mine long a go.

It was'nt until recently after becoming a huge fan of Achievement Hunter and the like that I thought I'd give it another go, and I adored it.

Also listening to the Rooster Teeth podcast a lot I got to really know the different members sense of humour.

A taste of things to come so to speak. 

My apologies for any confusion, I doubt it's not something other people have'nt done and thought before though for other shows.

Out of curiosity did you ever experience anything like that?
For shows that you enjoyed I mean.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that different really, but the fact that it's the highest selling anime is what makes you go "wtf?"

I've honestly just been hitting these posts purely for the sake of watching GaruPan slowly but surely grind down SAO. It has been a satisfying experience

Yes, pencil lead is the best armor! :P

Kidding, of course. They could be talking about any number of carbon-based materials. Mmm, graphene...

Actually, a thin coating of graphite is one proposed solution for pusher plate ablation in Orion spacecraft (that is, spacecraft propelled by tossing nukes under an armor plate mounted to the ship with shock abosrbers) so it's not *totally* bullshit. Wouldn't do much for a hunk of steel flying along at a a few hundred meters per second though...
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for my stupidity, but I'm not sure I fully understand this list. Could someone help me understand this? For example, is this list of lifetime sales of these titles, and do sales reflect what was sold internationally... or what was sold domestically in Japan? Also, what is the source of this information? Lastly, how do I read this list using the information at the top of the page? (Considering there are no ranking...Speaking of which, how do I tell those rankings? >.>)

Appreciate the help in advance. Again, sorry if I'm just being stupid, but I'm just interested in this information is all. I want to try to understand it the best I can.
>> ARTICLE
Average BD/DVD per volume sold domestically in Japan, which is where everything matters. Also it's based on Oricon data which isn't 100% accurate, and then it's based on the volume releases which means it doesn't account for boxset releases afterwards. But it's fair to say that every title on the list can be considered a massive success to some degree.
>> ARTICLE
List doesn't factor in merchandise, which imo is a metric we should def look at as well.

Like the gundam series. They prob make more money in merchandises than from the anime
>> ARTICLE
We look at disk sales because it's the only dataset readily available to the public.  What you want simply isn't available outside of the [odd press releases](http://wiki.fdiary.net/animesales/?%BB%D4%BE%EC%B5%AC%CC%CF%A1%A6%C1%ED%C7%E4%BE%E5) and unreliable estimates by [CharaBizData](https://www.charabiz.com/) (research group). 
>> ARTICLE
I know. I'm simply just stating there are far more factors into a series success outside of disk sales.

Precure probably doesn't sold that many disks relative to its time slot, but massively makes up for them through merchandise that not many other series could achieve.
>> ARTICLE
So... Evangelion should be in the first 3 places. If it exist there is an evagelion merchan edition of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Eva's merchandising dollars pale in comparison to the likes of Pokemon, One Piece, or even Pretty Cure ([source](http://wiki.fdiary.net/animesales/?%BB%D4%BE%EC%B5%AC%CC%CF%A1%A6%C1%ED%C7%E4%BE%E5)).

Aren't some of the gundam series stand alone kind of series?

Yeah, if you're going to combine Gundam series at least stick to just the UC stuff.
>> ARTICLE
-2 points for you,  SIEG ZEON WINS
>> ARTICLE
Zeon is *from* the UC continuity.

We just need like 10 more seasons of monogatari, then we can truly compare the sales differences.
>> ARTICLE
So how is Girls and Panzer? I've heard about it a few times but to be honest I didn't think it sounded very interesting. Anyone here that has seen it that can tell me his opinion on it?
>> ARTICLE
The first episode does a great job world building. The characters are tropish, but cute.

If not seeing much practice in K-On, an anime about music that doesn't involve playing much music, bothered you- be prepared to be irked that they take the easy way out, and never show them learning or getting better.

There is next to zero character development, which is unforunate. They could have really slowed down the pace of the show to make it more interesting from the main character's perspective. 

The show starts with a massive amount of annoying exposition. This could lead you to turn off the show.

The battle scenes are quite good both in design and execution. 

Definitely a short turn-your-brain-off and have fun anime. Maybe just put it on a backlist, for when you're bored?
>> ARTICLE
No, don't listen to this guy.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for having an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's an earnest underdog sports story of cute girls driving/commanding historical tanks in an inter-school tournament. It has an absurd setting but plays it totally straight, tankery really is a popular all-girls sport and you just have to accept that. The rest of the show is either friends hanging out together, planning for tank battles, or the genuinely exciting tank battles themselves. If you're into World of Tanks or historical tanks, it's an absolute must, but even if you're not (like me) it's still absolutely endearing.

Oh, and it doesn't have pandering fanservice, which is a pleasant change. Yes, the character designs are quite "mo", but you won't catch a single glimpse up any skirts nor any breast-size jokes. About the only scenes a westerner would consider questionable involve communal bathing, and there's like... two of such scenes in the entire show, which are both literally and metaphorically clean unless you find bare shoulders and backs *too lewd*.

Honestly, give the first two episodes a spin and see what you think.
>> ARTICLE
i do think you see miho's butt in one of the bathing scenes but taken in context it's definitely not pandering.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds alright, guess I'll give it a try soon.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and it has some amazing "camera" work throughout.
>> ARTICLE
it's fucking great.  it takes the utterly ridiculous premise of "tankwando" as a feminine art and runs all the way to the finish line with it.  the main character is a "thinker" - she bucks tradition and comes up with her own way of doing things (like lelouch or light) in order to succeed.  on top of that, there are **32** characters in the main cast and every one of them is uinique.

it's 12 episodes and 2 recap episodes (5.5 you can skip, 10.5 you should watch), and every time the girls have a tank fight, there's a good reason to get invested.  there are some side stories but they aren't made the focus; rather they're used to bring the characters themselves into focus.  it's really a mastefully done, triumphant, jubilant and heartwarming series.  and it's short enough to marathon in a day if you really can't pace yourself (like me).  go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
>tankwando

Tank-fu, Tankery, and ***[PANZERFAHREN](http://commiesubs.com/your-face-when-we-won-da-panzer-vor/)*** are acceptable substitutes. Tankery is my go-to one for talking about the show, but when it comes to actually watching Madchen und Panzer, only glorious Commie subs are accepted.
>> ARTICLE
i got tankwando from the deadfish sub of OVA 2...  i watched the show with horriblesubs.  aren't horriblesubs/commie both just ripped crunchyroll?
>> ARTICLE
Horrible's crunchy. Commie does half crunchy half other stuff - and in the case of Girls und Panzer, they put their own fantastic spin on it. To not ruin the surprise for anyone else: [Commie GuP](/s "is unique because it uses gratuitous German to replace common phrases - 'Arigatou' (thank you) is subbed as 'Danke', 'Hai!' (yes) with 'Ja!' or 'Jawohl' etc. - it forces a strange trilingualism, the ability to hear Japanese, read German, and understand in English. Since it's pretty much only used for set phrases anyone who's been watching anime for a year or more could recognize, and the German translations should be similarly familiar to anyone with even a cursory knowledge, it's not inconvenient, and often humorous.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh that is xlnt. If my data cap were more forgiving, I would definitely re download for that. 
>> ARTICLE
>there are 32 characters in the main cast

That worries me a bit, doesn't a lot of characters mean that each individual character loses a lot of depth?

Apart from that the show definitely sounds interesting, I'll be sure to give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Some of the tank crews get grouped to the point that you could class them as "one character". This includes the First Years and the Disciplinary Committee - if you watch closely you'll notice they each have their unique points, but in terms of narrative, they're basically 'herded' together and work together to have an individual's worth of impact. It's appropriate, given the collaborative nature of operating a tank.
>> ARTICLE
you'll actually be very surprised.  

actually, i don't think the words are good enough to describe the cast heirarchy.  there's one girl who is obviously the "main character", and there are the girls in her tank who all get backstoried, and then there are the rest of the girls on the tankery team who are all unique and well-characterized but don't get much time spent on their backstories.  they're all "main cast".  

then there's the MC's tank team's families, and the team's opponents, who i would say make up the supporting cast.
>> ARTICLE
Its more of a sports anime to be quite honest. There is your typical underdog team and other sports tropes. Except the sport in this anime is tank paintball. And the tanks are so very detailed and lots of historical Easter eggs thrown in.

Now go watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a moe slice of life series pretending to be a sports anime, the whole Sensha-do is too ridiculous and the girls don't take it seriously enough for it to be considered a sport. It's cute but also pretty silly, and also hidden right wing propaganda that more people should be disgusted about.  
>> ARTICLE
the only right wing part about the show I find meh is in the OVAs and that's because of the use of the rising sun flag (which admittedly it's not just in anime Japan has a poor record of). 

So what on earth are you on about?  
>> ARTICLE
Also in the OVAs, they gloat about how Japan has the best tanks in the world.
>> ARTICLE
That too. 

Imma hazard a guess and maybe the person is talking about how there was that JSDF video narrated by Yukari. I honestly cannot think of anything else 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I think so, mentioned how the Type 89 has some revolutionary design feature. 
>> ARTICLE
>Hidden right wing propaganda....

Lol wut...

They at most reference the actions of Meiji/Taisho era Japan (the whole Yuki no Shingun part is the only thing I can think up) who's hands may not be completely clean, but are saints compared to what actually happened during the war. 

Not to mention prior to the 2nd World War, the IJA and IJN were rather civilized (given proper incentive of course, i.e. sucking up to the Western powers).
>> ARTICLE
> hidden right wing propaganda that more people should be disgusted about. 

what on earth are you on about
>> ARTICLE
>the sport in this anime is tank paintball

With live tank shells instead of paintballs.
>> ARTICLE
Was trying to think of a way to describe less-lethal mock combat....maybe MILES should've been a better way to describe it?
>> ARTICLE
Yell yeah, Evangelion and Monogatari!  So SAO lost by 120? I don't know if that is major. Guess I'll go finish GuP.
>> ARTICLE
Golden Eggs still number one. I don't think anything will ever touch those numbers. Absolutely hilarious series.
>> ARTICLE
I would buy Girls under Panzer to add to my collection, but I'd have to get it through Sentai and they removed the Pravda song since they couldn't get the copyright. Honestly that's what initially got me to watch that show in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that the dub is [really, really bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izf5HxGRdEA)
>> ARTICLE
Even though it's licensed by them, they sell it hybrid so it'll have the subs anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Commenting to find later. Thanks btw
>> ARTICLE
Lol just buy it. Support the industry 'n' such. Or import the original.
>> ARTICLE
GuP is probably one of the only series I would considering importing other than an immaculate adaptation of the Muv Luv Trilogy. 
>> ARTICLE
That's something done on the Japanese side as evidenced by the difference in animation timing/editing. It's likely something done for the international masters, which is something we can't blame Sentai on (for once).
>> ARTICLE
I know it's not Sentai's fault. They couldn't get the copyright so there is nothing they can do about it. It's a shame, though, since that insert song is pretty awesome.
>> ARTICLE
You mean Katioucha/Katyusha?
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Kinda made Pravda my favourite school outside of Ooarai. Russian singing sounds really cool in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
That was the moment I thought that these were Russians. Up till then it felt like an act to me.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh

What are The World of Golden Eggs and Usavich? Never heard of them.
>> ARTICLE
Heres to Stardust Crusaders trying to bust the top 10.

What does the 'out' for SNAFU mean?
>> ARTICLE
The average sales of it just dropped a little so it fell off the list. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright! Good job GuP!
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YEAH GOLDEN EGGS!




>> ARTICLE
the list looks nothing like the mal top 10.  


>> ARTICLE
So anime is saved?

Usavitch sure was entertaining. No sarcasm.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad sells better then the After Story.. Completely reasonable! It takes a different kind of human to be able to look at that when you want to re-watch an anime.. 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently the World of Golden Eggs is an american style cartoon, with 15-minute episodes. It's a children's anime and also is priced more normally (only $55 per season, instead of $300) - maybe that's why it has so many sales. 
[Amazon JP link](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B9-World-GOLDEN-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B31-DVD%E3%83%9C%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/dp/B0019JJ4NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390438781&sr=8-1&keywords=The+World+of+GOLDEN+EGGS)

Turns out maybe Japanese people don't like paying hundreds of dollars for anime DVDs either!
>> ARTICLE
I never realized that Honey and Clover, Mushishi, and Mononoke sold that well. Makes me kind of happy.

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It ended up being better than it seemed like it should have been from its premise. It's worth a watch for sure, IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of its success is because its timing of Kantai Collection explosive popularity. 

Only seen two episodes and I'm liking so far, though the heavy usage of CG on the characters is a little jarring but I'll get used to it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad a CG heavy show got such good sales. Hopefully it'll lead to more CG shows, leading to an improvement in CG animation. Driving down production costs, meaning more seasons of things and potentially cheaper BD/DVDs.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. I was certain it would suck, but it was actually great. Roll on season two.
>> ARTICLE
The episode with the youkai that wants to see the sea was the most beautiful thing in the world, it made me feel so warm. Hella onions.

I enjoyed relationship between Nyanko-sensei and Natsume the best. I love how they quarrel about things and how Natsume always bribes him with food ;P
>> ARTICLE
>*hella onions*

upvote
>> ARTICLE
Third season is currently airing.

Try Aria or Kino's Journey.
>> ARTICLE
Nodame Cantabile is the only thing i can think of that is close to natsume , also lovely complex 
>> ARTICLE
So i just finished nodame and i must agree with this wholeheartedly.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of iyashikei, or "healing anime." Aria is considered one of the best.
>> ARTICLE
I heard very good things about Aria, but after starting first episode of Aria the Animation, I dropped it because in all honesty it was bad.

Looking at ratings, I assume next ones are way better, but I'm still not sure if it's good enough for me as I usually greatly dislike slice of life anime.

Would you recommend me to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same! It will probably get better...otherwise how else is it getting all the rave? Except I watched the first one and I certainly did not feel the plethora of emotions Natsume made me feel.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Usagi Drop for a similar tone, but it has no paranormal elements, just a slice-of-life drama.
>> ARTICLE
I have it on my watch-when-finished list.
>> ARTICLE
There's always Natsume Yuujinchou San.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes. I intend to watch it once it's complete.

Edit: Huh? Downvote? Really?
>> ARTICLE
Natsume S3.

Hotarubi no Mori e is something else you might like.  It will be in theater in Japan on Sep. 17.  It is based on a manga by the same mangaka as Natsume.

Here is the trailer.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5UMJVsw6js
>> ARTICLE
Mononoke is NOT like Natsume, but it's also about youkai and such. It's horror/mystery, I'd say...
>> ARTICLE
My vote goes to Aria; it doesn't have supernatural elements like Mushishi or Natsume, but as far as heartwarming series go, Aria is probably among the top of them. 
>> ARTICLE
Good feelings anime that I suggest:

Maria-sama ga Miteru

Skip!Beat

Special A

Tom and Jerry fucking rules. Was my favorite cartoon when I was little. Made me smile to see it up there.

The links are for me to keep track of some random things I feel like I could easily mix up. Also, some of the ranks seem to have changed slightly, so OP's list and mine won't match up on some places.

>> ARTICLE
Censorship probably have no effect, sample size definitely had an effect.

thanks for going through MAL

Nvm, going back and forth up and down I mixed up the GiTS you had.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...
>> ARTICLE
The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

> MAL: Rank 764.

China > West. 

Also the fact that all the GitS being rated so much higher says quality tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can get behind this list a little more (one piece is higher :D) 
>> ARTICLE
> 86 WALL-E

wat
>> ARTICLE
It's an animated movie, and a damn good one at that
>> ARTICLE
Yet again, Gintama within the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is fucking huge in China (pun intended)
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised Hikaru no Go is there, no one talks about it
>> ARTICLE
This is the first ranking Ive seen which puts Steins;Gate and FMAB that low. 
>> ARTICLE
This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

[](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.
>> ARTICLE
Fumoffu at75, everything is right with this list

I don't see Trigun on here, but other than that all my favorites made it.

Oooh, this promises to be an interesting bracket now - Cruel Angel's Thesis is the only thing I can think of on this bracket thus far that even comes close to Gotta Catch 'Em All in terms of how iconic to anime it is.

Log Horizon's opening is one of the few I sit through every time. I always loved how the OP essentially drowns you in characters. The second season's OP is the same, only with even more of them.

Parasyte's (Kiseijuu) opening is also pretty damn good.

yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUihzNN0ees

And here I was, thinking how ugly and bad Sparrow's Hotel is, and you've found me something considerably worse.

Its price is quite cheap compare to a normal late-night anime (~17 USD per 80 minutes). Guess it's one of the mainstream stuff.

*This* is the best selling anime!? What the hell. . .?

Not sure I'd really classify it as anime.  It was a weird cel-shaded (or something) comedy comprised of random skits - the closest comparison I can make is maybe something like Robot Chicken.  I didn't realize it was *that* popular, but I do remember a lot of my friends enjoying it.

Pre-2000 rankings

http://i.imgur.com/2C8dcWw.png

Note: NOT average sales. Box-sets / re-releases included. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
All those poor people getting shipped empty boxes...
>> ARTICLE
I was very confused about this list until I reread what this list actually is. These aren't the all-time best selling TV anime sales, these are the all-time best selling TV anime **average** sales.

So, although older anime series like Evangelion might have had the highest total number of sales, those sales *per month* (or whatever time period this chart averages) have tapered off over time, causing it to fall off the chart. So, this chart will tend to show higher rankings for newer series.
>> ARTICLE
No, that's wrong. Those sales number are total average tracked by [Oricon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon) from the day the BD/DVD is released up until now, it usually stays the chart for only 2 or 3 weeks since most of the sales come from the first week so there're no such thing as 'per month' sales. And Oricon is established in 1999 so this list is only limited to post-2000 anime (that's why there're no Evangelion)

There's a list for pre-2000 (Anko-chan posted it), but i'm not so sure about its accurateness.

>> ARTICLE
Seems a mistake in titel: To aru Kagaku no Index.

It's either 'To aru Kagaku no Railgun' or 'To aru Majutsu no Index'
>> ARTICLE
I noticed this as well. Pretty sure Index does not classify as "scientific". It make me chuckle. Usually I see the opposite and people write "To aru Majutsu no Railgun".
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing something? Shouldn't Evangelion be on top? Or at least on the list?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty niche anime, to be frank, and not everyone that watched it understood it or liked it. That's not to say it wasn't well done, though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the movies would sell well, because of all the ads and publicity stunts we see in convenience stores and whatnot.  Maybe US anime fans have an unrealistic perspective when it comes to seeing Japanese promos for Evangelion movies.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion, as I understand it, was a pretty big success. Not the biggest, but it had good reviews. But it just wasn't accessible to the mainstream. It is, after all, a mech series at it's core, and very into sci-fi beyond that. Throw in some daddy problems and a dash of odeipus (sp?), and you have a series that a select few will love, but most will not understand. They'll just see giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
>Not the biggest

Except that it has the highest BD/DVD sales out of any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Then why isn't it on the list? It does say "all-time."
>> ARTICLE
It's been said in the thread multiple times already. The people collecting the data starting in 1999 so all of the anime are from 2000+. EVA is from 1995. EVA has sold 170K+ copies, more than Bakemonogatari, which is at the top of the list.
>> ARTICLE
> The people collecting the data starting in 1999

I didn't see that, sorry for the confusion.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to watch it again, since I enjoyed it but alot went over my head as I've found out recently.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it once with a friend, didn't like it. Watched it again, and still didn't like it, but I saw that it was more than I'd given it credit for. So good move.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched it, tried watching it again, realised that there really was that much stuff left unexplained and left disliking it even more.
>> ARTICLE
This list only has anime that came out in 2000 or later; the data for older series is less reliable, but Evangelion is the series with the highest per-volume average.

I'm guessing that this list is just a copy of the post-2000 data from [here](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=2010466#post2010466), although I don't know why Golden Eggs isn't listed there.
>> ARTICLE
Is this average per year, per season, or per month?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realise how popular SAO was.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't one piece the most popular ever?
>> ARTICLE
It's the top-selling manga of all time, not sure about anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh that may be true, Totally forgot this was just anime, some of these im a little suprised they did so well but werent continued
>> ARTICLE
i had no idea bakemonogatari is that popular.

why is it so popular? 
>> ARTICLE
Have you been living under a rock????? Bake has always been known to be one of shaft's great successes and it shouldn't be a surprise judging from nise's sales number
>> ARTICLE
did not realize it was more popular than haruhi/k-on!

(almost as much as both of them combined!)
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of Shaft..... where fanservice blows everything else out of the way
>> ARTICLE
You can say that for Nise, but Bake didn't really have that much fan service.
>> ARTICLE
Just because Nise has way more fanservice than normal doesn't mean Bake didn't have its fair share.
>> ARTICLE
That's also not counting Nisemonogatari with it.

Pretty sure most shows at the top don't really fall under "mediocre" (except Destiny with its near universal dislike in the west)

How does an anime like The World of Golden Eggs even get that much sales? 

Furthermore, how does this go for more than $10 with what seems to be a low budget web series?
>> ARTICLE
Probably tells you just how insanely niche anime is in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
What I wanna know Is wtf is it that it got released in 2005 yet is beating Eva in sales

With the gap between Monogatari S2 and Attack on Titans closing, what's the chance of Monogatari taking over as the best selling series of 2013?
>> ARTICLE
It probably won't take over, unless Titan crashes. If I understand analysts correctly, Monogatari will be extremely consistent, i.e. it will probably hover around pretty much the same number until the end.

However, and on that note, it's not guaranteed that Titan will be consistent. If everyone suddenly loses interest in it, the average may drop enough to allow Monogatari to take over, but that's very unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
It's the other way round, Monogatari will be extremely inconsistent sales wise. Kabukimonogatari will outsell Nekomonogatari: Shiro by a huge margin but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well. So Monogatari will almost certainly outsell Titan temporarily when the Kabukimonogatari sale results are out, but in the end the numbers will probably be not that far from its current numbers.
>> ARTICLE
Your analysis got me curious, so I did a little digging and compiled the data and chart to comparing the two.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ajj_IfkmgvF0dEdXS1JXUG5qUlFVSG5XdVNWN3h6QWc&gid=10

Looks like your analysis is mostly on the mark.  The biggest issue hurting Monogatari's chance of a late come-back is the lack of a longtail (BD Multipler Monogatari 1.1 vs SnK 1.4).  There's a good chance that Monogatari S2 will end up winning the BD average, but its lack of DVD sales dooms any chance for the overall BD+DVD average.
>> ARTICLE
>but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well

This is a case where the stalker is unreliable.  I know for at least one of the arcs, their volumes were at rank 2/3 during their first week instead of 1/2 because there was something else high profile that went up for pre-order around the same time they went up.  There's a huge difference between consistently 2nd and consistently first for a week points-wise, but it doesn't necessarily means the sales were that different if at all.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks for the correction.

I should've remembered that the fact that it's split into arcs will cause some volumes to be more popular. I just went with the fact that v1 seemed to be extremely well predicted.
>> ARTICLE
Some surprises for me: I enjoyed Bakemonogatari but didn't expect it to be so high up on the list. When I think about it it sorta makes sense. It's one of the few harem shows that successfully convinces the viewer that the protagonist is justified in having an entourage of girls. Also, the dialogue sounds intelligent. Bascially it's wish fulfillment for a lot of otaku.

I didn't expect Madoka to be so high up either, but I guess it's due to Urobutcher's stellar writing. And, other than Nanoha, there's really no other show like it. It really filled a subgenre void.

Also, I thought Kyoani's powerhouse shows would be higher up on the list... which got me thinking, how would these shows fare if you included non-dvd sales like figurines?

Toshokan Sensou made it onto the list? I thought the show was charming but not compelling enough to rake in sales. Perhaps the work of the Fujoshi legion?

And finally, why is Umi ga Kikoeru on this list? Did it first air on TV despite being a Ghibli movie?

Anyway, glad to see Hataraku and SNAFU made it on from this season.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka would probably crush everybody (late-night) if we include figurines and other goodies. It even has its own monthly magazine/anthology where popular artists draws their fanfics/stories. Vol 11 just came out this year.

Latest figures for Madoka series was $400 million in 2012. Should easily top $600 million+ with the movie this year and goods that comes with it.

It aired prime-time and is a family friendly show. I don't think it's especially popular compared to other prime-time shows like Sazae-san or Doraemon, but It's much shorter so I can see it selling lots of dvd's as opposed to Sazae-san which has almost 7000 episodes.

Woah this is so weird. I went to bed last night looking for these exact statistics, but couldn't find any. So, thanks!

Edit: Shouldn't Neko:Black be on this list? It's sold 60k+ last I checked.

Edit 2: Nevermind, it counts as a Special. Kinda crazy, though, if you count it, the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't count as a special, it aired on TV first

I agree. I think it also aired on Nico at the same time? So I guess it's both. Maybe the difference is that it wasn't made for a specific time slot.

Some interesting things I noticed:

For how much love Steins;Gate gets here, it's pretty low on that list - just beating out Chuu2, which at 15k is more than I was expecting. Also surprised to see Cowboy Bebop so low. Does that include US Sales?

I'm glad to see Love Live! and GuP up there. Someone already mentioned F/SN at 26k. I liked it. I'm glad it's up there.

Clannad > Clannad: After Story; lel. 

I know people like Bakemonogatari, but I'm surprised at a mammoth 78k. Is there a reason for that? Is it just that good? I've got it, I'm gonna watch it now.

*monogatari and Urobuchi slaughter. Holy cow.

It's cool to see how well the data fit a curve. http://i.imgur.com/LQdIW3s.jpg

10 of KyoAni's 18 TV series make that list.
>> ARTICLE
It is really good, but its high numbers have always confused me as well. To me, it doesn't really have the features some of these other shows on the list have, what you could think of as universal appeal. Maybe its uniqueness makes it stand out. Maybe the LN was insanely popular anyways, so it already had a solid fanbase. I'm curious to know.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood OP 1 - Again - Yui

I personally really love the first opening for mirai Nikki. I know a lot of people hate the show. (Personally love it) but I think we can all agree that ever since you started watching it you couldn't get the theme out of your head. Hated the second theme though

Mirai Nikki's first OP is great, but it also kind of pisses me off because I swear I've heard something very similar to the first 25s before but I can't for the life of me think of where.

Good choices, but where is Tank from Bebop? :P

Great OP but not quite good enough :P

I didn't even get to include Trigun's OP and I like that more than Tank.

You found 50 OP's you liked more than tank?  
Eh, everyone has their own opinions I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not the biggest fan of Bebop so I'm sure that affects things.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, maybe. I do notice that a lot of your top songs have a single male vocalist and a couple electric guitars. Your taste is pretty good, actually, but it seems like most of it is 'my favorite alternative-genre openings'. That's not entirely bad, but it's missing a lot of good songs IMO.
>> ARTICLE
What? Where did this question come from? And people don't swear at me, they swear with me.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely tend to prefer male vocals over female vocals. I can't say this list is at all fixed in stone though. There's a good 20 or so other openings I could easily switch in, depending on my mood.
>> ARTICLE
Missing ones that immediately jump out at me: 

* Serial Experiments Lain
* Honey and Clover 1
* Cowboy Bebop
>> ARTICLE
> Serial Experiments Lain

I can't say I particularly like Lain's OP. I end up comparing it to Paranoia Agent's OP because Youtube puts it in the related section and I like Paranoia Agent's a lot more.

> Honey and Clover 1

It's *too* weird, when the show itself isn't that weird.
>> ARTICLE
These are all great opening songs, but I find the lack of Attack On Titan's first OP  to be a huge hole. That opening was dope.

Guren No Yumiya deserves a spot I think :o
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because I haven't watched it but I don't quite dig AoT's OP enough to include on the list. It's definitely a great OP though.

Funny seeing Death Parade right up there, considering it's so new. Hard to disagree though; Every time I hear that intro I want to dance!


Kyoukai no Kanata in there too? I must admit - It's one of the few shows where I would ALWAYS watch the opening AND the ending. Loved it so much.


Only disappointment here is no mention of Kill la Kill's second op! That always got me hyped up for each episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'd even consider putting Death Parade higher! It's just too good.

Kyoukai no Kanata's ED would easily make my Top 50 ED list as well, I like it more than the OP.

I went and listened to the KLK OP and I actually like it more than I remembered. I still wouldn't put it on my list though.
>> ARTICLE
It's all personal preference, however I would have added Tokyo Ghoul OP1, Parasyte OP1, and Nanatsu no Taizai OP1. Nice list btw :)
>> ARTICLE
I actually dislike Ling Tosite Sigure and Loathing in Las Vegas so you'd never see Tokyo Ghoul or Parasyte anywhere near my list :P

Nanatsu no Taizai's is awesome though! Just didn't make the cut.

Durarara OP 2

OP2 > OP1 = OP3

I think I like the song for OP 2 a little more, but OP 1 just feels more Durarararararara to me.
>> ARTICLE
I like OP1 and uh, would it be OP1 for season 2?

OP2 to me is the theme that started around episode 13. I agree the others feel more true to the pace of the series, more up beat and such.

The OP2 isn't bad just prefer the upbeat stuff.

Ok I'm going to say it. Everyone on this sub is going to hate me but I'm going to say it. 

SAO1 OP1- Crossing field 

*goes into corner*

Wait what, people hate that OP?? That's one of my favorites, does that mean I have shit taste because if so, I am okay with shit taste.

From what I've seen a lot of people on this sub hate SAO. I guess we're the exceptions.

Huh.. I loved every minute of it. Glad to be an exception

Stand strong brother

Since everyone's doing it, I might as well throw in my two cents.

* Neither of the **Death Note** OP's made it, which is a shame.

* **Noragami** isn't on here either, Goya is probably one of my favorites.

* I disagree that Closer is the best **Naruto** opening. My personal favorite is probably Diver.

* I feel like **Bleach** had an opening I liked more, but I can't remember it... they were all awesome though, so I can't really complain.

* Somehow nothing from **FMA:B** is here; I thought it had some of the most consistently good OP's of any anime.

* I feel like this is often overlooked because of how mediocre the show was, but **Btooom's** first OP is really good.And if we're talking Nano, might as well throw **Arpeggio of Blue Steel** in the mix.

* Somehow **Angel Beat's** OP didn't make it either? It was probably the best thing from the show, very memorable. 

* **Parasyte's** also didn't make the cut; it's one of my favorites of the season.

* **Sword Art Online's** first opening isn't here, regardless of what you think of the anime, I think the OP is incredibly memorable. 

* SImilarly with **Mirai Nikki**, controversial anime, but definitely had solid OPs.

* Also, **AoT**, the first opening is almost a classic now. Just like the two above it, regardless of your opinion on the anime, the OP was very good.

* Then there's a handful that probably would've scraped the very end of the list, something from **Toradora** or **Kantai Collection's** OP.

I realize you've probably explained or mentioned most of these already, but whatever, again, just throwing in my two cents. It's a pretty solid list, obviously you can't fit everything on a 50 song list, and I haven't heard everything on there either, so obviously I'm going to find a couple I'd replace. We probably don't have similar music tastes either, given the Naruto pick. I also have no idea what criteria was used to rank this. Song and visuals or just song?

And obviously, can't leave out the [best one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2mE5FqI5WY)


>> ARTICLE
To keep things simple,

I like: Death Note (both), Noragami, FMA:B (all of them), Btooom, Mirai Nikki, AoT (1st), and Toradora (1st)

I don't much like: Angel Beats, SAO, Parasyte (I hate this one), and KanColle

As for Naruto, I don't dislike Diver but there a bunch of other Naruto OPs I would choose before it (ex. Yura Yura, Blue Bird, Sign).

And nothing tops Ranbu no Melody! Bleach has a lot of cool openings though.

> I also have no idea what criteria was used to rank this. Song and visuals or just song?

Well both... *sorta not really*. I dig the visuals of pretty much everything on here, so the visuals end up not really affecting much at all (because I already put much more emphasis on the song).
>> ARTICLE
Haha, fair enough I guess. I suppose most just didn't make the cut? I honestly think *something* from FMA should've made it, but whatever. I only strongly disagree with you on the Parasyte one, but I know some people don't like Fear and Loathing's style (which is absurd to me, autotuned screamo all the way). 

Also, I understand what you mean by the visuals, but I feel like some OP's like Ranbu no Melody, Mirai Nikki, or Noragami's are very much enhanced by their cool visual style, opposed to some that may have more generic visuals. It's another reason why Diver is higher for me than Closer, I felt like the visual themes and little story they told was a lot cooler. 

Bleach really did have all the cool openings, if I made a list I'm sure most of them would somehow make it >.<

Actually, thinking about that, I'm kind of curious as to why you made this list in the first place. Seems like a ton of random work.
>> ARTICLE
> I suppose most just didn't make the cut?

Yeah, pretty much. By the time I was done collecting potential choices I had almost 90 openings, and after the 50 mark I didn't bother putting down things that I figured wouldn't make the cut.

> which is absurd to me, autotuned screamo all the way

Haha, And this absurb to me!

And yeah I get what you mean with the visuals, but unless I think they're *really* amazing (Death Parade and Bleach are good examples of thinking that), it has a small affect on the ranking. 

I guess you could say part of why I like Closer so much is the visuals. Not because it's unique but because of the subject matter. Shikamaru and Hidan are some of my favorite Naruto characters so I really like that they're featured in Closer. 

> I'm kind of curious as to why you made this list in the first place. Seems like a ton of random work.

Oh god, it was. I recently watched GRArkada's Top 50 Anime Openings list and it kinda just got me thinking about what I'd put on my list. Next thing I know, I'm scouring my MAL and Youtube listening to a boatload of openings and keeping track of the ones I thought could make it. I literally wasn't planning on doing anything with it or sharing it with anyone when I started, it just kind of happened. Later on I decided I should at least post it on reddit so it wouldn't completely feel like a embarrassing waste of time. It still does, but not *completely*.

I'm pretty happy with the response I got here though and overall it was kinda fun. Never again, however. One time is enough :P
>> ARTICLE
> Shikamaru and Hidan are some of my favorite Naruto characters

Dude, Shikamaru is the best. I forgot he had that scene in Closer.

Sometimes I don't really care about visuals, but in ones like Ranbu no Melody, the style choices really made a difference to me. Not that I didn't like it before, but the visuals really made me love it even more.

I have those moments too, where I just see something interesting, and next thing I know it's four in the morning and I have 20 tabs of various anime open. It just seems like it'd be particularly difficult for you as you seem to have watched a lot of stuff. I don't have nearly the range as you, but I'm sure even creating a top 25 list for myself would be tedious. I do have a thing where I've been examining various OP cuts for swapping, but I still don't know if that's as much work as ranking my favorite openings.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass OP was pretty damn good

I second this.

Nice choices overall, but where are OPs from FMA:B, Steins;Gate, TTGL, Monogatari Series and JoJo?
>> ARTICLE
> FMA:B

Explained in other reply.

> Steins;Gate

I like the OP but it might not even make my top 100.

> TTGL

I only think it's *okay* (I also haven't watched TTGL)

> Monogatari Series

Platinum Disco is on there!

> JoJo

Haven't particularly enjoyed any of the JoJo openings I've heard.

I'm not really fond of K-On's OPs/EDs (Partly because I dislike K-On itself I think) \*braces for the downvotes*

> After Story

Even 50 isn't enough spots for everything! Dango Daikazoku would definitely make my top 50 endings list if I made one though!

> Railgun S

S'okay. Index's OPs are better :P
>> ARTICLE
> Partly because I dislike K-On itself I think

Peasantry! K-ON! is love. K-ON! is life.

Peasantry! For After Story, you make room.

Peasan... Okay fine. I'll give you that one on a personal preference scale. But only if you're talking about [Index II OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmiwF-0EEHQ).

I was indeed thinking of Index II OP 2, along with Index OP 1.

I find it even more annoying than Lucky Star's OP D:

Eh!? How could you not love sanchi pinchi. You must've been dropped as a baby.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just crazy, man.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I love just how well it summarizes the show. It's really upbeat and lighthearted, but the actual lyrics and meanings are dark as fuck, just like the show.
>> ARTICLE
1 for me would be Durarara's opening. Either season 1's original or the new one for season 2. (sorry about giant text, Didn't know it did that...)

Honestly they are both my fav in a long long time. I might rank others above it just based on how much I like the series but honestly these openings strike me overall as the best I have seen.

Not there, but it is pretty amazing. On a different day it might have made it.

There are quite a few here that i enjoy. but what about Ao haru ride? Guilty Crown? Snafu?

>> ARTICLE
Ao Haru Ride and Oregairu have great openings. Especially Ao Haru Ride. Let's do this:

51\. Ao Haru Ride 

I don't like Guilty Crown's OP though.
>> ARTICLE
My taste is certainly very different from yours. Props for making this thread though. I'd imagine it took a lot of work. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

What's your taste like, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
More along the lines of rock openings. Probably stuff you haven't heard for the most part really. I like a lot of the Gundam openings and a ton of stuff spread out everywhere else. Here's from from 08th ms team(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PKgztP0zw) and another from Gundam 00(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akH8OQY0OxI). As a bonus heres one from SoulTaker(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGH59jj7FYM). So generally very upbeat stuff is preferred by me.

Must have been hard picking one OP from Jigoku Shoujo.

I miss Slayers, Madoka Magica the most.

What I wouldn't put here (and know them) is Death Parade OP, Arakawa Under the Bridge OP, Maria Holic OP.

What I'd get more towards 1st position: Spice and Wolf, .hack//Sign and especially Umineko.

More recently WIXOSS (any), Sekai Seifuku.
>> ARTICLE
> Jigoku Shoujo

I love Sakasama no Chou far too much, wasn't even a contest for me.

> Umineko

I haven't even see it, so I thought it did pretty well all things considered.
>> ARTICLE
I see.

Well people tend to get a bit more biased about these things after watching the series, but thing is, the show itself was really bad. Even the VN is a bit messed up, but combined with DEEN's worst at adapting and animating... it was really bad.

But the OP is something I though made making it worthwhile :)

The game also have a great, similar OP though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I heard it was bad. I considered watching it at some point but decided not to because of that.

Seriously though, there isn't all that much difference between 44 and like 24. I really, really like all of these OPs.
>> ARTICLE
I can somewhat relate to that, I'd have a pretty hard time putting a list like this together myself; at best I could randomly throw 50 of my favorites on a list, with the top 10 being some I like slightly more.

And the order of them would still change depending on my mood :D
>> ARTICLE
Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

Also, had to look up The World of Golden Eggs, since this was my first time hearing of it.

Definitely interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

That struck me as odd at first too, but then I realized that as DVDs became popular, cheaper to make, and cheaper to buy, home video sales went up a lot.

I'm happy to see Hataraku Maou Sama doing well.

When you consider that Nisemonogatari is also up there at 60k, and the Neko OVAs did really well too, the Monogatari series is actually a powerhouse selling series. I'm looking forward to hearing how the first volume of Season Season did, which released recently. 

And then you consider that Madoka is up there, and the movies did really well, it shows that Shaft and Shinbou might be considered the most successful anime team on the market currently. 

>> ARTICLE
I actually saw the sales for Nise before I'd ever seen Bake so I just assumed that Nise did better than Bake and never bothered to check just how well Bakemonogatari actually did.

How well did Neko do? Also Neko wasn't an OVA, it was a TV special. I think they aired all four episodes in one night and simulcasted them as well.

Yeah, I know it was a TV special. It tops the list at 56k.

Wow, Love Live outsold Jojo, an immensely popular franchise with a lot of content and history behind it.

What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 
On the list I'm surprised that SAO *only* sold 35k, thought it was more popular than that. 

SnK no surprise it's selling big. 

Madoka somewhat of a surprise I knew it was popular but not quite 71k popular.

I thought Haruhi would be near the top of the list but only 42k.

Wonder what it would take for a series to break 100k these days, would have to be immensely popular and/or have a lot of volumes.
>> ARTICLE
>What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 

It's not. It's an adult short (one of the episodes revolved around 2 teens fucking in the bushes at school). Very much like Robot Chicken's story style but there are no cultural jokes. Just plain datsuryoku-kei comedy. Occasionally there is a live-action cooking segment reminiscent of the one from Tentai Senshi Sunred. 

It aired on MTV in Japan so think about American MTV cartoons and that should give you an easier picture.

Fate series sucks anyway. I don't get how someone from the West can stomach the horribly interpreted Western themes.

I'm sorry, I know it's dickish to hate on things, but I can only take so much inundation of this show's praises.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much experience you have with the fate series, but having played the visual novels I can safely say I have no idea what "western themes" you are talking about. If you are just talking about pulling from western legends like King Aurthur and whatnot, then 1 those are not themes, and 2 you could not be more wrong. 

But yeah the anime sucks pretty hard. Did almost nothing right.
>> ARTICLE
You're nitpicking over a word that's not even really even wrong. The interpretations at least in the anime were really shallow, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Everything in the anime was really shallow. The anime was really shallow. The VN gives character profiles to each of the servants and explains how they are affected by being summoned. Forcing them into a class alters them from their historical/mythological selves in various ways. Additionally they are strongly affected by how people remember their legend, rather than actual fact. 

They give a lot more depth and characterization to each of them, and delve more into the legends they are from.

I see, so the problem I mentioned is probably not there in the VN.

Basically, this is the list of every show that has sold over 10,000 copies, which is considered the marking of a large success. 

Card Captor Sakura was highlighted because of the positioning at the bottom of the list. All the series that are moving up the list are from the last year (2012-13, anyway), except Card Captor. It was released in 1998, yet it's moved up! Very impressive!

How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

It's probably because Idolmaster is more known for the games than the anime and the anime is just a by-product of its popularity. While Love Live is a manga which means it originally has no sounds and people prefers the one with music

Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.
>> ARTICLE
> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this.

Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.

Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?

Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!

Jinrui was an amazing show, easily a contender for best show of the year. I hate to say it, but I feel like the first couple episodes were as good as it got, though. There were some nice moments, like parts of tea party arc. But it never got better than the absurdity of the factory.

Kuroko no Basket is one of those shows that everyone says you *will* like even if you don't like sports anime. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it because I don't like sports anime.

Yeah, I'm not to big on sports myself and still enjoyed it very much(obviously :P).

Is Kuroko No Basket fairly similar to Prince of Tennis?  It may have been pretty unrealistic, but I enjoyed PoT for the most part (it did get ridiculous at the end, but I was committed way before then).

I find that sports/game anime are the easiest genre to marathon though.
>> ARTICLE
I did start to watch PoT but could not get in to it because it about tennis, it's just not my thing. But in terms of similarity, it probably is that way in both anime. So why not give it a go, it's certainly not bad.

I marathoned KnB when it was simulcasting on CR up til ep. 14 or something and then I had to wait for the weekly release, and that sucked. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll try it out sometime; I usually enjoy any kind of show from the genre (watched your mention of Giant Killing already).

> because it about tennis, it's just not my thing

I want to say I had your same mentality when I first started on PoT.  I was never into Tennis and thought any show about it must be boring, but I was fairly hooked me into the series.  I think this was the case for Major and Giant Killing as well to be honest.  However, Prince of Tennis was around the time I really started watching a bunch of anime, so I likely overrated it at the time.

I think the show offered enough unrealistic play for me to not care if I don't enjoy the sport itself as much, but as you say, it might not be for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
I want to like PoT so I'll probably watch it later, but as it is now... I'll pass. That's how I watch anime, I start to watch a show, put in on hold for a while and then on a later date pick it up again. And who knows, next time I might love it from the start.
>> ARTICLE
I know you already got an answer but I gotta throw in my recommendation. I was huge PoT fan and Kuroko broght back all the same good sensations. 

Like they aren't afraid to have the main team loose, and there are some demi-god characters that reminded me of Atobe and that one guy with the hat.

Watch it as soon as you get the chance, it's a great show.

Natsume Yuujinchou is one of my favorite series.  Most of the episodes are standalone, so you dont necessarily have to watch them all in order (so long as you know the main storyline/about Natsume, Reiko and Nyanko-sensei).

I dont really classify it as a shoujo anime at all; it doesnt have any elements that are more for girls than for guys.  My dad has watched all 4 seasons and he really enjoys it.
>> ARTICLE
Why is this happening? The first season didn't do nearly that well.

Also, what's the show about?
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the show this week, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I know:

Uta no Prince-Sama (Shortened to Utapri) is the best selling Otome franchise currently on the market with a total of 7 games (2-3 of them being rhythm games, the others are dating sims), Drama CDs, music CDs, manga, and other merch. 

It's about Haruka Nanami, a girl who's dream is to compose music for her favorite idol. In the games, you play as Nanami and eventually start a romance with one of the boys. There are six main male characters, all of which have their own unique styles and personalities, and a seventh is introduced officially in Season 2. Later games, you can also branch out to their rival group for more dating possibilities.

Being a female anime fan, it's refreshing to see an otome game get it's own series and with all of the harem animes around, (which sure, I still love those too) it's a nice change of pace. I think the series can be summed up as female fanservice. The characters are relatively well developed, but it's entirely a girl's fantasy anime. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe the sales are incredibly high because they included concert tickets? It's something I saw said in another thread, so I don't know first-hand. I do know the franchise is very popular in Japan, and has somewhat of a cult following of girls and women. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to complete their collections of CDs, manga, and games with the anime series.

All in all, it's fun to watch and some of the music is really good. Having no previous knowledge of the franchise; Season 2 is a lot better than Season 1.

h20: footprints in the sand was very good, i like stuff about idols so i very much enjoyed akb0048, lemon angel project, kirarin revolution and idolm@ster, lilpri was good if you like really sweet anime, school days (i liked it its really messed up though) and if you want ecchi/humor i suggest seitokai yakuendomo

Jyu-Oh-Sei: Planet of the Beast King was pretty good.  It's also on netflix and worth a look.

Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari. While not part of the same same series I just mentioned, I also recommend Katanagatari.
