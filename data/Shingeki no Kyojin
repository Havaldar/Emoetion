[Potato girl is fucking amazing] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIVfUjCCMAAGBkf.png), I'm actually really interested to see if she has an interested backstory. 

Even if she doesn't, she still was some great comic relief. I don't know if the comedy was actually intentional but I hope it was and we continue get the odd bit throughout the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I like her hair very, very much. My favorite girl hairstyle :)
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, she is the first interesting thing in this show, so far. I think it was cool of the author to give some comic relief while referring to such a delicate issue - famine.

I was laughing my ass off the whole time she was being introduced.
"Tch. I'll give you this half." XD

It wasn't even half either.

So...why were they hiking in the woods in the middle of the night?

I thought it was to use the water to help balance training, but that's just a guess that has absolute no backing to it.

the hike wasn't really in the manga but the conversation was in it.

i guess they wanted to add more feeling to the scene that just have them talk inside the barracks for the whole time.

Nothing like a little late night BL "balance" training

I thought it was just them bonding out on a stroll to a peaceful lake area.

Uhhh, no real reason actually. Oddly enough, this was an anime original scene. Maybe to make things more dramatic before the aptitude test?

"He's thinking that now he won't have to be separated from me."  Yeah, okay, you keep thinking that.
>> ARTICLE
She's actually saying something along the lines of "He's relieved about how he doesn't have to stay close to me."

EDIT: It appears I might be wrong on this.
>> ARTICLE
Now that makes a lot more sense. Mikasa seems pretty sensible so I was surprised she'd spout a line that makes her seem so clingy and deluded. 
>> ARTICLE
No, Commie translated it 100% accurately. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/gFCwJWS.jpg) the official English translation, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/mXZYpkS.png) the original Japanese. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/Re6EIt9.jpg) Commie's translation.

Japanese breakdown.

"And for some quick japanese lessons

 means to be seperated

 means to not be seperated, and is the same as 
is  which means to "get by"

And of course  means to have peace of mind or to be relived.

So Eren is relived he can get by without having to be seperated from Mikasa."

Taken from Anonymous.
>> ARTICLE
I read an alternate translation elsewhere: "Hes relieved that now he wont have to fall behind me"

This seems pretty close to the official English translation while making Mikasa more in-character.
>> ARTICLE
But then the reaction of everyone around her doesn't really make sense.  They are either acting like she said something completely off the wall, or they do that every time she says something.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they're surprised that Mikasa is so sure about what Eren's thinking, as though she knows him completely? 
>> ARTICLE
This was surprising, it seems rather out of character for Misaka.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa is borderline yandere. She's smart, but not exactly emotionally stable. She really only cares about Eren.
>> ARTICLE
She's usually not that deluded regarding their relationship though. Also she entirely lacks the -dere part.
>> ARTICLE
She has a couple -dere moments, that can't really be discussed without manga spoilers though I think.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously potato girl is best girl. Would someone mind posting a gif of her leaping at Christa to snatch the bread?

So, most of the major characters are revealed now (except for a certain blonde, who's only been in 2 scenes so far).

Yeah, I guess the anime adaption isn't going to help clarify that Jean scene for me. I still have a hard time wrapping my head around his dramatic reaction to being ignored by Mikasa. 

Solid episode, I have no objections to the adaption.

I thought he was upset because eren tells her to cut her hair which is what he liked anout her

I thought it was less that he tells her to, and more that she's all "how long should I cut it"? She doesn't give a damm that he liked it.

There's also a guy/group named [AutisticCommie] that edits all the weird translations around the word 'titan' that Commie made in SNK. Not sure how fast the 'fixed' subs come out, though.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't mind waiting a bit extra, check out EveTaku's subs. They are usually pretty good, though slower to release.
>> ARTICLE
The trick to finding good subs is not to base it entirely off a fansubs group, but to look for the best subs for the anime. A lot of fansubbers have a hit and miss for each show. So don't just disregard the credibility of the group for screwing up one series. It even seems like gg subs is the best for Attack on Titan at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
I thought they were totally fine until I saw this thread, so I'm probably going to just keep enjoying them until somebody actually gets the rights to air this legally state-side.
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll has legal subs. Their subscription is pretty cheap too. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh hey, great! I remember hearing a couple weeks ago about some drama about it not showing up so I hadn't checked since. All this drama is even sillier now! Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Evetaku, away!
>> ARTICLE
I watch the Commie version, and have been enjoying it so far. Attack on Titan is an absolutely horrible title, and I prefer their take on it. Even multiaxial mobility gear I'm okay with.

I just don't understand why there's so much negativity towards a group that changes a few things that don't really matter. Translating something one-to-one isn't always possible, and sometimes if you do the result doesn't match the original intention or sound very good. Changing a few terminologies doesn't change the show, just makes it slightly more enjoyable for those that like the changes. If you don't, there's always other fansub groups, and you don't have to get butthurt over it.
>> ARTICLE
People's elitist attitude :)
>> ARTICLE
because they're bucking the currently accepted terminology for no apparently reason
>> ARTICLE
Went with Commie because I did not want to wait. Rewatching glorious gg subs later. Hope their recruitment goes well this week. Looks like they have some top notch recruits.
>> ARTICLE
What's the actual word they used for "multiaxial mobility gear"?
>> ARTICLE
It's "Three-dimensional maneuver gear" , or "3DMG" for short.

>> ARTICLE
Is "eoten" a weird mispronunciation of titan? Also what is the equipment supposed to be called?
>> ARTICLE
Eoten is basically just an overly fancy version of 'titan'. It's retarded; it complicates things for no reason and the show's English name "Attack on Titan" was already well fucking established. They even added it in the op to be fancy, but commie just plastered their 'Eoten onslaught' all over that.

IIRC, the equipment is called the Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear (usually 3d maneuver gear or 3DMG) in the official English translation of the manga. Changing it to "multiaxial mobility gear" was fucking ridiculous because it sounds even sillier and is just another way for commie to stroke its' own cock.
>> ARTICLE
Eoten is another word for a giant or monster, its old-english I believe. You might be familiar with the word "Ettin" which comes from it.
>> ARTICLE
You may also know "jotun," to which "eoten" is related; jotun were the giants of Norse mythology who lived in Jotunheim.
>> ARTICLE
I cringed at every Eotens and almost had to stop and find a different version. 
>> ARTICLE
Commie used to be pretty good, but they've gotten crazier and crazier with their subs.
>> ARTICLE
Oh it's even worse. [Have a look at this.](http://imgur.com/KpQXERp,XRkTAX7#0)

Also Behemoth Eotena goes against why they went with Eotena to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
Explain please.
>> ARTICLE
Your hearth normally IS on the left side of your body.Though some people have a symmetric anatomy where all their organs are on the opposite side. Rare, but true.
>> ARTICLE
Their reasoning for using Eotena instead of Titan was among others the fact that nowhere is it stated that the greek Titans actually were huge. Behemoth is similar it doesn't say it's huge originally, that's something that came afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
That's terrible reasoning and I have no idea why they would do that. In modern English, "titan" has a very strong implication of great size. "[Titanic](http://thesaurus.com/browse/titanic)" is almost only ever used to describe things of considerable size and "titan" is used (outside of its mythological context, of course) to indicate figures that are of immense and imposing stature.
>> ARTICLE
[Here's a pastebin of their justification.](http://pastebin.com/kH8jsjcw)

Can't link to it directly due to sub rules.
>> ARTICLE
Im wondering why he doesn't just keep "Shingeki no Kyojin"
>> ARTICLE
Oh god. The translator is seriously using Old English declensions? I'm an Anglo-Saxonist, and even I think that's ridiculous. 

Basically, the justification all sounds very pretty, but the basic rule of translation is that it should be clear and idiomatic in the target language. If 90% of your audience don't know what eoten means (let alone how it declines in the dative plural), the word fails to translate  in any meaningful way. I've translated Beowulf for classes, and I'd never consider leaving eoten as it is. 

 is a pretty simple Japanese word. If I were translating from scratch, I'd just render it as giant. However, since the manga is subtitled "Attack on Titan", I'd use that . . . . 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, thank you. As a translator myself it was mind-boggling and headache-inducing to read his over-the-top justifications for the word "eoten", when, as you've pointed out, the job of a translation is to make itself *accessible*. And since I coincidentally focus on Japanese -> English translations, this whole quasi-interpretation of what  means is bollocks.

 literally means "giant people/race", or just plain "giants". Sure, you could fiddle around with context and probably justify rationale for other "giant"-esque words, but the core of the word is really very simple. Also, if more exotic words were intended as a meaning, the Japanese would be written in katakana and directly derived from some foreign word. In this case,  is going for the most basic conveyance, and any localization to a more exotic meaning is the translator attempting to flex their linguistic boner.
>> ARTICLE
He makes a great argument for the word. Seriously he does.

But he doesn't make a great argument for inexplicably injecting the word into the Anime. Seriously, no one knows the word, so no one can understand it, or easily read it. Without a vocal explanation many people are going to stumble over the word and be pulled out of the show. It would be a great word if they took the liberty to somehow inject an explanation without ruining any lines, but that's pretty liberal as it is. Maybe that would work for an English dub.

He also ignores the modern definition of "Titan" in favor of the origins of the word, which doesn't make much sense.

I think Commie is really taking these things too far. I can agree with some of their liberal tendencies, but not this new naming sense.
>> ARTICLE
After reading that, he does make a strong case for "Eoten" instead of "Titan," (although I think "Jotun" may have been more effective).

However, as you said, he completely overlooks the modern English meaning of "Titan" as something of enormous size with an imposing air about it. His point about cannibalism has some merit and while titans certainly look human, they are different beasts (unless a reveal has yet to happen in the manga that we don't know about). While the humans see the jotun as monsters, it is suggested that they are intelligent beings and the word "Titan" does a good job of encapsulating this feeling of something that is gargantuan, but still humanlike.

Also, the average viewer has no fucking clue what a eoten is and probably think Commie just made it up. The official translation is "Attack on Titan," which, while nonsensical, is an established title. The use of "eoten" strikes me as about 30% actually wanting to find a better word than "Titan" to describe the antagonists of the series and 70% wanting to be able to say "look at how different and smart we are!"
>> ARTICLE
>probably think Commie just made it up

This was the experience of my friend and myself, and I imagine most people as well. Eoten isn't a modern English word, so unless you establish it, it has no meaning. I totally agree.

>The use of "eoten" strikes me as about 30% actually wanting to find a better word than "Titan" to describe the antagonists of the series and 70% wanting to be able to say "look at how different and smart we are!"

Personally, I think it's 100% trying to go against the curve. They want to create user reliability (you don't usually want to switch translators mid-season, but especially not if you are used to their terminology) and make their subs interesting rather than "just another in the crowd". And I think that's stupid. Focus on readability, understandability, and the source material.

What commie did with this Eoten thing is make a *marketing decision* for a show that they have nothing to do with, making their iteration a unique iteration.

Personally, I've stopped watching anything subbed by Commie, where I used to prefer them over others.

I wanna know that song that was playing in the last scene, where they're swinging through the trees. It sounded awesome!
>> ARTICLE
I spent a little time digging around. The song isn't released yet, but should be on the OST which as far as I can find will be released on June 28th. The person singing is apparently an artist by the name of 'mpi'.
>> ARTICLE
That song fit those 60 seconds so well, it was just plain awesomeness. I really like how the soundtrack complement the scenes of the show, and this one is no exception.
>> ARTICLE
Was I the only one who thought his belt being broken was setup by that one guy who he almost fought at dinner (Sorry the guys name is escaping my mind). 
>> ARTICLE
I suspected the sister...

But they didn't really present an opening...As in they got the gear and Eren started to fail hard right away. If it was sabotage, the saboteur would have had to have had prior knowledge of what belt he'd get, or actually be the one handing out the belts.
>> ARTICLE
As I said to someone else, it's just faulty equipment not sabotage. Just trying to prevent conspiracies around things that won't be brought up again.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't really call it a conspiracy, more like just something you think about when something like that happens.
>> ARTICLE
The trainer clearly says it was rust too and he's never seen it before.  

I'm not sure where people are getting the implication of sabotage.
>> ARTICLE
I believe that was gg fucking up the script.

>gg: "The metal fittings on your belt were rusty. I've never seen this part rust before. We need to add this to the list of things to get fixed."

This implies a they checked that part in the past, that it's unusual for it to rust. And it also implies that "the list of things to get fixed" is made only when things are broken. This also leaves a lot of room for sabotage being a possibility.

>Commie: "The fittings on your belt were damaged. I didn't even know that could happen, but I suppose I need to add them to the maintenance list."

This fits much better to the setting. It's like they made a discovery that would improve how equipment maintenance is done.
>> ARTICLE
I get the point why people have a feeling of sabotage. A popular theory is that Mikasa is literally trying to take Eren out of the program to keep him protected. She even said in the episode that he should just call it quits. Of course if you read the manga, she's very protective of Eren and borderline yandere to because [Minor spoilers](/s "Eren likes living a suicidal life as well as being tasked by his mother too protect him and the fact that she was saved by Eren who killed two criminals.")

But nah, it's just rust.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the guy looks pretty old, and he's in a position of authority, so he's clearly been in the army a while. When you deal with that many sets of equipment, seeing a defect that *you've never seen or heard of before* is pretty suspicious.

So this is what it feels like for the people watching Game of Thrones without knowing what happens. Because they have *no idea* what's coming this season and I do and it is killing me to know that the same sort of stuff is most likely lurking in this show's future for me.
>> ARTICLE
Problem with Game of Thrones though is that if you want to know what's going to happen this season and have never read the books, you will literally have to start with Book 1. So many changes occurred with the transition that you can't just pick up book 3 otherwise you'd get confused.
>> ARTICLE
Commie fucked up the terminology and now we're getting reports that gg bypassed QC and their dialogue is fucked.

Mango-chan of gg is saying they'll make a v2.
>> ARTICLE
Commie is the better release for everything except terminology, and maybe the karaoke lyrics: gg's lyrics read like Eren's message to humanity, and Commie's read as a song to Eren, the hunter.
>> ARTICLE
Well shit.
>> ARTICLE
v2 is out already, but it's a bit worrying that gg had to put out 2 v2s in one week.

This is a high profile show so I guess they feel pressured to get it up as quickly as possible, especially since Commie beat them this week.

I will wait for a better sub next week, Commie sub was atrocious.

I'm watching the Crunchyroll simulcast. Seems a solid translation so far, though I have no idea how they're getting some of the faint background dialogue. Maybe they get a script . . . ?

i, too, was surprised when i saw that panel.. it felt so dark and grim for the atmosphere of the entire episode.

So far, all the characters are pretty likeable, Eren included (even if he's a presumptuous braggart). 

I'm glad it was only malfunctioning equipment that held him back. If he couldn't even dangle in midair, the show would have gone overboard in portraying him as an underdog.

I was as well. I was actually honest to goodness scared that we were going to have to have some sort of incredibly too long training arc. Then they were like,jk He's actually great.

>even if he's a presumptious braggart

Oh trust me, you'll love him a lot more in future episodes.

i guess after going through 44 chapters, i'm the only one that still doesn't like him much. -_-

I hope you're not being sarcastic.

Honestly, I really do. This seems like it's going to be great and I'd rather not have a MC that I want to gut.

Not at all, Eren's just a total nutjob. But he's the 'good' kind of nutjob.

It feels so nice to have an anime where all the female characters so far are likeable, and none of them seem shoehorned into the love interest role.

don't think anyone could compete with Mikasa anyway.

ATTACK! On TITAN!

Pointless intro paragraph deleted. There's no time for that, there's *Titans* at the gates! Let's do this.

**Episode 3**

2:55  Already liking this episode. Getting its Full Metal Jacket on all over these pigshits from shit city.

5:35  Wow, the reports of Potato Girl's fantasticness were not exaggerated. I think the last expression was a little more absurd and hilarious in the manga, but using this anime's super-dramatic pans and close-ups to heighten the tension of Potato Girl's Last Stand was pretty amazing

7:00  And here's another scene I like  the cadets all crowding around to ask for scenes from the war front, since it's still just a far-removed adventure to them. I really enjoy when this show just re-contextualizes classic war film tropes into the Titan world  they're familiar, but they're well-written, help to ground this world in something tangible, and help to round out the personalities of our suddenly formidable cast of characters

9:00  Maybe it's just the highlighted lips, but I feel they've made Mikasa more classically anime-beautiful than she was in the manga, which I don't really like

10:40  "Is this... BREAD?!" I'm so happy this show's aware of the way drama can turn to silliness with these melodramatic close-ups, and is *actually using it that way.* If you understand the effect of your own shots well enough to use them for comedy, you'll probably be fine when it comes to actual drama as well

12:12  Eren what are you doing that is not how you belt-fly.

Wow, the last thing I expected was an episode full of actually pretty solid jokes. I also appreciate that they're using the 25 episode runtime to dedicate serious minutes just to establishing their system of training and combat, so when shit goes down, it's not just woo, crazy action, woo, you actually understand the stakes and powers of our protagonists, so you'll know when something is impressive, dangerous, or foolish in the terms of their world. As I've said before, action scenes are just noise if you can't tell who's winning or losing

14:51  Damn, Potato Girl is getting a dramatic workout this episode.

I don't even know what to say about the drama to comedy tonal shifts going on here  because the humor is mainly created through setting these scenes with the same dramatic tricks the allegedly tragic scenes of the first two episodes used, it seems like the show is kinda making fun of itself. Which is a weird place to be

17:30  I really like this guy's speech. I really like a lot of things about this episode, actually; it might be the first one that's really sold me on this show as its own thing with its own tone and ideas, and not just this season's action spectacle

18:15  This show keeps hammering in that theme of not being truly human if you don't have the strength to choose your own destiny. Very interested in seeing where they go with that  this show is too dark and has too many long, character-focused conversations for an idea as simplistically optimistic as that to go unchallenged for long

21:35  Okay, now I'm starting to see the JoJo argument as it applies to this show  it goes crazy with its dramatic angles and reaction shots, but it's still honestly committed to those scenes, and understands it's kind of going overboard. The contrast between those scenes, the comedy scenes where it *actually* makes fun of that kind of trick, and the actually very traditionally effective quiet drama scenes, is a little jarring, but I'm not against it  the show is doing its own thing, and I always appreciate that

**And Done**

Fun stuff! I had some misgivings about the way the comedy and drama bounced off each other, but by the end I think I just had a better grasp on what this show is actually about, and so all that stuff kind of fit into place. Overall I very much enjoyed this episode, and it gave me a great deal of confidence in the show going forward. I'm interested to see if they maintain this seemingly self-aware tone (well, the comedy makes it obviously self-aware, at least) going into more dramatic stretches, or if this was just to build a false sense of security  I honestly hope it does, cause I think I personally will enjoy the show more if it tries to have a little fun with its storytelling, and doesn't try to make us feel the weight of all this tragedy all the time.

I really hope it starts to pick up speed after this.

The story is interesting, but the constant teasing of the holy-shit aerial action is driving me insane.
>> ARTICLE
At the rate of how the episodes are progressing, we should be expecting some "holy-shit aerial action" pretty soon.

[My face when Potato Girl.](http://i.imgur.com/dVjwe64.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
While I liked the chapter it did cut out small parts that nagged at me. Marco's line suggesting that Eren get help from from Reiner was cut, the freckled girl getting Sasha to do her chores and other things that added to character development. 

Also really the lipstick on the girls is really annoying, like it sticks out like a sore thumb. I don't understand why they decided to do that when the manga never did it. I did love Potato girl scene greatly though. 

[For comparison here's the manga scene](http://i5.minus.com/i38r0czFI3CJw.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I really like how when she offers him 'half' she clearly keeps the bigger chunk.
>> ARTICLE
you really need to block the names that hasn't been mentioned yet. -_-
>> ARTICLE
>I don't understand why they decided to do that when the manga never did it.

You don't see lipstick when it's in black & white...
>> ARTICLE
It is not lipstick. It's a way to do character designs. See: Balsa (Seirei no Moribito), Mari (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0)
>> ARTICLE
It reminds me of Chihayafuru too. 
>> ARTICLE
I am pretty sure they are just lips, but since those are so rare, everyone thinks OMG LIPSTICK
>> ARTICLE
Well going after the description of Misaka on MAL and how she reacts in this episode-:

The adoptive sister of Eren and mutual childhood friend of Armin, Mikasa hides her emotions but cares deeply for Erennever hesitating to cry with tears of joy or despair depending on what happens to him. She shares an unbreakable bond with Eren following events in their past, and his mother requesting that she protect him made her even more overly protective of him than she was beforehand.

-It's pretty obvious that she dont want him to fight and maybe manipulated his gear.
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love this discussion thread.
>> ARTICLE
>maybe manipulated his gear.

I didn't actually even consider that, it does seem possible and it would be very interesting to see how Eren reacts if he finds out.

However part of me thinks that Misaka really knows how great Eren's fuel is to become a solider and kill the titans, and that if he wasn't good enough to become a soldier, He could never live with himself and possibly end up trying to (unsuccessfully) kill the titans anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
Before you guys get ahead of yourselves, his broken equipment is no sabotage it's just faulty.
>> ARTICLE
As i said... MAYBE
>> ARTICLE
Thats exactly what i was thinking... She KNOWS that he would become a great soldier but because of his mothers' request and how much she cares about him beforehand she just dont seem to want him fighting the titans and get into danger...

Dispite her showing almost no emotions until now, this is just an idea of mine and i dont know if its true or not but...
Could it be that her parents got killed by titans before she got adopted and i would even think that there is going to be this - "When nobody was there for me, he was" - backstory for her?

As i said i didnt read the manga dunno if its going to happen...
>> ARTICLE
Someone else below pointed out that it could have been Jean who messed with Eren's equipment, to basically try and make a fool out of him, but we shall see.
>> ARTICLE
> Before you guys get ahead of yourselves, his broken equipment is no sabotage it's just faulty.

He said...noooo
I think that Jean would become quite a good friend despite him saying nobody is going to see him acting like a hero, he probably will later on.

The manga author is terrible with flashbacks.  I get the feeling that he hasn't planned things out that carefully so he crams in a flashback in the worst places in order to get the backstory in.
>> ARTICLE
He probably didn't think it'd be that successful.
>> ARTICLE
It was so he could put the actiony stuff first. And the big event first too. In order to get views in a manga magazine (where its hard to fight the established ones) you gotta give a hook. Though I am not in agreement with this reasoning, this is the likely reason.
>> ARTICLE
"I don't like Reiner and Berthold, I hope they get eaten by a titan."

I will never get over that.
>> ARTICLE
I really need to know what the insert song near the end was.
>> ARTICLE
 when the trainer said Eren's equipment was defective, I kept waiting for them to pan to one of those guys he was arguing with as if they sabotaged him.

 Potato Girl was every bit as funny as you guys said. When her eyes turned all red and she attacked that other girl, it made me think of Fate/Zero "Shirley". hm hm hm

That scene with mikasa and potato girl was great.

[Weekly Reminder of the most Bad ass character from Shingeki no Kyojin](http://i.imgur.com/1K4CoN2.png)
>> ARTICLE
Expecting some action next episode from the preview.
>> ARTICLE
I have a spoilery question for anyone who has read the manga... (so please spoiler this...and just answer it generally.)

[Not really a spoiler but the answers certainly will be] (/s "Is this gonna end up being one of those shows where like half the main characters tragically die? cuz if so I think I'll need the manga to have myself prepared for it...Not sure I could handle just seeing his sister eaten half-way through.... ;_; ...but if not i don't wanna read the manga and spoil anything...so...")
>> ARTICLE
I really advise you against reading the manga just for that reason.  The beauty of this series is you really don't know what to expect next because of the constant twists and turns of events.  I guess you just have to learn to handle character deaths like a boss (not that I'm confirming/denying there will/will not be any deaths).

Be careful though, if you do decide to read the manga anyways, make sure you set aside a day or two for it.  Once you pop you can't stop, guaranteed.
>> ARTICLE
Where are you guys getting this show 18 Hours early? This just released 2 hours ago for me but this thread is already 20 hours old.... is it just a delay in the UK release on Crunchyroll or is there a quicker site?
>> ARTICLE
Fansubs, I'd suspect. If it's a hot show, the various groups race to get it out first. Usually with dire results. 
>> ARTICLE
Potato girl is the best girl.

I didn't like how at the end they jumped from basic balance training straight to swinging in the trees with ease, I hoped we would see them learn that.
>> ARTICLE
Yet another awesome episode... I can understand the people who started reading the manga, I can't wait for more. The details and info in the 'eyecatches' is just amazing. The whole setting is just Epic.

also Mikasa is a certified badass, but I am expecting great things from the potato girl too.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think that Ymir doesn't look nearly as bitchy as she does in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
seriously gotta block out things that hasn't been revealed yet, man. -_-
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm disappointed by the VA choice and appearance.  Almost feel like Ymir's and Sasha's VA should have been switched around.  Ymir needed to be more Tomboy and less lipsticks.  The character felt toned down and I fear it might have some impact for later developments if you know what I mean.

What's with the hyper-feminizing of all the female characters in the anime anyways? Aside for goddess Krista I really feel that the character design deviated a bit too much from the source... well we'll see how it goes I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I looked at Christa and went "Not NEARLY enough eyeliner."
>> ARTICLE
That last bit where they were swinging through the trees was the coolest thing I've seen in anime for a while. The art is strong in this one.
>> ARTICLE
3rd episode and still going incredibly strong. Nice introduction to a lot of new characters. Potato girl being best.
>> ARTICLE
their changing the story line all weird. I mean...this is technically the next part but the manga jumps back and forth. I suppose this makes more sense.

What happens after the colossal titan with the white hair destroys they second wall on the second episode? Did the titans enter the second wall then ate 10,000 people then leave?
>> ARTICLE
For clarification, the sector / district that Eren lives in is technically a walled off area off of Wall Maria (commonly known as the 1st / most outer wall). So the Colossal broken down the District wall, and the Armored Titan broke through Wall Maria. Everyone who lives inside Wall Maria but outside of Wall Rose had to either evacuate or get eaten alive. 

(not really a spoilers since it was already mentioned, many of those that did evacuate got sent back in a half-hearted attempt to retake Wall Maria, ending in death of 250 thousand refugees, effectively solving the refugee overflow problem) 

Titans currently occupy this space - at the moment no one (other than the scouting regiment or w/e the english translation is) dares to leave the confinement of Wall Rose.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much.
>> ARTICLE
whats the name of the ending OST?

>> ARTICLE
Does the anime follow the manga closely ?
>> ARTICLE
So far, it has moved some scenes around, for instance this training section was a flashback in the manga, but other than that yeah it seems to be following it closely.
>> ARTICLE
My body is so ready. I thought they were going to take a while to get through all the refugee/training stuff, but it looks like we'll be watching that moment we all fucking loved and hated equally soon enough...

I don't think I can handle waiting six days. Every expectation, fulfilled; faith in humanity, intact.
>> ARTICLE
so do you people think the part where mikasa just clings to him after the first cafeteria part. Also she does whatever he says like the hair part will come to light. she obviously loves but he doesn't give her the time of day
>> ARTICLE
Guys? Anyone help me? I tried loading up the video and the intro played fine, but then I blinked and the end credits rolled. I don't know what happened.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you did a timeskip IRL. Just joking.

I'm assuming you are watching from a streaming site? Well, that's the site's problem so... I don't think you can find help here. Maybe spam the reload button? (I think I might be taking a risk here and breaking Rule #4?)

It was a poorly constructed joke about how short the episode felt.

Ha! Then I truly deserve that Whoosh! Haha

Whoosh.

Potato girl freaked me the hell out. If she can attack somebody with food with such passion then she better not end up as food for the titans herself. That old bald man seemed to know about eren and his family, I wonder if he is somehow connected to them

I understand that the show is trying to take some artistic queues from the manga but [certain scenes] (http://i.imgur.com/RSlbX7d.jpg) just look a tad over dramatic, they don't appear very often though, the only other time I really noticed it was with the wind in [EP 1 here] (http://i.imgur.com/dImGfHI.jpg). I just hope they stay few and far between as they kinda take me out of the story when watching.

Edit: Changed some terminology to make myself a bit clearer 
>> ARTICLE
I'm completely fine with that... it kindy fits the artstyle and they dont do it very often.
>> ARTICLE
*cues
>> ARTICLE
For me, it's fine if the vertical shading isn't too much. But in the case of the first pic it looks like he's made of wood and it made me question if that scene was supposed to be serious or funny.
>> ARTICLE
>a tad over dramatic

It's shonen manga. 
>> ARTICLE
It's basically a straight, 1:1 adaptation of his face in the [manga](http://i.imgur.com/iGKe3hI.jpg). The joke wouldn't work as well if his face wasn't drawn like that. I think it's hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it really needed the over the top drama that art like that brings, anything less and he could be seen as feeling something else entirely different, which would have ruined the scene.
>> ARTICLE
One thing that seems off-putting about the anime is the slight attempts at humor, it kind of gives it The Office vibe, without the prolonged stares and uncontrollable laughter. I love the idea of the anime and I want to see it through.
>> ARTICLE
While I love the manga dearly, this is one of the most poorly animated shows I have ever watched. The airgear scenes look nice but everything else is horrible. This is no-budget tier animation.
>> ARTICLE
Most anime reserve their animation prowess for important episodes/scenes.  This one is more of a comedic relief so I guess they focused less on it.  The character development was still taken care of by some slideshows.  I think we can forgive the quality if and when it comes time to appreciate the high quality to come in the major battle scenes later.

The Titans would be doing mankind a favor by eating this guy

http://i.imgur.com/iIadJlw.jpg


Just kidding. But in all seriousness, he's *really* annoying.
>> ARTICLE
He's a coward that is hyper fearful, paranoid, and in a leadership role. He should be eaten asap.
>> ARTICLE
You can't prove you are not a demon. Fuck that logic

>> ARTICLE
I facepalmed and said "oh great, THIS guy is in charge"
>> ARTICLE
You're damn right he's annoying.
>> ARTICLE
I think he should be eaten. That guy's a coward.
>> ARTICLE
This guy looked crazy from the start
>> ARTICLE
I think that THIS guy is the real antagonist of the series. Not the titans. 
>> ARTICLE
I think many characters (WTF Armin!! How is this guy "brilliant"?) and parts of the plot are REALLY annoying! There's no single reason why they should kill Eren and the others. WTF.

Anyway, I'm watching it.
>> ARTICLE
>There's no single reason why they should kill Eren and the others.

You know the part about him turning into a titan and crushing about 20 titans until he finally "died" tends to scare the foot soldiers who die against normal titans.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but he killed a dozen titans! What about that?
>> ARTICLE
He's a titan/human that's enough for them to fear him.
>> ARTICLE
..without thinking. Why wouldn't they observe and use some basic logic?
>> ARTICLE
You know when people are terrified they tend to forget about the whole logic stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that, but they are terrified *all the time*. At least the guards have to have *some* guts. 
>> ARTICLE
If you keep watching or read the manga, you'll see that the guys who have guts are usually in the scouting legion.
>> ARTICLE
Hes on my list of 'one of the most annoying and hateful characters' 
>> ARTICLE
I still can't believe that a high-ranking commander of the military wouldn't see the *immediate usefulness* of having a person that can transform into a titan at will. It's obvious that Eren is their *only* hope!
>> ARTICLE
And where is this Pixie guy? He seemed to have his shit together.
>> ARTICLE
He was in the capital when he heard news of the attack. He might still be on his way there.
>> ARTICLE
Mostly he's scared shitless, not thinking rationally...
>> ARTICLE
Like, what the hell? "Oh this guy said he was human and this girl who we can't afford to lose is right next to him. Let's just kill them all for NO REASON!!"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah dude... the whole episode, I was thinking, 'oh god, somebody please kill this bearded fuck. Or at least shut him up.' 
>> ARTICLE
Is he the same guy as the commander who abandoned the rest of his squad or something to flee to safety during the fall of Wall Maria? And when they were like "No, please stay with us!" he threatened to punish them on accounts of treason, right? 
>> ARTICLE
Yes that's him.
>> ARTICLE
What a dick. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, same asshole.
>> ARTICLE
That explains my immediate distaste for him.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap

[Did Eren just transform into a Titan at will?! ](http://i.imgur.com/jELtZns.jpg)

 Also, this reminds me, in the first episode that Colossal Titan appeared out of nowhere and destroyed the wall. As far as we know it might have been another human who can transform into a Titan at will. Boy oh boy 
>> ARTICLE
Notice how they're both skinless as well, that could be a clue to this. O:
>> ARTICLE
What if the Colossal Titan is a Dr. Jeckell/Mr Hyde type thing?

I mean, suddenly Eren's dad has this magic potion that can make Eren turn into a Titan?

DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE CAPITAL HAS BEEN WORKING IN SECRET TO MAKE TITANS?!

Don't worry I've never read the manga. /u/iokau is correct in saying it's an NGE reference. Ever since the appearance of Titan-Eren some people, myself included, have pointed out similarities to NGE.
>> ARTICLE
After episode eight, I've described *Titan* to friends as, "*Evangelion*, without the fan-service."
>> ARTICLE
pretty much... unless we start getting female titan shifters...
>> ARTICLE
Come on, dude, if that even happens, do you really think they'd make a female titan *pleasant* to look at? Or put the woman/girl/whatever in a plug suit?

Sakes alive this series is like *Game of Thrones* heart wrenching with none of the nudity. What *would* fan-service be for this series? Killing all the characters in one episode, then a cliffhanger, then revealing that (most) of them are alive? Making a character lose all their limbs, but stay alive in terrible agony? The fat chess dude gets drawn and quartered?

Fanservice is in some distant land that the Titans are hoarding all for themselves, filled with high schools and underdone toast.

...Oh, wait. I'm stupid.

 Potatoes.

[*That* was it. This is our one and only source of fan service. No, not the character (well, yes, the character) just this one frame. That's it. That's all you get.](http://blog-imgs-51.fc2.com/y/a/r/yaraon/1366554953950.jpg)

>> ARTICLE
Maybe the transformation relies on how much damage Eren takes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to take a wild guess here and say the fact that he emerged from a titan the first time he transformed had to do with it. If Eren turned into a titan, and he covered in Titan fluid (which has regenerative properties), then wouldn't the liquid help him too?
>> ARTICLE
He also could have been worn out from having been in titan form for so long before, and doing so much fighting, maybe he wasnt strong enough to fully transform again?
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively, maybe Eren's not completely in control of the ability yet, hence the partial transformation.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was thinking, too.
>> ARTICLE
One of the highlights of this episode was that magnificent [falcon punch](http://i.imgur.com/S92pPAE.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
Such a glorious punch it melted his own hand right off.
>> ARTICLE
This episode really just flew by for me.  There wasn't any action but it still kept me on the edge of my seat.  The fear on everyone's faces were superb, the emotions are really well drawn out in this anime and you can really tell what people are feeling through their faces.  My first impression of Levi was that he was just a hard ass and could care less about any of his comrades.  I'm glad to see that is not the case for him, I'm sure he will be a wonderful character to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just going to ask this here since you're near the top and mentioned the character: Is it "Rivaille" or "Levi"? I thought it was pretty much interchangeable (see "Redo" and "Ledo" for Gargantia), but a friend is mine is pretty adamant about convincing me "Levi" is the only name he can go by.    
I looked it up and the katakana is , which is literally like, "Ribaai" kind of sounds like rib-eye, so I don't see why "Rivaille" is so wrong?    
  

tl;dr how did people get "Rivaille" from ??
>> ARTICLE
It isn't wrong necessarily.  It shows on MyAnimeList.net as Levi "Rivaille, Lance Corporal" Also, on the wiki page it says Rivaille is his actual name but Levi is the romanized version of it.  So I guess you can say it is interchangeable.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm just going to call him Rivaille just because it looks cooler. :p  
I'm wondering how they got Rivaille out of  though? Regardless, as long as people know what character you're referring to, I don't see why a difference in romanization is such a big deal. :p As long as the romanization isn't completely wrong, like calling him "Rob" or something... XD 

>> ARTICLE
The romanization is Levi because Word of God said so. I don't know why the scanlation teams decided to go with Rivaille but I think it sounds similar to the pronunciation of . Besides, it's French and kind of cool. 
>> ARTICLE
>because Word of God said so.  
  
I..don't get it? D: Is that a reference to something? ><  
Rivaille is french? Interesting, now that you mention it, I suppose it is~
>> ARTICLE
Word of God = The creater. I don't have the source, tbh, but Isayama-san said once that the romanization for  should be "Levi"." 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, gotcha. Weird how the scanlation teams still stuck with Rivaille, though.  
 Ah well, I'm so used to typing "Rivaille" I'm just going to stick with it. (Plus it looks cool lol) I pronounce it the same, so I guess it ultimately doesn't matter much. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, same here. I'm also more used to Rivaille. I'm pretty sure the scanlation team stuck with Rivaille for consistency, which is totally cool with me.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely went by quickly. When Eren transformed and the episode ended I was in disbelief that the whole episode had showed already...Great storytelling. I'm fighting the urge to read the manga right now :|
>> ARTICLE
It felt as if he was faking it the whole time to make his reputation and image better, guess we'll find out.
>> ARTICLE
So far I have nothing but respect for Levi. He is an outstanding soldier. Let's hope he stay that way
>> ARTICLE
I can agree it flew right by. At the end and the ED came on, I just sat there and thought "H-How was that 20 minutes? Wasn't it only five?!"

Normally that would bug me, but this pulls it off JUST right!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really thought it was gonna go the other way, with him being introduced as a neat-freak and all. Like maybe he wipes the other soldier's hand first and then reluctantly grabs it or something. Glad to see he's not an asshole. 
>> ARTICLE
I was literally like: "Will he shake that hand? Will he say the right words?" That was some awesome relation to the character that was just introduced. Really. 
>> ARTICLE
And also introducing him as the clean freak and grabbing the blood covered hand as even more emphasis
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought he was going to be cold-hearted and smack away his hand and say "Don't touch me." but I was pleasantly surprised.

I like this guy.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought that when he asked "Is he dead? Did he hear my last words?", he was going to follow up with "Good. Now he'll never know he wasn't useful."

I'm so glad that didn't happen.
>> ARTICLE
I believe he was still thinking it though.

He's cold and calculating, but not so cold as to let his men die believing they weren't useful
>> ARTICLE
That's a good theory, I like it. I'm eager to see his character development.

After reading the manga up to the latest release, I still have more questions than answers :)

Still, the anime does a good job of setting the tone and suspense, although I don't think reading the manga spoils any of that. In fact, it's made me want and anticipate the anime more, I really want to see how they animate key scenes and relive those scenes played out in the Manga. 

It's going to be an exciting series, thats for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice that when Eren bit his hand and turned into a titan, there was a burst of orange electricity? There was also a burst of orange electricity when the colossal titan showed up when it broke the second wall, so that makes me think that the colossal titan is also able to shift from a human to a titan.

Do you not see "SPOILERS" written in the link?

He wrote spoilers that go almost to where the manga is currently right now. NOT THE ANIME. This is **ANIME ONLY THREAD** which means if you have spoilers from the manga, keep it to yourself which that last guy didn't.

SPOILERS in an episode discussion thread applies only up to and including that episode and that medium. Spoiler tagging additional sources and anything not covered in that medium is both common fucking courtesy overall and implicit from the fact that it's also an "Anime Only Thread".

What are you talking about? This happens in the episode in the anime that we're discussing.

What are YOU talking about? Did you even read the comment that got deleted? It had nothing to do with the current episode. If someone read that comment, it would've ruined so many plot twists and secrets that they would not enjoy this anime.

oh you mean that, no i didn't read that, it had already been deleted. Thought you were talking about the original comment not one off the replies. Well guess i'm wrong, sorry :D

I thought so. Good that got cleared up. No harm no foul. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure they were manga spoilers, the name of this thread refers to the episode spoilers.

They were anime spoilers, i've watched the episode and this happens so it's only anime spoiler.

there was a flash when he broke the 1st wall too right?
>> ARTICLE
Or you could read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Then maybe that colossal titan is that old badass guy who was playing chess with the fat guy? Haven't read manga I swear.
>> ARTICLE
and the legion left to be on the outside that morning too, so the colossal titan must be someone from the legion or some straggler outside the walls.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually an extremely good point O_o

Good catch
>> ARTICLE
oh damn. that explains why they just vanish into thin air.
>> ARTICLE
You are right. But one thing stays unclear then. Why haven't other titans attacked the Colossal titan if he transformed from human to titan. When Eren has transformed into a titan, the first titan that saw him, attacked him without hesitation. I sense some conspiracy.
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed
>> ARTICLE
Interestingly, ee see the Colossal Titan attack right after Dr. Jaeger leaves Eren. Because of the "injection"/hope for humanity type speaking he did in the episode, this might be wrong, but could Dr. Jaeger possibly be the Colossal Titan?

Just a thought.
>> ARTICLE
Why would he attack where his family was located 5 years ago though? Or are there multiple Colossals?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, going by the tear-filled eyes as he injected Eren (and that scene where he's rushing somewhere presumably after hearing his home town has been hit) I would say that Jaeger probably isn't the colossal titan.

But in the meantime: *what's in the fucking basement?*
>> ARTICLE
What I want to know is when the whole Eren-injection/key-handover scene took place.
>> ARTICLE
When i watched it i thought it has to by right after his mother died. After losing wall maria. Cuz he says something like "you need to reclaim wall maria and get to the basement. But now that i think about that even in ep 1 eren has nightmares. So mayby Jaeger predicted attack of collosal titan and losing maria wall and injection was actualy before he left.
>> ARTICLE
Eren has a line where he says "You haven't been the same since mum died!" (or something to that effect) in that dream sequence, so it leads me to believe it was at some point between Wall Maria falling and where we meet up with the three children again.
>> ARTICLE
Oh you are right. But problem is how the hell did they met? I would thought it was just few days after losing maria wall and you would think he would by with mikasa and aramin.

Edit: Oh i got it! This was actualy a dream where his dad says "You haven't been the same since mum died!". This dream was influenced by what he could not remember cuz the injection caused memory loss. But it still affected his dreams.

Reminds me of the of this green electricity type of field surrounding Mikasa before she killed the kidnapper with more power then a kid should have even destroying the floor while starting to jump for him...

Even the investigators wondered if she really did that...

Was Erens father @Ackersmanns before the incident?
>> ARTICLE
No, the green electricy effect is shown on people who have gained total control of themselves. 
>> ARTICLE
Where else?
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it was in the scene in the mess hall where Eren realized why the blonde chick whose name I can't remember kicked his ass. 
>> ARTICLE
[Looks to be so.](http://i.imgur.com/ZZcSL5p.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Its funny, my theory relies on a completely unrelated movie. Pacific Rim is coming this summer, its tagline is **"To fight monsters we created monsters"**. In the trailers they talk about **The Jaeger Program** being the project that created the giant mech suits to fight the aliens. I think it matches up.

I think Dr. **Jaeger**, Eren's father, was part of a project to turn people into titans to be a weapon against the titans, and I think Colossal and Armored were the first two that managed to be able to transform, but for some reason either went crazy or decided to side against humanity. There's more evidence this episode because of Eren's flashback to his father. **"This power will be useful to you at that time"** as he holds a syringe and walks toward Eren. Its fairly obvious Eren's father gave him Titan powers, but I think he did colossal and armored too.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with that, but im pretty sure the similarities in Jaeger stems from Jaeger simply meaning "Hunter" in German (Actually after a bit of googleing it turns out Jaeger is actually middle German for hunter and is a word still common to both English and German, though probably about as used as Eoten). And its more than likely to be a coincidence, unless there is some sort of old myth / story that they are both based off that I am missing...
>> ARTICLE
This would explain how the colossal titan somehow appears out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
Could that explain how it escapes eren in their first fight? 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm maybe the colossal titan knows how to use his human-titan powers a bit more so he can turn back into a human without leaving a massive body thing behind like Eren did when he turned back into a human in episode 8. So yeah I guess it does explain how it escapes.
>> ARTICLE
So... gathering from who knows more about what's happening in the world, a possible situation would be that Eren's father is the colossal titan. If that turns out to be true, i wonder why he would do that. His actions would have caused the death of his wife and almost Erens. O.O

ARGGH, I need longer episodes and less cliffhangers, also this anime should be longer, like 64 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
How long is it going to be?
>> ARTICLE
2cour so roughly 25

Edit: for classification yes it will be carried over to the next season
>> ARTICLE
The manga is not over yet so there's not enough material for 64 episodes. At the moment people are saying that 25 will probably catch up to the manga at the current rate. 
>> ARTICLE
Ehhh, if it keeps up the current pace, and avoid an original ending, then I think it'll end a good 10 chapters earlier than where it's at now. 
>> ARTICLE
I seriously hope that they don't pull out a different story out of their ass, I want them to follow the manga.

They shouldn't pull a Fullmetal Alchemist imo.

The problem however is, that the manga is coming out monthly, if they really try to stay true to the manga, they would have to make 1-2 years pause, if the manga goes on for another 20-30 chapters.

[That transformation scene](http://i.imgur.com/K5Ih4VH.gif)
>> ARTICLE
So much kudos for whoever did this gif this quickly
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how he just knew to do that
>> ARTICLE
I think emotion plays a huge role in recalling that one particular memory with his father. Emotion in general is a really strong tool for remembering stuff(Tragic events, happy shit, etc). 

So I would imagine right at the moment when you have a fucking cannon about to blow up your friends, I would imagine it must of sparked that memory eren had with his father during that injection scene.
>> ARTICLE
His dad said something about "Their memories will teach you how to use it", whatever that means. So maybe the injection came with instructions in the form of memories or something. *shrug*
>> ARTICLE
Memories... from Titans maybe? Whatever it is the answer is kept in the basement. We'll be seeings episodes where the three will try to make their way back to their home with or without the help of others.

Also this might just be a wild guess but is there any chance that the Titans were once human and some event turned them into what they are? Though earlier episodes showed us that the Titans existed before humans did(well at least the surviving ones in the present).
>> ARTICLE
I was also wondering if the Titans were somehow related to humans, or once were human. 
>> ARTICLE
I think titans were either from humans or some kind of fleshy exosuit.

And I remember that titans came after humans.

*from memory and not complete in context, might have been mixed with avatar...*

>Then Humans were placed at the bottom of the food chain.

Or something like that.

And now I'm thinking about the avatar opening in attack on titan setting...
>> ARTICLE
They can't simply be exosuits, as Eren exploded into his titan form from inside another titan.  So it is more than just an exosuit.  Biological warfare from the past went haywire and relegated mankind to their current condition.  Is my best guess so far.
>> ARTICLE
Let me rephrase:

>exosuit-esk

along with the bio part, its either that or a experiment gone wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It makes sense that their only weak spot is the back of the neck and happens to be the same spot Eren came out of last episode
>> ARTICLE
Maybe, but you'd think they would have noticed that there are people in there.
>> ARTICLE
Notice when Eren gets out of his Titan body there's flesh attached to his face and hands? Maybe after centuries the people have *fused* with the their titan bodies, making them pretty much indistinct. This might also explain the lack of intelligence in most of the titans, the pilots lack intelligence since they've lost their human bodies.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent point.

Can I just say that Levi had the best establishing character moment? Like, whoa. You hate getting dirty, and yet you... Whoa. That was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if he's actually sincere, though. I kept expecting him to sneer when the guy died, but I wonder if he's just internalizing it to keep up morale in front of the girl.
>> ARTICLE
But later he pulled out the "did my men die for nothing??"-card, making me  believe he really is a cool guy.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting him to do that as well, but whether he did it for the guy, the girl or himself, I still think it was amazing that he didn't mind getting his hand dirty without cleaning them on-screen. 
>> ARTICLE
That would be the typical archetype for his type of character, and I expected it too.

So  happy that he was kind in the end though. I'm interested to see how his character grows. 

Even if it was an act, to put aside your disdain to comfort a dying man for no benefit to yourself is truly good.
>> ARTICLE
Fear causes people to act desperately. I'm not sure what answer the commander was looking for when he was asking Eren if he was human or titan... If he answers titan, then that is as good as saying he's a mole for the titans and infiltrated humanity (which Eren isn't... probably). If he answers human, the commander doesn't believe him anyway because people saw Eren coming out of the nape of the titan. With either answer, the commander would've given the signal for the shot.

Mikasa is badass, though. "My specialty is tearing through flesh. If necessary, I am willing to demonstrate at any time. If anyone would like to experience it firsthand, I invite them to be the first to approach." And I like how she just picks up Eren to scale the wall... not just grabbing his hand and tugging him towards the wall, but just a toss over the shoulder like he was a bag of potatoes.

Hanji was also super fun to watch. Just her playfulness and enthusiasm... ah~ I'm looking forward to seeing more of Levi's squad in the upcoming episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the scene where Mikasa held out her blades in a challenge to everyone else. What a stone-cold badass. 
>> ARTICLE
He wasn't truly *asking*, just voicing his and everyone else's fear.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... It didn't really matter what Eren's answer was.
>> ARTICLE
Eren just pulled a Gear 3 and turned into a Susanoo!
>> ARTICLE
I knew I'd seen that incomplete giant somewhere before!
>> ARTICLE
And that commander never thought as a titan-shifter, he could do it in front of them at any moment...

Also why can't that fucker die already?
>> ARTICLE
He probably think the mechanism to change into titan is a lot slower
>> ARTICLE
This is correct. He explicitly stated in the episode "We won't give you enough time to transform"

Eren showed him.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I dunno if skinless one-eyed one-armed torso titan is as big a threat as the last Eran-titan was. I imagine out of shock/recognition of non-aggression they won't be instantly following up, but no reason to think they couldn't kill Eren pretty easily right now.

Hell he does not even know how the fuck it happened or if it could happen again.

He's probably going to get humiliated.

Then he'll die.

This is exactly what I was expecting to happen: everyone, and Eren himself, freaking out once they see what Eren really is. 

A lot of others have said that the power gap between Titans and humans will drop too much if Eren can control his transformation, which that last sequence proved he can to at least some degree. I doubt it's quite that easy - the author would be an idiot to reduce the stakes this early in the game. My guess is that both physical damage and mental stress/sense of danger is a factor in when he can transform; obviously Eren will have gotten hurt or tasted his own blood at some earlier point during training camp considering how strenuous it is yet didn't transform. In both cases where he did transform, he was either mental stressed or full of rage (how he figured out that biting his thumb would do it is a mystery).

Regardless, I don't think he'd be a very effective weapon for the human military against the Titans since the transformation appears to need such specific conditions to activate - what's the point of a gun if you can't choose when to fire it?

I'm really surprised that Levi is actually such a good guy - my initial impression of him had been that he was one of those aggressive yet moody limp-haired aces who didn't really give a shit about other people, like Accelerator or pre-Shippuden Neji. Now he seems like a calmer, more leader-like future Eren. I definitely want to see more of him.

Also, fuck, did Eren lose his left arm *again?* Kid can't catch a break (although he can catch a cannonball).     

Edit: P.S. Please keep manga spoilers out, or at *least* tag them. I haven't read the manga yet, and I don't intend to until after the second cour finishes. If I could keep my self control in the Oreimo threads and not say anything about [Oreimo EP 8 spoiler](/s "Kuroneko dropping Kyousuke like it was hot before episode 8 aired"), then believe in me who believes y'all can do the same for SnK. And no, this isn't directed at anyone in particular, don't worry. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that he didn't transform before because the Titan cells/DNA/whatever that got injected into him needed a catalyst from a living Titan...blood, stomach acids, something like that that needed to come into contact with an open wound. After he got eaten, his severed arm allowed the Titan in him to "activate"
>> ARTICLE
But then how did he transform the second time? He made that wound in his thumb using his teeth, but there was indication that there was Titan blood/body fluid on his lips that could have gotten in that wound. 
>> ARTICLE
**Everything I'm saying is completely speculation btw**

Maybe its a one-time thing? It needed to be activated one time and now there's a certain trigger for it?  Although I'm not sure how he knew what the trigger was
>> ARTICLE
He got the catalyst the same time he transformed. I'm assuming that, because of that, he got enough Titan germs as to become a catalyst himself. (No idea if I'm wrong though).
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why everyone is saying that he's too overpowered when he was definitively defeated in EP8. 

Self-control or not.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that he's too small even in Titan form to be much of a threat to mega-Titan, and probably couldn't take on Armored Titan either considering he destroys his hands just punching a normal 30m class Titan.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps the size scale from mega-titan to titan-erin is similar in proportion to normal-titan and human-erin?

That of course means they'll need to make him titan sized swords and 3D maneuver gear to deal with it! 

Just so long as they don't go gurren lagann and get bigger by another magnitude, everything's good.

So..... if THIS power is possible, that can only mean that there is someone else is the big giant titan transformed from a human with same power (with lack of skin).  This will explain the insta-appearance and disappearance when Eren tried to kill it.

The question now is, who is it, and why is he doing it?  Could all the titans be altered human?
>> ARTICLE
Another possibility is that maybe they aren't the only survivors. Maybe there's anohter city somewhere who knows slightly more about the Titans than they do, and are attacking. For some reason.

shhhhhh, no logic here.

Because it's hard to do gigantic undergroud cities, + how do you get food underground?

They need to farm food above ground.
>> ARTICLE
better question, when the massive titan appeared, why didn't they make the walls slightly taller?

>> ARTICLE
He kicked the door in. Not sure what could solve that.
>> ARTICLE
no, remember the Massive titan like...pulled the wall down. Its the armored titan that kicks the door in.
>> ARTICLE
I thought about this before too. I believe it would make the most sense to say that when the first built the city, they didn't have any underground farming technology, so it was necessary to keep the territories above ground.

After a few decades or so, they probably just didn't have enough resources to dig underground anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense. Just find it odd they don't utilize everything for you're quite limited in space.

Once thing I want to find out is how the fuck did they build those walls so high in the first place. The amount of stone and maintenance seems impossible.
>> ARTICLE
...I think the real question to ask about that is "How would that have helped?" 

"How's this big ass Titan going to break into this underground city?"

*JUMP*

"Oh..."
>> ARTICLE
Depends on the depth you dig.
>> ARTICLE
Because then there probably wouldnt be a show...or if there were then the show would be called Attack on Lagan lol. I do think that there should have been an emergency contingency plan like an emergency tunnel exit.
But seriously, I wonder if there might be other unknown cities outwith the walled city, that have adapted to underground cities etc.
>> ARTICLE
I assume you never had rowdy people in the room above you?

Cause holy fuck can you imagine all the noise titans will make just by walking around?

Also I can see issues of claustrophobia, health, stress and safety. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still trying to figure out how they managed to build that massive city while the titans were attacking them near the brink of extinction
>> ARTICLE
100 years of peace I guess.
>> ARTICLE
An underground city is pretty hard to make, we (in real life) haven't made an underground city yet, I don't think they could do it in the SnK universe with their tech. They could make tunnels or something, which would be interesting, although we don't know how the titans can tell that humans are in their presence-- it could be sight, smell, or even some sort of supernatural "sensing" ability, which would kind of render the tunnels useless). 
>> ARTICLE
[Actually](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derinkuyu_Underground_City) it can be done, just probably not titan-proofed.
>> ARTICLE
What would they use for food while underground?

I guess in TTGL they herded pigs, but in this kind of series that's going for some semblance of realism I don't think that would fly.
>> ARTICLE
Because 100 years of peace
>> ARTICLE
And then the Titan nation attacked?
>> ARTICLE
I believe Eren can save the world!
>> ARTICLE
If a titan ever broke into the underground city, then their weapons and tech become nearly useless. That's why they had to plan so elaborately to beat the titans that were in the gas room
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't they just make the rooms too small for a titan to fit through?
>> ARTICLE
There are still 3m class ones. Its pretty damn difficult to live where buildings and ceilings are shorter than 10 feet
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, I was thinking mostly of the 15m titans.

I can't stand these cliffhangers. It's physically hurting me...

The song that played when Eren's mother was being eaten has come back. Instead of loss, it now heralds his rage.
>> ARTICLE
Mother fucking Levi
>> ARTICLE
Really great follow-up to last week's episode. The music when Levi was kicking ass was pretty awesome, too (*If someone who's better at searching than me find that song, I'd be eternally grateful*). A nice mix of epic music and rock tunes when the action gets pumping.

[Kind of a simple shot, but I really liked this little scene from Levi.](http://imgur.com/hcOtcTe)

Also, that whole slo-mo at the end. Damn, every episode's got me wanting for more. More titan-killing action! More badass moments! More of this pretty sweet tragic story!

FUCK THAT WAS SOOO SICK.......FUCKING IM SO ECSTATIC RIGHT NOW
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Hi Tieria!
>> ARTICLE
Does Eren's transformation remind anyone of the "Awakened State" of Eva 01 in Evangelion?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, especially with all the stomping and the biting/ripping necks out with his teeth...in fact, the titans in general are pretty similar to evangelions as a whole-- relatively lanky, humanoid beings of mysterious origin. And some of them come with berserk modes. And now, it seems that they can be "piloted," I suppose the word is (or at least Eren was piloting/controlling/became one). 
>> ARTICLE
I think its interesting how Eren's transformation was for the safety of his of Aramin and Mikasa. That titan is new, granted it shares similarities to the wall buster titan, but if you look at it, its built for protecting them. I wonder if he can choose the titan/form or (as suggested in this thread) the cannonball just interrupted the transformation. Should the cannonball theory be correct, I just want to know what he was gonna do to get them out of his lungs before he went back to human.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking that the soldiers were acting OVERLY precarious of eren, but then I rewatched it and was wondering if they heard everything he was saying during the clips of being a titan which is why armin looked so shocked and every one else did.

Also, the sound track is fucking amazing, re watch it specifically listening to the music and ou'll be blown away.

The flashback to Eren's father explaining the serum seemed to be directly inspired by Kiefer Sutherland's serum-induced monologue to Rufus Sewell's character at the very end of Dark City (1998). In fact, this is all starting to seem very Dark City.

Another week.. 
>> ARTICLE
So! Lotta questions this week. Eren's back, and was either controlling or actually became the fabulous-haired Titan. He's apparently regenerated, as well. Where are they going with this?

Well, we certainly have clues  in particular, the foreshadowing from the first couple episodes is looking to finally become relevant. That shot of the syringe, his father talking about showing Eren whatever craziness goes on in their basement... obviously they didn't include those moments for shits and giggles. Some crazy science has been done to Eren, and I'm guessing in the semi-near future that will likely be investigated. I can't remember if we know what happened to Eren's father, either  as I recall, he was last reported missing, right? So that and the basement itself are two valid threads to follow, and the idea of our squad performing a stealth investigative mission deep into Titan-controlled territory sounds pretty awesome.

But first our heroes should probably deal with all those fucking Titans wobbling around. Let's get to it!

**Episode 9**

2:57  Another flashback? Jeez.

It must be tough figuring out how to balance a show with this much exposition  one full episode of backstory, Titan attack. Two full episodes of training and character-introducing, Titan attack. Etc. I'm not sure this show (or manga, I guess, depending on how loyal they're being to the source) has quite gotten the balance right yet  I'd like to see more of the information we receive portrayed in a more organic way, and not through direct monologues or flashbacks

3:14  I guess we've found Sasha's big sister?

4:26  Haha, damn, this guy gets his own theme song? Looks like we got a badass here

6:00  Man, this episode's like an AMV of itself

7:15  Damn! I mean, doing spinning flips and killing titans to J-rock is cool and all, but that was an actually nice little you did good, soldier speech he whipped out! I might actually like this character

8:25  Now *here's* the flashback we've been waiting for...

8:48  That's pretty brutal  any soldier who gets swallowed whole gets to die in digestive fluids, surrounded by dead friends serving as reminders of how hopeless their fight is. Cheery!

9:19  The mystical flashback within a flashback. *We need to go deeper*

10:06  I'll kill them with my own hands! With your own *hand*, Eren. Let's not lose sight of the important things, like dismemberment

11:35  So it seems like he is pretty berserky in Titan mode. Probably for the best, story-wise

Also, is it just me, or is [this Armin's default expression?](http://i.imgur.com/I8erCzw.jpg ) Your face is gonna get stuck like that, Armin

12:49  Again, that exposition pacing... I like how the end of the flashback immediately jumps to the next relevant moment in the story, but, I mean, how valuable was that Eren flashback in the first place? We learned Eren became a titan. Which we already knew. I guess we learned that he still kinda consciously controls it? That doesn't seem worth a full flashback for, though. Most of the flashback was dedicated to Eren's despair in the titan  maybe that's key because him becoming a titan is dependent on an incredibly desperate emotional state, or something? I guess that could justify it...

14:50  I guess I might also be misinterpreting the pacing of this episode because I assumed the last episode wasn't actually the all-clear sign for the battle of Trost... but yeah, actually, the only conflict propelling the last couple episodes was the need for fuel to retreat to safety, so I guess they figured this cooldown phase is the best time to both introduce characters and get flashbacks/exposition out of the way. It still feels kinda uneven to me

15:12  Man, you don't have to *tell* us the balance between Mikasa, Eren, and Armin. Give the audience a *little* credit here

16:08 - Don't understand the question? *That's just what a titan would say!* Fuckin' bureaucracy man

17:58  It's nice that someone actually acknowledges picking fights with Mikasa probably won't end well for humanity in general

19:18 - ARE YOU AN EOTEN. *Come on, Eren, you KNOW this one!*

20:17  Bam, there we go. Basement mission established

**And Done**

Whew! What a finale! Man, that whole episode I was pretty lukewarm on the pacing and heavy exposition, and then that last scene combines a high-tension action scene with a critical flashback that furthers the central mystery of the show and the journey of the main character at once, as if to prove to me the show just didn't feel like being fast-paced earlier.

Eren displayed some pretty crazy control over his titanification at the end there, basically making just enough of a titan to be a shield for Armin/Mikasa. Once again, I'll be interested to see how well they can maintain stakes now that Eren essentially has a superpower, and what limits they might impose to keep up the tension. Next week should be pretty interesting.

Levi is a total badass, but notice that song also played in ep. 3, when it shows Eren first using the 3DMG. An orchestral version also plays in ep. 8, when Eren-Titan notices the abnormal that ate Thomas, and charges at him.

Ok hypothesis time. I get the feeling that Eren transforms when he ingest his own blood and it happened the first time from him missing two limbs. it could also just be from ingesting human blood in general as he was sitting in a giant vat of human blood inside of the titan.

I think what most interested me in this episode was during the flashback Dr. Jaeger said something about the others' memories being able to help Eren. Also I want to know what's up with the woman next to that jerk commander who herself didn't seem to be shitting herself like everyone else was. What's her story?
>> ARTICLE
She's appeared before already. I think she's a side character who keeps appearing every now and then when there are events pictured with no main characters around.
>> ARTICLE
I knew Levi was cool but seeing it animated is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
"Wow, that commander is annoying. But I'm sure Eren will be able to clear things up with them and everything will be just fi-TRANSFORMATION!
>> ARTICLE
**THEORY TIME!!!**

**(1)**  Dr. Jaeger was in charge of some project (either *[a]* orchestrated by the human government or *[b]* something entirely of his own personal effort) to create Titans for the purpose of fighting the real Titans off.  *This is less a theory, and more an obvious conclusion from this most recent episode.*

If **(1)**, then other abnormals are likely the result of this.  This is enforced by the "disappearance" of the Colossal Titan being so similar to Eren's transformation.  Also, the Colossal Titan had the intelligence to attack the cannons and break open the wall, and the Armored Titan had the intelligence to attack the gate.  That goes against the apparent mindlessness of Titans.  I feel that this lends itself to *[a]* more readily than *[b]*, because character development of Dr. Jaeger makes the idea that this immense crippling of human society is essentially his fault a bit too much to swallow.  Furthermore, the negative light in which the aristocracy is shown lends itself to them being responsible for more crap as we move further into the story.

**(2)** I considered the possibility that Dr. Jaeger is, himself, the Colossal Titan, and perhaps also the Armored Titan.

If **(2)**, then Dr. Jaeger is doing this for one of two reasons: *[i]* he has lost control of this ability (Jekyll&Hyde-esque) or *[ii]* he is trying to fix the problems with humanity by forcing change upon it.  *[ii]* seems very unlikely, again because of the apparent morality of Dr. Jaeger thus far.  *[i]* is not only more reasonable for an explanation if **(2)** is true, but it also opens up for the possibility of *[b]* being true over *[a]* (though I still prefer the latter).

**(3)** "Their memories" refers to either Titans, the humans ingested by Titans, or whatever lies in that basement.  While some are saying that it's the Titans' memories, I find that the senselessness of all Titans other than some abnormals makes that a stretch.  The ingested humans idea comes from the fact that Eren first transformed after hearing the cries of another ingested human.  That triggered memories of his mother, but may connected on a less coincidental level.  I personally think that this being said in reference to whatever lies in that basement is the most reasonable explanation at this point.

**(4)** Despite whether *[a]* or *[b]* is true, somehow the responsibility to try to do something to save humanity landed on Dr. Jaeger.  Thus, he imparted the power to save humanity to his only offspring in a Naruto-esqu fashion.  I feel that this further strengthens the argument for *[a]*, since both the idea of Jekyll creating another Hyde to combat himself and the idea of setting his son against himself while in total control of the turmoil offer major logic problems (which would be bad for someone smart enough to be called doctor).

**(5)** There is an *obvious* set-up that Eren and Levi will face-off at some point.  The real question is whether it will end in death or in an alliance.

**(6)** The inter-human relationship strains are becoming far more significant.  It's much like zombie movies:  all have zombies, but the good ones deal with conflict amongst the humans even more.  That being said, I feel that the story will climax in a showdown (likely involving **(5)**) between the chaotic good of our protagonist(s) and the lawful good/evil (grunts/aristocrats) of the human government.  The salvation of humanity from the Titans will be secondary to this, and probably end in the falling action (ep 25-ish).

**(7)** I want to point out the similarities between Eren sparking before he transformed and Mikasa sparking before stabbing the kidnapper in ep. 6.  While I think Mikasa's is more exclusively symbolic than Eren's, I think both demonstrate a sudden change in control of oneself and the subsequent ability to go above and beyond what they previously perceived as their limits.

**(8)** Apart from **(5)**, I want to address how I think other characters will act in the future.  Mikasa will be Mikasa, nuff said.  Armin will freak out over what just happened, but his loyalty to Eren and Mikasa will overcome that uncertainty within the next, say, 2 episodes.  Pretty much all the recruits who scored well, but followed Eren to the frontlines, will ally with him still (though they're all smart enough to only act "treasonous" when it becomes necessary).  Those who wanted so badly to be in the inner wall will mostly ally with the government unless convinced (not easily) that Eren is the righteous one to work with.  Jean will specifically struggle with whom to side with, but ultimately be convinced that Eren is not evil (this will be a big deal, given his ability to lead others in the right direction).  Pixis will eventually find that Eren is just (we've seen little of him, but his insistence on dealing with the attack instead of playing games with nobles shows a good morality).  Finally, [**THIS GUY**](http://i.imgur.com/iIadJlw.jpg) will be put in a near-death position where he will either be saved by Eren (convincing him of Eren's humanity), or **DIE A BRUTAL DEATH** as a result of his inability to trust him.

>> ARTICLE
Hey guys I'm about 3 months late to this but I think there are humans that have fused into the other titans. Think about it. Eren was in the weak spot of the titan. If someone were to slash across that spot, it would kill the human inside(thus killing the titan). Just my thoughts though but it seems very probable. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, they took one whole episode to do this part :|. However, I felt like they pulled it off perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
From what I hear they are fairly close to the manga already.. I honestly don't mind filler or a large break (similar to television series here in the US) so the manga can continue to plow forward. 
>> ARTICLE
The manga is released monthly, so by the time this reaches 20 something episodes, only about 3 new chapters will be released starting from now. And reading from the other post, some person said this manga is planned to have an additional 300 chapters or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of hoping that the popularity will make some people consider moving it from a monthly to a weekly schedule, but I have no idea if that's a thing that can happen. They have enough material at the moment for a second series if they carry on with the chapter per episode they're doing now but they they'll be stuck for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Even if there is enough popularity for the series to be moved to a weekly schedule (and I don't think that's so unlikely, seeing how the anime seems to have boosted the manga's sales ridiculously), there is still the question of whether or not the mangaka would be able to do this series weekly without a great loss in quality.
>> ARTICLE
It would depend on how much of the story they've already got planned out. I'd have thought that in the move to a weekly they'd get more assistants to help with the drawing.
>> ARTICLE
Probably, but I can guarantee you that "having story planned out" and "being able to bring it on paper", especially within a certain timeframe are two completely different things. While the second requires the first, the first doesn't necessarily lead to the second.
>> ARTICLE
Yeh, I can understand that but, I can dream.
>> ARTICLE
They're actually not that close. this episode covered chapters 9.5 (The bit at the start with Levi) and 10 out of 45. the anime would probably stop around chapter 27 if they keep going at this pace.
>> ARTICLE
I feel if they only get to around chapter 27, they will most likely have a second season because of how popular it is.
>> ARTICLE
Nah they should reach chapter 32 for the sake of finishing an arc

Edit: Oops, got my chapter count off. Yep 34 was the one I was thinking about
>> ARTICLE
Nah, push it all the way to 34, to ensure coverage of the most important cliffhanger that'll keep people wanting to see even more. 
>> ARTICLE
Go all the way to 34. Then with the increased popularity, make an OVA that covers the events up to chapter 46. Leave off on Giant Cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like the direction that this is going. I don't like that Eren can just turn into a Titan at will. I was hoping they would defeat the Titans as humans, not as Titans.
>> ARTICLE
*looks at Rivaille*.....

I don't think Eren Titan is that OP considering how the 1.6m class toyed with them with ease

Well i read the manga. And this shit is frame by frame manga to anime adaptation
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if there is any significance in why the commanders eyes are darkened throughout the episode? Is that a sign of fear? Or Uncertainty? 
>> ARTICLE
Probably a sign that they've been fighting Titans for years now. The stress of surviving and losing your comrades takes a toll. 
>> ARTICLE
True, or making unpopular decisions maybe? In one of the earlier episodes he abandons the supply depot with the same darkened eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
That too haha. You can tell he's not quite ... normal. 
>> ARTICLE
ahhh, good, I hoped it would be explained somehow.

 but he only formed a torso of bones this time.


 does the power deteriorate each time he uses it?!?!?


 . . . and how many of the titans were once human?



 This just took an even darker turn than the show originally had. I was kinda worried last week, but there was no need to be.

Around chapter 10. There are currently 45 chapters bro. You might expect fillers, if they get too close to the manga. Or they might go full potato and make their own version. Still the anime is quality.

Never go full potato.

Eren's father said that the walls of maria would be attacked....
>> ARTICLE
This is presumably after the initial Titan attack where Wall Maria was breached, that's why he is saying to Eren to retake it so that he can get to the basement.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain to me why the blood disappeared from Zoe's clothe right after she killed the titan? And the blood on Levi's hand/grip stayed?
>> ARTICLE
Titan blood disappears because Titans evaporate when dead; I'd assume the blood on Levi's hands was made to delay that with ~~artisticness~~ Titan Magic so that we see his disdain at the blood then we see him not care because of the soldier.
>> ARTICLE
Do we (according to the anime) know what happened to Eren's father? He left just before the invasion where Eren's mom died, and we've seen some faint memories or something of injections and telling him about the basement. Do we know what happened, though? Is he even alive? Did I miss something or is this deliberate?
>> ARTICLE
We know nothing. He definitively met him after wall Maria fell at some point...

~~Unless.... wait, it's possible that he met him before wall Maria was attacked. In episode 1, Eren wakes up and he's dreaming some strange stuff.~~ Disregard that, Eren mentions her mother being dead.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with many of you in many ways, especially /u/malakyoma. But, I don't think there's a conspiracy sort of thing with the names. But, I do believe that Eren discovered the power when he was some how alive in the Titan's stomach. But, it doesn't make sense to me that he could be both a colossal Titan and that other titan that was eaten. And also, seeing that Eren fought a colossal titan, I'm wondering if there's more than one. And as /u/A_Person_1 said, I think that the colossal titan can shift as well. But, who it is, is not yet known.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still wondering what the title means, "left arm's whereabouts" 
>> ARTICLE
Mmmm, I think the title is symbolizing his old arm as the humanity he has lost. A metaphor for "Eren's humanity whereabouts".

Noticing his regenerated left arm is what gave Eren the clue that he woke up being a different being, that something changed within him, and he wasn't as much human as before.
>> ARTICLE
Me the entire episode: Who the fuck is the seiyuu for Rivaille!? It sounds SO FAMILIAR...  
  
and then I kind of forgot about it, finished the episode and realized the most recent episode of One Piece finished downloading, so I started watching that...    
  
and in the middle of the episode, it clicked: FUCK, RIVAILLE IS LAW.    
My mind is at ease, now. 
>> ARTICLE
After reading through some of this I think the Eren's dad is definitly the colussus titan.

Why attack his own hometown then?

HOLY SHIT.

EDIT: Seeing everything in action was pretty cool. And turns out all the serum theories with Dr. Jaeger and Eren were correct in some or all ways.
>> ARTICLE
This episode went by so fast and was so good. It showed the conflict in their society and how paranoid they can be. Mikasa is once again badass x10000 willing to protect Eren while he's in "dafuq" mode. 

Although its somewhat understandable, that commander guy or w/e really ticked me off with his unreasonable attitude. He does not seem fit for his role.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that commander the guy that screwed up the operation by withdrawing support so they couldn't get the gas canisters they needed?  That guys a worthless coward.
>> ARTICLE
When you lived your entire life trapped by your own defensive structure in fear of creatures easily 3x ~ 10x your size, I think you'd be pretty quick to want to kill off someone who had the potential to transform into one of them. Without seeing all the backstory we're privy to, if you're in a position of power and you're being tasked with the responsibility of making big decisions, would you risk Wall Rose falling to some form of spy Titan taking the form of a boy, or would you want it dead?
>> ARTICLE
I served myself ice cream before watching this... 3 minutes in I stopped eating... and threw it away... poor ice cream


>> ARTICLE
I was disappointed in that whole biting himself for blood to do some awesome move. Reminded me of Naruto and I just facepalmed. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing, but I'm guessing Eren has to feel pain, bleed or both, as in, he needs the adrenaline they give in order to get the transformation going. I'm guessing this will be explained soon. 
>> ARTICLE
The first time Eren transformed he lost a hand and a leg. Maybe he needs to be injured to use his titan powers? Like some kind of self defense mechanism?
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm guessing. The transformation acts as a way for him not to get hurt further, but he needs to feel pain or get hurt somehow.

umm shingeki no kyojin means advancing/moving forward titans, which is referring to the titans advancing onto human territory. Shingeki no Kyojin is not a titan, and I'm not even sure that's how you would name a "charging titan" in japanese.

Good breather episode after last week.  I felt it was more slow paced and after the reveal its catching its breathe for next week.  Still well done but the standoff took forever and wish they would tie the advance party to the story as a whole (I guess next episode).  I did yell bullshit when the showed the transformation though.  Becoming a Titan at will just seems like a copout, I stand by it but liked the idea of titan jacking a bit more.

What was the purpose of showing us corporal Levi. He has not been important at all yet if he will be. Just wondering if I missed something or what.

He is second in command of the main force that is trained to kill titans and they showed him briefly to show what a huge difference him and his men could of made if they were there defending as the only people who were defending were the military police who hadn't fought titans for years and needless to say they were not prepared and were rather 'rusty'
>> ARTICLE
It confuses me that the human population is quite small yet they still have enough gunpowder and iron/steel

The reason he was important is they said the survey corp was out and thats why so many people died. They then showed off how skilled he was and how things might have been different with him there, thats his importance to this episode.

I'm not sure I like where they're going with this Eren-Titan business. If Eren really can turn into a Titan at any time, he's too overpowered. Plus, that'll change the focus of the show from squad/strategy-focused to pure Titan-on-Titan-stomping.

Titan Eren vs. 50m titan... no chance

Titan Eren with maneuver gear anyone?
>> ARTICLE
actually, the 50m titan doesn't seem to have too much maneuverability. Erin would have gotten a kill on the thing if it didn't use Hiraishin no Jutsu to teleport out of the way... it seems to be made for the sole purpose of taking down the walls, same as the armored titan, which can only run really fast and smash things. The whole Erin turining into a titan thing solidifying my idea that the titans are human -made biological weapons gone wrong at some point, so the idea of modification doesn't seem too extreme... but yeah, sans teleport, the big guy isn't that special

now for something completely different could it be that the armor and giant titan also have people in them? just a thought

That is pretty much what everyone is thinking now.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i know
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but notice how only half of his titan body regenerated from biting his thumb. Pretty sure that means that he'd have to face some serious damage to turn into a Titan. If any of the soldiers really wanted to, I'm pretty sure they could kill him in that exact moment. Plus, it's not like the Titan can't kill him in Titan form. As we saw in Episode 8, he was getting mauled on by a ton of Titans.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but once he got mauled and his Titan body disappeared, Eren himself was fine. Plus, we just saw that turning into a Titan wasn't a one-time thing. Seems to me that even if Eren's Titan body got destroyed, he can just get a new one. 
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily. I believe this episode opened up a new doorway of tensions between Eren, Armin, and Mikasa, against all the other people who are fearful that Eren is a monster. Fear has been a common motif throughout this series and it probably will stay that way for a while.

Thank you,I was worried to use the other tread for fear of spoilers.

Does anyone think Levi might also be an abberant Titan shifter. Who, like Eren, has gained control and hates other titans. From waht ive gatehred, the other titan shifters are all talented 3d gear users as well, it seems like Levi would be a strong candidate for a converted "mole".
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Its the same titan, just half-formed. If it had fully formed, odds are it would have killed Mikasa and Armin. He only really needed to form the arm and upper torso. How he had the degree of control, however, I dunno
>> ARTICLE
I think it's from the memories that his father implanted in him. In the mini-flashback sequence near the end his father says something like "let the memories tell you how to control this power."
>> ARTICLE
Didn't his father say something along the lines of "You won't remember any of this, but hopefully their knowledge will guide you when you need it"? This seems to imply that he isn't the first to have that power, and that there is some connection between he and whoever his father was talking about. Perhaps he "borrowed" the knowledge of how to partially transform into one from them, whoever they/he/it is. Almost has sort of a 'collective unconscious' tone to it. 
>> ARTICLE
He turned into what was left from the titan earlier. See how he does not have lower body? That's probably cuz his chest was fucked up at the end of ep7. He also does not have skin. Mayby he needs to eat some fucking titans or something to regenerate. Also look at the teeth. They are the same.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, but I can't buy this. At the beginning of his transformation, you see his arm shoot up, but the previous incarnation of Eren-Titan didn't have either of his arms. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I don't know i'm just starting discussion. After i rewatched this i though mayby transformation is partial cuz that's the only thing he needed. A ribcage to protect them and an arm. And he did not had enough time for full transformation.

I don't know if it's a spoiler or not but i heard on the review on the 9th episode [that](/s "transformation might by dependant on how much he is hurt. He lost and arm and a leg so he got full transformation. He bit his finger so only his arm, upper bones and head transformed.")
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts were either Eren hadn't recovered enough to make a full transformation; or the cannonball stopped him mid-transformation.
>> ARTICLE
Or he did this on purpose. He wanted to keep them in his ribcage.

every episode i ask myself "how can this show get anymore ridiculous" and then without fail it does
>> ARTICLE
That would be more appropriate for an anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann which is over-the-top on purpose, not SnK.
>> ARTICLE
exactly thats one of the reasons why i cant really get into this show 
>> ARTICLE
I don't see how you think this is over the top, it is pretty standard for anime.
>> ARTICLE
This whole show is an analogy for capitalism. And how greed is devouring us alive.
>> ARTICLE
So much filler and foreshadowing that my eyes were bleeding. Needed more feels after the last episode. But good nonetheless. Well played.

Can anyone tell me what happens after this episodes. The humans declare death on Eren, does anyone end up dying?

For those that didn't read the Manga,  she was squashed between two titans while screaming  "Big bro save me".  Yeah it was brutally sad

May I ask what chapters those are?

>> ARTICLE
The one Isabel and Farlan die in is chapter 7:The trio,  in No Regrets
>> ARTICLE
Wow, damn just went a read the chapters cause of your comment. As if that story wasn't tragic enough in the animated version.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda upset they didn't animate that. It was a heart-breaking moment that added onto Isabel's character and her attachment to Levi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I wish they added it too. As horrible as it would have been to see, it really did show how important he was to her. Also in a way it shows that Levi failed them by leaving them alone when he had originally doubted their safety before the mission.
>> ARTICLE
After reading this Levi can't be my favorite anymore. He let me down big time. Why didn't bro save her?
>> ARTICLE
Episode pretty much explains why Levi barely showed any emotions when his squad got killed in the show.

[Man, Levi is a beast,](https://gfycat.com/TenseJampackedAmericantoad) great OVA.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD-FYHdgI_8&feature=iv&src_vid=4PCgJGxz-FU&annotation_id=annotation_2476058579 - don't really know for sure its name, but it's the fourth song on the description
>> ARTICLE
I felt like they could've cut out a lot of redundant/pointless scenes and put in some more interesting ones...

Like canon scenes of Hanji meeting Levi, Isabel and Farlan would've been nice - considering the fact that Hanji was pretty much the only person who gave a shit about who Levi & co were as people. 

But other than that - good to see Levi still blessed with the bitchface by the gods from above.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the moral in AoT is the total opposite of so many shounen shows:  Friends say to trust in them? Don't believe them. They *aren't* up to it and they *will* die.
>> ARTICLE
What I don't understand is why didn't Levi tell Eren in the forest, "hey man, that [](/s"female") titan look's pretty OP, and even though my team is telling you to trust them, probs best you don't. Look where it got me..."
>> ARTICLE
XD But I'm pretty sure Levi also said he doesn't want to be responsible for anyone's life.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone comment on the sub quality?
>> ARTICLE
Some of the subs are a bit awkward (like when the Bad Guy, whose name I have forgotten, told them to kill Erwin Smith)
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I couldn't find a better way to word that due to how the sentence was phrased in Japanese. And because Nicholas Lobov says that line in 3 parts, I had to choose which pieces of information to display in what order so that the sentence still made sense and was still menacing.

In Japanese the sentence goes [I want you to] [Squad Leader] [Erwin Smith] -> [Kill [him]] -> [Those are your jobs]  
but I very well couldn't follow that sentence structure in English.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe "Squad leader... Erwin Smith... I want you to kill him" or something? I don't know, I agree that it seems hard. But it just came out kinda funny that the "kill him" got 'spoiled' before they actually said it.
>> ARTICLE
There is no real way to translate that sentence without either ruining the structure or straying too far away from the original Japanese sentence. In English, you'd say "I want you to kill Erwin Smith." in Japanese, you'd say "Erwin Smith kill."

The English language has this habit of putting [what you want to do] before [the thing you want to do it to] whereas Japanese is often structured in the opposite way. Because of this, many many translated lines are written backwards, and most people just don't notice it because they don't speak the language. In this case, the line had to be split into 3 sections which further limited my options.

You can't do "And secondly, regarding the Squad Leader Erwin Smith... kill him." because that sounds even more unnatural than what I did. The line simply sounds better in Japanese, and, like pretty much everything, loses impact when translated.

Those graphic scenes can still creep me out, really liked this OVA. Levi going ham was enjoyable to watch (and sad at the same time).

Oh wow. This episode was powerful.  

I without a doubt enjoyed the past two OVAs more than the show itself.

Is it just me, or does Erwin come off as a lot more cold hearted in this OVA compared to the manga version?

I forgot how brutal this anime can get.

Well, this was special OVA gore. Nothing in the show was more gory than the corpses of Levi's friends. They can get away with tht on the BD's.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not going to lie, I find the Levi & Erwin arc more intriguing than the main story line.



 

>> ARTICLE
Really? I don't. While it's good it doesn't have a broader focus than the main plot with all the political and social implications.
>> ARTICLE
Just my opinion, I would rather watch 25 episodes of Levi, Erwin, and the undertakings of the Survey Corps outside the wall, than the main story line.

 
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I think it would bet tiring and stale quite easily :P
>> ARTICLE
Well lucky for you season 2 is gonna be full of Survey Corp action.

Nice, can't wait.

It cut deep.
Both the episode and Levis blades.

Starting to think the OVA is better than the series itself
>> ARTICLE
I had the same feeling when I watched Pokemon Origins.
>> ARTICLE
Uh...first time realizing there was OVA's, where should I start and are they side stories of the main series?
>> ARTICLE
All side stories. The first one (Ilse's Notebook) is the only one with any real connectivity to the central story, though it'll become more significant in season 2. The second OVA (Sudden Visitors) is pretty lighthearted and is based on some joke drawings Isayama made. The third (Difficulty) is a side story that takes pace during the training arc. The fourth and fifth are Levi's origin story.

I am disappointed with the ova because the anime studio removed some of the great parts that were in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, and it seemed mainly in the second part. They made Erwin sound like a jerk. :/
>> ARTICLE
Decent adaptation of the manga. I don't really see any faults in it.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or was there some glowing stuff in the ceiling of the wall's gate that Levi looked at near the end of the episode?
>> ARTICLE
That's a flashback to trees in a forest or something.
>> ARTICLE
Are the OVAs part of the anime? What i read is that the OVAs are juts shorter verions of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
They're all side stories of the anime. There are two compilation movies, which are just shorter version of the anime, but the OVAs are side stories.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. Thank you!

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit is calling your name about Isabell?
>> ARTICLE
You can say that. It's Levi's theme, so if you were to look back on Isabel's [hell, even](/s "The original Levi Squad's deaths") the song would make perfect sense in context.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. That Levi rage scene alone has been more intense and impactful than all of UBW's action scenes shown at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is that UBW's action scenes, while flashy and good looking, are actually not that good and the camera work + choreography is only slightly above average, although the digital particle effects they use to spice up their fights do look good. 
>> ARTICLE
Also just the smoothness of the animation while maintaining high detail is what i see UBW for.
>> ARTICLE
This OVA does a good job of highlighting what I like about Attack on Titan. Despite being predictable, melodramatic and pretty shallow, it manages grip you because of its well directed high quality music and visuals. These OVAs managed to avoid the TV show's largest weakness, the painfully slow rate at which the story advances, they're really showcasing how good the franchise can be. I'm now even more hyped for the recap movies (speaking of which does anyone know who if anyone is subbing the first one and when?), a distilled adaptation of Attack on Titan S1 could be really great.
>> ARTICLE
Predictable? [main series](/s "THERE ARE TITANS IN THE FUCKING WALLS")
>> ARTICLE
That's a fair objection, I really meant that the show is emotionally predictable, that you can easily foresee the moments of tragedy. The larger plot itself is barely foreshadowed, so you're right that several revelations such as Eren being able to transform into a titan and the walls being made of Titans are all together unpredictable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you could totally predict Eren "dying" in the first few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
>Predictable

Do you read the manga? Because the last arc had a lot of twists.
>> ARTICLE
I tried reading the manga but I really didn't like the artwork , and since the visuals have been so integral to my enjoyment of the anime I've decided to wait for the second season. If the manga has well executed twists that could add another layer of enjoyment to the series, but until I see them for myself I'll remain skeptical.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. But a majority of people on /r/anime have only watched the anime, which is why they're more critical about it without knowing the happenings of the manga right now.


>> ARTICLE
Well that chain of events was pretty obvious.
>> ARTICLE
People... the rules say we can't give links or mention how to get it. Now read between the lines. I will say, though, I think it's only out in 480p, if others can confirm.

Is the SnK OST out yet? I hope it includes the piano piece that played during Levi's god mode.
>> ARTICLE
>Is the SnK OST out yet  
  
It came out almost two years ago. And you won't find the OADs in HD because they've been released on a DVD, not a blu-ray. (Actually you will find the first OAD in 720p because it aired on TV a few months ago.)
>> ARTICLE
Anyone following the mangas should be hyped for this.

AoT is in a weird position at the moment were the spin-offs are a lot better than the main manga. Really hope they adapt Before the Fall next.
>> ARTICLE
Who is writing the spin-offs? 
>> ARTICLE
The ova's are based on a manga spin-off. They are written by the author of the main series.

>> ARTICLE
Good to see SnK is back to over [dramatizing](http://i.imgur.com/MKsEIqA.jpg) moments. Though it was pretty lack luster in this instance. 

EDIT: Holy shit that was actually really fucking good. No holding back on the gore either. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk why you got downvoted bruh... people just throwin' shade with anything AoT related. I thought the OVA was great, too.

But yes, the over dramatization can get ridiculous in this show... I sort of love it, though.
>> ARTICLE
So you made a post discrediting the OVA before you even finished it? Why?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not discrediting it. I'm saying in that particular instance, they tried to overdramatize Erwin's speech how they usually do but in this particular instance it was poorly done since they literally just shook the screen while he was talking.

[What I got from this entire episode](http://i.imgur.com/YuhckSE.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Request: Nigel it
>> ARTICLE
Random observation: the location where Eren is embedded into the Titan appears to be where its weak spot is. I wonder if that's significant.

Also nice to see Armin get a chance to shine.
>> ARTICLE
We might have a Bokurano like concept going on here with the "weak spots" if you know what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck! That's gotta be it...The titans are being piloted!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking that as well. Perhaps the titan's all have people in them or something and cutting them off from that/killing the human inside is what actually kills them? That's what I'm thinking now anyway.

Just a theory to discuss.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, none of the other's have had human bodies in the weak spot when they were killed, and none of them have turned human like Eren did at the end of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
We haven't been shown that I don't think, just a few steaming corpses and meat chunks flying off of the back of a titan (which may have the human in it). Maybe killing the titan via the weak spot does not allow a human to leave the titan, but expending their regenerative ability does? Up until this point, we have not seen a titan die from what I will call "over regeneration", and the one time that it did a dude popped out. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that even it's not shown on camera, the characters would be able to see if a human would pop out of the Titan.
>> ARTICLE
I think the theory has merits certainly, but I think that the fact that Eren transformed from human to titan and back to human just means that something strange is going on with him because of that serum his dad implanted in him, not that every titan is a human. If that was the case, then I feel humans would have transformed into titans within the walls and wiped everyone out, plus the Eren titan was the only titan to ever ignore humans and attack other titans.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly think the serum was more to induce rage and help fight if he were turned into a titan.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with the injection theory more than I do what I just said, there is definitely something going on with that. I think it will be explained a bit in the next episode because it looked like there was a clip of Eren inside the titan at the end of this episode.

Honestly though I am not sure we can entirely point at science here though. Mr. Big, Red, and Ugly appears to teleport/appear and disappear arbitrarily, plus the fact that the titans have extremely strange biological systems (no reproduction, seemingly no excretory functions, no need to eat, regeneration, etc) that would point more toward magic rather than science being the cause. That is my major issue with the injection theory.

I think *the key* to finding out which one is what is...well...*the key*, which I believe was also shown in the end clips. Pretty soon we might know what's up with the titans or at Eren Titan.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think that not every titan has a human inside of them but one other titan that comes to mind that showed abnormal behavior is the "armored titan," that motherfucker just busted up the wall and then stood there menacingly, no fucks given about the dudes running away. However, that titan seemed much *much* different because it also sounded somewhat mechanical after it busted off the wall--it blew out steam.
>> ARTICLE
That steam may just be Titan vapour or his natural special ability, similar to the Colossal's.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps there are titans who are in someway influenced to have simple objectives. Let's look at the noteworthy titans and their behaviors thus far.

* Eren Titan: Kill other titans
* Armored titan: Break gates
* Biggest titan: Break gates, smash cannons
* Every other titan: Eat people

Eren titan was clearly influenced by Eren, who is to say that the other titans are not influenced similarly by something?
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's pretty clear at this point that there's some significance. 
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that is why Titan Eren can't regenerate. His human body is fucking up the magic/science somehow.
>> ARTICLE
But we've already seen him regenerate a hand several times during his fight. It may be that there is a limit for him due to some specific personal attribute, or that all titans have a regen limit and it has just gone undiscovered. The humans at this point know so little about titans that who can honestly say if that isn't normal titan behavior?
>> ARTICLE
Right. I think that Eren's is fucking up the flow of things, so major regenerating is impossible.

Making him a mortal Titan in that if he lost his head or got chopped in half, he might die. D:
>> ARTICLE
At this point, I'd love for him to get built up as some amazing badass, just to have his titan form get eaten within a few seconds of meeting the colossal titan the next time. I'd feel like we'd come full circle.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I think the colossal titan is too big to be a real bother other than peeping over the tops of walls. He hasn't really done much else but be a distraction so the armored titan could blast through the wall
>> ARTICLE
Colossal kicked through the wall and let the titans in.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, he kicked the hole into the outer wall. The armored titan broke the inner wall surrounding the village Eren & co. lived in.
>> ARTICLE
And then the cycle would probably repeat, with Erin getting shat out/reborn as Colossal Eren.
>> ARTICLE
Chou Ginga Eren Kyojin?

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?!?! TENGEN TOPPA, EREN JAEGGER!!!

EDIT: My highest rated comment is a Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann reference, yay :P
>> ARTICLE
Yours is the sword that will pierce the assholes! 
>> ARTICLE
I think he has to put energy into regeneration. If he got tired, the regeneration stops
>> ARTICLE
so either you are a smart titan and cant regenerate, or you a a dumb-ass but regenerate fast? 
>> ARTICLE
I think its the other way around. Smart titans know just where to focus their regeneration, whereas dumb titans are just like "IM HURT? TIME TO REGEN"
>> ARTICLE
my guess is that for a titan to regenerate he has to eat humans.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't if anyone has considered the fact that they other Titans were eating Eren (Titan) seemingly absorbing and or eating away his flesh or (taking in consideration that little is still known about the Titans) some thing in the Titans blood stream that has a regenerative cell giving the ability to fully restore loss body parts... Remember towards the end of episode he (Eren-Titan) grabbed the Titan that Thomas was eaten by and bit his neck absorbing something and using it to "evacuate" before delivering whatever was left of its energy. But shouldn't Thomas be alive?? 
>> ARTICLE
Remember the cryptic scene where Eren's dad injected him with something? I'm guessing that makes him able to become a titan upon being eaten. Maybe it can happen again.
>> ARTICLE
Thomas was bitten in half?  Eren technically only lost an arm and leg a d was swallowed whole, debatably survivable injuries in real life.   Losing your bottom torso isn't really survivable,  especially with such an unclean cut.
>> ARTICLE
No. He was eaten. Eren is the exception to the rule not the standard.
>> ARTICLE
My friends' theory. Titans are essentially Nazis, Aryans. A group of humans (who have the ability to "go titan"), and they are purifying humanity by wiping out all non-titans. Dr. Jaegar was a descendent of the Aryans, but ones who didn't believe in blaming the Jews for everything and thus went into hiding with the rest of humanity instead of slaughtering everyone. Before the titans invaded, since Eren wanted to join the Recon Corps, his father was going to show him his lineage/proof of the fact this is what titans really are and that he is indeed a titan. Being filled with immense rage, hatred, distress, and pain, whilst within the belly of the beast, his titan powers awakened and he exploded out of the titan that ate him and went on a rampage.

I then tacked on the part that titans actually have limited regenerating capabilities, but it's completely unrealistic for humans to reach the limits due to the fact Eren lasted a LONG time fighting numerous titans whilst staying together. Seriously, he killed a lot getting injured in the process, and then what? 6 or so were dog piled on top of him when he stopped regenerating? It's not like humans have ever had a titan in captivity and were able to repeatedly abuse it for hours on end to even find out of it's limited or not. The damage they deal to titans while fighting is miniscule compared to what the titans can do.

Also, to explain why titans are immensely retarded compared to regular humans, their society gave up on "civilization" a long time ago. They became so obsessed with their beastly form, they decided to sit in it. Given the fact they are (potentially) biologically immortal, at least while maintaining titan form, they gave up on logic, reasoning, and nearly all thoughts. They live for pleasure alone.

As far as biologically immortal goes, they might not be, they might be like regular humans as far as needing to eat and sleep and fuck to keep the population up, but accomplishing this can only be done in human form, and they make sure no non-titans are around before they switch forms.

Insanely wild speculation: A titans' size is the inverse of how it looks in human form. Aka, the colossal titan was a new born that suffered from a horrible disease where it had no skin on birth, but it's titan powers keeps it alive, which is how the colossal titan is able to "appear out of no where."
>> ARTICLE
I think it points to humans having been the origin of these titans. There must have been some experiment where the titans were first created from humans and thus the "weak spot" is actually where the humans reside. Therefore, this is humanity vs humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Remember the first episode where Eren's dad promises to show him the basement when he gets back?

Experiment happened there, I'm calling it.
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember the short clip at the beginning, when wren is dreaming, when his father sticks a needle in his arm.  Probably DNA of the titans.
>> ARTICLE
I think this points to how the titan's numbers get larger even though they have no reproductive organs. The humans that are killed are reborn into titans. I was thinking this'll turn into a huge plot twist where they'll meet their mother as a titan.
>> ARTICLE
Are humans in their asses too?

Held my breath during that scene!! 


>> ARTICLE
I feel that she's too interesting of a character and hasn't been fleshed out enough for her to die. Still a big scare ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I had to pause the video and seriously consider dropping the show before possibly seeing her get eaten. I fear I'm starting to invest too much on Sasha and Mikasa.
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who was seriously considering dropping the series when eren died and kept watching just in case he came back in some way, the ending to this episode has left me a bit confused. Was she crying because she heard a heartbeat or crying because there wasn't one?!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Look how the episode is named.
>> ARTICLE
I remember wondering why it was titled that and after finishing the episode I went back to check. Feels decided to punch me in the face as I read it. I didn't think the title would hold such emotional impact. All of a sudden I actually felt the relief Mikasa must have felt as she heard Eren's heart beating. It's been a while since a story, or rather, anything influenced me in such a way.
>> ARTICLE
All episodes have relevant names.

Last episode was called Small Blade. Matches the length of the blade that Mikasa was wielding now and 6/7 years ago. I think it symbolizes the whole [unfairness](http://i.imgur.com/xXeZEJP.jpg) of the world.

EP6: The World She Saw, again refers to the "the cruel and beautiful world" she's been ignoring. The entire ED revolves around this concept as well.

EP1's title is the most intriguing: To You in 2000 Years.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably not a spoiler to tell you that most anime episodes are named 1:1 after the according manga chapter, so any probable hidden meaning in them comes straight from the author, just in case anyone was wondering.
>> ARTICLE
she heard one. She was crying from the proof that he was real and alive.
>> ARTICLE
Turn your volume up, there's a pretty clear heartbeat.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh I didn't hear it! Reading that comment made me a lot happier than it should have. Thank you for being the bearer of good news xD
>> ARTICLE
Also the whole bit where the episode was called "I can hear a heart beating".
>> ARTICLE
Her reaction of apologizing was great. Someone needs to make a gif replacing the titan with a giant potato.

Obviously it would break the show, but if the Kawaiitan had been, "It's all good." and winked at her, I would have been ok with that.

Current Humans killed by Titans: **33** deaths, **8** additional deaths possible.  

Suicide count: **1**  

Counting this is harder then expected........  Also i revised the numbers from a re-watch, if you want to add a count to badassery to someone simply reply and give reasoning and if i haven't counted it i'll add it.  
My initial count of Betholdt with 1 kill seems to be wrong (counting is hard) he might have a kill, but it doesn't show him killing if you get what I mean.

Armin should have -1 for being a total bitch for most of the episode
>> ARTICLE
I laughed so hard at that punt.
>> ARTICLE
bertholt has a kill too, man, right? He was one of the 7 in the supply room
>> ARTICLE
That's what i thought at first, but it doesn't show his kill so i can't give him one.
>> ARTICLE
ah ur being really intense with this, alright fair enough
>> ARTICLE
I think intended or attempted suicides like Armin's should be counted as well.

Anyway, thank you for doing this!
>> ARTICLE
I vote badass points for Mikasa for saving him from intended suicide...but he should be more greatly commended for his strategies in this episode.

KICK THE BABY!
>> ARTICLE
Shit man... you must have eyes of fucking hawk! If I may kindly ask how many re-watched did u do?? I commend you for your potent observation skills, quite a feat in my book lol. I did wonder tho how many got killed... however how many were part of Eren's class? Or I u counting a overall death count? 
>> ARTICLE
When action appears i pause and replay several times. And... i'm not sure of Eren's class specifically but the deaths excluding episode 1 and 2 its at 17/18 and most of the deaths from those episodes i believe are from his class, but there might be some not from the training corps. and about 2 rewatches.

Essentially just doing something cool, which kind of makes it subjective, if it can make me mentally go "your a Badass" then its a point.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to add to Eren Titan some badassery for killing an abnormal with his teeth, then killing the surrounding titans by flinging the abnormal's body around.

I call it "Abnormal Chew-Toy Flail!"
>> ARTICLE
You need to add "8 years old Erin" = Badassery 4. He tracked and killed 2 grown man and motivated (while being choked) scared to death and traumatised Mikasa to kill 3rd one.

annie needs a bit more love, she beat the piss out of eran and reiner during training
>> ARTICLE
Yeah she got one for that :)
>> ARTICLE
You might want to give the efficiency medal to Connie. It has been proven that his sharp turns can increase his gas efficiency enough so he can carry a bride to safety.

And all of Armin's gas went to Mikasa, not him, which makes it even more of a feat.
>> ARTICLE
I think eating a potato in front of the drill sergeant earned Sasha at least *one* more badass point. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm tempted by that, but then i'd have to give connie and sasha another when they do eagle poses in martial training.
>> ARTICLE
But don't people tend to play around in the martial training anyway? Not many people were taking it seriously.
>> ARTICLE
Its more to do with Sasha and Connie being idiots rather than badasses, Sasha eating the potato in front of the sarge was more stupid then badass as well.

Definitely, just the look on her face when she was eating the potato screamed "scared" rather than "idgaf".

Every scene where the Titan-killer was punching people out, [this was playing in my head the entire time](http://youtu.be/UC86yQAzaxg?t=10s). I think it's very appropriate.

Thank you, Armin, for actually flexing your mental muscles in a situation that rewards you for it. It was stated earlier that Armin was a strategic and tactical genius, but now we finally get to see it, and I'm happy about that; I was getting tired of your freaked out face (partially because it's the exact same face I'd have in your situation).

Jean, I know you're going to hate me for saying this, but dammit, I will: ***YOU ARE ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD LEADER. I KNOW THAT THE TRUTH HURTS BUT YOU MUST LEARN TO ACCEPT IT. MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU WILL COME TO TERMS WITH THAT FACT AND YOU CAN MOVE ON TO BECOMING AN INCREDIBLE LEADER.***
(but actually though, you're a pretty decent leader - I've certainly met worse)

Can I call Potato-girl and Connie as this show's resident idiot OTP? I feel like threatening to spank a girl is a sure sign of undying baka-love. 

It's official, Eren will be the next Gundam pilot. I mean, he doesn't *quite* meet the requisite "whiny little bitch" standard, but I'm willing to forgive him for that since he has the requisite "I'm a god in combat when I'm angry" attribute. I just hope they show the Gundam SEED animation where a seed explodes in his eye before he turns back into Titan-killer, that would be great. 

Mikasa crying? WHAT? Is this the same show?

*Dammit, why can it not be next Saturday already??? Where's a DeLorean when you need one?*

Don't want to be an annoying besserwisser here, but what Conny actually said was [](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%BB%BD%E8%94%91#Japanese), which means "scorn/scold" rather than spank. Still, I think gg was awesome to change that just for comic effect. It's the main reason I love their subs. :)

I'm glad it's clear at this point that Eren isn't a perma-titan since I feel like having a Titan vs. Titan battle all the time would weaken the impact of the story. 

Hopefully the next episode sheds some more light on exactly what the Titans are when Eren wakes up. (Assuming he does so next week)

I mean, you'd have to build a 15 meter Titan bed for it to sleep in, and a 15 meter lounge chair for when you just want to chill with your Titan. Thought I imagine you'd have to make room for it at the dinner table, even if you're not on the menu.

It's better to watch it first on anime man.

This is totally personal, but any emotion(happiness,sadness,shock,etc) is usually more powerful in an anime medium since you have the visual, and sound+music. 

Don't underestimate how much emotional pull music has.

>> ARTICLE
Centrifugal* 
>> ARTICLE
Nope centripetal. There is no such thing as a centrifugal force, only centrifugal motion.
>> ARTICLE
A) [Stop posting.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force)

B) [Do your research.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force)
>> ARTICLE
Sorry but I have to agree with centripetal force.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I'm too tired to argue with the internet. You win.
>> ARTICLE
You should read what you link before posting.

>Centrifugal force is often confused with centripetal force. Centrifugal force is most commonly introduced as an outward force apparent in a rotating frame of reference. It is apparent (fictitious) in the sense that it is not part of an interaction but is a result of rotation  with no reaction-force counterpart. This type of force is associated with describing motion in a non-inertial reference frame, and referred to as a fictitious or inertial force (a description that must be understood as a technical usage of these words that means only that the force is not present in a stationary or inertial frame).

When an object is in an orbit it is actually being accelerated toward the center of the orbit. In order for this to happen Newton's first law dictates that there must be an inward force acting on the object in motion (centripetal force). When you remove this force (i.e. swinging a ball on a rope and letting go of the rope) the object breaks out of its orbit and then moves in a straight line at a uniform speed. It does not, however, accelerate outward. As such we can apply Newton's first law again to prove that there is no outward (centrifugal force) on the object. As I said before, what people often call "Centrifugal Force" is nothing more than centrifugal movement.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually been yelled at by physics professors for using the term wrong. What you appear to be describing from your linked image is a force being applied to the breasts to make them seem larger while she's moving the way she is. Her rotation is exerting centrifugal force on her breasts correct?
>> ARTICLE
no it's centripetal. the breasts are following the curve caused by the rotation of her body.

centrifugal force is a [ficticious force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force) it doesn't technically exist. Your professor was either wrong, or you took the completely wrong conclusion from his lesson.

>> ARTICLE
Last episode was pretty damn great. I thought Mikasa's regaining her resolve scene was probably the best paced and best directed scene of the show so far, and the appearance of this sexy-haired titan definitely complicates their world in a possibly interesting way. I could see this turning the show in a more shonen and less tactical squad-based combat direction, which would make me unhappy, but we just don't know enough to make a call like that this early. So let's find out.

**Episode 8**

1:01  It looks like they might be helping to manage the budget demands of a show like this by replacing cold opens with little recaps prior to the OP. I honestly didn't think there were super-visible slips in quality earlier on, but I'm the story guy, so I'd probably be ignorant to this stuff even if it were fairly obvious. Either way, I don't have much of a problem with this choice either  if they think it will better maintain the quality of the show, that's a fine stance to take

3:04  Okay, maybe recapping and *then* actually playing the last minute of the previous episode straight through is a little excessive. But I guess ya gotta do what ya gotta do

3:55  Aw yeah, Armin using that big strategic brain of his. Good to see any of the characters exhibiting their individual strengths. That post-OP replay also kinda makes sense in retrospect, since it led directly into the pacing of the first new scene

6:02  Also great to see Jean figuring his shit out  he's one of the few characters that have really defined themselves outside of a single trait or two at this point, and the one I most want to see get more development going forward. They seem to be setting him up as another leader with a very separate style from the one Eren used, which I'm a fan of  blandly positive and hotheaded leaders are less interesting than caustic ones fighting through their own doubts and own personality to pull people together

Yeah, now that I think about it, Jean's easily my favorite character in this show

6:33  Goddamn is that titan's hair ever lustrous

8:20  How many casualties did I cause... defending it is your goddamn job! See, this shit is great. He's an inherently antagonistic person, and he's never had anything close to this level of responsibility, so he keeps veering between competent leader and the worst kind of team-breaking troublemaker

9:04  [We're so proud of you son](http://i.imgur.com/zOJaHC4.jpg )

14:09  The gang's first tactical operation! Good, they're doing this the way I'd hoped  no Mikasa-style crazy groundless showboating, and instead a specific plan using the squad in the best way they can think of. They even fit in a little time for banter between all the main squadmates. I'll be interested in seeing how they concurrently develop the... what is it, nine or ten core characters of their squad? 

Well, I guess they could always just kill a bunch of them off...

15:43  KAWAIITAN LIVES

17:36  Man, this show is just doing every single thing I wanted it to. I like how Freckles assumed squad leadership and stayed strong for the less capable squadmates during the operation, and I like him helping Jean through his doubts as well  it's furthering Jean's character arc while simultaneously establishing his own personality and role in the squad. Excellent

21:17  Another well-directed scene here, with that slowly building song doing a lot of work

**And Done**

Nice, I like ending on such a quiet tone for once.

But more importantly, yeah, Eren's back. We're finally up the point I'd read to, so I can finally stop acting like a genre-blind idiot in these writeups and say, yeah, that was definitely happening. The huge Mikasa flashback kind of gave it away  placing a flashback like that directly after killing one of the two characters it develops just doesn't happen, and with both Mikasa and Jean they directly combined that sense of general hope and purpose Eren instills in people with appearances by the shiny-haired titan.

How do I actually *feel* about this development?

Conflicted. I don't know if this story really needed Eren, and the idea of a shonen where the standard we can do it guys! protagonist gets himself killed within the first arc is a pretty compelling one, and also pretty damn appropriate for this show. Having a story where everyone just has to pick up the pieces in his absence would be fairly interesting... but not all the characters were that invested in Eren in the first place, and as we saw this episode, they can pick up the pieces pretty damn well, so maybe there's less to mine there than I figured. I do like how his presence means we have three very different styles of leadership between him, Jean, and Freckles, though I'm kind of worried about this becoming-a-titan development. Clearly that syringe from before is going to come into play... if Eren can actually control what he just did, it will be hard for them to maintain really harrowing stakes going forward  squad combat is a lot more interesting and fraught with peril than titan boxing. And of course, calling takebacks on a protagonist death always comes with the inherent risk of devaluing all the stakes of your story, so hopefully this isn't a bad sign in that direction either

That said, I really liked this episode! It finally pulled the whole team together and started developing them as a unit and diverse set of internal relationships, and pushed forward a bunch of the individual characters. I find that stuff really compelling and one of the best ways to add some substance to action shows, so hopefully the focus stays on that going forward, and having Eren back doesn't center the perspective too much around him.

I'm not sure I would agree that it would reduce the stakes if Eren can control the Titan. If he can control it, then yes, he has the power to fulfill his goal to kill the Titans effectively by piloting it like a mecha and reduce the stakes. However, we saw that Eren-Titan was very primal in his behavior - it's behavior was "kill the Titans," not "protect the Recon corp." He had to be directed toward battles by having Mikasa and company kill nearby Titans and force him elsewhere. Shit, he almost stepped on Mikasa in episode 7, indicating he doesn't even acknowledge humans in that form; if Titans invade, he wont be protecting anybody. On top of that, Eren-titan is only a 15 m class Titan - what would he do against the 60 m class Titans?

There's also plenty of setup for potential drama and conflict. If it turns out his power only activates when he's in danger like an adrenaline rush (evidenced by him becoming a Titan after having limbs ripped off and being eaten alive), he might become more suicidal and reckless in combat, which would set up for great drama as he throws himself literally into the jaws of death. Alternatively, Eren might recoil in horror at the idea he's become that which he's sworn to destroy, which would lead to drama over when, or even if, he should try and use his Titan power - sort of like an enemy within (I'm reminded of *Busou Renkin*'s Kazuki and his 'Victor' form). On top of all that, Jean indicates he doesn't trust the Eren-Titan, since he elected to abandon it to it's death at the end of the episode; I bet you there will be plenty of people in the Recon Corp who wouldn't trust a Titan as an ally in combat. Finally, if the higher-ups hears about this, Eren could be put to death as a traitor or manipulated into becoming an enslaved tool against the Titans. So yeah, I don't think Eren becoming a Titan is necessarily a bad thing - it has plenty of possibility for story development.
>> ARTICLE
Loved how Eren went berserk after seeing the Titan that ate Tomas, it shows he has at least some control or at least retains his memories when in his Titan form.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, these soundtrack are so epic!
>> ARTICLE
Well, if we assume that every titan has a "pilot" of varying degrees of control that would explain why the weak spot is there as that is where Eren was in the Titans body. 

So the Titans are more exoskeletons ... maybe. 

Idk. I knew Eren was the Berserker Titan in some way, but my mouth fucking dropped when he emerged out of the neck. Mikasa's reaction was just so... passionate. I'm not really thinking in full sentences right now because i'm still processing, but holy shit, her reaction. 

Also that scene lead up to the blinding of the 7 Titans, my heart was absolutely racing. They did a really good job of the preview making you think something shocking was going to happen there instead of... well you know. 

Amazing. Truly amazing. If this keeps up Mikasa is going to finally remove saber from my number 1 female anime character and this is going to be a once in a blue moon Anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if every Titan is an exoskeleton like Eren's was. Compare his physique to the others'. Way different. But his Titan form does look similar to the Armored Titan we say bust down the gate earlier, so maybe that one's a human-titan thing, too. I mean, if *every* Titan had a human inside their weakspot, I think someone would've noticed after slicing it open at some point.

Anyone else kind of disappointed this means Eren probably wont fight with the grapples?

Well, the circumstances in which he first transformed were pretty extreme. I don't think he'll be in titan form unless he really gets in a tight spot.

i don't believe so..  my money's on both. i mean.. he doesn't show up on the OP grappling often for no reason. he's now an enemy of mankind too, it's probably best to remain small when chased by whatever assassins they'll throw at him.

No.

Titan Eren > grapples.

Because rock'em sock'em Titans is awesome.

Clearly they just need to make titan sized grapples.

>> ARTICLE
Oh mai gawd, once again the show leaves me speechless, but we'll get to that later.

We start with everyone still living in a hopeless sitation. Jean has accepted his role as leader, but hates it as he is literally sacrificing lives of his comrades to push forward (wars of attrition are pretty scary). Everyone makes it to the supply base, including Mikasa, Armin, and Connie with the new Super badass titan. Armin makes up an intricate plan and they managed to secure the gas. This is not without some scary parts as googly eyed titan girl almost eats Potato girl (FUCKING SCARY I DONT WANT HER TO DIE). I'm hoping potato girl doesn't beat herself up too much about her moment of weakness. Also before I forget, we will probably hear another flashback story of when Mikasa/Erin meet Armin, since Mikasa said later she would remind Armin about another past time his plan saved their lives.

Anyways, outside everyones happy and retreating full on gas, but super badass titan is getting chomped. Honestly, hes been my favorite character at the moment since the way he kills titans is WHAT MAKES HIM BADASS AS HECK. ITS AWESOME. Last ounce of strength left, with no arms CHARGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AVENGE THOMAS, RIP THE TITANS HEAD OFF WITH A JAWBREAKER. Testosterone was strong with this one, as that kill was the best way for a badass to finally fall. 

But wait one more time, I dunno if other people noticed but in the previous episode's preview, they said we would see something shocking and I was waiting all episode for something crazy gruesome to appear. Instead, when the badass titan is melting... its Erin. WTF!? YES!!! I thought/prayed the super badass titan was Erin in some way and it turns out its true. We see a glorious scene of Mikasa as shes hugging Erin (Sorry I hate seeing girls cry, but when its Mikasa and shes doing it with tears of joy, it made a truly beautiful scene for me).

Episode preview based on scenes  in it shows, the captain dude of the military (not bearded guy but more young serious soldier showing up). It looked like when Erin got eaten he was bathed in magical goop that gave him back his limbs (Sorry no more FMA references now lol). But it probably causes Erin to be ostracized and even punished for somehow having this relationship with the titan. Technically tho after being eaten like that and controlling a titan, Erin could basically be viewed as a monster by regular people. 

Anyways, AWESOME EPISODE BESTTTTT ANIMEEEE
>> ARTICLE
I. FUCKING. LOVE. THIS. ANIME!
>> ARTICLE
As mentioned before, titans dont seem to reproduce, yet there are a seemingly infinite supply of them. My guess is that the reason the titans are so hellbent on devouring humans is because that IS how they reproduce. The devoured human ends up in the nape of the neck of the newly formed titan, hence the weak spot.

Eren's dad probably knew a lot about this, and that injection he gave Eren most likely made it so that he would be able to retain his conscious should he ever be eaten by a titan. Titans also have regenerative abilities, which is why Eren's limbs were still there. The basement is probably a collection of notes/explanation of the origin of the titans as well as the injection Eren was given.

Also it looks like we're going to be seeing some human vs human action soon. I hope Jean sticks up for Eren :x

IT WAS A LITTLE OBVIOUS BUT GOD DAMMIT I KNEW IT!!!! That ending seen was fucking beautiful beyond words, god dammit onions.

This series.. Love it
>> ARTICLE
What I kept thinking near the end of the episode: 

["That scene looks familiar..."](http://i.imgur.com/1nWRZbg.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Great episode again. Lots of good action and while I strongly suspected some sort of Eren reveal was coming for the ending (unlike the last few episodes that caught me off guard) it still hit me hard. Edit: I wonder if it would have been a more surprising experience reading the B&W manga?

Anyway, the ending of this one actually has me thinking about what the series has done as a whole to date. I just saw two of the first few tentpole action movies of the summer, which also have scenes of characters reuniting after supposed deaths, and they didn't do a thing for me. Mikasa crying on the other hand hit like a ton of bricks. So what exactly about the show's pacing or character development or presentation lets it hit so consistently? Certainly it has the space to spend time with a character's grief, and it takes advantage of that. Great music too. And it's believable that the show will actually kill major characters at various points. Still trying to put my finger on what else it's doing....
>> ARTICLE
I think the difference is that we spent episode 6 and 7 understanding how much Eren meant to Mikasa, and then we see how she crumbled and picked herself up later. Once we sympathise with her, the return of Eren also means happiness to the character we love. It's not about Eren being alive, but Mikasa regaining what she thought she had lost forever.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, good analysis. The shock of the initial loss also hit her fully at the same time, I think. Did a lot for me, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
>I wonder if it would have been a more surprising experience reading the B&W manga?

[Here's my answer in the Regular Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f1txr/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca6c3ht). Manga comparisons in my comment, but no spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
So I have seen a lot of brutal things in anime, and a lot of heartwarming as well.  But seeing Mikasa lose it over Eren being alive, yeah I cried a bit.  Kudos director, that scene moved a fan who on his first viewing of Madoka laughed at the end of Mami.  Excuse me, still have something in my eye.
>> ARTICLE
I normally don't like animes because they are over the top and full of fan service, but my gosh this anime has so many feels and every episode surprises me and the story progression is very fast I don't know where it will go (I'm avoiding reading the manga until the show is done) and I literally can't wait until next weeks episode.

I'm sure it's something to do with the injection that Eren's father gave him.

He could possibly be a spy. We discovered there are humans that can turn into titans so it's not far-fetched that there could be titan spies within the army, right? The only question I have now is why? Why would titans need to keep tabs on human activity? My guess is that titans are there to force humans to start working together or at least distract them from each other so there would be no wars between them. Then again, they're slowly wiping out the human race so that could be wrong.  
  
  
Edit: Basically, Reiner's a titan for the plot I can't wait to see.
>> ARTICLE
Are they really wiping out humans? We only know one little kingdom, and nothing about the rest of the world. Quite possible that it all plays on just one isolated island, and outside is just prospering and overflowing with humans. 

Considering the situation, I think there is a legit reason for the situation of that kingdom, like an ongoing war, a global threat the kingdom holds, or some specific threat for the race of the titan-creators.
>> ARTICLE
Race of the titan creators? That's an interesting thought. I haven't considered anything like that yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Also, why wouldn't they just all out attack all the time with the transforming ones? And couldn't they just transform inside the walls?
>> ARTICLE
Well, that would be true if their goal was just destruction. But if they are truly intelligent transforming titans they might have goals we don't know about. Destruction could have been their goal at the beginning but it could have changed since then. There's too many possibilities.
>> ARTICLE
Because the humans truly wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell.

i think erins dad injected erin with something that lets him absorb a titan if eaten.  remember when his dad gives him a shot?

Isn't that a different dude?

Jean was the one talking about being a leader. He's the guy with shortish hair on top and the sides shaved.
>> ARTICLE
I've been wanting to ask this. I just watched all the episodes on Hulu yesterday. Never read the manga, but someone spoiled in the comments that the two colossal titans that attack in the beginning look a lot like 2 main characters. So I thought this, too. My guess is the very first colossal looks like the drill sergeant, too. So having seen Eren as a titan, I have absolutely no idea the reasons why certain titans look like certain humans.
>> ARTICLE
The story doesn't add up though if that's what you think is happening, especially with the timing, not to mention  the age
>> ARTICLE
I thought the age was kinda sketchy as well but barely passable. After watching the episodes again it does mention that he lives far away and I think Marco would mention if Reiner went away on any trips.  
  
To anyone who read the manga you could PM me and tell me whether or not that guess was right.  
  
Edit: I got the answer I was looking for so no need to PM me anymore. Thank you for the replies.
>> ARTICLE
Question being why is he there for 5 years without doing anything
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's his father or some relative.
>> ARTICLE
Here is a theory. Eren emerged from the neck region of his titan self, so what if that's the reason the titans are vulnerable in the neck region? So when cut in the back of the neck, the human in the neck of the titan is killed, thereby killing the titan. Of course, this suggests all the titans are humans transforming into said titans but without their intelligence with the exception of titan Eren and the Colossal titan.
>> ARTICLE
Or perhaps the normal titans have absorbed their human "pilots" and become dumb, while the "Abnormals" still retain partial memory and human instincts like Eren.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good episode, I even liked the stills.

(Violaxcore pls unban me from IRC, I'm sorry for spoiling Harry Potter)
>> ARTICLE
it's make me wonder, why they still use musket when they already have a knowledge to produce something very advance like 3rd gear
>> ARTICLE
They were old, remember the dust. Also, police doesn't fight against titans, the muskets are probably meant against humans. After all they are not all shiny little angels as shown ;)
>> ARTICLE
Necessity is the mother of invention. They aren't infighting, and can't pierce titan skin with guns, so why would they need better guns?
>> ARTICLE
Read somewhere that armored titans looks are based on Brock Lesnar so he will be called Lesnar Titan from now on.
And on topic:
I wonder if Giant Titan and Lesnar Titan are someones alter egos too and why would they fight against other humans? Maybe not in full control?
>> ARTICLE
in short eren is a badass. moving along
>> ARTICLE
I just want to throw this out there and I'm sorry in advance if others have posted this already but...regarding Eren's limited regenerative ability and the fact that it looked like he was having trouble regenerating his arms, maybe there's a time limit or perhaps an energy threshold that, when used up, reverses the Titan Form. Or perhaps it could be a proportional thing(not to over think this but the speculation of this show is a lot of fun)that states that the more energy he uses up at a given time, the slower he can regenerate and eventually when he's used up all of his energy then he reverts to his human state.
>> ARTICLE
I am so much looking forward to the inevitable Eren Titan vs Armoured Titan showdown.
>> ARTICLE
The penultimate battle before the big boss fight against colossal?
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm a few days off on this thread, but I just recently watched all 8 currently out episodes, and after reading a couple of people on here, wasn't that one badass blonde chick talking about having to master hand to hand combat? Eren-Titan was certainly wrecking the other titans with hand to hand combat. 

Perhaps the best 10 that get to be in the king's guard have access to piloting? a titan. 

Also, as far as what Mikasa is, my current theory is that her entire race, that has died off, was the pre-existing super power, and humanity felt threatened by them, thus titans were created.

I don't honestly know, and these are just theories of mine. This might be my new #1 favorite anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Annie was saying that mastering hand to hand combat was a waste of time, a fool's game. And she also explained Eren that the training was a joke because the best TITAN KILLERS (the top 10) were granted the privilege to be as far as possible from those very TITANS they were trained to kill (if they wished to).

Stil, hand to hand combat is useful for soldiers to deal with other law-breaking humans.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck you wikipedia.

I saw a bit of the RAW. I hope they re-do some of those annoying panned still transitions with dialogue.

I don't know, I quite like the feel of them. Sort of like a documentary.

Think about it this way, if they cut costs with that we'll have more kick ass 3d gear movement.

And everyone wants that to happen.
>> ARTICLE
I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was a better way than to show them walking down stairs. 
>> ARTICLE
Same, I really enjoyed those scenes. As long as the show doesn't become full of them, I see no problem with them every now and then.
>> ARTICLE
They are probably doing it to save animation money for the action scenes and such, given that they most likely had a limited budget. 

Works for me, I'd say.
>> ARTICLE
What would it take for them to get a bigger budget? This is one of hottest animes of 2013, so hopefully they can make some money and invest in some more superb animation.
>> ARTICLE
I think they already got more budgets, as I remember that the studio was hiring more staff. But maybe they are just trying to find people to replace their dead ex-co-workers. 
>> ARTICLE
That and the show is beautiful (at least in my opinion). The artwork is very high quality and all the scenery is very detailed, so i'd imagine you gotta cut back a little bit to save money.
>> ARTICLE
They have to scrimp the money in their budget for those 3D gear fight scenes somewhere!
>> ARTICLE
Dat heartbeat.  It even had a split S2, presumably on inspiration!
>> ARTICLE
RELIEF! That's what I'm feeling when Eren emerged from that Titan. Then I saw the preview... Are you fucking shitting me?! He's gonna be treated like an enemy? Though I really don't need an explanation as to how Eren pulled that off but the preview said that Eren's ironclad determination turned him into one?
>> ARTICLE
Is anyone else a little bit mad that they brought eren back? He was kind of an idealistic dickhead in my opinion, even the supporting characters had more dimension as people.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hate Eren, but it would have been better if he died as an Eren-Titan or just died as a human after piloting the 6-pack Eren Titan.

I was secretly hoping there would be no heartbeats when Mikasa came to see if he's alive. That would have been tragic and made the scene 100x better.
>> ARTICLE
This is the anime-only thread, but to you and all those who are annoyed that he's not dead-dead: Don't expect Eren to get the typical Shonen Jump main protagonist treatment. Attack on Titan will remain being something that proceeds differently, even if the MC is back.
>> ARTICLE
There's a couple of things which make me question if the Collosal titan is human as crazy as that sounds. In Episode 5 when it just randomly dissapears before Eren questions its intelligence, its motions were similar to that of Eren when he transformed from titan to human, If it was true I wonder who the hell it could be. Just more and more questions!

So the titans are actually EVAs without armor?

It's disappointing.


 they have three episodes to make that asspull worth it

About to drop this show, didn't like episode 1-2, 3-6 was what I loved, 7-8 has me disliking the show. I don't like the "surprise" Eren became a titan, was really obvious and dumb. I really hate it and would prefer he just stay dead or he came back as a titan at a much later time so I could keep watching them fight in the the unique way that they do.

Watching Sasha fail when shes supposed to be the 2nd strongest imo sucks, glad she didn't die though. Despite  this ass being alive, the voice actress and moment Mikasa had at the end was great only cause she made it so. The whole hype about Eren titan fighting off the titans eating him with no arms etc isn't anything epic, go watch FMA Brotherhood King Bradley vs everybody doing some work or even Zabuza in Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted eren to show up when they were about to escape, missing an arm and a leg but with determination to live, after using his sword to cut himself out of that titan's belly.

But Eren is not the final boss :/
>> ARTICLE
>  I... would prefer he... came back as a titan at a much later time...

You gotta remember that this is an anime, which has the benefit of coming out after the comic has been around for years.  Things are at an accelerated pace here.  The time between Eren dying and being revived in the manga was probably months IRL, and felt like forever.
>> ARTICLE
This ep would've happened sooner if they didnt change the events of the manga in the anime.  In the manga it was Beginning>Get Recruited> Timeskip> Eren reveal + > a volume of Training flashbacks. So in a way you guys are lucky they got the training flashbacks out of the way.

I've read ahead, but not far enough to know if they eventually make weapons for Eren's titan to use, but it's on my Christmas list!  Imagine Eren's titan walking around with a giant sword or knife or something.  He could single-handedly end the titan problem (except for the 60m guy)
>> ARTICLE
Um...yeah I could see this episode's event coming from miles away. Attack of the Titans is the current generation of kid's equivalent of DBZ/The Guyver/ etc. 

I stopped getting impressed after episode 1. There's nothing interesting in this show for me now. The show is trying too hard to be meaningful. Anime shows need to stop it with the melodrama. It's too bad. I thought this show had potential to be one of the next great anime but it's just another slightly better but still shitty show with overly emotional characters.

"Omfg I messed up how could I face everyone now! They must hate me!"  These characters are alive for too long when they should die fast.

The info exists but most likely you will only see it on the second season.

Wall Maria is 450-500km in diameter IIRC

Commander Pixis wouldn't mind being eaten by a beautiful titan? Too bad kawaiitan is already dead.

Well that's a foreshadowing line if I ever heard one.

I think he just meant a titan with lady parts not anything of true beauty like kawaiitan
>> ARTICLE
Remember that Titans possess no genitals.
>> ARTICLE
Do any of them have any secondary sexual characteristics? I don't remember anything like breasts, but I may have been too busy watching humanity getting annihilated to notice.
>> ARTICLE
I saw a titan with breasts a few episodes in...

Had long hair, and breasts. You can see how spherical they are when it moves. It would have to have some pretty deformed pecs to not be a woman.

There! [Found it.](http://i.imgur.com/obHWNgb.jpg) Appears for a brief moment in episode 5, at the scene where they're firing the cannons after the wall is breached, I think.

I'm pretty sure I've seen a few more of them in the background of various scenes.

Hahah, not too amazing. I only just watched all the episodes for the first time a couple of days ago, and I remarked upon this titan to my friend over skype. Checked the chat log to nail down the location in the series.

yes I know and that's pretty much Pixis' complaint
>> ARTICLE
Armin finally got his shit together and it was glorious. 
I also want to punch Commander Felkman or whatever his name is in the face several dozen times. 
Next episode gon be guuuud. 
>> ARTICLE
You mean the guy that didn't trust one of the giant people that devoures his soldiers? Yeah, he's craaaaaaazy.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure he was talking about the commander who decided to act on fear rather than rationally deciding what the best course of action would be. The guy who thought it would be best to kill first and ask questions later, especially considering that Eren clearly couldn't go titan very freely, or at least wasn't hostile, as if he was he would have attacked by then. The same guy who abandoned his allies during the breach of Wall Rose, leaving the soldiers unsupplied without enough gas.
>> ARTICLE
Well how he reacted to Erin was rational for the state of fear he was probably in, all things considered. It was when he abandoned the resupply fort (and thus it fell) which is why I hate him.
>> ARTICLE
I have a problem with using "rational" and "state of fear" so closely. A rational commander shouldn't let fear get the better of him. Pixis seems to be there to demonstrate how a good leader acts, and he was the complete opposite of the cowardly commander.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you are right. I really hate the guy and trying to play the devil's advocate is hard.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, not killing them would be an extreme gamble.

The statement "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". doesn't logically resolve anything because they still cant be trusted.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying they should go and hug him. It's just reckless to blow him up when you have such little info on what's actually going on. As far as the commander can tell, Eren has yet to act aggressively toward any humans, and has only fought against titans. That, at the very least, should warrant looking into him.
>> ARTICLE
>It's just reckless to blow him up when you have such little info on what's actually going on.

You have a potential threat sitting further inside humanity's last bastion than any other giant has ever been before during the middle of a battle that could determine the fate of humanity.

*no one* has ever seen a human turn into a titan or vice versa and no one can tell whos side it is on. Sure the titan took out other titans, but we don't know if it would take out humans as well. (no one saw it save Mikasa)

Furthermore, no one knows how much control Eren has over the titan or the details of its origin. Not even Eren himself.

I think it wouldn't be an overreaction to just get rid of it rather than wait to sort out the details. If it were during a different time when they weren't being attacked, they could quarantine him along a border town, study him, etc. However, that is not the case.
>> ARTICLE
>no one has ever seen a human turn into a titan or vice versa and no one can tell whos side it is on. Sure the titan took out other titans, but we don't know if it would take out humans as well. (no one saw it save Mikasa)

That's just it, they don't know anything. That's precisely why it would be best to try and gather more information. I get what you're saying, that they should take out the potential threat. The problem is, there isn't just that much evidence pointing to him *actually* being a threat. They may as well just go ahead and kill everyone who found him after his titan rampage, as they might be in on it. That's another thing. If they had ONE discussion with any of those people, they would know that Eren never once attacked a single human. They don't even need to study him, just keep the cannons pointed and ask "Hey, what did you guys see while he was a titan?" Then, when the relevant info is revealed, they can realize that he might be an ally, and look into it further.

>> ARTICLE
Let's put it like this ...

You have a package that could be a bomb or it could be a new laptop. You have to make a decision right now because if it is a bomb it could go off at any moment. You don't know the odds of it being either other than the fact that it *is* a bomb is a very real possibility.

Do you open it?

Just as it is in eren's case, the unknown factors are exactly why it makes it such a dangerous scenario.

It seems cruel but its actually a pretty logical decision.


>> ARTICLE
But now let's say that several soldiers can all testify that this is not, in fact, a bomb, as it never harmed anyone. The only evidence they have is that Eren can transform into the titans. If they spoke to the other soldiers, they'd know that

1) He doesn't fight humans. In fact, he shows 0 interest in humans. If he were a threat, why wouldn't he have attacked other soldiers when given the opportunity?

2) He loves killing titans.

In that case, the odds heavily favor that Eren is not a bomb. And your metaphor is slightly flawed: it should be a bomb or a tank, as little realistic sense as that would make. If Eren is indeed an ally, which all of the evidence supports, he would be a HUGE asset to humanity, both figuratively and literally.
>> ARTICLE
You're still taking that risk that he may betray them!

Put yourself in this guys shoes, he doesn't have time to gather stories and figure out if this guy is good or bad. The enemy is at the gates.

Have you ever heard the expression "[the fog of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war)"?

Knowing what he knew at that point of time in his shoes, I would heavily consider opening fire as well. Since humanity is so backed against the wall, it's a risk that could completely kill humanity.
>> ARTICLE
That's a bit too simplistic. In Eren's case there are so many unknowns, that you can't just say yes or no with so little information or ignore the little you do have.
>> ARTICLE
You say "no" *because* of the unknowns and because of how little time you have to spare.

He doesn't really have the time to sit there and babysit them until he can figure out if they're a threat or not.


>> ARTICLE
But that example indicates a time limit.

There was no time limit for the commander guy to make his decision, at least not a tiny one like that.
>> ARTICLE
*Didn't follow the rules during the battle.*

*Nearly kills the three for breaking the rules.*
>> ARTICLE
Wh...What is this...? Do I... *like* Armin?

>*Attack on Titan*: The first time I ever liked the "group weakling."
>> ARTICLE
But he isn't weak. Sure he isn't cut out for killing titans but he seems to be in the making leader/commander.
>> ARTICLE
actually, Eren is the commander who yells while charges in, Mikasa is the biggest weapon who covers up his ass, Armin is the strategist who plans the escape route when sht goes wrong
>> ARTICLE
In physical strength, he's the weakling. But like last episode mentions, Armin's got a brilliant mind. He really showed it off this week.
>> ARTICLE
really? I always loved him he is the most human to me he tries his hardest fails and tries again, because he's never doing it for himself he just wants to help his friends. He's something we can all relate too a failure with pride 
>> ARTICLE
I joined him in his salute, it was great to see some resolve from him. I still want to punch the captain in his stupid face.
>> ARTICLE
Because the captain is totally not justified in acting freaked out and wanting to kill what was to him a Titan pretending to be human?   
>> ARTICLE
He was totally not justified. He should have listened to the intelligence he had and made a rational decision. The man is a soldier, it is his job to stand in the face of things like that and keep his wits about him, especially since he is an officer.
>> ARTICLE
His job is to kill titans.  He just saw a what he could only describe as a titan.  They even point out that their knowledge is very limited; all titans could turn into humans for all they know.  He was a man working with the resources he had.  Many would have made the same decision.
>> ARTICLE
It's not about his actual decision but how he went about it. His eyes were sunk a mile into his head and he was shaking in his boots. He has a squad he has to set an example for and some of them were thinking more rationally than he was.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was totally unjustified. The captain, in his role, needs to be held to a higher standard than mere foot soldiers. Military commanders must not panic, no matter what happens.....or else they'll risk much more than just their own lives. That captain had no place in a position of responsibility, if *that's* how he reacts when the going gets tough. 

TL;DR: Cowards shouldn't ever be in command.
>> ARTICLE
You do have a point there. Honestly, I'll bet this guy got promoted purely because he managed to survive for so long - considering the high turnover rate of soldiers, he was probably among the most senior of what was left of his cohort which is why he even got promoted. If they didn't promote guys like him to command, I feel like their officer corp. would be kind of empty.

Furthermore, considering how Eren could easily break out of any restraint they could have put on him, there was literally only Eren's word there to show he wouldn't just attack them then and there - the word of a Titan, humanity's sworn enemy. It didn't help that one of their best, Mikasa, was on his side, meaning they couldn't use her to kill him in case he went Titan on them. I'm not saying the captain shouldn't have stopped and considered Armin's words, because what he said was absolutely true, but I can understand why he came to decision he did; not the best or more rational one, but an understandable one.
>> ARTICLE
> I'll bet this guy got promoted purely because he managed to survive for so long - considering the high turnover rate of soldiers

You have to remember that prior to the first breach in the wall (and even after the initial slaughter) deaths among the regular army would have been very rare (as only the Recon units would have left the walls at all)

It's more likely that he's a noble 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, that would be an extremely efficient method of promotion.

Either they have the skills to slay titans efficiently or the survival instinct to stay alive (Considering that is the entire goal of humanity, this would be a desirable attribute).
>> ARTICLE
The Pixis dude said he remembers him as a child. This leads me to believe he is most likely in a position of power due to family ties, as the commander seems to spend a lot of time behind the fancy wall where the rich nobles live. 
>> ARTICLE
Pixis is also rather old, though, significantly older than the captain. Its quite possible that he was a trainer or drill instructor in the past. When he says he remembers him as a child, it could be when he was a recruit. Also, Pixis seemed rather disdainful of that noble when he was leaving, which would be unexpected of a member of noble family.

It's like the trio represents the [Triforce](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Triforce): Power, Courage and Wisdom.

Holy crap you're absolutely right
>> ARTICLE
It really does make the best kind of characters. Instead of having a Mary Sue, you can divide a single character into three. A lot of fan fiction authors don't get this, which is why most fan fiction is bad.
>> ARTICLE
The real problem with fanfiction is that most writers don't seem to understand that adversity and the growth required to overcome that adversity is what drives character. 

In other words, giving Frodo Jedi powers is great, but it'll only work out if you give Sauron a Death Star.
>> ARTICLE
Never thought that leaving a cliffhanger on "can a 15 metre titan move a big-ass boulder to a gap in a wall?" could be so suspenseful!!

But, in all seriousness, another great episode. Nice to see a bit of character development in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Remember, there's also the element of "Can I turn into a 15 metre titan at will?"
>> ARTICLE
And maintain control of it mentally in order to actually move the boulder? Or would I just tune out/get nudged out by the Titan mind and go on a Titan-killing bender?
>> ARTICLE
You know what's the thing I just loved about this?  I sincerely had no idea what was going to happen with after Armin's speech.  Whether the captain would reject it, or not, or how Erin would respond.  You don't see many shows which can pull that off.
>> ARTICLE
That's because this anime gives the impression that they are not afraid to kill off characters to advance the plot.  You don't know who is going to live through the next scene and be able to construct the plot from it.  This is what also makes Game of Thrones such a good book series.

I could have easily seen that being Armin's great sacrifice scene. He had his moment of awesome, then gets shot while protecting the other two. Plenty of other Anime would've done just that.

I wonder about that actually. Let's try and think this through...
(For those joining in, I'm about to start talking about Eva's ending. Spoilers ahoy. Rose bud.)

Let's make the assumption that, as soon as Shinji kills Kaworu, he levels up and instantly decides to put all his stat points into hot-blooded manliness. Consequently, he realizes he needed to kill that bishounen Angel anyways and gets over it instantly.

A few days later the JSSDF invades. Shinji gets in Unit-01, punts all their sorry faces, and even beats the crap out of the mass-production units. Then giant naked Rei turns up (nothing Shinji could do about Rei), the mass-production model revives (they got up just fine after getting half their head cleaved off), and they turn Unit-01 into the funky tree thing just like before (all the ingredients were there already). At this point pop goes the weasel, exactly the same way it did in EoE.

Shinji, now with a level in hot-bloodedness, probably makes the same decision his wimpy counterpart did in the funky soul world. He gets spat out along with Asuka; same as before.

I guess what I'm getting at is: after Kaworu goes poof, nothing Shinji could do would've changed the situation for the better. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you I don't think the ending would have changed. Also, personally I feel like Shinji had a lot more to "emo" about than Armin. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Are you joking? Shinji had a lot more than father issues on his plate. He had already been facing a long history of wrestling with his self worth before he had very large responsibilities thrust upon him. In addition he was to carry out these responsibilities alongside someone barely capable of emotion and another who rarely turned down an opportunity to verbally (and sometimes physically) abuse him. 

When he finds himself alone and unable to rely on these people, suddenly out of nowhere a boy shows up and shows him kindness he has never seen before. When Shinji is later betrayed by the boy, Shinji has the task forced upon him to kill him.

This all amounts to more than father issues and (once again, in my personal opinion) more than Armin was faced with here.
>> ARTICLE
i got chills from his speech... 
>> ARTICLE
I did too. The entire scene gave me the chills and the feels at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
That salute had more frames per second than the titan who bit Eren's leg off (seriously, it had surprisingly few FPS. Pretty smart move being so unnoticeable).
>> ARTICLE
That was fucking awesome
>> ARTICLE
Probably because they dont want to emphasize the gore since the show is censored and all.
>> ARTICLE
No, Eren's roagdoll was pretty awesomely animated, it's the Titan I'm talking about. I think he only had like 3 different hair frames (on the same perspective of the ragdoll; I'm sure he has more on the zoom-in before the bite), but it worked because you didn't focus your attention on him
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. You were left with the same feeling that anyone in the episode watching - or Eren himself - would have felt. A few seconds of confusion, thinking "wait, why didn't that work?" The super-action movie momentum kind of feeling just slammed to a halt in less than a second.
>> ARTICLE
Really nice visual metaphor of the Titan's skeleton breaking, just as Armin's illusions of helplessness were broken down. Nice to see Armin pull his weight, even if it's not literal.

"I wouldn't mind being eaten, as long as it was by a scorchingly hot lady Titan." Oh god, this Dot Pixis guy is great. I love me some badass ojii-san action.

**Edit:** On further consideration, I'm a little surprised that Eren would take that long to decide whether he would help retake Trost in Titan form, and not just say yes instantly. Maybe it was to build dramatic tension, but I think Eren is smart enough to realize that that was his only option left - I suspect that Pixis, as genial as he may seem, wouldn't have hesitated to chop Eren's head off right then and there if he hadn't complied; given the general aura around Pixis, I have no illusions that he couldn't have taken on both Misaka and Eren at once and eliminate both of them if needed.

**Edit 2:** Wait, I just realized: given that he seemed to be incredibly exhausted and had a nosebleed after transforming 1.5 times in a row, if they mobilized Eren-Titan once again that day, there will have to be some major physical repercussions. My suspicion is that the next battle won't be quite the same literally curbstomp as last time. Still, I hope I get an opportunity to play ["Move Bitch" by Ludacris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD-xlfVr5gM) again while he beats Titan ass!

**Edit 3:** Last one, I swear. From the looks of it, Armin won't be back on the front lines anymore - I suspect Pixis will take him under his wing and will be some aide or tactician and strategist, like that silver haired girl with glasses next to the captain. I just wanted to say that, as harrowing and traumatizing as the experience was for Armin, I think that his frontline experience will be really helpful when devising unit tactics and battle strategy - he's not some armchair speculator, he knows just how fucking scary Titans are and how others react to them. 
>> ARTICLE
Armin's rank is too low to become an aide to a regional general. Don't forget that his combat experience is just one day.

Also, he doesn't want to be separated from Eren and Mikasa.
>> ARTICLE
> "Move Bitch" by Ludacris

The fact that that video exists is just hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
eren's problem was he didn't fully control himself while being in titan form. he's said that he focused on blocking the cannon and that's what drove what materialized to come to shape. 

he didn't want to promise pixis something he could not do.. but he sure as hell would try and in the end just kicked reason to the curb to go full gurren lagann!
>> ARTICLE
Woah, woah, he hasn't gone all Titan on us yet. Knowing this show, there's a really good chance that, even if he is in control for the next fight, something will go wrong, like getting ganged up by mini-Titan, or armored Titan showing up and fucking up his day with a Spiritbeaker charge.
>> ARTICLE

Just speculation here but where Eren comes out of the Titan, is also the Titan's weak-spot. Could that weak-spot on other titans be driven by some other life-form? Or it could just be the 'come-together' point for all functions related to the Titan's body, sort of like the brain.

**EDIT 3:** Someone asked me to put my theories in spoiler tags, so I am about to go through and edit all my stuff. I haven't read the manga, but if someone is asking then maybe I got something right, so yeah I'll spoiler tag it up so no one gets any ideas if they don't want them.

So maybe I was right about what I said [**last time.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f1twt/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca622tq?context=3)

>Perhaps there are titans who are in someway influenced to have simple objectives. 

>Eren says he was focused on blocking the cannon fire, thus that form was created.

[And as someone else said, ](/s "when Eren goes titan, there is orange electricity and stuff. And when the biggest titan shows up, he has electricity too. And he just breaks the gate and then leaves. ")

[Conjecture:](http://operationrainfall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Chamber.png) [](/s "the big titan is another human.")

[](/s "The big problem in my thought process is that the titan bodies Eren leaves behind are there for a while and then decompose. Why isn't big red and ugly left behind? Why does he disappear almost instantly? I don't have an answer to that yet.")

**EDIT:** [And if I assume that](/s "the special titans (armored and big red and ugly) are humans, does that mean the others are humans as well? If so, why is their objective all the same? Why do they all want to eat people instead of doing something more personal like what Eren did?")

[And another thing I forgot to mention.](/s " They said they were coming from the south. Either Titans just so happen to migrate or something happened to the south of Wall Maria that brought a ton of Titans up. Alternatively, since Eren's dad seems to be in on the titan thing, maybe the humans with titan abilities were coming for him specifically for some reason.")

Just some theories.

**EDIT 2:** /u/sexRichard just made me consider 
[something else.](/s "If Eren can make multiple titan bodies, who is to say that the titans are all not made from the same person using the titan power? I'm considering the theory right now, and I thought I would bring it up for discussion up here since this comment is more visible. Current issue is that titans tend to decompose once Eren leaves the body, so maybe this isn't valid. But something to consider: a single human can produce multiple titan bodies, even if they both die.")

What is that image from? Looks cool.

That is Chamber from the currently airing anime [**Suisei no Gargantia.**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia) 
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think your last spoiler is the case, because as you said once Eren leaves, the body disappears. Not to mention if Eren's dad is the cause behind this, that wouldn't explain the regular titans, because they have been around for an exceptionally long time. So right now, we have three titans that are different from the rest (and actually display intelligence), giant titan, armored titan, and Eren. Giant titan and Armored titan work together, and the regular titans don't seem to attack them, like they do Eren. 

They clearly have a goal to destroy humanity, so what is there motive, if they are human this wouldn't make too much sense. If there cause was to overthrow the government or along those lines, they could just sneak in and turn titan near the palace, rather than break through each gate killing hundreds of thousands/millions of people. So that kind of rules that out. 

So to really make educated speculation, we need much more information, because what we are working with is just a drop in the bucket. That said, and I'm surprised I have not seen this posted yet, since Eren titans form looks similar to Eren, who can we match with the Giant Titan and Armored Titan, if they are humans/have been revealed? I don't want to start looking up characters because I know I will read spoilers, but I'll start looking through older episodes to find resemblances. 

Also, did anyone else get a vibe of heavy foreshadowing from Commander Pixis talking about a female titan? Possibly a Mikasa titan form when they get to the basement? 


>> ARTICLE
While it would be cool to see a titan Mikasa, I dont think that is going to happen. Seeing as the comander now knows that there is something in Erens basement I dont think that they themselves (Eren, Mikasa and Armin) will have access to that alone. Someone from the goverment will likely atleast be with them or following them there to make sure they dont do something stupid.
>> ARTICLE
Here are theories I posted in last episode's discussion:

>**THEORY TIME!!!**

>**(1)**  Dr. Jaeger was in charge of some project (either *[a]* orchestrated by the human government or *[b]* something entirely of his own personal effort) to create Titans for the purpose of fighting the real Titans off.  *This is less a theory, and more an obvious conclusion from this most recent episode.*

>If **(1)**, then other abnormals are likely the result of this.  This is enforced by the "disappearance" of the Colossal Titan being so similar to Eren's transformation.  Also, the Colossal Titan had the intelligence to attack the cannons and break open the wall, and the Armored Titan had the intelligence to attack the gate.  That goes against the apparent mindlessness of Titans.  I feel that this lends itself to *[a]* more readily than *[b]*, because character development of Dr. Jaeger makes the idea that this immense crippling of human society is essentially his fault a bit too much to swallow.  Furthermore, the negative light in which the aristocracy is shown lends itself to them being responsible for more crap as we move further into the story.

>**(2)** I considered the possibility that Dr. Jaeger is, himself, the Colossal Titan, and perhaps also the Armored Titan.

>If **(2)**, then Dr. Jaeger is doing this for one of two reasons: *[i]* he has lost control of this ability (Jekyll&Hyde-esque) or *[ii]* he is trying to fix the problems with humanity by forcing change upon it.  *[ii]* seems very unlikely, again because of the apparent morality of Dr. Jaeger thus far.  *[i]* is not only more reasonable for an explanation if **(2)** is true, but it also opens up for the possibility of *[b]* being true over *[a]* (though I still prefer the latter).

>**(3)** "Their memories" refers to either Titans, the humans ingested by Titans, or whatever lies in that basement.  While some are saying that it's the Titans' memories, I find that the senselessness of all Titans other than some abnormals makes that a stretch.  The ingested humans idea comes from the fact that Eren first transformed after hearing the cries of another ingested human.  That triggered memories of his mother, but may connected on a less coincidental level.  I personally think that this being said in reference to whatever lies in that basement is the most reasonable explanation at this point.

>**(4)** Despite whether *[a]* or *[b]* is true, somehow the responsibility to try to do something to save humanity landed on Dr. Jaeger.  Thus, he imparted the power to save humanity to his only offspring in a Naruto-esqu fashion.  I feel that this further strengthens the argument for *[a]*, since both the idea of Jekyll creating another Hyde to combat himself and the idea of setting his son against himself while in total control of the turmoil offer major logic problems (which would be bad for someone smart enough to be called doctor).

>**(5)** There is an *obvious* set-up that Eren and Levi will face-off at some point.  The real question is whether it will end in death or in an alliance.

>**(6)** The inter-human relationship strains are becoming far more significant.  It's much like zombie movies:  all have zombies, but the good ones deal with conflict amongst the humans even more.  That being said, I feel that the story will climax in a showdown (likely involving **(5)**) between the chaotic good of our protagonist(s) and the lawful good/evil (grunts/aristocrats) of the human government.  The salvation of humanity from the Titans will be secondary to this, and probably end in the falling action (ep 25-ish).

>**(7)** I want to point out the similarities between Eren sparking before he transformed and Mikasa sparking before stabbing the kidnapper in ep. 6.  While I think Mikasa's is more exclusively symbolic than Eren's, I think both demonstrate a sudden change in control of oneself and the subsequent ability to go above and beyond what they previously perceived as their limits.

>**(8)** Apart from **(5)**, I want to address how I think other characters will act in the future.  Mikasa will be Mikasa, nuff said.  Armin will freak out over what just happened, but his loyalty to Eren and Mikasa will overcome that uncertainty within the next, say, 2 episodes.  Pretty much all the recruits who scored well, but followed Eren to the frontlines, will ally with him still (though they're all smart enough to only act "treasonous" when it becomes necessary).  Those who wanted so badly to be in the inner wall will mostly ally with the government unless convinced (not easily) that Eren is the righteous one to work with.  Jean will specifically struggle with whom to side with, but ultimately be convinced that Eren is not evil (this will be a big deal, given his ability to lead others in the right direction).  Pixis will eventually find that Eren is just (we've seen little of him, but his insistence on dealing with the attack instead of playing games with nobles shows a good morality).  Finally, [**THIS GUY**](http://i.imgur.com/iIadJlw.jpg) will be put in a near-death position where he will either be saved by Eren (convincing him of Eren's humanity), or **DIE A BRUTAL DEATH** as a result of his inability to trust him.

>EDIT: Formatting

After episode 10, here are some alterations I have:

Mainly in reference to **(3)**, I'll say that the memories sparked by the dying comrade are not the answer.  This episode points toward the idea that both the initial Eren Titan and this defensive form he just produced are made by a powerful urgency to do some trigger (realization of death, fear for his and his friends' lives).  Because of this, I'll submit that, though this is probably not significant, Eren was infused with this ability *after* saving Mikasa.  Otherwise we'd probably have seen him go Titan at some point in that flashback.

There are several minor alterations that need to be made to **(8)**, but I'll leave those for next week.
>> ARTICLE
The titans don't decompose, they evaporate into nothing.  My theory is that there is some other plane where they draw the matter from to make the titans, and once spent they just return to that plane.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the 'normal' titans are from normal people who got eaten by other titans.  That could explain why there arn't any pilots(?) in those titans.  big ones would be devoured adults, the 5m could be children, ext.
>> ARTICLE
[I actually like that idea.](/s "Considering that they do not have any known reproductive systems (or excretory systems it looks like), perhaps they are "eating" people purely for the sake of reproduction rather than nourishment or sport.")

There is no evidence for this yet, so take what I say with quite a bit of salt, but it is possible. I don't know enough about titan digestion or death to say more.

**EDIT:** Spoiler tagged as requested.
>> ARTICLE
I think that this idea makes the most sense. It would explain why Eren is in the weak point on the titan. It would also explain why the titans became such big problem so rapidly, as their numbers would increase exponentially, kind of like a zombie apocalypse, but giant.
>> ARTICLE
Also, when fighting the titans they always attack the area where Eren came out of his titan from. 

Edit: I can't take this anymore, I think I'm gonna have to cave and start reading the manga. So many questions left unanswered and these weeks feel like ages.

pro tip: the questions just keep increasing  in both the manga and the anime so just dont
>> ARTICLE
As mentioned previously when [**I talked about this:**](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f1twt/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca5zoo9?context=3)

>I was thinking that as well. Perhaps the titan's all have people in them or something and cutting them off from that/killing the human inside is what actually kills them? That's what I'm thinking now anyway.
Just a theory to discuss.

Followed by /u/EpicDan pointing out that no findings of human corpses have been mentioned. If they decompose/fuse into the Titan flesh (which then decomposes again to be completely unrecognizable), that would explain why there were no bodies found, but I really don't have any evidence that would suggest this is the case.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing you stuck at certain points of the speculation -because you need more confirmed information- makes me realize how clever was the author in the craft of the mysteries. 

Leaving us in the dark about whether there are humans in the normal titans or not is completely intentional and fires up speculation.

EDIT: From the previous thread, and related to this episode

>Every other titan: Eat people

You forgot to add Titanic-Erens there.
>> ARTICLE
Well I did say 

>Eren Titan: Kill other titans

[But now we have to consider what you just brought up:](/s " Eren titans, plural. Because technically, there are more than one that he made....
OH MY FUCKING GOD. WHAT IF ALL OF THE TITANS ARE MADE FROM A SINGLE PERSON REPEATEDLY USING THE TITAN POWER WITH THE GOAL TO DESTROY HUMANITY FOR SOME REASON HOLY SHIT  ")

**EDIT:** Spoiler tags as per request.
>> ARTICLE
Oh noes, forgot to spoiler that the Erens are part of the Human Instrumentality Project!

____

I meant: "Every other titan" eats "people", right? They completely ignore animals and other forms of life, right?

Then Armin in this episode said that Eren was seen as their "prey" as well, so, I ask: Eren-Titan, an exception or part of "people"?
>> ARTICLE
Now *that* is a good question. Titan's which are in large considered to be non sentient must be at least intelligent enough to distinguish between other titans and "prey". Granted, they might eat each other and we just haven't seen this happen yet, but let's assume they have criteria for identifying prey.

Going back to the episode where the titan first saves Mikasa: If I recall correctly, the first titan he killed didn't see the attack coming in the slightest. Then, he roared at another and that titan, upon being provoked, appeared to make an attempt to fight back. Later, when he is fighting groups of titans, it appears at first that they ignore him, believing him to be a fellow titan, but change their minds and gang up on him *after* being provoked.

Perhaps I can assume that the titans are more sentient than we are told. Perhaps they don't see Eren as "prey" until he demonstrates that he is a threat.
>> ARTICLE
However this weeks episodes did remind us of Eren's dad... Speaking of which where the flucks capacitor is he??? The basement??!?! Dead?! Alive?? 
And why choose Eren?? and not Mikasa or why not both??? Only one injection?? Would it not benefit them to be both injected to obtain the ability to "ride"/ "drive" the titans?? And not going to lie but that Commander... I'm ready to find a way to teleport myself into the anime grab a brick and kick him in the jejunum....  
>> ARTICLE
My theory is that he is the colossus. I don't know though since I haven't read the manga. I believe though that he did experiments on himself and is now the colossus.

Who's not to say Mikasa got the same injection just wasn't shown to us?

Hmmmmmmmmm Titan Mikasa......

>> ARTICLE
Eren's dad had some kind of unknown, white collar work in the capital...probably with the church, judging from his clothes. He probably stole the titan serum from the church, and has hence been imprisoned. The church is probably behind the existence of the titans, because the church's power is maximized in times of crisis in real life, just as it would be in this universe.

TL;DR: The Titan's are a plague engineered by the church to kill 99% of humanity so that it, and the feudal nobility, could have absolute power over the final 1%. As for how the colossal/armored titan attack factors into this, the greatest crime in the history of civilization, I don't have a clue. I just don't see how the church could profit from the destruction of the outermost wall, Wall Maria.
>> ARTICLE
It's simple. I agree with your theory that the church was behind it. Right now, that seems most plausible.

But, I think the Titans have gone berserk, that the Church is no longer in control.

Hence, the attack on Wall Maria.

Eren has more resolve than Mikasa. I imagine the Titan power relies on something similar to spiral energy. I am just waiting for Eren to ask someone who the hell they think he is.

Quick question: 

http://i.imgur.com/MnWYIoU.jpg

Why do Titans use route 1 instead of route 2 (I think they do, at least)? I mean, why don't they just use the route with less walls and less resistance and head straight for the king?
>> ARTICLE
this shot also helps really give an image of how large the walls are, the smaller image in the beggining was always hard to figure out how much area they have.
>> ARTICLE
Weak gates are located in those areas. 
>> ARTICLE
Gates are easier to break than wall. I think.
>> ARTICLE
I wrote it on an older thread but here I go again:  
Titans are attracked to a large concentration of human beings in one place. Mankind doesn't nearly have enough people to cover the whole wall with soldiers. That's why they put the 4 districts in each direction on each wall to concentrate the population. This attracts the titans and they can defend the wall more easily that way.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like this episode much. It was mainly two characters I didn't like screaming at each other. It took too much time for Armin to take action, and I really didn't need to see him question his self-worth yet again. Kinda bleh but the ending made me excited for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's right, Eren's a superhero now. The fuck you gonna do about it?

**Episode 10**

2:30  Jeez, I forgot this battle's been going on for six damn episodes. I guess the constant flashbacks will do that...

2:50: Speak of the flashback...

3:42 - My tummy hurts! This show has such a weird sense of humor. At this point, the number of despair faces and despair speeches we've run through in the past few episodes has definitely tipped into the realm of self-parody, but you're actually supposed to take most of them seriously, and then there's a joke like this that basically acknowledges how wide-eyed despair has become almost every character's default expression. But aside from the silly gag, it doesn't actually separate itself from the serious despair scenes in any tonal way. For a show that puts so much stock in maintaining its grim atmosphere, it seems weirdly flippant about how easily it can be perceived as comedy

4:30: Carpenters and stonemasons must make a killing in this world, what with all the constant holes in walls and roofs from the soldiers flinging themselves around

5:32  Great, so when Eren claims to not be a titan, the captain opens fire  but when he *actually morphs into one*, he orders everyone to hold position

6:18  I heard the cannons fire... For this episode, the role of flashback will be played by Armin's narration

6:30  Flowers? Hm. Odd bit of foreshadowing there  no idea what it could mean yet

7:04 - We can't negotiate with the garrison. Isn't there a single person in the chain of command who isn't a goddamn idiot with no ability to process new information? I mean, I get that taking the risk of trying to negotiate with people who just cannon'd you is probably a bad call, but this captain is just such an openly incompetent and antagonistic character that it's frustrating having the plot be dictated by his insane ramblings

7:56 - Eren, we've got other matters to attend to. *Thank you* Mikasa. Freakin' Eren monologuing himself into another cannon barrage...

8:17 - Hold your fire! *I'm getting dust in my eyes!*

8:55 - That explains the lack of durability and functions. So his power basically manifests titanism designed to fulfill his current base desire? That works. Still monologuing with cannons pointed at him, though

11:03  Yesss, develop Armin. He's been static for too long, and these other two desperately need a competent person who thinks before they act

11:18  That said, the flashback meter is going crazy right now

12:09 - Using these powers strategically, as part of the military... YES. PLEASE.

14:01  That's right, Armin. Believe in the Eren and Mikasa who believe in you!

14:27 - I'll use my brain even while I'm talking! Is that... not what he usually does?

17:25  Legitimately nice speech by Armin there  appealing to their camaraderie as soldiers was a good call. I wonder who's gonna appear at the last moment to stop this idiot captain?

17:41 - *PIXIS?!?!*

17:59 - You go take command of the reinforcements. *Why is anyone letting this man take command of ANYTHING?* He couldn't fucking strategize his way through a ham sandwich

Also, I accidentally paused to type this at [the most perfect moment](http://i.imgur.com/JrT2A0s.jpg ). Armin, you are beautiful

19:07  Man, I get the feeling Pixis and I are gonna get along just fine

20:38 - It was just something I came up with to give people hope Eren's power could get us out of this. Wow. This one sentence *hopefully* puts all those despair faces into perspective. If this is actually a thematically meaningful statement, it also explains the focus on the irrationality of the soldiers when dealing with Eren earlier  this show might actually be interested in the irrational nature of human optimism, pessimism, and morality, and have characters actively manipulating either their subordinates or the general populace for the greater good. That's a really compelling idea, and one I hope the show continues to pursue

Also, if it *is* true, it basically means Eren is this world's Batman  "the people need a symbol" and all that

21:46 - Will you give it a shot, or not? I understand how drama-wise we need to keep up the momentum, but this seriously doesn't seem like how an intelligent commander would take the news of a trump card as critical as Eren's powers. His abilities seem very literally to be the difference between survival and extinction  they should test the goddamn things, and devise exactly how they can be best employed. Sure, it'll mean more titans enter Trost  but Trost doesn't seem strategically significant anyway. This is not something you throw away in a gamble

**And Done**

Whew! That one finished strong, though once again it started pretty slowly. That seems to be the pattern with this show  every episode starts with a pile of slower exposition and character-checking-in, and then moves to a dramatic finale that pushes the plot forward a bit. I'm honestly not the biggest fan of this format; at least this episode, it felt like the scene with our dynamic trio concealed by dust went on far too long, even if it resulted in some long-overdue character development for Armin. Ten episodes in, I still feel like we're setting up the pieces for the game to come  establishing the various interactions between the characters, giving each squad member a base level of conviction and a specific strength to contribute, exploring Eren's power. And I'm not actually against that in any way  I just think the pacing seems slow for scenes that essentially amount to worldbuilding and exposition.

Still, I'm certainly enjoying the show  I like the world they've created, I like the idea of a show based on the human side of military strategy, and the direction is pretty endearingly melodramatic. But I can't help feeling I'm still waiting for it all to kick into high gear.

Fortunately, this shit is 2-cour. My body is ready.

Also, good timing by Pixis. That captain was starting to piss me off immensely and I wouldn't mind Mikasa slicing him up or Eren using his Titan power to annihilate him.

I'd say that this episode's pacing felt fantastic. You dread the coming seconds, you try to hope that the show doesn't throw you a curveball (I was dreading that they'd shoot Armin as he stepped from the smoke) and they placed all hopes on Armin - the guy who spent most of his time moping, outright sobbing, lagging behind his peers, shitting his pants in fear and so on. I'm glad that he finally stepped up to the plate. While Mikasa is still my favorite character, Armin got some serious points for being **THE MAN**.

Now I can definitely say that the captain is by all means the weakest sauce on the show - because he lacks guts. What a bitch.

Bring on Episode 11!

Fuck yeah, Armin! Going from "scared" to "totally badass soldier speech" in no time flat.

I'm pretty darn curious about Eren's Titan skeleton protecting the ground Mikasa and Armin were on. I can only guess he has some magic Titan voodoo magic that protects whatever's inside his skeleton.

Also, really loved the dialogue at the end. "Can you? ... No.. Will you?" The difference means a lot and shows Eren's strong will to do whatever he can, even if he isn't able.

One of the eps was confrimed as a recap. So there is speculation if th total wil grow to 26.

Honestly, I felt like this episode was pretty weak, at least compared to the other 9. They wasted way too much time chatting in the rib cage while the soldiers slowly loaded the cannon. I understand that that scene is where we see Armin finally grows a pair and adds something to the group, but they really didn't need to spend half of the episode on it.

Those were the longest 25 and 15 seconds ever. Maybe even longer than DBZ.... actually maybe not.

Ehhhit was stupid, I'll be honest. It felt like those episodes of DragonBall Z where it would take Goku an eternity to charge an attack. But that's just my $0.02.

The regret to be just a sac of meat using oxygen, like there should be no place for me because I'm meaningless. He thinks he need to fight just as good as Eren. I'm just any nice person, it doesn't really matter, but ultimately it does. People can make differences for the better; they're just not aware of it. Just like when they told him that he actually saved them before.

Armin's speech was really amazing. I half expected him to just tell Erin and Mikasa to run..I almost thought he was going to die....
>> ARTICLE
Im really diggin' the series so far but i feel like the last two episodes have slowed down, but im glad arimin isn't such a bitch anymore
>> ARTICLE
I have so many mixed feelings about this anime. While i can appreciate the fact that it is pretty good at handling the whole "epic battles" deal with fairly good music and animation, I'm also pretty fed up when it becomes all Shounen and melodramatic like this episode.

I for one have had enough of Armin bitching out at every possible situation before realising that he's not completely useless after all. I'm also not really convinced by the overall dumbassery of a lot of characters (i.e. the fucking crazy dumb commander). 

I just hope the anime is done with all the unnecessary melodramatic pseudo-tension and gets on with interesting plot development. In other words, stop building up hype for that goddamn basement.
>> ARTICLE
The whole episode was to give meaning to Armin's character, he isn't just the side buddy that is scared and useless all the time. Although it didn't take much intelligence to speak the words he spoke, it worked out okay. The captain is really annoying and I hope he gets eaten by a titan.

What part of not talking about the manga at all in this thread do you not understand? People don't want to know at all about anything that's going to happen until they watch it. Yet here you are talking about the next episode and how things are gonna progress from here.
>> ARTICLE
Armin needs to get his act together, he's got a good brain in that skull. I didn't even think about using Eren titan to move the boulder and reseal Wall Maria and I had WEEKS to think about that. 

^(I mean comparing myself to a fictional character isn't really fair but still...)
>> ARTICLE
It was really obvious when they even mentioned that they had tried to move it that they would need a titan to move it.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, if I forgot that over a few weeks, I can only give Armin even more credit for bringing that up after a few *years.*

**EDIT:** JUST KIDDING I GOT THE WALLS MIXED UP
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, can't wait for next week!
>> ARTICLE
nice to finally set the main character's roles in the same scene play out with some dialogue and tense moments:

- Eren is the hero they need, but not the one they deserve. he's all heart and determination
- Mikasa's the no nonsense, cut the bs grim reaper! she's the brawn, pure power and merciless executor
- Armin's the mastermind. he's the brains of this operation
- Sasha's the comic relief. she's the fun part of life
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see Armin growing some balls for once ^^ 
>> ARTICLE
Were can I watch this show?
>> ARTICLE
With the way the shows slowing down, I feel like my best bet is just to read the manga and get caught up and just watch the epic parts when they're animated. :/
>> ARTICLE
It shall speed back up.

Unless they slowed down the manga's chapter-> episode rate, because this was just one chapter. It was dialogue that took 3 or 4 minutes to read (and as much to speak as I was reading it at a natural in character pace), and it got stretched. 

On the flip side, I've read the manga and I still look forward to every week a new episode comes out.

edit: sorry adaptation/mangaa comparison.

 You won't be turned off the anime by reading the manga.

 Last week I would beg you to stick with the anime. If it keeps slowing down I would be more understanding of taking up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I know I might get a lot of flak for this but, here goes: Does anyone else find it pathetic and extremely annoying that like 90% of these trained soldiers fear and get paralyzed so much by the titans? I mean, I understand PTSD and the idea of fighting these giants that can easily eat you is pretty fucking scary, but as a soldier, you're trained to deal with that, conquer your fears and do your job. But in every episode, all I see are a very, very small group of people who have somewhat dealt with the fact that they might die, while everyone else is just consumed with fear and can't do shit. If real world armies were like that, I'd imagine we'd have a lot more casualties and desertions.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's that they know that they don't stand much of a chance. Yes you sign up for a war thinking that you're going to die, but a good amount of the time you know that your side has a chance of winning. In this show they constantly  mention that they are on the verge of extinction. Many of them might be concerned that they really are going to die for nothing. Even with the 3D gears, the Titans are way overpowered.

Also, if the episodes where they are getting trained showed you anything, it showed you that at first many of these guys weren't going to actually join the Recon Corps and just reap the benefits of joining the military. (Example: Jean)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've been wondering that myself. What I'm thinking is, very few of these people have actually seen titans in their lives. Only the scouting legion, which is small in number, has actually met the Titans in battle. The rest of the soldiers are just kids and peacetime reservists who've been hastily trained and thrown into the fire.....remember that the walled territory of humanity has known peace for a hundred years prior to the storyline beginning.

I figure that we'd see a pretty similar situation if we called up state-level national guards and threw them into the Battle of the Bulge or something.
>> ARTICLE
real armies are exactly like that. did you believe soldiers witnessing slaughter for the first time react any differently? our technology does a hell of a good job to shield most armies of the world from personally experiencing mass death first hand with all the longrange abstract weaponry, institutionalization, harsh training regiment etc etc.. but i think every soldier remembers what death they've seen and dealt up close.
>> ARTICLE
Remember that those guys are seeing the titans eating people in front of their eyes for the very first time
>> ARTICLE
Did no one else think this episode was awful? Nothing happened. They were in the steam cloud the entire time, just padding out the episode. 

I just found it boring, and I was excited all week for this episode. Nothing happened...
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Thinking of dropping it.
>> ARTICLE
I probably won't, but if I did, it'd be for a couple of years, until there's enough where I don't have to wait a week and be disappointed by nothing happening. 

"Armin, you have 15 seconds to decide"... *Takes 5 minutes*
>> ARTICLE
I kinda agree, it's clear now how they managed to stretch it to two cour. Everything moved real slow and that yelling was over dramatized.
>> ARTICLE
When you say nothing happened do you mean action wise? because there was plenty of character development of one of the major characters in the show. In fact this is his defining moment. So a very significant thing happened in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Action-wise or plot-wise. I get this was Armin's big moment, but I just thought it was silly. It was so overdone; way too melodramatic for me.

It's not reddiquitte when you post something that contributes nothing to the conversation. People are going to downvote you for low effort posts. You can't really have a show without build up though. There are bound to be episodes that less happen in. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. If they want to spend 2 episodes standing in 1 location deciding if they should kill Eren then this series will need at least 35+ episodes to get to a spot for a reasonable ending.

Also with each passing episode the show seems to look like it's losing production quality, the little things here and there are starting to become noticeable. Hopefully this gets better when the plot starts rolling along at a faster pace.
>> ARTICLE
Well the manga hasn't even ended yet and I've heard from people that if they keep going at the current pace, they'll catch up way to quickly. This will most likely lead them to create some kind of anime original ending, especially since new chapters are released monthly. However, I will agree with one thing. The entire time I was thinking "how long does that smoke stay up?"

It's also available on Crunchyroll. You know, supporting the official streams...

With a delay... Not saying that I torrent but they do lose out on a lot of ad revenue by not simply releasing it with greater amounts of ads. And I can see people who only watch a couple anime a year don't want to pay for a service that would only function for one show. 
>> ARTICLE
They're working hard to bring releases as quick as possible. This week's episode was released at 6 p.m. in Eastern Time Zone, which is quite fast even for a simulcast. It's not Crunchyroll's fault the anime gets delayed, but the publisher, Kodansha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I meant a delay for non premium users. Currently I can only view a sample clip signed out. And I wasn't specifically implicating crunchy roll but rather anyone who made the decision down the line. Watch on an illegal site or wait for a week while everyone else talks about it. Most people will choose illegal site if they are strapped for cash
>> ARTICLE
It's $6.95/month for premium membership, that's a pretty good deal considering you get to watch all of their content (depending on where you live due to licensing restrictions) without ads and up to 1080p quality.

Unfortunately, that's how premium subscriptions work. If content was released around the same time for both premium and free users, then there would be no point in having a paid membership. The legal streaming sites (like Crunchyroll and FUNimation) do have to make money and have the arrangements to organize for future simulcasts, and this is the only way so far.

I personally don't mind waiting a week for another show, probably because it's not a big deal for me to immediately go on social media sites to discuss, but it's understandable to see why some need to watch something as soon as it's released.

Awesome! Eren is ready to move the boulder, Pixis gave an amazing speech, Armin further shows he's a smart guy, Mikasa is guarding Eren along with other elite troups and all the soldiers are ready to take back Trost no matter what the cost. This is perfect.

Well, I think it is fueled by the last strong emotion he had. The first time he wanted to kill all the titans, so he did. The second time he wanted to protect his friends, he did it. The third time, he calmed his mind and focused on moving the boulder, but before that he basically told Mikasa, "I AINT YO BABY'S DADDY!!!" So... Yeah.

forget the boulder.. he basicly punched Mikasa!

he also had massive butthurt when Mikasa was volunteering to be by his side and didn't say a word when she was ordered to join the elite team. by the looks of things he may have injured her.. but with the dust and stuff i'm sure(hope) she's already flying somewhere unharmed.. still, she had high expectations and ended up rather surprised.

Maybe he still has control and there was a titan behind her? Sounds possible.

But behind Mikasa is only more of the building.

Yeah... With all the debris it could only be a building. Idk where a titan is gonna hide, unless it's the 4m class ones (which I doubt would be in the building when the titans have been baited elsewhere near the wall)

have you seen the preview? skip the ED song and watch the last 5 seconds.

also, he punched a house and didn't blast through the other side.. he was going for her allright

personally, i think the preview gave away a little too much this time. or it could turn out to happen in the first five minutes i don't know.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah just like when he had balancing trouble with the 3D Maneuver Gear though I am hoping it will be a similar situation where he finds a way to control it.
>> ARTICLE
I thought they should've given him a day, or at least a practice run before going straight into it. He's transformed too much without knowing how things fully work. 
>> ARTICLE
How do you propose they give him a day to practice? Time is a factor, but more importantly you can't just release a titan somewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Clear out a section of town and surround him as they already were prepared to do when they were ready to kill him.

Too dangerous to try inside town anyway? Do it just outside, similar to what they were doing today except closer so they wouldn't need to attract as many titans and could manage the Eren situation. If he failed here, then everyone else wouldn't have to put as much effort into being bait.

Eren's nose was bleeding from is second half transformation just hours before, what if that was a sign he shouldn't transform this often, or could've died from transforming so often? How do they even know if his titan self is healed enough to attempt this.

Sure time is a factor. But the titans have been hugging that wall since they broke it (I assume) also less than a day ago. For one reason or another they never seem to go for breaking everything down at once, so they should've had more time.

I'm...halfway sure Eren will snap out of this and succeed for a temporary victory, but it isn't looking good right now and I think that's because they didn't give him time to attempt to learn control/regain mental health.
>> ARTICLE
They're probably also worried that the armored titan may show up again to breach the wall. They want to plug it immediately before the situation worsens or the soldiers completely lose it. Although, if the giant titans show up again they're pretty screwed regardless.
>> ARTICLE
>or the soldiers completely lose it

I think that's the biggest issue, right now. Most of the soldiers are about fed up, and already there's a lot of grumbling and people wanting to desert. I'm pretty sure the biggest reason Pixis wanted to do something about the situation right away is because he knows that if the Titans don't kill them, they're pretty close to all killing each other. After all, the deserters would have to be punished, but even if they walk away fine that's still a huge blow to their already small fighting force.

If things get any worse, there will be riots - people will demand to know why the army is so incompetent, why they aren't doing their job and protecting people. They had peace for 100 years before this and I'm sure the people inside the smallest wall are the pampered elites who have never even come close to Titans and therefore know nothing about them. They've never had to deal with this situation before, so they'll be much less understanding about it than the people who lived on the outskirts and always lived in fear of this sort of thing happening. Plus there's the food shortage to consider. If they have to retreat behind the third wall people will start fighting over bread, and there will be more riots and looting. Everything will dissolve into chaos and then they'll have absolutely no chance of fighting back against the Titans. They'll all be screwed.

Considering Eren, transformed THREE times in a day... 
First - Complete Transformation (FULL TITAN Body), yet zero control over, not evil (didn't care about humans), went ham on the other titans... 

Second - Half/Quater Transformation (1/2-1/4 Body, with no epidermis layer and 2/3's skeletal structure) Included head, neck, left arm, partial pectoral muscles. Stopped cannon, so he had a sense of control, slight. No harm, to protect Armin and Mikasa.  

Third - Full Transformation... yet it seems with no sense of control.. or purpose... and it seems to be after everyone... including loved ones... 
>> ARTICLE
Remember what he saud when the half body was collapsing? He transformed with the thought of protecting Mikasa and Armin. The body began to fall apart once that goal was reached. This leads me to believe that his thoughts at the moment of transformation are what drives his titan body (not his own will). After the entire exchange between him and Mikasa his thought as he transformed this time may have been something along the lines of "I'll show her I don't need her help!". This thought could have resulted in him attacking her. /wild speculation.

Pixis is one baller motherfucker. Also, the ending was not expected. At all. Whatsoever.

Goddamnit... this anime has a cliffhanger every single episode >_>

My guess is that Eren will try to either hunt the titans down or get revenge on the people that doubted him.

I guess that titanform Eren is acting on his deepest feelings and thougts?

I think he's going to rampage for a bit and then get snapped out of it by Armin or Pixis. There's no way they did all this build-up for nothing.

agreed. it's [her eyes](http://24.media.tumblr.com/912c0ebfacde7a922ab85b544c98355f/tumblr_mmrmuqTkzi1rut0qpo1_500.gif).. those radiating eyes filled with [bliss](http://i.minus.com/iboYPjkWVmIM3d.gif)! .. and [death!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/0b31b8d00953ae9390ff616553b48738/tumblr_mmop1dTSbC1rdol9po1_500.gif)

As a manga reader, I actually didn't like what they did to Mikasa's eyes.

[She lacked obvious pupils in the manga illustrations](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130515213261/shingekinokyojin/images/2/2c/Mikasa.jpg), so I expected the animated Mikasa to look more like [Ryougi Shiki](http://i.imgur.com/wEXDmz6.png). Her emotional expression is also less cold and subtle in the anime (overall) - and I felt that diminished the more heavy-hitting tearjerkers (1st time Eren emerging from Titan).

[Because I love it when a badass ice-cold killer is hit hard by humanity.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/f0c13e8e5b3fe0c3ed930a5de7bc43ea/tumblr_mjbgzg2lxQ1qhrxsqo1_500.gif)
>> ARTICLE
as an anime watcher i've only noticed mikasa's eyes swell up when eren was around.. rest of the time she was as dead as you describe her to be. shiki's eyes had tons of hate though.. mikasa is blank as stone. nice comparison btw
>> ARTICLE
It seems to me that Eren's titan mode has a kill priority of **Destroy all Titans->>Destroy all humans.** And if there are no titans around, he defaults to humans.
>> ARTICLE
Distinct possibility. I'm hoping that's not the case for humanity's sake, though, since Eren is much more effective at Titan-ing than most Titans are.
>> ARTICLE
My theory(I haven't read the manga) is that mikasa also has a titan side(explains her superhuman power) which titan Eren mistakes for a real titan thus punching her through the roof, now I expect titan mikasa to form in the next few episodes if my theory proves true.
>> ARTICLE
i doubt that mikasas would also have a titan mode since it would make erins titan mode less intresting and special if there was another one and mikasa's skill seems to be in Human Vs Titan fighting.
>> ARTICLE
What I meant by titan mikasa forming is that she loses her control over her feelings and conscious mind like how Eren  did when he first became a titan, and a huge fight ensues between the both of them.
>> ARTICLE
mindblown.jpg

I totally hadn't thought of that, but it would certainly be interesting. After all, Dr. Jaegar would have had just as much opportunity to experiment on Mikasa as he would have on Eren. I don't know about her being a Titan, but I would not at all be surprised if her awesome physical prowess was the result of some experiment too.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or does Pixis seem kinda similar to King Bradley from FMA???
>> ARTICLE
So Pixie gave Eren alcohol, and he lost control.

I'm probably thinking to much
>> ARTICLE
The pacing is getting worse and worse. They are barely pulling a chapter per episode by dragging it out... 

It's getting frustrating watching such a good show with good source material that is being paced so slow.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I originally wanted to wait till the entire series finished before diving in. Then I got curious one day and here I am... 
>> ARTICLE
The last two episodes were mostly a direct adaptation of the manga with some filler dialogue added. It's just following the manga's pacing, not that I think it's a good thing. I think they should have cut out some of the dialogue from the manga and combined the last two episodes into one. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree.

The manga is just barely 3X the length of the anime right now. The high BD sales, high animation costs and everything in this show means that its probably now a 'series' that we can expect.

I read the manga. This episode was SO much better than the manga's rendition of it even though nearly everything is verbatim. I couldn't feel the urgency, the power, the pride, the honor of Pixis and his message to the soldiers in the manga. It kinda went past that scene in about 20 reading seconds. The anime added scenes, images, and words to the speech but the additions made it just so much better. 

So yeah, its like 1 chapter per episode right now. But considering that this is probably going to be continued, the manga being just barely ahead of the series, and where they want to fix the mistakes/not as good parts of the manga. This is doing quite well.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's what you get when you read the manga. Different feel of pace for those that read the manga and those that didn't.
>> ARTICLE
The pacing feels off to me, and I haven't read the manga. Though I would rather that they pace it slowly than have to make their own story due to catching up to the manga. I just hope they don't pace it too slowly and have to blitz through some of the story. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here, and from the pacing I'm getting from the anime is that they're stretching out the story as much as possible so that there's enough breathing room for a second season/allowing the manga to get ahead.
>> ARTICLE
They're also making episode 14 a recap, so the manga will hopefully stay ahead. 
>> ARTICLE
For this season it will be fine, but the manga is released monthly while the anime is weekly. At it's current chapter of 46 it could be possible to have enough for when there is another season, but after that there would be very little to go from.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It was to be expected. Almost every semi-long anime (25+ episodes) have a recap episode for for the purpose of:

- Using the time to improve the animation quality 

- Bring in more people into the series without relying on previous episodes

Personally, I'd honestly wait a week rather than having less-than spectacular animation continuing to plague the series. It's a good move for Studio WIT, considering the complains they had to endure for their quality control and late deadlines.
>> ARTICLE
Currently there are 46 chapters in the manga. (ongoing)

The anime is slated for two cours (26 episodes this year). I'm guessing given the overwhelming success of it, more will be requested. 

The slow pacing is because the current state of the manga, the simple fact is if they went any faster they'd run out of material. 

We will probably get another two seasons next year when more chapters are written and the production of the anime can stay behind the manga at a proper rate.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, when I went to read the manga I was suprised at how much was written so far. I figured they were just gonna add another season.
>> ARTICLE
My first guess was that because he didn't go into it being focused on fighting titans, he reverted to the titan default mode of fighting people, BUT, it's interesting that he tried to punch Mikasa instead of grabbing her to eat her like a normal titan would.
>> ARTICLE
My guess, is that it's because he initially didn't want her to be there, and the titans act more out of base instinct. Since "i don't want you here" was in the back of his mind, that's what the titan latched on to.

At least that's the only thing that really makes sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
That would be the the most logical, I remember back a few episodes before they knew it was Eren they were talking about his titan attacking other titans out of instinct. Also, before Eren transformed he was totally set on killing titans, claiming he wouldn't give up when in the stomach of the titan that ate him. I suppose we found our first and major fault to Titan Eren, he acts only on instinct like every other titan.
>> ARTICLE
Why does Eren have to be so mean to Mikasa? First he denies and tries to headbutt her and then later tries to megaton punch her face in. D:
>> ARTICLE
Because she's constantly annoying him by making him feel inferior, I mean she constantly follows him wherever he goes saying that she will save him. That'd get me really annoyed and pissed off. In fact, i'm glad that he got mad at her this episode.

The music used during Pixis's speech was brilliant, I can't wait to get a hold of the OST.

I also really liked the music that played when Titan Eren appeared from the dust and rubble. The OST is one of the things I'm looking forward to most.
>> ARTICLE
Every time there's a crazy cliffhanger I think "well it couldn't possibly get any worse." Then the next episode comes out. This has been the worst cliffhanger yet.
>> ARTICLE
Well, this fucker's taking a while to, uh, be legally purchased, so I might as well lay out the score.

I think this show's been kinda struggling lately. My initial thoughts were: cool concept, the animation of the action scenes is great, the dramatic scenes come off as unfortunately melodramatic. My thoughts in the middle stretch, through the training and the gas raid, were: alright, cool, it's pretty superficial, but it's a fun action show and I like the idea of a sort of chessboardy squad-based tactical drama.

Recently?

Man, these last two episodes really didn't do it for me. The pacing has slowed to something well below a crawl  we've spent 40 minutes of screentime watching Eren, Armin, and Mikasa have a brief argument with a lunatic. There have been a lot of flashbacks, a lot of gaping, horrified expressions, and a lot of frantic repeated arguments.

I have not been impressed.

Fortunately, Pixis is apparently a huge plot-progressing badass, and he has successfully shoved us towards our next daring action gambit. This show occasionally pulls out some really superb moments that push character/plot development while also working as frenetic entertainment  I'm thinking of stuff like Mikasa's resolution to live just before Ereoten (yeah, I'm rolling Commie) appeared, or Eren's transformation sequence into Ereoten at the end of 9. But I think the show is most *consistent* when it's using the ensemble cast for daring heroism  and this attempt to re-secure the wall makes me hope we're getting more of that. Either way, more Pixis for me.

**Episode 11**

3:06 - That plan I came up with is ridiculous, and we're just running with it? I was thinking the same thing. Yeah Armin, turns out Eren just wanted to make you feel included last episode. Congrats on your character development, though!

3:57 - The Titans aren't our only enemies. Well, first of all, I was running Commie regardless, but I am very thankful they've decided to back down on that incredibly self-satisfied translation. But more importantly, this hopefully means we're gonna get into the psychology of war stuff  either through needing to give the people hope, or through needing to make a terrified populace accept something like Eren's power

4:22  Man makes horrified expression and grabs own head. Commanding officer turns back, wearing horrified expression. Horrified expression count: 2.

4:37: 4

4:44: 5

4:55: 9

5:01: 11

5:30  Okay, mocking this show's one expression is fun and all, but that sequence actually did go into the fraying mental state of the soldiers, which will hopefully lead to the importance of symbols or something (omg Eren is Batman), which is a good place for this show to be going

5:48 - If a powerful external threat were to appear, mankind would cease its squabbles and unite. Alan Moore nods approvingly

6:30  I like Eren's [head in the game, scrub](http://i.imgur.com/UOwQL8e.jpg ) expression

7:10  And Eren can't hold his liquor. I swear, this show has the weirdest sense of humor. On that note, brb whiskey

8:16  Pixis just keeps going up. Awesome that he's immediately framing Eren's trump card as a known top-secret project, so it's just another encouraging, reliable piece of their military apparatus, and not a crazy what-the-fuck-is-that nobody knows anything about

10:33 - There's a limit to how much one can be motivated by terror. Interesting choice of words, considering it seems Pixis' speech is designed to keep the troops level-headed and removed from their fear. Is this getting back to the complacency of the first episode, where the lack of an immediate threat weakened the military into indolence? Not sure what else they're referring to

11:26  Traitors? I'LL CUT YOU DOWN WHERE YOU STAND! Oh man! Weirdy beardy might be a terrible leader and strategist, but he's got Pixis's back! In his own, poorly-thought-through, likely-to-cause-a-riot kind of way

11:40  Hold the phone, isn't that the [lady of Pixis's dreams?](http://i.imgur.com/KZ8GNXx.jpg )

12:17  YES! Rally the FUCK out of those troops, Pixis! God, it is so good to see a goddamn general doing his actual goddamn job, and doing it *well*  I get pretty tired of all authority figures being incompetent buffoons

13:44  This speech is fantastic. Maybe the best moment of the series so far. No complaints

13:45 - I don't know if I can move that boulder, but I do know my dick is diamonds after that motherfucking speech.

14:07 - I must become a symbol of hope for everyone. What was that, Eren? I'm not sure I heard you  were you ratifying my suspicions about the entire point of this episode or something?

14:36  Sweet, weirdy beardy's glasses-pusher assistant will be joining us. I do love a good glasses-pusher

15:53  Pixis knows the plan is a massive gamble, so he attacks the logical elites through their pride, not their intellect. He is taking this show the fuck over, and I could not be more cool with that

16:42  Judging a man by the caliber of his drinking. C'mon Titan, I know when I'm being pandered to

17:30  I'm neither your little brother nor your kid. It's nice to see Eren directly address Mikasa's very specific relationship with him. I think a lot of this show's overwhelming commercial success lies in its avoidance of overt anime-isms, and they have a weird super-personal relationship and nobody talks about it is one anime-ism I am very happy to see die in a fire

19:25  Excellent, excellent little piece of episode-specific storytelling there. That would-be deserter was given a full narrative arc: from urging others to justify his desertion, to leading the exodus himself, to being drawn back by his desire to protect his family, to acting as one of the most stalwart believers in the necessity of their plan. And he wasn't even given a name. Fantastic storytelling

21:20  Jesus christ, does this show burn 98% of its budget on these flying sequences? Not actually complaining

**And Done**

Damn! Not sure specifically what that ending implies, but it reeks of a cheap cliffhanger that will be resolved in the first ten seconds of the next episode, so I ain't worried.

But fuck that noise. That episode was *awesome!* I think it was pretty easily my favorite of the series so far. My hopes for Pixis couldn't have been better-placed  he kept the plot moving at an extremely satisfying clip, was full of entertaining one-liners and casually tossed off a ridiculously inspired and thematically relevant speech. Speaking of thematics, holy shit, this episode actually had some real ideas! For the first time, I felt this show moved beyond being entirely about narrative points moving to other narrative points, and dabbled in greater ideas of how our mentality and psychology can dictate our potential. It was pretty much the classic Batman stuff (the people need a symbol), but I'm not complaining. It also advanced several characters in a much less beating-you-on-the-nose way than Armin's turn last week, outlined the greater significance of this conflict, and refused to wallow in tedious despair. Pixis, you're a pretty cool guy. Keep on slapping this show into fighting shape

>(yeah, I'm rolling Commie)

[...](http://i.imgur.com/cmo9rkL.png)
>> ARTICLE
I actually typed up a paragraph discussing this for one of my Maou-sama posts at some point, but decided to crop it for some reason.

I was originally completely anti-Commie because of their extremely self-indulgent flourishes - stuff like Eoten, or adding random profanity, etc. And I'm still completely against that stuff, and basically see it as sabotaging their own work to satisfy their own egos. But after reading the arguments here and comparing a bunch of lines myself (the "date" in OreGairu was ridiculously superior in Commie), I've decided those problems are rare, very obvious lapses in judgment, and in *general* their editors prioritize changing only what is necessary to capture the actual spirit and tone of the original lines, even if this requires changing the line itself. Their translations might be less word-for-word "accurate," but they have a very strong grasp of the natural rhythms of dialogue, and their translations come off as much less stilted because of that - they clearly have some actual writers, not just people who know both English and Japanese. And stuff like changing 2chan jokes to 4chan jokes... I mean, yeah, do that. I don't know any freaking 2chan jokes, and it's not like the original joke was critical to the intent of the story, so by all means, change it to something that conveys the same information about the character while not appearing like an incoherent non sequiter.

And yes, I know all these groups share members and have different people handle different shows, but it seems like Commie's *philosophy* is consistent across all their releases that I'm watching.

Now now, cut the man a break. He *has* been drinking.

I figured Eren would lose control. Another kinda slow episode because I liked this episode.

You know there's not many roars in anime that sound overly awesome to me. For the longest time my favorite was [Eva 01's in Shinji's fight against Zeruel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGNV0DZc8xY&list=FL-PYgQcFa21WQTmSVpd-eBw&index=229) but I think Rogue Titan's roar has topped it.

One more question. How long does it take for these episodes to come out. I watched all of them last night :/

Raws come out every saturday at about 9PM GST

Subs out about an hour/hour and a half after.

Jesus that fast? I never knew they translated that quick. I thought it took days.

Hmm? Fansubs come out between 1 and 3 hours after the raws pop up for currently airing shows.

Popular shows (especially ones that CrunchyRoll simulcast) might show up even sooner.

Some shows even get webrip releases before the TV release (eg Date a Live this season)
>> ARTICLE
How do these people even translate that fast? 
>> ARTICLE
>Subs out about an hour/hour and a half after airing.

Only if the show is simulcasted.

>Fansubs come out between 1 and 3 hours after the raws pop up

The raws are not up as soon as the episode finishes airing. They take around an hour to be available. 

* Shingeki 11 aired at Japan's 2AM (Sunday early hours). That's 17 UTC.

* [Zero-Raws] release was up at 18:32 UTC 

* [~~HorribleSubs~~ CrunchyRoll] 18:30 UTC (extremely fast because this is a simulcast rip)

* [gg] 22:48 UTC (worked on raw)

* [Commie] 22:54 UTC (worked on raw)

**That's a 4hrs delay for fansubs on the most popular show this season.**

One per week. But it's more like a year to me.

So the contrast between the still frames and the 3d gear scenes is getting really bad for me. It's breaking my  immersion to the point where  I just think "well here is the budget" whenever the one second of good animation for the episode occurs.

I don't mind them making the 3d gear scenes look so much better than everything else, I just wish they would make the transition less jarring.

It isn't a sin to want animation from an animation.
>> ARTICLE
it is a sin to overhype a series but that hasn't stopped anyone..

i get what you mean but i'll reiterate what i said last week: a LOT of scenes in all anime are just panned shots with dialogue and maybe one or two elements moving, and those shots are usually less detailed than the ones in SnK. most series - i haven't seen any tbh - do not have such beatiful fluid non-cg(not obvious anyway) 3d camera&character movements.. that's the price you pay for awesomeness of [that level](http://i.minus.com/ibp56tPf2O75UC.gif).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, though, these dialogue/monologue/planning scenes don't really offer many opportunities to take advantage of said budget. Also, out of curiosity, have you had similar problems with other Production I.G. shows? They're no strangers to high/low extremes in animation quality.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It was definitely way too optimistic to think that a person could just control the titan transformation whenever they want. I doubt the titans exterminating humans would have ever happened if that were so easy.
>> ARTICLE
Maaaaaan, the pacing for these ep now are slow as heo.
>> ARTICLE
Also, my guess is that his hate for Titans overshadowed their controll over him, now that he need to focus his energy on something not directly linked to killing Titans, things are a little more difficult.
>> ARTICLE
I'm also thinking he still has that residual anger from their earlier disagreement, so is lashing out.
>> ARTICLE
agreed
>> ARTICLE
Everyone seems to be describing how much of a Badass Pixis is, but I'm actually quite suspicious of his character.  Eren drinking the alcohol (as someone else mentioned) seemed to have done... something (?).  Either that or it's just comic relief and I'm thinking way too hard about it.  That's just speculation and I'll leave it at that.
>> ARTICLE
Why is Eren out of control? Did only partially transforming last time screw up this next transformation?
>> ARTICLE
i suspect is has to do with his emotional state. he seems to be a raging behemoth most of the time and doesn't seem to posess any rational faculties.
evidence: 

- he lashed out at mikasa with words -> ended up punching towards her
- saw his friend get eaten alive by specific titan -> went berserk after him
- is constantly screaming like he's going supersayian.
>> ARTICLE
he has lots of rational faculties, but you are right in that he goes berserk when his friends are involved.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this show has slowed down a lot since we discovered Titan-Eren.  Since then there has been fuck-all action, with a lot of shounen yelling.  I'd like a nice balance of action with plot and character advancement.
>> ARTICLE
Its a hard ballance. If they skipped some of the dialouge, the pacing could of easily felt extremely rushed, yet if they spend too long people start to complain about it dragging out. I personally think they are doing ok, considering how there actualy isnt much down time in the manga, no real break arcs
>> ARTICLE
I think it's very important to remember what exactly we've already seen. We started the anime with some brutal set up with 3 episodes of hyping the training scene, Then episode 5 comes out and it's just absolute insanity for 5 episodes straight I think right now it's best if we slow down a bit before all hell breaks loose for a second time and I have a feeling that it's gonna happen next episode when the plan falls apart (or gets dangerously close to falling apart)
>> ARTICLE
is SnK confirmed for 25 episodes?

Confirmed a long time ago.
>> ARTICLE
any idea where in the manga that would go up to?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe like chapter 30, IIRC, at the end of [The First Expedition](/spoiler) Arc
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for sounding stupid, but does that mean it will end there and not have any more episodes after? Or is this just a placeholder in case they get picked up for more?
>> ARTICLE
Given how popular it is it would most likely have a 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
I feel really doubtful with the pacing.
>> ARTICLE
Only the past 2 episodes are 1:1 pace, the rest had been covering more stuff
>> ARTICLE
From waht I hear, we've been doing nearly an ep/per chapter.

I haven't read the manga, but I don' tthink we're anywhere near 30.
>> ARTICLE
The eps in the beginning of the next arc will be a lot of talking, but its balanced out by a lot of action later on, which will speed up the adaptation amount
>> ARTICLE
25 isn't *that* much less than 30 you know....so saying "we won't get anywere near 30" is uh....well I guess it depends how big you perceive the number 5 to be...

and the first episode was a chapter and a half. Assuming it continues at that rate (I haven't compared the episodes to the manga myself) 30 chapters isn't unrealistic at all.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, shit. I totally misread that comment! I read that as saying that we're *currently* at 30. Sorry!

It's definitely reasonable for htem to finish the first arc in the 25 episodes. I might even go so far as to say it's expected, unless they decide to do an anime-ending.
>> ARTICLE
Got it XP

I haven't seen the last 3 episodes...but if this one ends where I think it ends, we're just about to start on chapter 14...though, the training for the military was covered earlier in the show than it was in the manga, so progression wise we've probably covered 17 chapters worth or so.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost all yelling in these past few episodes lol.
>> ARTICLE
Wow just like every episode before this one,I am shocked and angry that I have to wait a week till the next damm episode
>> ARTICLE
Allright so what is the thing that Pixis is seeing that others havent realized yet. How is it that he was the only one who was like: A Human Titan, nothing special. The way he came up with that lie of human weapon was just too quick. 

Could it be that there was really some kind of programm and the special titans are also humans who just went rouge, or did he trough learning about Eren start thinking that there could be other human titans who are on the enemies side.
>> ARTICLE
The ending kind of reminded me of the Eva-03 accident in Evangelion.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely interesting, but not overly shocking ending, seeing as how Eren never had recollections or memories of when he was in Titan form.  Previously when in Titan form, it seemed like it was based more on subconscious and spur-of-the-moment instinct.  

Kind of like early Naruto and his hidden Kyuubi fox powers.

That entire episode was a filler for that last moment.

As far as missions goes, this one shouldn't be THAT dangerous. Nobody is going after these titans. Seems to me like most of them just have to chill on the wall, and every now and then send the fast ones out to keep the titans interested.

She treats him like one to begin with.

The thing that bugs me about Eren's titan form is that sometimes he can change into a full titan but in episode 9-10 he changed into 0.5 of a titan

It's explained, the titan form does what it needs to do, e.g in episode 9 all it had to do was survive the cannon ball.

"What if he attacked another building?"

the unexpected ending aside, i think this episode really showed how pixis can become armin's role model in the future, especially the way they are both outstanding strategically. Armin was given a taste of power aswell which sets him on the path to take on pixis' role later on >

Eren epic titan roar at the end = Best scene
>> ARTICLE
decent episode was sat on the edge of my seat waiting for Eren to transform and man did it leave my jaw open. my take on the reason he tried to punch mikasa is because she had some weird strength before and Erens dad used to visit her before everything went to hell so basically the idea i have is that she has the power of titans but not like the complete power so basically she was a test subject for Erens dad and now Eren is the complete version so Eren now can sense her as a titan hence why he attacked her. any thoughts?

oh, I so knew that they would end the episode on that cliffhanger (they even gave him a bit of a reason to attack mikasa) but, dammit, i was looking forward to the transformation and then they go ahead and change the camera view briefly.

Nothing happened except, a lot of character development, and plot. Sorry that some anime have more than just mindless action. As someone who has read the manga, if you are going to throw a fit over not having every episode have some kind of action sequences in it, you best drop it now. 

Also I think this was the best episode yet.

I think that scene where Titan-killer regrew his hand after face-smashing the second Titan is probably supposed to be some callback, indicating Eren = Titan-killer and grew his arm and leg back. All speculation, of course, but I think it fits.

Does anyone have any idea as to what the meaning of the pomegranate lying on the ground means? SnK kept showing it while showing images of blood pulsing, so I guess it's some odd analogy of adrenaline or something? I honestly don't get this one...
>> ARTICLE
> I think that scene where Titan-killer regrew his hand after face-smashing the second Titan is probably supposed to be some callback, indicating Eren = Titan-killer and grew his arm and leg back.

Nice. I really think that sheds light on the subject.

I sincerely hope you have a great day.
>> ARTICLE
Shoot I just posted similar about the arm without reading your post first, my bad but I agree.

I think the pomegranate pulsing was more symbolic of a heart than adrenaline gland but honestly either fits. Did that thing come from the titan that got punched? Do they have crazy pulse hearts like Mikasa now has? Is that why she has super strength? So many questions but I refuse to read the manga because I'm enjoying being surprised every week.
>> ARTICLE
The first thing I think of when I see a pomegranate is the Greek myth of Persephone, who is kidnapped by Hades and brought to the underworld. In the myth, she is not supposed to eat any food in the underworld, lest she be condemned to stay there for eternity, but Hades tricks her into eating 6 pomegranate seeds. This causes her to have to stay 6 months of the year in the underworld, even after she is freed. The myth explains the origins of the seasons (the earth going dormant while Persephone is in the underworld, and then regenerating when she returns).

Taking this myth into account, in Shingeki no Kyojin, I saw the pomegranate as a symbol of life, death, and renewal, with Mikasa having already "died", or given up on life, when her parents were killed. As she stares at the pomegranate with the titan looming, wondering why she continues to live on despite being resigned to death, her blood or cells pulse with life. I saw this imagery as a reflection of how Mikasa (as well as other characters, such as Eren) are inescapably mired in both life and death (like Persephone who lives both in the underworld and above ground), no matter what they do.

The amount of cruelty they have seen has marred them, and like the pomegranate seeds Persephone eats, sets them apart from all others. And, while others may give up on life by committing suicide etc., Mikasa and Eren continually stand up, finding some way to live even if all seems lost - perhaps similar to how the earth renews itself only after the darkest part of the winter, with Persephone's return from the underworld. I definitely see both Mikasa and Eren as characters who have one foot in the underworld, and one food in the land of the living, similar to Persephone.

Another thought: pomegranates are also symbols of fertility, so if you combine it with the imagery of the cell/blood pulsing, you could interpret it as Mikasa's innate will to survive. Her very cells/DNA are striving to live on, even if she's given up in her mind.

Hope I'm not stretching this symbolism too far, haha....

TL;DR: Pomegranate = Greek myth of Persephone, life/death/rebirth, and symbol of fertility.

growing the arm back was evangelion 2.0 status

And the part where the titan-killing-titan stomps on the first titan it kills reminds me of when Shinji went crazy mad after the dummy system nearly killed Auska. The stomping motion, I mean.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
About the pomegranate, this is a big speculation, but I like to link the pomegranate to the myth of Persephone's abduction. Even though Persephone ate pomegranate seeds and was required to stay in the Underworld, she was still allowed to go up onto Earth. Mikasa may have been experiencing her own hell, but then her new found drive to live gave her surge to lift herself up from the darkness.
>> ARTICLE
On the regular thread, /u/Kitawa mentioned the following:

>That's pomegranate

>interesting stuff from the wikipedia page :
In the Ancient Greek mythology, the pomegranate was also known as the "fruit of the dead"

>In Christianity The fruit, broken or bursting open, is a symbol of the fullness of Jesus' suffering and resurrection.[77]

>The Qur'an also mentions pomegranates three times (6:99,[81] 6:141,[82] 55:68[77]) as examples of good things God creates.

>Pomegranate was the symbol of fertility in ancient Persian culture.[citation needed] In Persian mythology, Isfandiyar eats a pomegranate and becomes invincible. In the Greco-Persian Wars, Herodotus mentions golden pomegranates adorning the spears of warriors in the phalanx. Even in today's Iran, pomegranate may imply love and fertility.[citation needed]

>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate

The Christian symbolism might lend credence to Eren being resurrected as a Titan (just like Jesus returned from the dead as a fully divine being), after suffering in the belly of the bearded Titan. I'm not Christian, though, so forgive any inaccuracies...
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
>Also I have to say that in the traditional heroes journey, Eren getting eaten strongly lines up with the belly of the whale[1] phase, which would also imply a rebirth (as something greater than before).

That comparison actually works out really well, I honestly wouldn't have thought to compare Eren's personal journey to the monomyth.

**Shingeki No Kyojin Kill/Badassery count:**  

**Mikasa**: 6 Titans^*+2* , 2 Badassery  
 

**Eren**:  1 Badassery  



**Potato Girl**: 1 Badassery, Best motivational words (Cowards! Weaklings! Retards!) 

**Angry Titan**: 2 Titans, Best at shouting matches  

   



*I'll probably keep updating as this goes, and having episode specific things added for spice and humor, rabid dogs kill count removed as they probably won't be touched again, if they are i'll add it back.*


>> ARTICLE
Eren should have 2 badassery.  He went at the Colossal Titan without hesitation and he pulled Armin's punk ass out of another Titan's mouth when he was missing a leg at the time.
>> ARTICLE
mmm, i have gone back and revised it actually, see one of the other posts attached; his count is currently at 3, next ep i'll have it continued from the revised edition.
>> ARTICLE
Very nicely done then, keep up the good work.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if people will notice, i might edit it in to the original...  

Done my re-watching and checking, keeping all the data in a spreadsheet to keep track and have changed the counts on a few things, specifically badassery count (hey its more badass than what i originally thought) so our totals:  


**Shingeki No Kyojin Kill/Badassery count:**  

1.  **Mikasa**  
 * 6 Titans  (Six 15m class)
 * 4 Badassery  
 

1.  **Eren**:  
 * 3 Badassery  



1.  **Potato Girl**: 
 * 1 Badassery

1.  **Angry Titan**: 
 * 2 Titans (Two 15m Class)
 * 1 Badassery  

1. **Annie**  
 * 1 Badassery  

1. **Commander Pixis**  
 * 1 Badassery  

Currently Humans killed by Titans: **31** deaths, **8** additional deaths possible.  

Suicide count: **1**  

The human kill count is fairly tricky, as its hard to tell if they are showing different people, or if its just a limb and not a body, so 31 are confirmed from seeing the body, and 8 additional would be for limbs or something that does not make it clear that someone died, such as the soldiers being blown back by the armoured titan's charge.   

Thanks to /u/Muragoeth for pointing out the Titan class point.
>> ARTICLE
I just realised that Eren never get to cut down a titan
>> ARTICLE
Just a suggestion but would it be wise to divide the titans into classes? Since its harder to kill a 15 meter one then a 3 meter one. Otherwise someone who kills a 15 meter one has the same score as someone who kills a 3 meter one. 


>> ARTICLE
not a bad suggestion, i'll do that for the next one and do some rechecking of the previous and see if people prefer it. Only problem i see is that it might be a difficult sometimes to find height, and it could make it look messy.  

I'll see what i come up with though
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, going to actually backtrack to see, although it might be difficult to *know* if its a specific class, might just need to assume if theyre taller then buildings theyre 10-15 class incisde buildings would be 3-6 and ones that are in the middle will be 6-10.
>> ARTICLE
I think the 15 meter class titans are as tall as buildings not bigger. If you look at episode 7 where Connie says shit there's 2 15 meter class titans. Both seem to be about as tall as bigger buildings. 

Also as far as ive seen there are 3 types of titans. So i think we could classify them as such. 

3-4 meter ones that can get insinde buildings. (about as tall as a small house maybe?) 
15 meter ones that are as tall as the big buildings or most buildings. i guess
Abnormals. (Armored titan, Colossal titan, Berserker/Teamkill titan)

Ill check ep 7 now and see what the kill count is for this episode. It should take some work off your shoulders. And i feel like watching it again. So it's a win win. 

Ep 7

Mikasa: 1, 15 meter titan. (i think the slouching one seems to be a bit shorter then a building. But after it falls backwards it appears to fall against the entire building so id say its 15 meters)

Berserker/Teamkill Titan: 2, 15 meter titans. 

I think that's it for ep 7. 

Do you also count the titan kills btw? Like how many people got eaten and such?

I look forward to you final score tally after the series finishes.
>> ARTICLE
i'm probably going  to do a rewatch and do a tally for titan kills too as i won't recall from memory for the first ep. (just an fyi I've read the manga and iirc they sectioned each class at 3-5 / 7 /  15 i believe, could be wrong on that) so i'll probably go with that, which would mean 2 15 m for mikasa and angry/berserk/teamkill titan this ep.  7m class have big heads in relation to body, just checked the wiki.

The colossal titan and armored titan are special so i'll have to figure out how to put them down after.  


>> ARTICLE

As they likely aren't going to kill a person again or atleast for a long time imo, i'll leave it out to make it cleaner - if they do indeed dispatch more rabid dogs i'll add it back to the count, ive got it all in a notepad.

Tons of foreshadowing in this episode. Also a question that came to my mind is why mankind doesn't live underground like in Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
They talk about in this episode how it would be hard to fight a titan indoors, if titans got into the underground tunnels it would be a slaughter, more so than it currently is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but you have seen how big titans are compared to humans. What would stop them from making all hallways and rooms so small the titans can't fit in them or at least really short so they couldn't fit in unless they wanted to go in on their sides (could they even do that? Better yet would they even be smart enough to?). Just making them about half as tall a titan would give lots of room for things and make it nearly impossible for titans to get in. And yeah there is the colossal and armored titan to worry about about but is it one thing to break a man made wall that is thin (thin compared to a titan or even thinner compared to a mountain) and another to break through massive amounts of earth.
>> ARTICLE
Titans vary greatly is size, anywhere between 4m to 15m. In order to stop a 4m class titan you would have to build every hallway in a way that even they couldn't fit through sideways, it would be extremely cramped tunnels. And you just can't do that for in order to house the entire population, an underground city big enough to house the population of the inner wall would take centuries to build without modern drilling technology. Then there are problems with agriculture and hunting. Moving underground without farms up top is simply impractical. When they lost the first wall they had a huge food shortage, that would be far worse if they couldn't farm or hunt.
>> ARTICLE
Dam it. I keep on forgetting that they are semi medieval. Because of some of the higher tech they have developed because of the need to fight the titans I keep forgetting they aren't even close to the level of tech we have. While we might be able to find a way to move underground the people in this show aren't even close to our level up tech so they have no chance.

You aren't defending the supplies, you are defending the entire district. Also I didn't make it clear before but of course you'd have a central location/depot with most of your supplies but you would also have secondary locations to resupply on the field. Even if the central depot gets taken out you still have supplies remaining + resupply on the front lines is much faster.

This is what I was wondering...Why wouldn't they have smaller areas where you could just refuel a bit? Obviously there would be a main supply area but even an idiot would place at least tiny emergency supply buildings.

It's heavily implied through the series that the current government is cowardly, weak and retarded. This is just one of those examples, I'm guessing some time further in the series, there's going to be some changes. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok i haven't read the manga and here's my theory:

The injection that Eren's father gave him, bestowed him with the power to transform into titan. I'm guessing that this power functions much like Bruce Banner/The Hulk 
>> ARTICLE
Here's a thought - Eren's father found a way to use humans as vectors for some virus that makes Titans fight each other. If we're doomed to be eaten anyway, might as well put our deaths to good use.

As for the key? Maybe a hoax to ensure that Eren goes back and gets himself eaten by a Titan.
>> ARTICLE
This is the only explanation that I will accept if Eren is the Titan.  
Otherwise, Eren being the Titan is way to fanfiction-y, and pretty blas. "...Mikasa was saved by the Titan because...*the Titan was Eren!*"   
The fact that everyone in this thread assumed this shows that it's pretty weak. It definitely needs a reasonable tie-in, like the father's injection playing a part, otherwise it will play off as too typical and fanfic-y. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, also! it showed him growing his limb back. Which means he can regenerate. Thus his arm and leg grew back. dude this show..

>> ARTICLE
dont forget all titans can regen and stuff unless u get their neck. it said that in another episode.
>> ARTICLE
Whilst highly plausible, the only issue, is the injection has been depicted as a dream at this point of time

There needs to be some explaining on this later
>> ARTICLE
He dreamed about getting the key and he had the key after the dream, so his dad was probably there the night before he woke up. (I don't know how much time passed between the scene on the boat and him waking up.)
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't a dream. They had actually met on the way from Wall Maria to Wall Rose. Eren was just dreaming about the encounter.
>> ARTICLE
So Eren just out of nowhere dreamed his dad went crazy and injected him with some serum?
>> ARTICLE
Can you remind what ep that was i wanna go back and watch it. TY
>> ARTICLE
Freudian states that it's a repressed thought after seeing his mum being *eaten*.

Ah, the power of subconscious
>> ARTICLE
>I'm guessing that this power functions much like Bruce Banner/The Hulk

if that were true it would've triggered before he engaged the titan squad. it's more likely the power is activated once he got into the titan's body via ingestion and then took it over like an advanced parasite.

this would mean eren's physical body wouldn't be recovered and he'd be permanently a titan.. unless he's in some way integrated inside the titan biophysically mecha style: "piloting" the titan in a psycho-frame interface like the one in dragonballz when Buu had other people inside of him and melded himself with them in that way.
>> ARTICLE
my 4 theories are: It's Eren, It's Eren and he can hulk out, It's his dad, or Mikasa was right about it being humanities anger or some shit.  Either way, Is it a week later yet?
>> ARTICLE
1. The titan regen's his left hand, same hand Eren lost.
2. Titan mutilated the titan that was attacking Mikasa but coolly took out the second one once Mikasa was safe.
3. They have the exact same hair color.
4. Main character isn't gonna die that fast and that easy (Sorry to all the Kamina fans out there XD). 
>> ARTICLE
Or like in Bleach. Tame the power of the enemy and all.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised. It's a pretty common theme. Bleach, Soul Eater, Medaka Box, and many others do the same thing.

Personally I'm wondering if that titan isn't Eren, but rather the one that ate him. Maybe those injections turned Eren into a parasitic being to the titans that can modify the body and take control when eaten. I don't think that's likely, though, because this titan seemed to be built much differently than the titan that ate Eren. Unless it results in some serious modification to the titan's body, I don't think it's very plausible. Just a wild theory of mine.
>> ARTICLE
The titan is completely different from all the others except maybe the armored titan. While others are fat, Titan-kun has abs down to his knees.
>> ARTICLE
What episode specifically does eren get the injection?
>> ARTICLE
One of the flashback scene in ep2 methinks.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the injection stopped him from transforming instead of giving the power to do so. I mean if the trigger for him to get pissed/see someone get hurt it was bound to happen when he was a kid.
>> ARTICLE
I know right? I'm really hoping that that theory holds true. First of all, Eren lost his left hand, which the titan regened. Could be symbolism. Second, the titan freaked out and mutilated that titan that was gonna attack Mikasa but just took out the second one in one hit. Perhaps Eren/titan got mad and protected her and cooled down and actually fought the second titan with his hand-to-hand. Third thing (though it kinda pales in comparison) is that they both have the same colored hair.
>> ARTICLE
How's he going to turn back human though?  Or will he just be like that for the rest of the anime?
>> ARTICLE
Titan-kun and friends. The mischievous deeds in Trost where his gigantic size creates so many misunderstandings and problems for the local residents.

"Titan-kun, you're late."

"RAAAAAGH"

While I am not fully in support of this theory yet, I do want to point out the symbolism of the rogue titan regenerating his left arm. The same one Eren lost when he got chomped.

Plus they mentioned the key to the basement so it has to come up again right? Key got eaten too?
>> ARTICLE
Well think about this, if Eren did not become a Titan what possible scenario exists in which Armin doesn't die? There was no one around to save him, and no Titans around when they found him. Literally any other human being would have interacted with him so he should have at least moved. 

Titan man Eren on the other hand would likely not be able to communicate, and would have just smashed any titans that happened to be around.
>> ARTICLE
Key/basement = Chekhov's gun. 

It'd be really disappointed if they just decided to forget about it
>> ARTICLE
Exactly the reference I was thinking but forgot the name. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap thats right. I totally forgot about the flashback with the injection! This could actually be true man. For longer I had a feeling that the dad of Eren (and the basement) has something to do with the titans. My theory is that the titans were created by experiments on humans. Maybe the experiments took place in the basement? 

Or maybe its just that the father of Eren was working on an antidote against the titans or something like that in the basement...

Edit; Or the father of Eren realized that the only way for mankind to survive is to become titans who can fight the other (bad) titans. So he was working on this in the basement, found a way (injected Eren with this, in case that...) and wanted to massproduce this "potion"...

So many theories man xD
>> ARTICLE
Remember his father 'cured' some plague (e01)? I'm assuming it had something to do with that.
>> ARTICLE
That has to be more recently than when the titans appeared over a century ago, otherwise don't you think someone would have remarked how amazing it was that he is a centurian?
>> ARTICLE
The theory pile doesn't stop from getting taller:

Remember last episode when it was mentioned a couple times that Mikasa knew Dr. Jaeger, and they asked if she remembered him from when she was little?  Then she suddenly breaks a floorboard and knife handle attacking that slaver.  Now this episode we're talking about how strong Mikasa is and we have the pulsing bood/pomegranate scene.  If Eren's injections gave him titan powers, I'm starting to think Mikasa might have gotten a healthy dose of some experimentation, as well.
>> ARTICLE
If the titans were an experiment gone wrong in the past, and Dr. Jaeger was messing around with replicating the results in Eren, I'm guessing that Mikasa was possibly made into a 'failsafe'. There's also the possibility that, since all titans appear male, she just responded differently.

That scene where that Titan was stomping on the other felt very Evangelion-esque for me, even the scream. Maybe Eren's anger was so strong it got absorbed by the Titan who ate him and turned it into that. Hell! I don't know what I'm talking about!
>> ARTICLE
Eren's father injected something to him, it's probably something that gives him titan powers/regeneration, I think he's basically the Hulk and can transform to a titan if he gets mad.

hand regrowth scene was evangelion too.

Im really hoping that somehow eren was reincarnated as that titan and is going to fuck shit up.
>> ARTICLE
Wink wink nudge nudge
>> ARTICLE
That was my first thought.

But this anime has subverted my expectations so often already that I don't think that Titan is Eren, mainly because I think it is Eren.

If that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how he reincarnated though? Did that bearded titan chuck a big shit and then eren rose from the pile of ashes(shit rather) like a phoenix?

EDIT: downvotes? what for lol!
>> ARTICLE
The colossal titan was teleported right infront of the front gates and disappeared in an instant, the titan could have been summoned that way too.
>> ARTICLE
No remember that shot his father gave him in episode what ever? I bet you his father did some research or something so that he will become a titan. And under that basement there's going to be more crazy shit. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even think of that, but it makes sense he would do research into anti-titan weaponry.

I figured it out, basement is laboratory full of cloned Mikasas.  Humanities ultimate weapon

You sir. Are going places

> And under that basement there's going to be more crazy shit.

gundams and magical girls, no doubt.

Yes i remember it but if it made him a titan what happened to the bearded bald one that ate eren?
>> ARTICLE
Good point,, however, knowing Eren  (with massive cojones) he probably tried to fight his way out with one arm and leg (possible fullmetal reference now that I realize lol) anyway maybe found his way to the titans heart, (mouth>esophagus>heart>stomach considering the titans have the same human organs (except reproductive ones) idk just speculation... I should STFU now...

Maybe he exploded and this new titan emerged.

He could have taken his body over and transformed it a bit.  That'd explain how he went from small to huge.

If this theory is correct, he's probably more inside-out than inside-in now.

Erin Is the titan. This seems painfully obvious to me, and I haven't even read the manga.

in one of the earlier episodes, something along these lines was foreshadowed... Dr. Erins dad had something kick ass that he was working on locked away in his basement, and then as soon as Erin dies, a titan killing titan rolls all up in the shizzle. 

Their is also the question of Misakas complete and absolute badassitude. How is it that she can run through titans like she's beating one legged puppies when everyone else on the field seems to always be twelve steps behind?

Dem shots.

>Their is also the question of Misakas complete and absolute badassitude. How is it that she can run through titans like she's beating one legged puppies when everyone else on the field seems to always be twelve steps behind?
Dem shots.

maybe no one else's parents were violently murdered in front of her then kidnapped for selling into slavery then saved by a kid she never knew before who motivates her into killing the last kidnapper.

Mikasa's badassness is her own.. she did almost die out of her recklessness once she lost her cool. imo she would have died had eren-titan not appeared as she had no more gas and whatever resistence she'd put up to the titan she hardly had a chance of reaching the back of its neck anymore.

when eren died he was up against a squad of titans.. so far mikasa only dealt with 1v1s and was never caught by surprise - the way eren lost his leg for example.
>> ARTICLE
Same, as soon as I saw the titan run past Mikasa, I instantly accepted that it was Erin. It's definitely the most likely theory so far.
>> ARTICLE
The titans eyes looked familiar imo
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I thought the bigger hint was all the yelling the titan was doing. The pose it was making is exactly like Eren's.

To be honest, I'm a little disappointed if he's been reincarnated as a titan. I would rather see humanity battle the threat and find a way to win rather than essentially becoming what they've been fighting for the last 100 years.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. It opens a wide potential for the context and plot as well as adds a tragic element for the story. So they have a titan on their side, they can actually start fighting back, on a leveled playing field. Not only is the whole titan v titan thing epic in its own right, it plays the theme of mindless combat v skill and technique amazingly. We can explore more of the world now, without being limited by the characters mobility and just the sheer epicness of how they may take this especially with that they've done so far is exciting. Don't forget, if the titan is eren, doesn't that just explode of emotional potential, now that he can longer have a family, have a settling life, he has become the very bane of his existence, and will probably die fighting tragically. Humanity will have a justified way to learn about the titan's and we'll be seeing more strategy, techniques and awesome ways the humans can still fight back now. Eren would just be the tank class, and they definitely need one if they want to go up against the colossal or armoured titan. I can't see this as anything but an absolutely brilliant plot twist for the future of the story, and we haven't even got into the conspiracy like plot behind it all yet.
>> ARTICLE
And knows hand to hand combat...
>> ARTICLE
That confirms it. Annie is a transsexual titan who can change her hair color.
>> ARTICLE
And the symbolism of growing his left arm back, it's blatantly obvious it's Eren.
>> ARTICLE
Him being a titan would be cool.

But I want him to come back as a human...
>> ARTICLE
Maybe he can like turn it on and off? That would be badass.
>> ARTICLE
I can see it now:

Someone: "We need more power! Eren!"

Eren: "Alright! TITAN MODE GO!!!!!!"

*Start transforming sequence."
>> ARTICLE
Well it is a shounen, so I can believe this. 
>> ARTICLE
With a magical girl transformation sequence.... ohhh i would kill 1000 titans for a gif of this...
>> ARTICLE
I think it's almost certain that he will return, my guess is the he takes on the form of a Titan when he's extremely angry, hence Mikasa's statement about the anti-Titan Titan being human's rage/anger.

Eren Smash.

Wow that was a heavy episode (again). Especially the scene were the guy shot himself in the mouth...

Btw calling it now: That BAMF Titan is Eren! So does this mean that all the humans that were eaten by titans reincarnate into titans?

They did say that they don't know how titans reproduce...

I think that's the case as well.

When the good Titan with the abs was killing the other titan at around 18 minutes, they showed two pictures for a split second between shots of the titan and Mikasa. 

[This.](http://i.imgur.com/9zVFfLc.jpg)

[And this.](http://i.imgur.com/racLPn9.jpg)

What's the meaning of this? 

EDIT: To people saying the second one was survival instinct kicking in: Yes, this was shown with heart beat sounds when the happy titan was walking towards her, but I'm talking about two minutes later, when Eren-Titan stomped the shit out of happy titan. They showed that picture again for a split second.
>> ARTICLE
Must have something to dow ith their regeneration and the mutation of how they actually work, seeing ast hey ahve no reproductive organs, and how they actually reproduce is still unknown.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm.. maybe it's some kind've Titan SUPER POWA that gives them their strength? Or what's inside of them, idk?
>> ARTICLE
the first is a hint as to what titans bodies are probably made of, I think that's the piece of finger mikasa sliced of the happy titan. 

The second must be like in episode 6, mikasa's muscles started contracting, her brain activating, this one is like blood starting to flow or something?
>> ARTICLE
i agree with the finger thing. ever read that scary story (i think it was in those classic 'scary stories' books) where the giant beast is chasing a kid and its weak point is in its little finger? i kept thinking about that.

i thought the second pic might be her sensing erens presence or something.

then that confirms it. Titans are actually edible... and very delicious
>> ARTICLE
And they're regenerating too. End to world hunger!
>> ARTICLE
Revenge never tasted so sweet
>> ARTICLE
The first is a pomegranate I think.

The second one is the same imagery used when her shit kicked into gear when she was about to stab the guy trying to kidnap her. Like, her adrenaline or whatever. I think. 

Edit: I'm too dumb to glean any meaning from it

I think it's supposed to signify Mikasa's survival instinct 'cells' kicking in or something

I dislike the term, but *visceral* is the only was I can describe this show and this episode. It's intense, action-packed and it has never bored me. It's not even predictable. I sure hope Eren won't be a full time giant from now on, though.
>> ARTICLE
When Mikasa was like "If I gave up, I wouldn't be able to remember you." Fucking touched me right in the feels, man.

*Right in the feels.*
>> ARTICLE
Really liked this episode. Started off really dark but it really captured how people would react in a situation where people were dying all around you. Mikasa is definitely my favorite character along with Sasha. 
I loved how her body wouldn't let her die and she kept moving that was too cool. I also kind of hope that Titan is Eren and he is ready to kick some ass. I half expected it to wink at Mikasa after it killed that one Titan. The music was also really good. This show keeps getting better and better. Can't wait to see what really happened to Eren.  
>> ARTICLE
Knockout! How awesome would a boxing match between two Titans be? FUCKING AWESOME IS THE ANSWER 
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy Mikasa as much as the next guy, but I'm really missing Erin. I even was trying to imagine the badass new titan to be Erin somehow. 

This episode had more hopelessness and humans dying without being able to do anything. Really scary to be in the situation where you're basically screwed so you might as well struggle. 

With all of Mikasa's screentime we saw her take on some actual emotion. First was yandere eyes (I just finished Mirai Nikki, so its just the first thing I think of), rage, despair, and newfound strength. Luckily, Mikasa won't give up thanks to Erin's actions and will have grown a bit more from feeling like shes the only one capable od doing anything (even though she kinda is). Also the shots of Mikasa's close up face, anyone notice the detail they put into the eyes?

Dat new titan. Supposed to be human's anger reincarnated eh? Where did that mofo come from, because humanity probably needed his epic Bitch slapping power a long time ago. Saved Mikasa and seems to be the new head of the attack on the support building for gas.

Next episode, we see something even more horrific based on what the preview said. After everything we've seen so far, including a gleeful suicide in the beginning, I'm expecting something pretty gruesome or inhumane for next week.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Sasha... Every word you say in an episode is gold, especially what you said after Mikasa's speech.
>> ARTICLE
When I saw the titan-killing titan with more humane features (styled hiar) I was like "don't make it turn out that Eren actually turned into a titan". It would kind of ruin it for me - am kind of tired of seeing over powered characters and stuff.
Appart from that I love how the show portrays the idea that 'there isn't always a hero to save you' by creating scenes where you know that the characters are doomed and have no hope of being rescued :3
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you mean but I was getting tired of everyone except Mikasa getting eaten alive immediately.I feel like they made their point, the titans are not meant to be fucked with but I mean are they just gonna let all the characters except for one suck.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that was annoying - everyone can't do shit and there you have Mikasa, who at a very young age underwent a super saiyan transformation, saving the day killing all dem titans.
>> ARTICLE
That was one intense episode. 

I was not sure which feel I should actually feel when it went from Mikasa learning about Erens demise to her pumping up the demoralized Unit, which was a 'bright' moment. But it had an underlying tone of misery. Then Mikasa got trapped and gave up on life just to get PUMPED in the next moment by flashback-Eren. And then the teamkill Titan appeared and I was just confused.

Yeah, I don't know how to feel all those feels.
>> ARTICLE
>Then Mikasa got trapped and gave up on life just to get PUMPED in the next moment by flashback-Eren.

Because her body goes on.
>> ARTICLE
As Armin said "She wants to drown out her pain with action". Makes it much sadder that she didn't really know how to react to Eren's death. 
>> ARTICLE
Pure unadulterated bewilderment.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, this was an insane episode! Why do I get the feeling that the new titan is somehow Eren? the week wait is going to be hell...
>> ARTICLE
The eyes, hand to hand combat, and the symbolic representation of his arm regenerating? It's pretty obvious that it's Eren, or something along those lines.
>> ARTICLE
And the fact it's so pissed it wants to kill every single titan possible also supports this(Think of it, it/he was as just pissed as this when that damn titan ate Thomas, poor guy...).
>> ARTICLE
It probably has something to do with that shot he was given
>> ARTICLE
Serious steroids.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that in the last 2 episode threads, no one seemed pay attention to or question one particular issue, which would take out some of the confusion  about current events: How did  [](/s 'Armin survive after Erin got eaten, being surrounded by titans and in an unresponsive/shock-state' ). 
>> ARTICLE
Not a spoiler. It's a valid question. Armin was found in the same place that Eren left him to live after all.

Extremely long recap of the events in the beginning was like super unneeded. 

I guess, Erin (due to shot from his Dad) somehow made that bearded Titan mutate and took over that body partially - or at least channeled his anger against the Titans into that body.

My predictions: Mikasa is to become a new MC, the whole purpose of Erin was to die, create that anti-titan Titan and inspire the rest. Kinda like [Zetsuen no Tempest](/s "and Aika").
>> ARTICLE
They are probably thinking that word of mouth is so good (esp. after cliffhanger of ep 5.) that more and more new people are gonna see the episodes, so it would be wise to give them recaps, esp. since the setting isn't that overtly complex atm moment. Oh yes, and money saving/pacing.
>> ARTICLE
>Extremely long recap of the events in the beginning was like super unneeded.

Probably trying to conserve money.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if it's money or saving animator lives at this point 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like the flashback when Mikasa realizes that it's her responsibility to protect people, and that she can't give up.

Yeah we saw that like, 4 minutes ago. Just react properly and we the viewers, who are not dumb, will understand that you had that epiphany.
Anime loves flashbacks, especially flashbacks that aren't even from the character's POV.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember correctly that was actually almost a panel for panel adaption from the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I believe you are correct. It's a personal storytelling/stylistic grudge that I hold.

Also, on the subject of adaptation, this anime has been an almost 100% adaptation. Very impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it pisses me off as well. At least Shingeki does it well. There are a lot of shows that break into flashback, or other filler bullshit and does a terrible job with it. I don't mind a bit of filler in an episode, but if it's only purpose serves to be filler then it is rather frustrating.

Sasha's way of calling them cowards, weaklings, retards and the special class titan (who is probably Eren) putting up that boxing stance was so unexpected and hilarious. 7 days please come faster!!!

Instead of doing my extremely late coursework essay, I'm in an anime discussion thread. 

Practically, what this means is that I just read about a version of the myth of Persephone, who is associated with the pomegranate, having her son Dionysus/Zagreus, Zeus' intended heir, **devoured by Titans** - only his heart remained, from which he was reborn (ErenErenErenEren). In revenge, Zeus strikes down the titans with thunderbolts, and from their ashes, humanity is born.

It's not a version I'd heard before reading this book on Plato, and it's not really compatible with the other Greek myths I knew, nor does the symbolism match up exactly with Attack on Titan. It is however, pretty interesting regardless, and a sign from Zeus himself to disregard all deadlines.
>> ARTICLE
Ohey, it's Titan. Also known as that show you should probably comment on in the first hour because holy fuck there are already 300 comments. So I guess I kind of screwed that one up. POWER THROUGH.

**Episode 7**

1:58  Full recap of show so far accomplished in two minutes, further demonstrating the ridiculousness of recap episodes. How about instead of recap episodes, from now on we just get 23 minute videos of show creators profusely apologizing for not making a real episode that week? That sounds more watchable to me

4:17  I've had a number of conversations this week that basically come down to people telling me I'm underestimating Titan, and that it actually has some intellectual weight behind it. So this week, I'll be trying to see if I can draw some depth out of everyone's favorite action spectacle. And here's the first potential clue in that direction  the commander hiding behind orders to justify his retreat from the front. Obviously, both this kind of action and the opposite action in heroes (I can't follow orders, they're dying out there!) are pretty much cliches at this point, but lines similar to this have appeared a few times so far, so I'll be interested in seeing if the show is actually generally condemning these dehumanizing and blame-dividing mechanical systems, and promoting individuality and humanity in the course of war. We'll see

5:07  Why are they hiding in a room that faces the windows?

6:16  Connie and Jean bickering. I really like them including scenes with none of the main three present  I think a show like this will work better if their squad really is an ensemble cast

7:48  And they actually take the time to check in with the entire squad. Nice. I like all of this

10:54  I'll fight them all alone. You're all just cowards. It actually kind of strains my understanding of Mikasa's character to have her be this good at manipulating people. Her completely internalizing Eren's death and showing no emotion, *that* I totally buy  but instantly becoming an effective drill sergeant? I dunno

110:6 - Unless I fight, I cannot win. And then they completely dispel my complaint by overtly linking her statements here to the first thing Eren ever taught her. Damnit

13:40  Deft transition to the splash page (goddamnit I forgot the name again) here. An understated cliffhanger, with the footsteps continuing into the we'll be right back. Nice work

14:55  Yesss, more Jean scenes. I don't need characters who start out badasses, I need the slow burners

15:20 - This world is merciless, and it's also very beautiful. Another thematic line the show could follow, but I'm pretty certain the show has no interest in making this a thing

17:55  Well isn't *this* an interesting development

Also, I wanted to comment earlier that I really like how clumsy and grotesque the Titan's actions are, as if to hammer in what an arbitrary natural predator they are for humanity, but I wasn't willing to pause what was easily, pretty far and away the best scene of the series so far. Pretty much every single thing worked in that Mikasa regains her resolve scene, and I really couldn't be more impressed with its pacing, direction, or tone. That's one I'll remember at the end

19:38  Ahaha, following the flying head. Man, I guess you gotta let this show indulge itself sometimes

21:30  Why would you THROW THE BLADE AWAY? Mikasa, there is a time and a place for dramatic gestures, and it is NOT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE EATEN BY FUCKING TITANS

**And Done**

Very solid episode! No complaints from me  the character development was good, it pulled in the whole cast to further what I'm pretty sure will be this series' trump card (tactical ensemble drama/action sequences), some neat twists, and some of the best-directed segments so far. I actually think this was pretty solidly my favorite episode so far; this time the show was firing on all cylinders, and reigned in all of its melodramatic impulses to pull off some really effective dramatic turns. I'm eager to see whatever happens next

The "splash page" name? It's called an "eye-catch".
>> ARTICLE
>21:30  Why would you THROW THE BLADE AWAY? Mikasa, there is a time and a place for dramatic gestures, and it is NOT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE EATEN BY FUCKING TITANS

The blades are segmented due to the hard skin of the titans easily dulling the blades. The normal size blades have around 7 segments, this one had 2 segments left, so it really wasn't useful anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Also Armin was talking about saving it to kill himself before he gets eaten, obviously Mikasa won't have none of that.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, good points, both of these. In that case, yeah, Mikasa successfully earned that dramatic gesture.
>> ARTICLE
Armin's expression was priceless afterwards.  

"How am I going to kill myself now Mikasa? :[" ignoring the fact that she didn't want to kill himself in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised by how much suicide there was in this episode. There didn't seem to be as much in this previous ones. But I guess this is the episode where everyone breaks to a certain degree, so that they can rebuild themselves and become stronger. (Except for that guy in the beginning. He won't be rebuilding himself any time soon.)

Also, Mikasa, was it really necessary for you to throw Armin's blade straight off the rooftop? I mean, he's not that strong. You could probably have held it a few feet away from him for a couple minutes and accomplished the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
Forlorn hope is powerful given no other choice. Taking some down with them always helps.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure there was only a single case of suicide this episode. Everything else was death by mastication.
>> ARTICLE
If Sasha dies, I might not know what to do with myself. She was pretty funny in this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like this show but I've gotta say its looking like Eren is not gonna show for quite some time. After being left on massive cliff hangers for two straight weeks I can't bring myself to be on the edge of my seat in anticipation anymore. Don't get me wrong either I really like Mikasa and the development of the other characters followed by the sheer hopelessness we are being fed. I also get a feeling that we are progressing very slowly. But I don't know maybe its just me being antsy.

That was not what I expected *at all*. I expected Eren's injection from his father to let him grow his limbs back or something but instead we don't see Eren and get a titan killing other titans. The titan fought and acted like it had human knowledge, so is that Eren? That seems like far too much of a stretch, no fricken way getting eaten would morph him into something 25+ times his size. So god damn I can't wait for the next episode now.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic episode and I am becoming more and more impressed with the sheer quality of animation for this show.  My one gripe at the moment is the sheer lack of change in the tone of the show.  I thought showing the CPR scene last episode and the soldier suicide one in this were beautiful for portraying the emotions flowing through everyone.  Many of the scenes could not have been done better when it comes to creating believable characters and individual personas. 

BUT

All it has been so far is constant depression, creepiness, and grief.  I am all for not having boundaries when it comes to killing off characters or creating such a desperate overtone to the entire thing, but it is starting to become too much.  Unless there is some glimmer of hope in the next episode (I think there will be...hopefully) I worry that the show has pushed this sort of thing too far.  You can only create so much hopelessness before the viewers become hopeless as well and stop watching.

That soundtrack.  Damn, I was ready to fight a titan!

Ok, I remember during a previous episode discussion that someone (can't remember who), had a good theory. That the way the Titans reproduce is by eating people then birthing the same people as titans, like giant, non-dead zombies. At first I was skeptical, but it did account for why Armin wasn't eaten after Eren, the hippie titan could only consome one of them.

This now is leading me to believe that Angry Titan is Eren, I mean look at there hair and eye color and tell me they don't look similar.  
>> ARTICLE
Aw god, it went by so fast :(.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit late, and I've only just watched this episode. Unlike you guys thinking that the teamkilling Titan = Eren, I thought something else whilst I saw him appear for the first time. My theory is that every single human (maybe not all) has a sort of Titan equivalent of themselves. Like TK Titan is Eren's Titan (I still think Eren is alive in the bearded Titan's body and will bust out soon enough), the armoured Titan is some other human's Titan etc. so maybe something like how Mikasa says that TK Titan is the embodiment of the human race's rage or something, it's actually just the embodiment of Eren's emotions. IDK where I'm going with this, but I swear I've heard of something like this before in a different story with humans having another version of themselves in a different form without them knowing about it. I'm quite bad at putting my thoughts into words, so yeah. 
>> ARTICLE
>humans having another version of themselves in a different form without them knowing about it.

That's a fairly common setting.
>> ARTICLE
What if the special titans are people who can transform. That would explain how the colossal titan can disappear at any random time. Maybe he's just returning to his human form.
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YES!  I cannot express the the emotional up and downs just from the brief Mikasa bit, shit was all over the place and then WHAM!  Vengeful Titan appears.  Mikasa overcoming her dependence on Eren (in physical terms at least) was overwhelmingly awesome, and right at the heroic sacrifice she acknowledges he means something dear to her again.  Armin still needs to grow a pair but he is getting better.  I have been wanting a story in which humanity has to seriously earn its happy ending/victory and this is it.  They are losing to the Titans outright or hold them off after great sacrifice so it hits hard that these heroes are not invincible.  Great writing, GREAT action scenes, character growth.  Can this show get any better?  Pinnacle of the season by leaps and bounds.  
>> ARTICLE
Shit just got real, that Titan has some Mortal Kombat style x-ray finishers!
>> ARTICLE
The whole episode was just beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
As interesting as the Eren-Titan theory is, I find it hard to believe that one injection is enough to turn Eren into some kind of medieval Titan-Hulk (dat change in mass), so I'm guessing that the injection makes Eren carcinogeous to any Titan that ingests him. Eating Eren changes the DNA in the Titan somehow, switches its biological imperative from eating humans to killing other Titans. 
>> ARTICLE
That "eren-titan" thing crossed my mind for 10 seconds. . but no.

Still. . .what is that all about?

 Added a whole new level to this thing. I mean, yeah, you'd have to think the whole time the titans weren't trying to break down the walls, they must have been fighting each other at least some of the time, but shit. 

 That blew my mind.

 Also, Mikasa's badass level = Homura.


 I wonder if Eren is gonna be like Aika in the first half of Zetsuen no Tempest from now on (it makes no sense any other way, honestly).

What was the meaning behind that pomogranate at 16:25? It got the spotlight for some reason.

There's people here in the comments saying it has o do with the pomegranate's symbolism in Greek mithology, but IMO it's just a metaphore for the walls (it has two or three protective membranes inside, some of them pictured broken) and the people living inside (the fruit surrounding each seed).
>> ARTICLE
Great episode.

The suicide in the beginning was disturbing. Offing yourself in that situation is one thing, but damn, do it outside or away from others at least.

The soundtrack continues to impress me aswell, always matches the scenes.

The preview for next week really leads me to believe that what I hope will happen, might actually happen.

Damn that episode was epic! That Titan at the end definitely has something to do with Eren. I know he's alive, main character can't die in 5 episodes (Sorry to all the Kamina fans there). Anyhoo, fangasming aside, any theories on Mikasa's electricity thing? Is it just symbolism or something else?

I love how your can hear the forced sentences from Mikasa after she heard the news from Armin. It makes it easy to tell that it's not just a confidence boosting speech, but a distraction for her.

Considering my last guess:

http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1dpczq/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/c9sulbo

It's looking like I was pretty close. From this ep the obvious (hopefully correct) guess is that he became a titan or took a titan over.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those animes that, if I had the money, I would pour millions into getting a really good live action film adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to se a lot of people seem to think Eren is the Titan, and that the shot had something to do with it too. Initially when I first remembered about the shot(before Titan vs Titan) I thought it might give Eren similar regenerative abilities to the titans so he could grow his limbs back but honestly now I think it gave him the ability to take over and morphology the Titan that ate him. Awesome punchy Titan looks nothing like bearded grandpa Titan though.

I have no idea why they would rather starve all of the humans during the panic rather than just starving the horses.

Rule of cool, I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
What the hell are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
It might just be me, but I actually like paying attention to the worlds and structures of societies in different anime.  One such example is Attack on Titan, where you can clearly see horses on the end card.  Now, using some critical thinking, why was it that horses are plentiful enough to be used militarily while 1/5 of all humans were to the point of starving then drafted to war because they couldn't be fed?

Just something I noticed is all.
>> ARTICLE
[What have you unleased!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool)

Horses are the only way they have to keep up with titans' speed in the open field, where they cant use the 3D because of lack of things to grapple onto. (Interestingly enough, their reliance on horses was a minor plot point in the last manga chapter).

I'm going to be sad if Eren ends up being the Titan that saved Mikasa. I really hope that's not the case.

Pretty sure mikasa tried to Bankai  a moment b4 elvish looking titan attacked the other 1 xD

>> ARTICLE
I've only got one major gripe worth this show:  how hard really is it to kill a Titan? 

Episode 5 was cool when you saw Eren's squad flying around, music pumping and all that. I'm thinking "they're gonna wreck these Titans."  And then they all die. 

This I don't mind at all, I really like it. It's pretty sobering and makes you realize how dangerous these things are. 

But then we see Mikasa just kill everything with no trouble. As long as her gear is working, these titans just seem incompetent. 

I get that they're all trainees, and all the best soldiers are in the back. Still, I'm not liking the disconnect between Mikasa and everyone else. Especially since it's not really explained (yet?). 
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa was described as the once in a long time prodigy amongst the trainees. Don't forget that she passed with top marks.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone seems really happy with this series. Am I the only one whose teeth are put on edge by the fact that half of each episode is either internal dialogue or people with really big eyes freaking out over titans? The constant terror/whining is grating.

Any theories on Mikasa, her electricity thing, and the weird heart? Dr. Jaeger has been to Mikasa's place more than once before and might have done experiments on her much like he did with Eren. That might explain her electricity thing (this is most likely just an aesthetic effect though) and how she crushed a knife hilt and snapped a floor board. The heart thing though, I'm stumped. Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
Again an episode where I can just think about the absolute incredible stupidity of the humans. Just sitting there, awaiting their deaths, building cities which are meant as a trap for titans, but are nothing more than a feeding-ground, instead of the battle field it should be...

I mean, they had more than enough time to prepare for an invasion, but what did they do? Neither build any tunnel for a fast escape. Nor build some traps to slow down or even kill the Titans. THAT IS A F***ING CITY! Every stupid kid could kill some titans with the right equipment there. Titans have limits to their power, and cities are the perfect to make use of that limits. But no, sitting there, awaiting their deaths seems more fun for those stupid crap of characters...

I really really hope there will be some valid reasons for setting.
>> ARTICLE
I have a theory that when you get eaten by a titan you turn into one. Then that might explain why the "pointy" eared titan was fighting the others. It might just have been Eren who got turned, and since he has such a hatred for them, fought them regardless of being a titan or a human. This would also explain how the titans are able to proliferate. (Just my theory).
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yeah.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like nature is just doing its thing humans get out of control kill them off now titans are so kill them off.

>> ARTICLE
I have a theory that the titan is actually eren. if thats the case... i don't know how i feel about that. this anime definitely has a lot of explaining to do in the future.

Not sure if I'm the only one, but I really hope Eren hasn't transformed into that Titan.

I got it figured out (haven't read the manga). [Spoiler](/s "When that giant ate Eren, he turned into some sort of catalyst and transformed into that rouge titan (FLCL style). Later in the series, he's gonna pop out of titan form as a human with all limbs in tact since titans have that regeneration power or whatever.")

 [Spoiler](/s "How Eren was able to fuse with Titans is unknown, but it will probably be explained in later episodes. Then the whole titan massacre ensues since Eren is able to transform into some sort of demi-god Titan. Yada-yada-yada Eren and his buddies kick butt, there's probably some sort of prophecy involved, and the series returns to typical anime nonsense. I really hope I'm wrong, but if Eren is somehow alive through some magical vodo shit, I'm gonna be pissed.")
>> ARTICLE
Man this show gets more and more boring each episode. I'm seriously disappointed because the first episode was so good that it's number 1 best first episode I've ever seen.

It's pretty obvious who that new giant is and the drama was so over dramatic and exaggerated. It's not a philosophically deep show either so wtf was Mikasa spewing her shit about when she was already emo last episode. It's sad this show is heading this way because it could have been a really cool action anime in a tell by showing kind of way, but it's shounen curse is too strong. This episode is the worst episode by far, but I'm sure it'll get even worse later.

OVAs are basically extra episodes that are released straight to DVD.  This is second out of three planned OVAs that are bundled with the manga.  The first one was canon to the story while this one is more comedic.

Confirmed:

Mikasa's abs are canon.

Brilliant change of pace! There was also some good development between some of the side characters which I thought were much needed. Anyways, great OVA especially for the big fans of the show.

>They should all just rip their subs from CR and be done with it.

That's what Commie does half the time anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was what horriblesubs does
>> ARTICLE
They also do that, yes. I believe Commie does some extra editing, typesetting, etc. when they use CR as a translator, which horriblesubs doesn't do.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any serious advantage to leaving "eoten" untranslated when the canon translation is "titan"? I'm all for leaving words in Japanese when it adds context or when their isn't a good translation. I think I'm in the minority in that I want groups to leave in honorifics and leave words like Itadakimasu untranslated, but the "eoten" thing just seems silly.
>> ARTICLE
I think "eotena" is a japanization of the Nordic "jotun" which are giants.
>> ARTICLE
No Eoten is actually an English word, just an extremely archaic one.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. It's basically the same word as "jotun". And as for Eoten/jotun being an appropriate word to use for the giants in Shingeki no Kyojin, it very much is:

>Jtunn (Proto-Germanic *etunaz) might have the same root as "eat" (Proto-Germanic *etan) and accordingly had the original meaning of "glutton" or "man-eater", probably due to their enormous diet because of their size

Source:  Shippey, Tom (2005). "Giants". The Shadow-walkers: Jacob Grimm's Mythoogy of the Monstrous. Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies in Collaberation with Brepols. p. 83-110.
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with the word and yes it might fit quite well here but it's an archaic word so it shouldn't be used. The job of a translator is not to translate words but to make the reader/watcher understand what the piece is about something Commie fails with when they use Eoten. If we for example never saw the titans and we just heard characters speak of the "Eotena", very few people would know what these things look like.

If I know what the characters are talking about without seeing it the translation is good. The only exception is if the word in the source material is made up.
>> ARTICLE
>If we for example never saw the titans and we just heard characters speak of the "Eotena", very few people would know what these things look like.

This point is made entirely irrelevant in the context of Commie's subs though. The first time we see a Kyojin, the main character exclaims that it's an Eoten. So right off the bat people know what it is called, and they can tell that it's big. They don't need to be told that it's a "Titan", because the only accurate detail in this anime about Titan's is that they're big, which is abundantly obvious. All of the other details about Titan's contradicts what they are in the anime.

And then if the person bothers looking up the name, they'll find that it perfectly applies to who they are and gives them a better understanding of them. Sure it's not a common word, but it hardly matters. Either way, what you want to call them is personal preference and doesn't really matter. Everyone will call the anime by it's Japanese name so it won't change much.
>> ARTICLE
>If I know what the characters are talking about without seeing it the translation is good. The only exception is if the word in the source material is made up.

Context doesn't matter, if I can't understand without the visual aid the translation is bad. Kyojin is a real word and there's an official translation for the word so there's no point in changing it to an archaic word.
>> ARTICLE
>There's nothing wrong with the word and yes it might fit quite well here but it's an archaic word so it shouldn't be used.

If we for example never saw the titans and we just heard characters speak of the "Eotena", very few people would know what these things look like.

True. They're far too artistic in their translation sometimes, like how they translated half of the dialogue in Girls Und Panzer into German instead of English.

Now, that wasn't a problem for me personally because I understand German, and I know words like "Eoten", but I totally get why people want easy-to-understand translations and not "technically correct" or "artistically fitting" ones. It's more than reasonable to expect subtitles that you can understand.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a matter of "understanding" though. The first time we hear Titan in the anime is when we're seeing it, and it's clearly huge. Any context we could get from them being called Titans is either obvious or incorrect. And because the first time we really see them is when the MC is exclaiming that they're Eotens, no details are lost. There are only details to be gained, from people either already knowing the word or deciding to look it up.
>> ARTICLE
My main point was, that 1-to-1 translations between Japanese and English aren't always that easy and it'll come down to personal preference. I see nothing wrong with Commie deciding that they want to use a different word instead of Titan. I don't understand why there has to be so much animosity towards them for it. I would understand if it was "Well, I think it's stupid but they can do what they want with their subs, I just won't watch it and won't make a big deal about it in every thread about Shingeki.", but that's not the case.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been paying all that much attention but I thought they were called "kyojin" pretty much everywhere in the Japanese.

Edit: I went through and ctrl-f'd titan in GG's subs and I can't find anywhere they're not called either "kyojin" or just "yatsura" ("those guys").
>> ARTICLE
What happened? :o Did I miss something? I'm just curious because I d/l some of Commie's subs, and if they're being dicks or something then maybe I'll d/l a different group's...?
>> ARTICLE
Basically what happened is that when Commie subbed Shingeki no Kyojin they subbed the word "Kyojin" as "Eoten", which is an Old English word for Giant or Ent. There's no word in Japanese for Eoten, and it just seems masturbatory. He went on to rerelease the first episode as "Episode 1v2" with the title card changed to "Eotena Onslaught".
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure masturbatory is not the word you're looking for....
>> ARTICLE
Nope, it was exactly the word I was looking for. Rereading it a month later. Still makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
"Kyojin" does not mean giant or Titan. There's no direct translation for it in English, although "Giant" and "Titan" both have their own direct Japanese translations. Eoten is a more accurate parallel to what the kyojin actually are (they're definitely more Grendel than Kronos), and doesn't conflict with any preexisting Japanese/English translations. Simply sticking with the Engrish subtitle is lazy.
>> ARTICLE
I've been seeing this argument a lot, that 'Kyojin' doesn't directly translate to 'giant'.  I don't know a lot about Japanese, but doesn't  essentially mean 'Huge Person'?  That's essentially the same definition as the English noun 'giant'.  I do like the flavor that 'Eoten' brings to the table, but if I hadn't looked it up I wouldn't have known its context.  Titan, I think, is a little more culturally accessible in that most would know what is meant while still adding a bit of flavor.

Just my 2.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with "Titan" is it gives the wrong flavour. As Commie explained in their lengthy (and silly) dialogue on the subject, Titans were intelligent gods, and they never interacted directly with people.
>> ARTICLE
I don't disagree that Titan doesn't quite fit, but I am somewhat curious what kind of flavor Kyojin has in Japanese culture, if any.
>> ARTICLE
Kyo means large, and jin is used to denote that a person is of an ethnicity. (Nihonjin is "Japanese," Gaijin is "foreigner.") It has an inherent sense of "otherness" to it. So kyojin would denote "A person of the huge clan," while indicating that person is inherently different from the expected norm.
>> ARTICLE
So the proper translation would be giant-folk... uhhhh let's allow the subbers to take some liberties then.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think any reasonably intelligent person would assume that the use of the word titan in this context implies a relationship to the Titans of Greek Mythology.
>> ARTICLE
The trouble is what it implies. Titan has never been used to refer to any specific creatures other than the primeval greek gods. When it is used as a metaphor, it implies higher status and godlike attributes (ie. "Titans of Industry").

Eotena like Grendel were very specifically grotesque, engorged, humanoid figures with an appetite for human flesh. It just works so much better at conveying what the Kyojin are.
>> ARTICLE
[grendel looks nothing like kyojin](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Grendel&aq=f&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=UQ94Uaz2Eoa7igLFhYGADQ&biw=1680&bih=949&sei=VQ94Uc-kL4qyiQLnjIDADQ)


>> ARTICLE
I think it works very poorly because nobody knows what the fuck that is. Moreover, the translation doesn't need to convey what the kyojin are, the anime does plenty well on its own. Kyojin has none of those implications either.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. I think Titan fits perfectly, and conveys what they are, beings of immense size and unnatural power, as the old mythology says the Titans were. However, it's never hinted that there's any connection or relation other than physical stature.
>> ARTICLE
Giant is a pretty good translation for Kyojin

It literally means "Large human"
>> ARTICLE
You are correct, sir.  reads like "giants."   
Like the Japanese baseball team, Yomiuri Giants, is sometimes called Kyojin as a nickname. So I would think that "giants" is a fairly close english translation of "kyojin." 
>> ARTICLE
After watching episode 3 with Commie subs I decided to rewatch with gg subs. Pretty much every 3rd line was different, it was kind of scary how different some of the scenes were.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, especially the potato scene made Sasha seem condescending, greatly different from her airheaded attitude. 

Compare "*You seriously don't know why people eat potatoes?*" to the manga/original^1 "Is that a, 'Why do people eat potatoes?' kind of question?"

[The manga version.](http://imgur.com/a/jdZ39 "I didn't think this through!")

: You can hear her say "*Sore wa, 'nani [etc]*'"
>> ARTICLE
They translated it as "Are you asking why people eat potaties in general, sir?", which is pretty much the same as the manga?
>> ARTICLE
#I know GG translated it as that, which while not manga (may be just me, but the line just has a great delivery), is still pretty good when comparing to [Commie's](http://i.imgur.com/5Q4Rcuh.jpg) subs which I was talking about.



On the other hand, it is just a line in anime, but I just like the manga so.
>> ARTICLE
i didnt interpret it as assholish, more like she was completely serious and concerned. 
>> ARTICLE
Commie's release for EP3 was better on everything except the terminology. The joke where they guy smears his hand on the baldie was handled terribly by gg.
>> ARTICLE
Mango-chan went on /a/ later and apologized for his horrible release. He said there was a lot going on that day so he dun goofed. He even made a joke about it and said he'll finally get it right on 3v50.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Commie said something like "My faith in humanity" which fit perfectly but gg did something strange that made me go "what?".
>> ARTICLE
My trust in others I'm pretty sure it was, nothing wrong with that.
>> ARTICLE
That's not the line. Make a guess: which one is gg's?

>Connie: "Hey, what are you doing?? Did you just wipe your hands on me?"

>Jean: "It's the trust between people"

or

>Connie: "H-Hey! What the crap? What the hell did you just wipe on my shirt?!"

>Jean: "My faith in humanity."
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you pointed that out; everyone's so focused on a piece of terminology when at least for episode 3, I thought Commie's translation was far more accurate in terms of getting meanings across and not just translating line for line. I'm willing to forgive some pretentiousness if the work is actually better.

Also, I kind of like multiaxial maneuver gear better than 3D gear. The whole point in Japanese of using '3D' is to sound fancy, but in English it doesn't sound nearly as fancy. That's more personal preference I think though.
>> ARTICLE
old thread but i was looking up the whole titan/kyojin thing. I think you're right they do get the meaning across and that's what i'd rather hear than a direct translation. it's no secret that japanese artists make use of gratuitous english to sound cool to japanese ears but would sound cringe-worthy to and english-speaker's (compare: westerners getting kanji tattoos without really understanding the meaning).

Honestly I'm starting to dislike this song just because of how generic it is. I mean, it's got a nice, epic sound going on, but musically it doesn't really go anywhere. Also I have a really strong feeling that they borrowed that motive from some piece of classical music and one of these days I'm going to figure out what it is.
>> ARTICLE
If it's so generic, would you link similar OPs then? 

I know I can link you 10 openings similar to Photo Kano's.
>> ARTICLE
I meant generic more in the sense that it works for anything, as you showed, than in the sense that the exact same thing is done a lot.

Musically my gripe is that it mainly consists of the same 2 measure motive repeated over and over again for the whole song. G#, E, F#, D#, E, C#, D#, B. Repeat ad nauseum, modulate for Jesus once in a while. I've basically heard the whole thing in the first 15 seconds.
>> ARTICLE
while I do like the song, the first time I heard it, I tried to sing "chocolate rain" over it.


also, note that the song did not actually fit all the OPs


 they had to stick both Psycho-Pass OPs together to fit this song, and the Fate/Zero one was heavily edited.

>> ARTICLE
I think the word you were looking for was universal.
>> ARTICLE
I can see were you are coming from. Anime songs in general suffer from being industrialized, and are not the most inspired music sheets out there.

Kalafina, JAM Project, Ali Project... heard one, you heard them all...

It's even more sickening how the full version of these songs follow the same pattern, there's always that acapella segment before the last chorus.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It's not just anime songs either, it's pop music in general. Oh well, there's always Radiohead. xD

>> ARTICLE
same here. The animation, the music, the voice acting... everything is a plus.
>> ARTICLE
Oh...

When I was reading the manga I had always thought that the titan-obsessed scientist in the recon corps was a dude with long hair. I seriously never realized she was a girl.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Strange, I read the manga after ep 7 and I haven't had trouble distinguishing any of the characters genders. 


I can see where yur all coming from now that yu mention it though.
>> ARTICLE
This is a common debate. The mangaka is ambiguous about the sex of that character. I always though she was a girl until I read people arguing that she was a reverse trap. There's plenty of fanart depicting the character ambiguously as well, so... I don't know what to think really.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this has been one of my complaints about anime in general and Attack on Titan in particular. I'm not a fan of the Japanese trend towards androgynization of characters, and it feels especially out of place in a world as gritty as that of Attack on Titan. 
>> ARTICLE
How is it out of place?  The guys look like guys, and the girls look like guys too; they are in the military and fighting to survive.
>> ARTICLE
Right, I'm debating with the willfully blind. Should've expected that from /r/anime. 

Next time you watch an episode, look at the character's body structure. They don't noticably differ much in anything but their hair, facial coloration, eyelashes, lip structure, etc. The actual facial structure is darn near identical. And it's ten times worse in other anime, such as that that sorry excuse for a show Valvrave, in which characters are so androgynous that I need to wait for them to talk before I can get gender confirmation. This is a relatively new trend....gender identification was much easier in the 1990s and early 2000s.
>> ARTICLE
In one of the fake previews from the manga, Hanji showed up wearing a skirt. That's how a lot of people realized that Hanji was supposedly female. I just got more confused.
>> ARTICLE
You guys like androgynous characters? You should start reading Tower of God (Korean Manga, or Manhwa).  Doesn't hurt that it's a *fantastic* Manhwa.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Ymir was a dude for quite a while.

I love this series, but I really REALLY hope that it's not going to get an original anime ending. That could kill the series completely. I dunno what manga chapter it's on, but as far as arcs go, they are nearing the end of the current arc (the defense of troist), which given the pacing will end at around episode 12 or 13, leaving another 12 or 13 eps to do these general arcs (from memory) [Major manga spoilers](/s "getting into the corps and introduction of more characters, The Annie Titan capture and then re-capture, and the face in the wall") - I'm hoping that's more than enough so that they don't wander into Original anime ending land, because that'd be horrible. Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
I watched the conference of snk, in which they invited the anime staff/producers and Isayama-san on stage, aired the PV for the first time and introduced the seiyuus. The director of the anime revealed that they have had lots of meetings with Isayama-san to discuss about the plot. He also admitted that he had always been a big fan of the series. So I believe that we don't have worry about anything plot-wise.
>> ARTICLE
I think they will probably finish up this season with what you said at the end of your spoiler. I can just imagine all the rage and people breaking down and reading the manga after that.

Also I really dont think we have enough manga content (or just barely enough) for a full season after this season finishes. So probably be off for a season or two unless they speed up production of the manga, which I highly doubt.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's ending in chapter 34. [Hint](/s "Code Geass style.")
>> ARTICLE
Exactly what I thought, this show will most likely end with [Manga spoiler](/s "the revelation of the titans in the wall.")
>> ARTICLE
A good place to end it. The Annie arc is going to be ridiculous...
>> ARTICLE
Should spoiler the name in case... 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, all I said was that Annie is going to actually be relevant to the story. I'm not sure if that counts as a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god no, thats too much..
>> ARTICLE
Oh lord.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't see this getting an anime only ending, it's just way too popular. They'll probably finish off somewhere in the middle of the manga right now, and wait for enough material to be released where they can reliably do a second season.
>> ARTICLE
>Well they did that for FMA so I wouldn't know if being popular has anything to do with anime-only endings :\

But I sure hope not.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I think it's probably decided on long before the show is aired.

No requited love so far, though Mikasa seems pretty head over heels for Eren. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Oh come now, that's comparing oranges to apples. Mikasa has a reason to be emotionally dependent on Eren because, I don't know, he is the last person she considers to be part of her family? Did you notice how she was about to cut a fucker if they tried to touch him? She ain't no blushing violet in either the anime or the manga

Come on man, don't complain about down votes. That contributes truly nothing to the discussion. On the other hand I do agree your emotionally dependent argument works an a multitude of anime, just not this one

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Hey man, I'm not trying to be antagonistic nor am I even down voting. I really do hope you continue to discuss in the subreddit. Though I feel this piece has pretty good gender politics, not all shows do. I would definitely appreciate your inputs on some other shows popular shows this season (OreImo) *cough* which really do tread the line of "this is just male Otaku fan bait right?"
>> ARTICLE
And they seem to be stressing this a LOT more in the anime than the manga. In particular it's easy to note how Mikasa appears more feminine in the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa's feelings for Eren are complicated, but definitely aren't love of the kind between sexually active men and women. It's more along the lines of complete, utter, and absolute devotion. Eren is the only piece of the world that Mikasa honestly gives a damn about, and she'd burn the entire world if it meant keeping him safe.

That is so much more absolute and terrifying, and INTERESTING, than mere love.
>> ARTICLE
That settles it.  Mikasa for #1 Yandere this season.
>> ARTICLE
The hell is a Yandere?
>> ARTICLE
Yandere is the nickname for a character trope, similar to how the phrase "tsundere" is used. Where tsundere describes a character who initially seems very annoying, prideful, selfish, and bratty, but later reveals to have a very soft side (and thus a very lovable side), Yandere describes a trope of a character who initially is very lovable, sweet, and usually passive, and later becomes obsessive (over a love interest), to the point of violence, creepiness, or other "unlovable" characteristics.

Of course fans would probably debate my description over "true tsundere" and "true yandere" definitions, but this is the 'casual' definition.

A classic example of a yandere character is from the series School Days, which started as a Visual Novel but has been adapted to both manga and anime; I recommend the manga because it's really short, if you just want to 'know what it is in full.' Anyway, I recommend School Days because it's pretty iconic in having very violent endings. Obviously the best place to keep reading would be the [TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere)

Awesome episode! So it looks like that injection either makes Eren part Eoten or the ability to transform into one.  Whoever called his father being involved with everything back in like episode 3 or something, well done because apparently he is the center of it all.  I thought originally the basement would be some sort of key (pun somewhat intended) to unlocking Eren's abilities from the injection but apparently he can already do some nifty things.  Maybe it just has answers? More injections? Captured eoten? 

The form Eren took at the end also obviously has similarities to giant and armored Eoten.  He pointed out a few episodes ago after attacking the giant one that it had some sort of intelligence which could mean that both of them are humans that transform into their respective forms (could also explain their apparent "disappearances"). 

Anyone know if this is a typical 13 episode series or if it will continue into a second season?
>> ARTICLE
You know, after watching the episode I think the key is simply a psychological object that makes Eren activate his abilities rather than a physical object that actually opens a lock in his old house. Notice how his father mentions the "basement" is where he can unlock his powers. I believe this is just mental suggestion so Eren can willingly change himself into a Titan

>> ARTICLE
I cringed a bit when I read "typical 13 episode series". I hate the fact that so many showes started doing this over the 24-26 range. Shows like this give me hope again!
>> ARTICLE
Making anime is expensive. And from what I remember, the returns aren't that great unless you do *really* well.
Having 12-13 episodes be the norm is understandable.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, thankfully Titan is doing ***really*** well
>> ARTICLE
its 25 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen. The manga looks like it's going to take at least a hundred volumes to end, i.e., 55 more releases. 

I HATE MANGA THAT ONLY RELEASE ONCE PER MONTH. The Naruto/Bleach model of one short chapter per week is so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic! I was worried they would start rushing things if it was 13 episodes so this clears up those concerns.  Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't sure if I had to put a discussion on just the length of the manga in a spoiler tag, but I did just to be safe.

[Manga length spoilter (no plot spoiled)](/s "At the current rate the anime could get to where the manga is now in around 25 episodes (though they may need to speed up a bit). However the manga isn't done, and imo may even be 50% or less - so unless the manga abruptly ends, in the long run the anime will have to slow down and be far more than 25 episodes.") IMO I think the episodes already seem to be slowing down in terms of content covered/episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking that the producers will do a FMA and make up their own ending. Then remake it (since its good enough to 'milk' it) with the manga plot once the manga is finished (ie FMA:B). I agree with you at where the plot will be 25 episodes in and it seems very unlikely that they will stop the anime series for a long enough time for them to have enough manga material to animate.
>> ARTICLE
There's definitely enough material to make 15 more episodes. They won't need to make anything up unless they really want to make an anime original ending instead of picking one of two big cliffhangers.

Multiple fansubbing groups are doing this show. Commie is one of these fansubbing groups, and in a very odd choice, decided to rename Titan (the correct name) as Eotens.

Here is a pastebin with the fansubber's reasoning behind using it. http://pastebin.com/y564U7QE

Its really dumb in my opinion and stuff like this is a common issue in fansubbing where people stretch from literal translation too far or too little. Of course, if you are watching your anime legally, you would know none of this.

> Yes, because it tells me that Isayama Hajime does not speak English and therefore is not qualified to find the best English rendering of "." I speak English.

The first one is a little off though (understandably so). She should be a little more square and have feet pointed slightly more forward.

It's very similar to a [Muay Thai stance](http://www.muaythaialchemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krujosefightingstance2.jpg)

Given her devastating kicking with the shin against Arin and the stance I assumed it was definitely supposed to be Muay Thai.

Im really glad i saw the whole anime before seeing this. This is a giant spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
It just shows a titan. The significance is not at all obvious unless you have already caught up on the season.
>> ARTICLE
i already heard that a female titan exists before even starting to marathon the show. I didnt know it mattered untill the last episodes. If i woulve seen this post earlier i wouldve found out that the female is actually important to the plot. And since a lot of the main cast are blondes, i woulve seen a resemblence.
>> ARTICLE
> If i woulve seen this post earlier i wouldve found out that the female is actually important to the plot.

How so? Maybe the comments reveal that it is a specific character with some significance to the plot, but otherwise it might as well just be a random female titan (...though I suppose these kinds of titans look somewhat different from the regular ones?).
>> ARTICLE
How is this a spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
There is a post with the female giant and her normal form - its a giant spoiler - because that is only revealed in the last 3-4 episodes. So yeah im really glad i already watched all episodes before viewing this thread.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair the spoiler last for only 1 episode, after that it's obvious who the Titan is. Also, the submission isn't a spoiler at all.
>> ARTICLE
> after that it's obvious who the Titan is

It wasn't for me. For me it was revealed in the last two or three episodes, the last episode explaining how they came to that conclusion in the first place.

Yeah, but do they know that subreddit actually exists?
>> ARTICLE
There's usually a subreddit for every popular anime, anyone wanting more info on a certain anime can usually look for a subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. There's *usually* a subreddit for ridiculously popular shows, like this one, but for anime that are popular but not ridiculously so, it's not necessarily the case. After all, /r/araragi is not a huge subreddit, and neither is /r/TWGOK.

Regardless, it doesn't hurt to mention it for those who don't know it exists. For the most part, I don't specifically check to see if there's a subreddit unless I already see it mentioned somewhere.

I'll agree it's hard to keep up with the latest anime. I've still got LOADS of older anime that are really popular to watch so I tend to keep track of the best 1 or 2 current anime. Last one was Shingeki no Kyojin, this time I'll be watching KILL la KILL because 'plot' and action.

Why is it called Attack on Titan anyway? I know the title of this post is a play on the title of the show, but neither makes any sense.

I'm getting a little tired of this recap thing at the beginning of all these episodes. Maybe episode 14 will be a recap of recaps.

Agreed. Additionally there were flashbacks. So overall this episode had a good 4+ minutes of filler there. Then Armin's little break down. Kind of annoying. I wish Armin would die honestly. I don't like that character at all.

i'm finding armins character annoying in the anime whereas not at all in the manga. a lot of episode time is lost on his flashbacks and emotional breakdowns
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, though I never read the manga so I can't comment on how he was there. I'm getting downvotes for my opinion which isn't surprising. I guess a lot of people either like him in the manga, or like whiney bitchy chars that waste time.

if you havent read the manga you should avoid the (regular thread) posts, you'll end up getting massive spoilers

I think it is just a motif that was alluded to again later in the episode when Pixis stops the troops from a second attack. As a result of Pixis' intervention the flower remained alive, just like the trio. I'm guessing it is just another symbol of life/survival for the protagonists.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just worried about the ending at this point, as that will make or break this series, I'm hoping it will follow the manga to the end, but that also means, based on the speed at which the plot is advancing, that the manga should be wrapping up soon in order to fit everything into the 25 episodes (especially if ep 14 is a re-cap episode). D:
>> ARTICLE
I think that's some seriously wishful thinking on your part. Manga still is nothing but questions, and with some of the more recent plot elements added I don't see an end in sight for the manga. Whether the anime chooses to have an original ending (no idea how they'd manage that with all the foreshadowing about BRA and the pace they're going) or takes an extended break for a second season is ultimately up to them. There's no way they can have [Manga](/s "the Bert and Reiner reveal") without having an original ending. [Manga](/s "Titan Annie could feasibly occur or at least appear before the end of the 25 episodes"). 
>> ARTICLE
There's no way they would fit all of the current Manga chapters in anyway, it's just a matter of what point they will leave the Anime at
>> ARTICLE
I really really hope that the court scene is in episode 13. Don't want them to waste more time before the great arc that's coming up
>> ARTICLE
I read that EP13 is named Primordial Desire, so no.
>> ARTICLE
curious, where did you read that at?

If that's true though, they're really slowing this down to a snail's pace
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no, I do agree that they're going really slow, esp as someone who's read the manga I want to get to the good parts. 

However so far, it's been pretty much 1 anime episode : 1.1 manga chapter, if i remember correctly they end at around the same points as well. 

Overall I wish they'd speed it up, I personally would prefer Shingeki's anime to complete the story and not go over 50 eps. That's being really optimistic though....
>> ARTICLE
Sigh indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Court will probably be ep 15. There's lots of talking in the manga part, so I doulbt they'll move faster than 1 chapter per episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the [](/s "sooner we get to see Levi in action the better")

[Look,](/s "I just want to see titan-Eren fight that one titan-chick")
>> ARTICLE
But isn't there an OVA scheduled for December? So doesn't that hint for an S2? I mean unless its gonna be a beach episode. I wouldn't mind that either.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa, Sasha, Annie, and Christa all in bathing suits, I don't care if it makes no sense I want this
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean the movie or a real anime OVA?  

I thought all they time they might end the anime with chapter 33.
But maybe they'll only go as far as chapter 30 and end it with a huge downer (which would also be a bookend to the first episode). 

And then in the OVA, they do the whole [](/s "Annie reveal and fight inside the walls") 
>> ARTICLE
Even though this was a slow episode I still enjoyed it, 

I don't see why Armin gets all the hate, He seems to have more brains than most of the characters and although he is cowardly thats just who he is. 

Hell I'd like to see if any of you guys/gals wouldn't cower in the face of a towering beast that eats humans. 
>> ARTICLE
If I had those swords I would be like bring it on 3-4 meter class, 15 meter class...only if its one and I have the movement gear, armored, special female(you will see it soon enough, not really a spoiler) or colossal....NOPE
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see why Armin was hated... before this episode. He doesn't come into his own as the brains of the operation until a bit later, but this was the episode where he experiences the beginnings of a revelation that he is relevant. He is, after all, the [](/s "one that recognizes who the female titan is, iirc.")
>> ARTICLE
Great set up episode, can't wait for Eren to use his ~~Susano'o~~ Titan powers again!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I definitely agree with you. I like how they made that connection were if he uses his susanno/Titan armor to much, he ends up getting worn out. Kind of like when sasuke or itachi overuse their sharingans.
>> ARTICLE
So... can we use that image of the whole south region on the two inner walls to track down the events of the manga that have taken place there up until now?

Can anyone see Ulgard?
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen a good, reliable map in Attack on Titan (both manga and anime). The walls shouldn't be at the same distance between each other IF each of them protect 1/3 of the entire human territory, yet every map so far have shown the same (or whatever) distance between each other.
>> ARTICLE
Differences in population density.  The outer regions were more rural and probably had more farms than the inner regions; hence the mass starvation after the first wall fell.
>> ARTICLE
Somewhere in the manga the artist included a picture of the walls to try and give you a good estimate of scale, it is kind of like concentric circles with wall maria encasing a massive area. and then significantly smaller and the third wall seemed more like the size of an average city in our world.

[EDIT] Link to the in Manga Map to show general scale http://ex2.unixmanga.net/onlinereading/?image=Shingeki%20no%20Kyojin/Shingeki%20no%20Kyojin%20c005-008/0040.jpg&server=nas.html

When they panned out to show the scale of the cities and walls I thought holy fuck how did they have the materials to build that size of walls...
>> ARTICLE
listen to /u/subarash.  you should go visit the anime only thread...

Are you sure you are in the right thread buddy

It's never really SPECIFICALLY stated in the manga that [](/s "The walls were there before the humans moved in"), its only a little ball of text in the corner of one of the map illustrations

Ah, Pixis. Someone does [manga chapter 22+ spoilers](/s "get "eaten" by a hot lady Titan") later in the story, but it won't be you.

These last 2 episodes were slow, I know we're building up to something big, but hurry up damnit!
>> ARTICLE
Last week's blew by for me >_>
>> ARTICLE
Really felt that this ep should've been in the last. Oh well.
>> ARTICLE
Next week's episode should be right up that alley. They left it right where it was needed to continue with for the operation to take the city. Should be perfect for what AOT is known for.
>> ARTICLE
Abnormal type of spoilers has appeared: "I didn't read the manga, even though my theory sounds like I know the whole plot, so it's ok". Fun times for you people. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, once the Titan appears, it pretty obvious. They are not even that subtle in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
What's worse are the "Liar! You are pretending to be a non-reader to speculate things from the manga!" comments I had to report.
>> ARTICLE
It's time to start posting decoy spoilers that are actually lies. The murder-titan is actually a dimension-traveling Neville Longbottom, and in the end he gets together with Potato Girl.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's regular thread, so it's either sarcasm or poking fun.

Same here, emotionless bastards

Even the phrase, "It's not time yet" sounded bad.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... that's a familiar looking Titan there. Must be a coincidence though!
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing Eren has Titan blood in him (explains the injection) so he can transform into a Titan and have regenerative powers like the Titans do.
>> ARTICLE
Eren can be regenerative and Mikasa can just be a boss
>> ARTICLE
what if the Titans convert humans into other titans by consuming them?

You mean that they get eaten, digested and then shitted as TITANS?

Can't wait for those scat doujins!
>> ARTICLE
bro, titans dont have digestive organs.
>> ARTICLE
So they just throw them up? 

Two titans 1 giant cup where?
>> ARTICLE
Obviously Titans use Cell-Mitosis. So the Hippie-Titan (who obviously ate a lot already) ate Eren and then Split-Up into 2 new Titans including Titan-Eren.
>> ARTICLE
yes, after they get full they will just throw up all of the pieces of humans they ate. Wasn't this said in a previous episode when they were sitting in a classroom? I can't remember though...


>> ARTICLE
I remember it being explained in the manga but I'm not sure about the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
then they're going to explain it once they start sweeping the city for dead people, after the trost arc ( no spoilers in here)
>> ARTICLE
Eren's a zombie now?

I hope it's something to that extent, as opposed to some BS escape routine he pulled inside hippie titan.

Well, [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1elk7y/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca1fqpx) is obviously a joke, but [Annie](http://i4.minus.com/iboWK3EfPwPDGK.jpg) *does* use a [very similar stance](http://i.imgur.com/4lLBGNc.jpg) when fighting. Good catch.

On another note, the anime is simply outstanding. I forgot how much music could make a difference.

It's not just music. Armin reporting the names the way he did actually made me tear up.

I just find it incredibly telling that SnK is getting so much rabid attention with the anime version. Does anyone remember when the *manga* came out? SnK was a *massive* hit, and was selling an absolutely ridiculous amount of volumes. Hell, it topped One Piece from what I remember. 

It's just so funny watching it happen *all over again*, but with WAY more Westerners.
>> ARTICLE
I don't believe it topped One Piece, at least during a week when a new OP volume came out. That is always number one the week it comes out.
>> ARTICLE
Yep theres no way it has topped a One Piece volume. One Piece sells something like 2 million at release, with some of the volumes having over 4 million lifetime sales. 

[According to ANN](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-15/japanese-comic-ranking-may-5-11) The first volume of SnK has hit over 1.3 million. Which is still pretty damn good. But I think before the anime it was sitting around 800k or so, so all volumes got a pretty good boost thanks to it.

I can't wait for the soundtrack to come out.

The music is so goood.

Despite my best efforts of not watching the anime, I'm so glad I did. Its amazing. Brings everything to life.

This show has the best soundtrack of the season. If you disagree I would love to know what you are watching because I clearly am not.

Watch Aku no Hana's episode 7 and swallow your own words. This show's OST seems quite forgettable so far, except for the awesome opening.

Started in the list hoping for titanic bitch slap. Received it. Thank you. :)

So happy. I've read through the manga all of last night because I couldn't be patient, and that part is what had everyone in our apartment cheering. 
>> ARTICLE
I just thought that the red glow you see go through the titan are his bones regenerating after those sick punches broke them all.
>> ARTICLE
hey could you make a gif of the Titan bitch slap of awesomeness :D
>> ARTICLE
Ok i haven't read the manga and here's my theory:

The injection that Eren's father gave him bestowed him with the power to transform into titan. I'm guessing that this power functions much like Bruce Banner/The Hulk in that it he basically transforms when he goes into a rage or haves some trouble actually controlling when he wants to morph. He probably regained his leg and arm when he transformed to a titan and gained their regenerative abilities.
>> ARTICLE
But Eren is always in a rage!
>> ARTICLE
[Rage?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsCHULTqsOI)
>> ARTICLE
Hm, [Considerably large manga spoilers](/s "The most important part of Eren's titan transformation ability is that he actually needs a purpose. Sheer rage and will alone don't do it; he needs a clear goal in mind. This implies that Titans themselves could have been something that were made by humans, as tools of sorts. But somewhere along the line that backfired, and who knows what/if any society exists beyond the walls, of Human/Titan hybrids like Eren, Annie, and the armored douche and colossal douche. That's my theory anyway.")

Here's my theory; Eren is sent back from the future - in 2800.
Just hear me out. This explains the title of first episode, "To you, 2000 years from now"

MAJOR SPOILERS IN BOTH MANGA AND ANIME


"When Eren wakes up from his dream in first episode, in the Manga, [Mikasa said "See you Later, Eren" and out of blue, he asks her if her hair has gotten longer.](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/19) This, first of many forshadowing that the author throws at us might give us some insight. My theory is that 2000 years from now, in about 2800, the world is still the same. SnK's world is inspired by the Viking mythology, as shown in many references throughout the story and names of certain characters. For instance, Armin talks about the outside world; Sea of flames and Field of Ice. Which, if you look for it in the Norse(viking) Mythology, it exist the outside of Midgard and [Jtunheimr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunheimr) - a fucking world of giant. Sea of flames is called [Muspelheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BAspellsheimr), and Field of ice (plane of ice?) is called [Niflheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niflheim) In Norse Mythology, they build a wall against the giants. with the eyelash of [Ymir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir) - incidently a name of a character in the SnK. When Ragnarok happens in Norse Mythology, those giants break down the wall and kill the gods...basically, SnK. Ymir is the primeval being, the very first being in the Norse Mythology whom of which killed by Odin and other major gods. In death, Ymir's body create the world. Gods try to protect themselves and humans from the giants by making the wall. This is the part of Norse Mythology SnK uses. 

Back to SnK, world creation is probably similar to the Norse Mythology. Ymir - some primeval being - was killed and remnant of it was scattered across the world. In year 700, the remnant was found by a young scientist (Eren's father.) He experimented on it, and extracted a virus to titan-fy things. Some plants that he experimented on create the gigantic forest outside the walls of SnK. The nation start to investigate on the Remnant of Ymir and create the Titans. The nation decide to use the Titans as a part of their conquest. "The world without conflicts" (On the cover of a second book, the map has upside down writing that reads that) It was simple, they build the walls to protect themselves safely inside, and spread the giants outside to devastate everyone else. They probably had some sort of vaccine that will kill Titans. From the beginning, I was wondering how the walls were conveniently built once Titans appeared. Walls were under construction by the royalties in secrecy, and when they released the Titans, they just lead the survivors and escape into the pre-built walls. The plan was wait it out until the titans outside devastate the other nations - they are only interested in killing human - and kill the titans by spreading the vaccine. All this project, for the convenience, I will call it Ragnarok Project.

However, they needed a messenger. sort of a like a bird in Noah's Ark. They needed to know when they can come out. So they created Titans with intelligence and who can become human at will. They created those straints of titans, however they only had vaccines to eliminate titans - in which will kill the messenger titans also.

In short, there's two kinds of titans. ones that were created initially, one without any intelligence of sort and no way of going back to Human. And another one that can become human at will.

The plan was perfect, the speed of devastation was unimaginable. However, they evolved. Some of them gained intelligence. They now have their own agenda - to create the world of giants. Titans with intellignce tried and succeed in killing the scientist and the vaccine.

Those messenger titans - one that can revert back to human - create their own nation outside the walls. If needed, they can change back to titan form, so the protection is ok. Reiner and Bertolt told Eren of where they came from - outside of wall. Well, they were revealed to be titans in manga. 


To clarify, there's 5 major powers in this world now.

1. Humans and royalties who created Titans (Midgard, Asgard)

2. Titans without intelligence

3. Titans with Intelligence (Jtunheimr)

4. Messenger Titans who joined Jtunheimr. (Ymir)

5. Messenger Titans who created their own nation. (Reiner, Bertolt, Annie)


Anywho, the scientist had a son, Eren, who had the vaccine. However, Eren didn't know or didn't have guts to use the vaccine. In order to do so, he will have to come forward with the vaccine and expose himself. He hid it in the lab of his father and waited till he can use the vaccine. However, in 850's, he was killed by Titans and the vaccine and the location of the lab is lost. The Ragnarok Project that began in 700s, is continuing without any way of ending it. This state of entrapment of human continues for 2000 years. And by then, almost all titans have intelligence. However, the world is already theirs, and they saw no reason to breach the final wall. Those royalties and survivors tried to come up with a way to kill Titans. Due to the constraint of the wall, humanity was unable to build any substantial weaponary against the titans. Also, they failed to produce the vaccine again since they were unable to capture the titans in any shape or form and also, anyone who gets close to the answer gets killed by the titans. Finally, the vaccine and the virus are both created from the remnant of Ymir, which discovered in 700, only the scientist who discover can know of it back then, so in year 2700s, they can't figure it out. However science advanced regardless. They gathered as much resources as possible in a hope that one day they might come up with a plan. 

At one point in history, they find a letter - "To you, 2000 years from now." Written by Eren in 850's. This letter, explained the plan that humanity is going to do. They create the time machine with all the resources and scientific advances combined. The purpose of the time machine is to send assassin into 700s to kill the Eren's father before he create the Titan virus. However, for some unknownreason this fails, and the future fails to change. In year 2800, the titans attacks human one last time and humanity comes to an end.



At the year 2800s, the descendant of Mikasa send her son, Eren, back to the past in a hope to save him from the Titans. She sends him off with her final word "See you later, Eren." It is impossible even for her son, Eren's eye. This is why he cries when he wakes up. I assume that Mikasa's name was passed down to her descendents. Since she is...quite obsessive of Eren, she probably wished that the son of her lineage will be called Eren, and daughter Mikasa. However in time warp, only the memory warp back.


Due to the nature of the travel, the original Eren's memory and 2800's Eren's memory collide with one another, and he only feels as if he was dreaming. However, since Mikasa's lineage is quite unique (Oriental) future Eren's mother, Mikasa, is similar enough to past Eren's Mikasa. I guess the future one had short hair, that's why he asks her about the hair when he wakes up.

Eren's father, the shots that he gave to Eren, was to protect Eren from the danger of Titans. He made it so that Eren will be like Messenger Titans. Also, he disrupts Eren's memory of location of his lab and what is in there (most likely vaccine)


In 850's, Eren's memory finally collides, he realizes the fate of humanity in the future. He hurries to the lab only to realize it is already ransacked. He was already surrounded by titans. knowing that there's no way out, he writes to the future that he came from the future and back to 800s, but he failed, so that future humans should send assassin to year 700 instead to kill his father instead. This is the letter, "To you, 2000 years later"

In future, the letter is found. In year 2800, they send assassin back in 700s, and failed. In the brink of extinction of humanity, Mikasa send her son, Eren, back in time just to save him. The loop continues on.



Back to the Norse Mythology, after killing gods, the titans set the world on fire. However, the fire is not for the destroying, it is for cleansing the world. 

In SnK, this could mean that the titans are the bringer of the new future, the cleanser of the world instead of mindless devastation.. but this might be too hopeful.


TL;DR

1. The SnK's world is in Time loop without the possibility of multiverse. In the end, the humanity is extinct.

2. In 700s, the scientist finds the Remnant of Ymir (the primeval being) and create the virus. The royalty of current nation in SnK weaponize them by creating Titans and Messenger titans that will tell the end of devastaion outside the wall. However, they lose the vaccine that will eliminate Titans. Only ones that know the whereabouts of the vaccine is Eren and his father. However when Eren finally reaches the lab, lab is ransacked (probably by intelligent titans) and Eren is killed

3. Eren, knowing the truth about him writes the letter, "To you, 2000 years from now," before his death that soon follows. In the future, when humanity find the letter, they realize the possibility of time travel and create time machine. They send back the assassin into 700s to kill the Scientist, but fails. Titans are created. In 2800s, Mikasa sends her son, Eren, back to the past to save him from the Titans and the history repeats itself. The loop is completed, and even with the Time machine, the humanity meets its extinction.

I actually think that the plot so far is pretty lame compared to what it becomes a bit later in the manga :D Can't wait for it

The manga has gotten that far in sense actually they explained how he transforms and how he controls it.

Yes that's true, but we don't know yet whether or not the shot had anything to do with it.

What? The manga has gone way beyond all that, except explaining the content of the injections.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT THE FUCK IS IN THE BASEMENT?! All I care about these days.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, It's depressing to know the author actually managed to drag this for so long. And the biggest plot hole is that the "enemy" has had plenty of time and opportunities to go there and completely destroy or at least collect what might be inside without the scouts knowing. It's not like they have to politely knock on the door or learn to pick doors to get inside.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt the enemy knows where Eren's house is tbh.  If we consider the three that we know of Eren and Mikasa haven't actually told them where they live.  The house was destroyed and that land hasn't been reclaimed yet. Also in the titans don't discriminate against any humans so the only way to look would be in their Titan forms.  There also seems to be a lack of awareness between some of them.  I.E. that bigfoot guy didn't know what the 3rd gear was at all.  They don't seem to be a cohesive organization so it doesn't seem entirely out there that the basement hasn't been touched.
>> ARTICLE
They don't seem to be a cohesive organization? It seems to me its roots are way deep in the elite of the society. The three we know of all knew about each other. They have information on the civilians and their families, I don't think it would be hard to find it at all. And there seems to be quite a lot of them. But i can't risk saying too much here.

On a second note, I'm a bit lost... What do you mean the "bigfoot" didn't know what the third gear was? Do you have any suspicion on who it is? I've heard a few people say how it looks like a certain character, but I honestly can't tell.

PS: Now that I think of it, there's one person with such a relaxed look on his face, just like the bigfoot.

In Christianity The fruit, broken or bursting open, is a symbol of the fullness of Jesus' suffering and resurrection.[77]

The Qur'an also mentions pomegranates three times (6:99,[81] 6:141,[82] 55:68[77]) as examples of good things God creates.

Pomegranate was the symbol of fertility in ancient Persian culture.[citation needed] In Persian mythology, Isfandiyar eats a pomegranate and becomes invincible. In the Greco-Persian Wars, Herodotus mentions golden pomegranates adorning the spears of warriors in the phalanx. Even in today's Iran, pomegranate may imply love and fertility.[citation needed]

So they're not holding back on the special titan at all eh? Interesting... Well seems like Episode 8 is going to be the episode everybody's waiting for.  I know I can't...

I feel like this episode was finally the one that didn't quite match up to the Manga's presentation. So far the anime have outshone its manga counterpart many times, but Mikasa's predicament I felt was better handled in the manga.  The giving up and the sudden change to "I won't give up again" was so dramatic and emoted so well in her facial expression in the manga.  It was one of those rare moments that she emotes and shown the vulnerable side of herself, and that's what defined her character for me.  In the anime they just went with her normal facial expressions and something feels amiss.  There's not enough contrast to show the change in her normal self as a soldier and her vulnerable self as a girl.

I hope they make this up with her next time....

I think 2016 was the safe prediction, they would probably have tried to make it earlier if there was enough manga material compiled for a season 2. Unfortunately they are working with a monthly serialized manga, so with chapters only coming out once a month it takes a lot longer for the material to compile. By the time season 2 finishes, they might have to wait EVEN longer for season 3, so hopefully the series will wrap up by the end of season 3. A bit of a rough situation there, the same reason Akame Ga Kill! has absolutely no choice but to go an anime-original route (as much as people want to hate on the animators for that decision, they really had no choice unless they waited much longer), it would take at LEAST 4 years for enough material to compile for another season there. 

12 chapters per year is not a lot to work with, even if they are longer than the standard weekly chapter...
>> ARTICLE
Is there any reason they take a whole month for each issue? I mean, the art style is such that it doesn't even seem like a great dearth of time is put into each panel; they're very rough and aren't colored either. I honestly think they could be at least doing twice a month.
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly commonly known that mangaka have absurd schedules with maybe 4 or 5 hours of free time a week. Many mangaka become seriously ill due to overexerting themselves. It may not seem like it, but a lot goes into creating these things. Even more in anime (with a few cases a year of people actually dying from over exhaustion).
>> ARTICLE
It's serialized in a monthly magazine, so by default it will release monthly. Each chapter does have many more pages than your standard weekly chapter, but still not enough to compensate. Also, as I said in a previous reply:

>Perhaps the author thinks he wouldn't be able to produce the same quality of work if he went weekly, or perhaps he just wouldn't be comfortable with it.

I think you're really underestimating the amount of work it goes into publishing each chapter. Most people who serialize weekly work tirelessly without rest to get these chapters out each and every week. Whether the artwork is superb or not, it's still a daunting task. Coloring the chapters would just make it straight up impossible. 
>> ARTICLE
U saved me from making a lil rant on the fact its 2016
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know if we'll get a season 3. They may just end the story at the end of season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Considering the hype season 1 got (They even got a marvel crossover for God's sake), even if season 2 sucks as much as I think it will, there will still be a season 3.
>> ARTICLE
I would disagree. By the time it finishes airing it will approach 2017, and by then if they wait until around 2018-2019 for the third season it will probably work out.

Shingeki no Kyojin earns WAY too much money to not cover the full story. It is leagues ahead of almost any seasonal anime that you watch. The only shows that gain that generate this much money are maybe One Piece and Kuroko no Basket.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko no Basuke? lol

Sazae-san, Doraemon, Gundam, Yokai Watch etc. earn figures that make SnK and KnB look like flops.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. I am speaking about shows that aren't necessarily "household names". Also I'm comparing the amount of sales the shows generate for their respective mangas.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that's doubtful. The first season animated 8 volumes, and 25 are planned, so they'd need 3 seasons to encompass the whole series. And based on how popular it is, it's almost certainly going to be fully animated.
>> ARTICLE
Attack of Titan blew up,  it's extremely famous so wouldn't the Manga move at a faster rate 
>> ARTICLE
it would lose some fan base due to the manga is less action now days and with more political stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
No, it's still going monthly. Perhaps the author thinks he wouldn't be able to produce the same quality of work if he went weekly, or perhaps he just wouldn't be comfortable with it.

Mangakas who serialize weekly work extremely, extremely hard. They barely have any time to do anything else. 

edit: Not to mention that the magazine it is published in serializes monthly, so it's forced to release monthly at this point
>> ARTICLE
> Mangakas who serialize weekly work extremely, extremely hard, and you barely have any time to do anything else. 

Wow I didn't think it was that tough, I have a lot more respect and appreciation for them now.

Partly the reason why Yoshihiro Togashi(HunterxHunter) is so lazy.

Though weirdly enough he's an assistant for the mangaka of Kuroko no Baske.

As much as I'd like to say anything, I believe this schedule should be considered rather extreme and cut out of the context. There may have been one week of this insane schedule, but there is no indication it is 52 weeks a year.

I'd probably go insanse from that amount of work. I guess you really gotta love doing it to make it as a mangaka.

That's disturbing.

That seems like poor division of labor. Why wouldn't you give that work to teams of story, storyboard, sketch, lining, inking, lettering, etc... like the comic industry does? Seems like a waste to have your author do the detail work if the book is popular enough.

no wonder he took several breaks last year.
>> ARTICLE
It almost excuses Togashi's various health problems.
>> ARTICLE
Just an assumption, but I believe that's the reason some characters are so embarrassed to admit that they want to be a mangaka. I'd use an example but it's a spoiler.

I still think Togashi is far lazier than the average managaka, especially when you consider Oda(One Piece) was in the hospital for months and (though he wasn't able to release chapters) he was still witnessed by many mangaka as "working hard from a hospital bed".
>> ARTICLE
Imagine being the guy (Oda) from One Piece, started 4 years before than Bleach... and going to finish YEARS after Bleach does. 
>> ARTICLE
Speaking as a huge One Piece fan, I wouldn't mind it if Oda took more breaks for his health. I'm afraid of one day waking up and hearing about how he died because he just worked himself into an illness that killed him. It's not even about wanting to see the end of the series but about how this guy is giving everyone such an awesome story, he deserves to not be sick as often as he is.
>> ARTICLE
Well while you can be concerned about his well-being, I don't think it's a huge issue. This year, the only time he took a small break for ''health issues" was actually just for a routine check-up, nothing serious. It was only one real circumstance that he was forced to take a small break for a real health issue. I don't think we have to be worried for his life just yet. I don't think his editors and assistants would allow him to work as hard as he does if they thought it was life-threatening.

Plus, he does take a lot more breaks these days than he use to, so I think he's still making sure he doesn't overwork himself. That said, he still works like a maniac.

I actually don't mind when an anime decides to split from its source material. It just means I'll be experiencing something new when I go through the manga.

The only issue with that is that since it doesn't follow the author's vision and usually the writers won't be as talented so 95% of the time it will result in a much weaker and unnatural ending.

Has the Akame ga kill already separated from the manga? Mind telling in which chapter?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't read the manga but supposedly it skipped chapters 33-51ish, and other than that the story is still relatively consistent with the manga. A few scenes were different like a character died differently, but overall it's still almost the same as the manga, although there's heavy speculation it will end differently since it's within maybe 2-3 chapters of the manga now, and the last episode is going to be around new years. 
>> ARTICLE
Around chapter 40/42 the assault on the temple is really different and the outcome is not totally the same.
>> ARTICLE
The last one or two episodes were "new". They had similar plot but almost left an entire arc out. 
>> ARTICLE
Ya they skipped the wild hunt arc.
>> ARTICLE
Believe it was after chapter 38 that it starts diverging, they appeared to have skipped 10 chapters so they can give the anime proper closure with the last few remaining episodes.
>> ARTICLE
They changed the ending to the Borick/Path of Peace arc in order speed through it and then skipped an entire other arc to sort of catch up with the manga.  Because of all the skipping, the anime and manga have diverged; certain plot points remain the same, but the details are wildly different.
>> ARTICLE
They started to change/leave out minor things at around chapter 34-36. But now the show just recently skipped about 10 chapters of content completely. 
>> ARTICLE
Last one and half of episode are different.

From what I've heard, the anime cuts a lot of the content out from the manga to skip ahead to where the manga is now. I'm not completely caught up yet, but it should be around where the manga is now (don't take my word for it)

Yeah it's about where the manga is. The last episode deviated a little bit in events from the manga, but to relatively the same result.
>> ARTICLE
I would say more than a bit, the events weren't even the same though they did lead to the same result.

They were different because the anime skipped an arc [Akame ga kill spoiler] (/s "The person that killed Lubbock in the manga wasn't in the anime because they skipped that arc so they had to change it.")

I'm quite aware of that. They are deviating from the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
hold on, isnt lack of content the problem ? why are they skipping ahead then ?
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the content within the skipped chapters is pretty damn brutal. Like disgustingly brutal, but it does mean that a couple characters are kind of... misplaced.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't tell you any legitimate reasons why, but my personal theory is that the studio (White Fox? I think) can only do a certain amount of episodes so they're just trying to get the most story possible. Maybe? I have no idea either.
>> ARTICLE
I think the main point is, they had to skip over some of the sub-plots because they would be to dark for tv, 1 specific sub-plot that you couldn't air even censored comes to mind (clown plot)

i'm not sure, i'm an anime reader, just check a discussion thread for [AnK](/s "Pedo-clown")

I think the manga is actually about to either end, or take a dramatically different direction, and it's going to be one of those deals where the anime/manga hit that point at the same time.

In an interview, the mangaka reckoned he had the whole story planned out for 20 volumes(we are currently on 14).

Not to mention, there are at this point enough episodes to make a good Season 1 out of half the available volumes, then wait 3-4 months and get enough for Season 2... After the mangaka finishes the story.

I think it's because they realized that it wasn't selling so well, or it wasn't exactly a hit. So they decided to give the viewers an actual ending instead of making them wait for a second season that would never come.

It's been in development for years. It just happened that Nomura had a hand in every game (Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy 15, Final Fantasy Type Zero, and KH Birth by Sleep to name a few)that was announced in e3 2006. He also had to set up the story with games like BbS and 3D's and admitted that the technology at the time wasn't cutting it.

I'm honestly wasn't even surprised when it got announced because every other game had finally gotten pushed out and he's now able to give it his full attention. I admit that it would have been great to at least get some kind of insight, but **I think** it was Square Enix that said they were going to stop (after Final Fantasy XIII I believe) announcing their games ahead of time so that there was less pressure on the developers. I look at the KH3 announcement as more of a "kids I'm finally done with all of those projects from work so we can play now."

Even with the monthly manga releases I would've expected the huge hype to push for a 2015 run. I'm actually glad they'll now, in theory and hopefully practice, have enough time to produce a great second season, especially since the budget should be generous now considering AoT's massive success. Would be a real bummer if some of the budget issues reappear. 
>> ARTICLE
The reason it would be a little unrealistic to push for 2015 is because, even IF they had enough material to currently cover a full 25 episode season, which is likely the case, this will make things MUCH more problematic for season 3. If they started in 2015, by the time the series finishes it will be almost fully caught up with the manga, and they would have to wait 3-4 years to make season 3. They probably want to make the wait in between seasons approximately equal from season 1-2 and season 2-3. 
>> ARTICLE
There won't be a season 3; the writer confirmed that Attack On Titan is more than half-way complete.
>> ARTICLE
The *manga* is more than halfway complete. 25 or so volumes are scheduled. The manga is currently on Volume 16. The first season adapted 8 volumes. So 3 seasons are needed in total.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, the manga might be halfway complete, but that includes the manga material that will be used for Season 2. Which means there will easily be enough material for a Season 3. There are currently around 30 chapters in the manga that haven't been adapted in the anime yet.
>> ARTICLE
The release schedule would, in my opinion, but a lot less of a burden if they shot for single cour seasons releasing once per year.  Only having 12-13 episodes per year would make it a lot easier to follow along with the manga.  2 cour seasons aren't a good option for currently-running monthly mangas, imo.

Season 3 won't be so far off as the manga is more than halfway over. Hajime Isayama clearly has an endgame and does not want to stretch it out more than he has to

>ignoring the words "popular shonen"

Let's not do unnecessary things. I listed those two for a reason, they're popular among the worldwide anime community(to love and to hate), they sold incredible amounts relative to their peers for fitting into the relatively new shonen category, and aired at least partially in the summer. That's all it is.

Checking my MAL wouldn't have helped your assumption since it is outdated, but had you looked anyway it would've indicated that I had viewed most of Log Horizon. In reality, I finished all of it. I am watching neither SAO2 nor Log Horizon 2 (waiting for some free time or a good mood for marathoning),  but please don't be that guy that assumes you can't enjoy both shows. I'm sure I took you more seriously than you intended, but I'm just giving my honest answer to that.

The production values are going to be so effing high.

Why so long!
>> ARTICLE
because making anime is more expensive than making manga, requires much more time per scene.

Need to pay animators, a director, producers, writers, voice actors, compliance lawyers (make sure what they are doing isn't violating the license they receive), accountants, marketers, and financiers.

producing animations requires scheduling, hard deadlines, and tight organization. Voice actors can get sick and lose their voice temporarily, animators could quit mid-way through production because of various work place issues. Episodes may need to be scrapped and remade for legal reasons.

For example if Gintama had used "Mickey Mouse" on a single episode, Disney would viciously unleash a horde of lawyers upon Sunrise. 

Lets see Namco Bandai (parent to Sunrise) roughly $2.5 billion net assets vs Disney Corp $81.24 Billion net assets.

Unless Disney was trying to fight with another huge company with gigantic quantities of income like Microsoft, or gigantic law firms such as SASM&F, Baker McKenzie, or Norton Rose Fulbright (God would only know why these companies would have interest in the anime industries).
Disney wouldn't back off.
>> ARTICLE
I see
>> ARTICLE
Well, at least its something, although we would be done with the anime already if they wouldnt have decided to make a bunch of recaps as a movie in the first place. Even then, i can see they are trying to make money and ride the hype train while it lasts. All of that being said, they have plenty of time to make the second and possibly third season spectacular, as i wouldnt settle for less and i dont think anyone else will for that matter. 
>> ARTICLE
So i should just go read the manga than? But really, why so long? It ended in 2013.
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is probably amount of source material. The first season adapted 33 chapters, and so far, only 63 are out. If they made the second season in 2015, then we'd have to wait 3 or 4 years before we got a third season. They're most likely spacing it out so that they don't run out of material too quick.

And I'd definitely recommend the manga. It's pretty good. The story is a lot farther ahead than the anime went. The art isn't that great, but it's definitely been improving a lot recently.

On one had I'm glad they are doing it the right way and giving enough time to adapt the manga properly, but on the other hand 2016 is so far off. I have no idea if I'll even be interested in checking it out at that point. I probably will still end up watching it, but it really does suck that this is the way it has to be
>> ARTICLE
Just curious about when the manga will end if it keeps releasing at the current pace and for the currently planned 25 volumes. Any estimates?
>> ARTICLE
The editor says it will end in about 3-4 years. We're on Volume 16 at the moment. Each volume is 4-5 chapters. 

25 - 16 = 9

9 X 4 = 36, 9 X 5 = 45

36 months is 3 years, 45 months is 3 years and 9 months, so around 3-4 years is correct.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that's a long ass time from now. I thought the 3-4 year estimate meant from when it started and not from where it's at right now.
>> ARTICLE
The manga celebrated its 5th anniversary on September 9th of this year, so it'll run for 8-9 years total. Quite a long time indeed!

I am probably one of the few people who really did not like the show. I thought it was extremely cliche and I literally called every cliffhanger they had. The only thing it had going for it was the secret in his basement which is the only reason I will think about watching this.

Thanks guess I will not watch it. Message me in 10 years with whats in the basement.

Edit: Seriously lol that would be my first fucking priority.
>> ARTICLE
yeah... to be honest, i enjoyed it for quite awhile. and then they just, forgot about the plot and the storyline just changed. it became extremely boring and completely uninteresting. the only thing that seemed interesting in the first place was the lack of plot armor for supporting characters, and even thats changed. so i honestly wouldn't bother with this anymore.

Edit: I also stopped reading it because of this bs.
>> ARTICLE
Can I get a quick summary of the current plot as-is? I'm an anime-only viewer who isn't sure if I should continue with the series.
>> ARTICLE
I'll try to write a brief one. Quite a lot has happened so far, so it might be a bit confusing to follow:

[Attack on Titan Manga Summary](/s "After they capture Annie in Stohess, they find that she has closed herself in a crystal, and can't get her out. They then are horrified to see that she caused some damage to the Wall when trying to climb it, and look inside the Wall and find a giant Titan living *inside* it. Pastor Nick, from the Wall Cult, shows up and orders them to quickly fix the hole so that sunlight does not hit the Titan and it doesn't wake up. Hange demands he answer questions about how he knew about the walls and why there are Titans in them, but he refuses to answer. Soon after, they receive word that Titans have mysteriously appeared inside Wall Rose. The rest of the 104th (Sasha, Jean, Reiner, Bertolt, Connie, Krista, and the freckled girl) along with the Survey Corps are sent out to warn villages and towns nearby, while the army sets up a defensive line long enough to evacuate everyone inside Wall Sina. It's revealed that the Titans are being led by an intelligent Ape Titan who can speak, and can control the other Titans. There is a battle at a castle, and just as they are all about to be eaten, the freckled girl reveals that her name is Ymir and that she is a Titan Shifter as well. She transforms and kills all the other Titans, but the Ape Titan climbs back over the wall into the lost territory, never to be seen again. Just after the battle, the rest of the SC arrive. At that moment, Reiner cracks under the pressure, and privately reveals to Eren that he is the Armoured Titan and Bertolt is the Colossal Titan, and that they were sent from a far-away 'village' of some sort to kill all of humanity. He says that if Eren comes with them, then their mission will end, and they will leave the Wall Country alone. A battle breaks out between Eren, the SC, and Reiner and Bert. Eren and the SC almost win, but R and B capture him and Ymir and escape over the walls. The SC launch a mission to rescue them. There is a huge battle. R and B reveal that they were sent in search of the 'Coordinate' Ability, but don't know where or what it is. Just as all hope seems lost, Eren uses the Coordinate Ability by accident, revealing that he somehow had it. It allows him to control the mindless Titans, and he orders them to attack R and B. They use the distraction to return to the Walls, but Ymir willingly goes along with R and B, and those 3 escape back to the 'village'. Along the way, Krista reveals that she is actually Historia Reiss and grew up on a farm with her negligent mother, and her father, who she did not meet until she was older, told her to go in hiding shortly after the fall of Wall Maria. The SC realize that the Monarchy is hiding secrets and are suppressing information, and decide to launch a coup. They succeed in overthrowing the Monarchy, but discover many things, such as that the Reiss family is the true Royal Family, and have the ability to somehow erase the memories of the entire population, and that is why no one remembers what the outside world was like. They are also stopping the development of technology by murdering inventors and people who ask questions, like Erwin's dad. It is also revealed that Levi is related to Mikasa, and so is one of the agents of the Reiss, named Kenny. Their family, the Ackermans, have a special power, and thus were oppressed by the government. Historia and Eren are both captured by Rod Reiss, her father, and he reveals to Eren that Eren's father killed the entire Reiss family by turning into a Shifter, and unlocks Eren's memories. It is shown that after his father injected him with some strange serum, he turned into a Titan and ate his father, gaining his father's Coordinate ability, which his father had stolen by eating the Reiss family. The latest chapter ends with Rod convincing Historia that he is the real good guy, and he is about to inject her with the same serum in the hope that she eats Eren and regains the Coordinate Ability.")

So yeah, a ton of interesting stuff has happened. We've gained a lot more mysteries, but have also gotten a lot of answers as well. The manga has even more action and more politics after the anime ends. I had to leave out a *ton* of important details though, so you'd have to read the manga to get the whole story.

Huh?  Did you mean "The second season **was** announced at the end of the first movie**, which** premiered today in Japan."?
>> ARTICLE
If i remember correctly it was stated that the manga will be 200 chapters and currently has only 63, and i don't know how long will the anime continue but due to the popularity I'm guessing it will go till the end of the manga. So by the time season 2 starts airing we should have 30-40 episodes that can be animated, and by the time it catches up to the manga we should have at least another 20, so they can go for 50-60 episodes without having to make us wait more or make fillers.
>> ARTICLE
It's confirmed to have about 25 volumes, and we are currently on Volume 16.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprising, the manga will be done by then after all (I believe it is slated for 20 volumes?)
>> ARTICLE
It was later changed to 25ish, and is supposed to end in "3 to 4 years", so it will still go on a while after the second season. There will even be enough material for a third season if they keep animating at the same pace.

Why is it still in bessatsu and not weekly shonen? It had great sales numbers last year,  I'd think theyd move it.

The author is overworked enough as it is, and the quality would suffer a lot. The art's not that great to start with, so rushing it to weekly release would just make it worse.

Hopefully they realize there is no need for this show to keep going and cancel it.

I feel bad for Mikasa, she is so sexualized even though her character is barely sexual. 
>> ARTICLE
Funny, Mikasa herself would say exactly the opposite.
>> ARTICLE
Why would you feel bad? People are attracted to her, because people are attracted to a strong characters.

Do you believe that being sexy strips a human out of his other qualities? Like he can be a whole valuable human being or sexy but not both?
>> ARTICLE
Nah, it's just that there are so many sexualized girls in anime, and as soon as there isn't one who is somewhat awesome, she is automatically sexualized. As a girl, I love variety in girls in anime, not just the usual large boobed shallow girl, and Mikasa was to me an awesome badass female character who was different than the others, I guess. It makes me sad that she is fanart-ed with large boobs and a large butt, looking sexy and junk. 
>> ARTICLE
Why would it sadden you? Men like awesome pretty women, is it a surprise? Remember that nothing is substracted from a person when somebody is attracted to him, despite the hordes of sex-negative people trying to prove you otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the issue is that the character is sexualized, but rather that she is drawn with proportions that she doesn't actually have in the show, to make her *extra* sexualized.  Like all the pictures that show a gigantic camel toe.

If you decide to watch it, try to it's now about a good time to start.  Just try to avoid comment threads since spoilers for this show is pretty serious.  Your waiting pain will be about 7 days long per week.

If you decide to read it, go nuts.  Your waiting pain will last about a whole month.  The good thing is that you'll have avoided all the potential spoilers for the show since the show is very faithful to the original.

Both the anime and manga are superb in their own right, so choose whichever format best serves you.  Now, do what you must.

I can't say on the reading front, but the show has been extraordinarily fun episode to episode with no spoilers. Kinda makes up for already knowing what's going on in Game of Thrones this season.

The reading is great as well. Although I normal prefer manga over their anime counterpart, I must admit that the show superbly done. The action scenes are pure eye candy, and the voice acting is wonderful. Minus the small censorship here and there, the anime offers a great experience to the world of titans. I love both works equality. Hopefully the live action movie turns out great as its printed and animated siblings.

Googling doesn't seem to help - what are the boxes that they are wearing on their thighs? Why do the swords have wires? What are the gas tanks on the boxes for? And what's the device in the small of their back? 

How do the above help them kill Titans (yay googling)?
>> ARTICLE
So the boxes on their thighs are containers for their extra blades. The swords are really, really, really sharp and consequently very delicate, so they have to be swapped out pretty frequently. 

The device in the small of their back contains very tightly coiled wires - the wires have very sharp, grooved metal heads and are fired forward in pairs from front of the device near the hips. The firing and coiling of the wires is powered by the gas - in this way, the soldiers are able to build a high amount of inertia and can functionally become airborne as long as there are control surfaces around to maintain altitude (and not crash into things). 

The wires to the swords actually go to the hilts - the hilts have a pair of triggers for firing and coiling the wires in their 'belts'. 

The soldiers would like to be airborne since it's far harder to kill them from the ground. 

Here's the [official preview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKzmOh4SuBc), which should give you a pretty good glimpse at how the stuff they're wearing works. No real spoilers since it's a PV, I'd highly recommend this show based on the existing episodes.
>> ARTICLE
So their wires are Spidey-web, controlled by triggers on the swords, and their swords are Xacto knives writ large. Gotcha. 

Is this show worth tracking down a subbed version for?
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly spidey-web, but yeah you get the basic idea. The general frenzied banter is that it's AotY. I'm not convinced yet, but it's definitely the best show of the year *so far*. Only show in any market I'm enjoying more is Game of Thrones.

I love Mikasa mainly because she isn't over sexualized like a lot of female protagonists or female characters are in anime.
That's why although good, a lot of these fanarts don't fit her personality. 

There is no need to make her ass the main focus, or explicitly draw her a cameltoe in order to make Mikasa look sexy.
>> ARTICLE
Amen brother.

The only gripe I have about the show is that it didn't do Mikasa justice in portraying her character.  Not enough dead eyes, too much lip sticks! Her empty, bottomless iris IMO is one of the most defining traits in the manga.  It contrasts the rare moments when she does show her emotion.

I wish the fan arts would capture that side of her more and less sexualizing... Go do that for Sasha and Krista, whatever, but Mikasa is too badass for that.

I can't tell if that's a guy or a girl.

I was gonna reply "It's obviously a girl."

Upon further inspection, we're in the same boat. I can't tell either.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the jawline and hair are very non-specific.

It could be lighting or makeup, but it *looks* like his/her chest has gotten a lot less sun than the rest of him/her, though, so I'm *guessing* it's a girl.

Also, if we're going full on gender-roles here, he/she is really good at makeup.
>> ARTICLE
It's a she.

That's awesome, only thing I'd say is to go for a little heavier/more defined outlining between the lips and the teeth.  Sorta looks like they bleed into one another (or it could just be the lighting, not sure).

I think that's the intention.

You could tell there was a clear differentiation between the flesh and teeth in the anime/manga, though.

Its freaky but cool how all of these Shingeki no Kyojin look on people.Everyone I have seen do a lot of detail with the makeup like this one.

Well, Morphsuits does make that one muscle kind; mod it up a bit and you got yourself a suitable colossal titan.

edit: I just wanted to share it with you guys on reddit, I loved this look and I thought you guys would too! 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen this anime, but the makeup look very cool! Is this one pretty popular? I've definitely heard the name...
>> ARTICLE
Same reaction here. I started seeing it just about everywhere so I checked it out. Probably the best manga I've read in years. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been reading the manga and it is positively riveting. I haven't read/watched something this exciting in years.
>> ARTICLE
I stayed away from it for a while because of the fact that it was in the horror genre (not usually keen on that) but after seeing it on the 2nd spot of the popular section of Crunchyroll I thought I should see what the fuss was about, especially after seeing a lot about it on this sub. There's a reason why it's doing so well, so you should at least watch the first episode to see for yourself because I'm not going to be able to explain why.
>> ARTICLE
Like Slender_Mann said, it is mainly shounen, but the manga does have more horror/gore than the anime (from what I have seen). I feel that the horror elements are meant to make you feel how helpless humans are in this universe, it isn't there just for the hell of it. It is used well. Great characters and strong story. I recommend watching the first few episodes and deciding from there.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know I've been keeping up with it. It's also described as a tragedy which really just sums it up. It really goes against the grain of the usual main character who just happens to have powers that make the enemy seem arbitrary, whereas with this series it's the other way around in many respects.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely not horror genre. If it is, the horror genre got really soft. It's shounen: full of manly action and cool stuff that makes noise. Also Old Spice.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry that's what I saw when I first looked it up on wikipedia (although I really shouldn't trust it for genre placing because it's wrong a lot of the time), so yeah my bad.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's probably the most popular one this season.

Be forewarned that it's really fucking intense. but in an enjoyable way.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy intense! Will check it out. :)
>> ARTICLE
Best anime this season. Maou-Sama is second. 
>> ARTICLE
1. Titan
2. OreImo
3. Maou-Sama
4. Chihayafuru 2 
5. My Teen Romantic Comedy is not what I expected

It's hard to number them cuz they're all pretty damn great. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok so I had to see this and I was totally blown away. I completely second your opinion. How many episodes are out yet though I've only seen 8 and I need more. How often do new ones air?

EDIT: Question unnecessary; I discovered google. leaving the comment though to support the original claim to the show's awesomeness
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu, while obviously lacking in the visuals department is more than making up for it in character and story. Giving Maou-sama a run for its money.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I'm also enjoying Suisei no Gargantia, even if it stagnated for a couple episodes. The color palette is gorgeous.
>> ARTICLE
I love all the made up languages! I prefer Ente Isla over the Galactic Alliance dialect though.
>> ARTICLE
what's that one about?
>> ARTICLE
The backstory is that humans developed space travel, left the Earth, but eventually lost the coordinates to get home. Meanwhile, civilization on Earth essentially collapsed when sea levels rose dramatically, and now the remaining humans live on [fleets of ships](http://rabujoi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/suisei82.jpg?w=604) that travel around the surface covered in water.

The space-faring humans are fighting a galactic war, and during one of the battles, a soldier named [Ledo](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/3/31225/637486-suisei_no_gargantia___02___large_04.jpg) and his battle mech [Chambers](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vRZc6-8jyNU/UWYeuY8a_xI/AAAAAAAC5hY/6kPdxGHQZ9g/s1600/Suisei+no+Gargantia+-+02+-2.jpg) get flung through a wormhole and end up back on Earth, where they meet [Amy](http://dalian.7thstyle.com/2013/04/suisei-no-gargantia-ep-3-seventhstyle-014-614x345.jpg) and everyone else who lives on Gargantia, one of the fleets.

The anime starts out as a fish-out-of-water story, where Ledo is completely unaccustomed to anything but military life, and needs to learn the language and customs of Gargantia. Now the pace is starting to pick up, as he attempts to contact the other space-faring humans, and meanwhile the galactic war may be finally coming to Earth...

Check it out, I do recommend it. Eps 5-6 drag a little, but the rest of the episodes have been excellent. It's one of the most visually stunning animes I've ever seen, so watch in high quality if you can.
>> ARTICLE
I love this one for it's art. I'm blown away by what they're managing to do. Also, the world building they did is well fleshed out.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed-- don't know if you ever played Chrono Cross, but the color palette reminds me a lot of that game, lots of bright colored clothes against the teal green of the sea. Also because [Kid](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091217201957/chrono/images/a/a6/Kid.jpg) and [Amy](http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/05/21/91149/b7a9afd0236796375ad7e050a977965f.jpg) wear basically the exact same outfit.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of people are saying it's the best of the season. I'm enjoying it immensely.
>> ARTICLE
It gets even crazier in the manga, so I am excited to see it in the anime. It follows pretty much word for word what happens.
>> ARTICLE
It is actually better than the manga if I do say so myself. I see the anime and then read the manga up to the point where the anime I watched has reached. There are extra scenes in the anime that are not even in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Well obviously you are saying so yourself. You give no indication that you are being forced to say this opinion your that you are conveying someone else's opinion willingly.  So its technically redundant to state 'if I do say so myself' because its clear contextually.
>> ARTICLE
You have to keep reading. The anime shows things in a different order.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean that. I meant that some scenes in the anime like for example [anime spoiler](/s "the way in which the armored Titan was portrayed") were way better and much more fleshed out than the brief scene in the manga.

So after seeing that ep, I was wondering [Spoilers] (/s "if maybe the reason that their weak spots are where they are, is because that's where the people that those giants are based off are.") That was a very poorly worded sentence but hopefully you get the idea. 
>> ARTICLE
All this time it's been a mecha anime is disguise
>> ARTICLE
Oh god. That'd make me sad. Lol.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of got that feeling as well. [Post-Ep 8 conjecture](/s "Like they're giant construct beings controlled by the base instincts of humans. Maybe they eat humans in the hope that they will be freed. Eren's will to kill all titans, however, was so powerful that it *completely* overwhelmed the santa titan that ate him and this abnormal was born of it. Then by using all of the power of the titan, he drained his fury on any titan he could until the very end when the shell dissolved around him. The other titans were trying to eat the Eren titan because they wanted him to replace them as the host of their bodies, freeing them of their 'torment'?")
>> ARTICLE
you guys just blew my mind.

Haven't watched 8 yet. Has it been subbed?

Why didn't you spoiler this? 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoiler!](/s "LOL anyone notice when Reiner said he was glad Annie wasn't injured. That would of gone differently if she was.")
>> ARTICLE
It is only now that i am aware of certain things that I pick up on stuff like this. It's nice.
>> ARTICLE
Especially noticing that group being in focus in the anime more. Good foreshadowing, nobodies picking up either
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't say no one... Someone in the anime thread suggested a connection for the armored titan. Could be a troll though.  
>> ARTICLE
I love this anime for this exact reason, nobody in the other thread seems to be noticing what the manga readers are noticing, no ones picking up on the intense twist coming later on in the season.

Can't wait for that reveal, and for everyone to go back to previous episodes to check the scenes out.
>> ARTICLE
Something that I didn't quite realize during my first read through of the manga is [mild spoiler?](/s "how often Reiner and Annie actually talk to each other, or support what the other is proposing"). It all makes sense in hindsight. I'm definitely paying attention to the trio and how they react to what's happening on screen...
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoiler](/s "Yeah when you know everything so many of their conversations have double meaning particularly instances of  ~we~ should use his power for ~our~ cause")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "My favourite part is watching Bertholdt's face whenever Reiner and Annie say something that might give them away. He makes the same faces in the manga, but it's interesting to watch how he reacts to instances like when Reiner immediately goes with everyone else to the tower, and when he suggests saving the abnormal titan.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, me too. Although now that I've  reread the manga, all these scenes are all in there, so the anime isn't embelishing anything. Yet it seems to be much more obvious seeing it on screen and it makes me wonder [](/s 'If the anime only-watchers will catch on much faster after Annie is revealed as a titan. I remember reading Bert/Reiner therories before their recent reveal, but those were all usually shut down and ridiculed on /a/ and other boards for being not substantial enough, making the actual reveal still a huge shocker, besides the hints.') Will be intersting to see if this will play out differently with the anime fanbase (though I kinda doubt there will be many anime-only watchers left at the end. The story is just too intruiging not to pick up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Such a nonchalant phrase as well. You wouldn't realise the significance of it until later on
>> ARTICLE
After finishing the manga, man, just noticing the things I never picked up.

Especially how Reiner immediately started to question Connie about the Titan. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i had to go back and check to see if i just glazed over it while reading or if it was added in the anime.

>> ARTICLE
It was the little bumb Annie made at that moment that made me proud the most.
>> ARTICLE
A pretty intense episode. The entire tower adventure had my heart pumping and seeing the titans turn to face the soldiers in the elevator freaked me out just as much as they freaked the soldiers on screen, haha... 

I wasn't expecting to cry at the end, but... [it's hard not to when you see Mikasa's face](http://imgur.com/d5b6HyZ).

All in all, a pretty good episode.

Mikasa is adorable.

>> ARTICLE
There's actually more. [major Manga spoiler](/s "in the manga right before that scene when they are talking about the colossal, the panel shows you know who"). I'm kind of sad that they removed it, but I guess too many cuts in that scene might make it too obvious
>> ARTICLE
It looks like they added more Marco scenes right? 

BTW, fuck my download speed.

I like that they are adding Marco scenes. I nearly forgot who he was in the manga.

I'll do that next time.

[manga spoiler](/s "well, wasn't Marco pretty much obliterated in half by a titan during this invasion in the manga? I haven't seen this episode yet, but I'm pretty sure that happened.")

[manga spoiler again] (/s "woah woah alright, this is weird. Marco's "you're cut out to be a leader line" was in a different flashback that Jean remembers randomly while they were in training. I definitely remember that scene from the manga, weird that they switched it up to here.")

edit: the edit applies to the 2nd spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a pretty common trend for the anime to show stuff in continuity rather than resort to flashbacks. I think a lot of it is to help with pacing. The show seems to be going pretty fast as it is (I think they could even catch up with the manga given 24ish episodes). I imagine they would have blown through a lot of content if they hadn't included flashbacks in the main storyline. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure, but you should spoiler tag stuff not show in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
fair enough, I edited it, also the second spoiler should explain the marco thing.
>> ARTICLE
[2nd manga spoiler](/s "nvm, I totally forgot about Marco.  Maybe they want to show his death firsthand in the anime version?  So the small back and forths with Jean add up to character development and more likely motivations later")

Edited.
>> ARTICLE
that's pretty fair, i honestly don't 100% remember the context of the flash back in the manga, so i can't say much to it's setting. also may want to rework your spoiler tag there.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny, I didn't remember him until chapter 34-ish. I like how the anime gives him more early scenes.
>> ARTICLE
This is a responce to /u/Nissi's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f1twt/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca6b4ad).

____

[I read the manga as soon as EP2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1cfmtb/just_read_shingeki_no_kyojin_mangas_latest/) was out because I could see the popularity getting big enough to catch the troll's attention and I didn't want to get spoiled.

The anime dropped a huge hint in EP2, when Eren is getting injected with something by his dad in a very confusing scene. That scene was not in the manga by the time Titan-kun gets introduced (neither were the training episodes). So, manga readers had less clues about Eren's death than the anime-viewers. We only knew who were the Top 10.

Still, as I was reading, I had this strange feeling that I saw that Titan somewhere before, a wishful thinking of sorts. And it got more wishful when that titan took a fighting stance and punches another titan in a similar fashion than that of a previous struggle that Eren had with Jean. That punch made %80 sure it was him.

When the reveal takes place, it felt like a huge release. I said, "wow" to myself while reading. A reaction similar to that of Jean and most of the speculating anime-viewers. Personally, back then it was somewhat disappointing that the story didn't take the MuvLuv approach (Man vs Alien), that toned down my expectations a bit. But Shingeki does its own thing, it eventually delivered more than what I was waiting for. 

The same will apply to the anime so keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I've went thru the manga again (which I do periodically to quench the thirst), and the injection scene was shown as early as Chapter 3, page 20ish.  I know the injection scene you were referring to after the titan reveal, but both scenes in the manga dealt with different details.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the writeup, interesting read and very much appreciated. I just checked out the first couple chapters of the manga, and the absence of flashbacks was the most notable difference in what is generally a pretty faithful adaptation. Between that and the inability to see eye color, I was thinking it was a bit trickier. (You said you were at 80%; I was probably at 90%+ that it was Eren somehow.) 

It's great that almost everyone who has read the manga indicates that it stays worthwhile all the way up through the current issue. The show moves through plot points at a breakneck pace so I'm impressed it hasn't run out of steam.

The following message is for Manga peeps ONLY (up to the 42+ chapter).  HUGE SPOILERS IMPLICATION.

What do you guys think about [this comment from the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1f1twt/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_attack_on_titan/ca5ymgc)? An honest an innocent speculation or a jackass trying to ruin things for others?

My money is on the latter.  There really is not enough clue for anyone to make that inference right now.  That's really sinister though... why would anyone do that?  I really hope I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I belive that it's honest. Look at his history, he seems to be an anmie-only poster.  Also, he's a brony. A doubt a brony would be so many to spoiler others like that intentionally.
>> ARTICLE
I think the latter as well, it really isn't something you will see unless you are actually looking for it. I can see it all now as I've read the manga, it was the biggest shock ever the first time I read it though. Who knows, maybe it is just a lucky guess, they do look similar after all.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's honest. 

Heck, a month ago I asked my brother (who never read the manga) who lives and who dies for each character that appeared in EP4.

He failed to guess that Eren would "die". But for the rest of them, 95% accuracy man. And the scarier part was [Huge Manga Spoiler](/s "when I was going through the TOP10 list, I asked for Annie and Reiner: "Will these die?." He said: "these are actually the true bad guys, look how mean they look""). I said nothing hahaha Bert-style!

I trust he didn't get himself spoiled because he was very surprised to see Eren get chomped and very confused when Titan-kun appeared last week.

Marco's "you're cut out to be a leader line" was in a different flashback that Jean remembers randomly while they were in training.

The romaji is Rivai, which is why the translators thought it was Rivaille, it is pronounced in Japanese as Levi. The author said on his blog that it is Levi and he got the name from some kid in the Jesus Camp documentary.

Meta suggestion: use a tag like "[Manga Readers Thread]" or something similar, as "regular thread" is ambiguous.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there doesn't seem to be a "Regular Thread" anymore. In fact, I'd instead let the manga thread a spoiler-allowed thread, since, after all, discussing foreshadowings is mostly what we do.
>> ARTICLE
I want it ambiguous. Anime-only viewers can get in this thread as well and ask questions here that don't belong in the other thread (like manga comparisons or straight up spoilers). Manga spoilers have to be tagged anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I was under the assumption that manga spoilers were not tagged in this thread. Maybe I should've read the post body before commenting.

My point was more to do with being able to tell what the thread is meant for at a glance without more context. (like opening the thread itself or seeing that the other thread is the "Anime-Only" one.) I don't think someone looking to be spoiled would be dissuaded by the title.
>> ARTICLE
Talking about anything that has not happened in the anime, despite it happening in the manga, should be tagged with a spoiler tag, even if it's posted in this thread.

Edit: Not warning you, just anyone that visits this thread. If you got confused, others might as well. :)
>> ARTICLE
man, Eren really does border on MC-in-a-harem level intelligence when it comes to Mikasa's feeling
>> ARTICLE
Not really, mikasa doesnt love him like a boyfriend. Its more of a sisterly love.
>> ARTICLE
and Eren doesn't realize that.

I'm just calling him dumb like a MC in a harem.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it is as much that he doesn't realize that she cares about him. If anything I think it is just that Eren simply doesn't care.
>> ARTICLE
It's a horrible melange of the two. Conflicted feelings which she even more confusingly expresses in purely protective terms to him, which he resents.
>> ARTICLE
completely disagree, eren is everything to mikasa to an obsessive point. i'm not completely sure if her true feelings are just under the surface or she's scared of losing him too much to admit them but i am certain they're there
>> ARTICLE
Ain't no MC got space for love on their raging mind.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad for Mikasa, Eren only has boners for murder.
>> ARTICLE
This episode went kinda slow. 

[I was certain](/s "he was going to block the hole in this episode, or at the very least regain control")
>> ARTICLE
I figured that the episode would end around that point. They seem to be adapting the manga, panel for panel. Though that is a good thing, the scenes all feel a lot longer animated than they did when reading the manga. I suppose that is to be expected to a degree though. Even if it was slow though, the whole episode felt really intense, and I loved the scene with the soldiers attempting to abandon and whatnot. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the idea was to end it on a cliffhanger with Eren punching Mikasa. In the manga that is where the chapter ends.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it would end at this cliffhanger two episodes ago... but I greatly underestimated how slowly the anime is going. Guess 20 minutes really isn't that long.

But episode 14 is supposed to be a recap, so they'll have to wrap up the Trost Arc soon. [Unfortunately,](/s "it'll likely take more than an episode for Eren to snap back to reality..")
>> ARTICLE
I imagine they're going to end EP 13 with plugging the hole, have the recap episode, and then start with the [spoiler](/s "courtroom and best character levi business after.")
>> ARTICLE
I think the passing feels weird not because they decided to do a certain number of chapters per episode. The are trying to finish with a cliffhanger every singe time.
>> ARTICLE
Most (if not all) of the episode endings are the same as the manga chapter they adapted. That's how serialized manga works during its early chapters.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, is it just me, or is the skin around Pixis' eyes much more wrinkled and scarred than in the manga? [manga spoilers] (/s "His eyes in the anime almost look like the titan transformation scars around the eyes have become permanent")

EDIT: Upon remembering that I actually have 7 volumes of the manga in my house, I just decided to check and it turns out that I'm wrong. I just didn't really notice it before, really.
>> ARTICLE
How do you have 7 volumes? Have 6 and 7 been translated in print yet?
>> ARTICLE
I have them in Japanese, not English, which is why I have 7 (I'll get the next 4 soon).
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, now that I look at it that seems like a very specific aspect of Pixis' character design. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to get a little worried about the show. I've been very into Attack On Titan since the moment I saw Ep. 1, but these last 2 episodes have the most ridiculous pacing compared to the rest of the show. Out of nowhere, the show stops and grinds to a halt, while most of the other episodes had been skipping around the timeline and picking out the best, most dramatic action scenes. 


With so many cliffhangers, I feel this show loses its "replay value". I feel like the show is starting to build itself off of cliffhangers. Unfortunately, when I watch it again (and I know I will), I know the cliffhangers, I know all the twists. It won't surprise me as much. 

I may just wait the a few weeks so I can watch the next few episodes in one sitting, simply because it's so grueling to wait an entire week for an episode you expect to be packed full of action, only to receive an episode that seems obviously low-budgeted and mostly consisting of dialogue and stills. 


This episode was simply disappointing. 
>> ARTICLE
I know it went kinda slow but this episode is just what we needed, not every episode can be action-ed packed.
>> ARTICLE
Its Episode 11 and I have yet to see 1 person of color...  They have people from Asia but not anywhere else?
>> ARTICLE
of course there's no other people of color, they were the distractions while whitey built the walls...
>> ARTICLE
Severe budget limitations in this episode. That beautiful 3DMG scene made it even more noticeable. I don't mind them as long as that budget is being allocated for the following stories. This is the worst part of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say the worst part.. I thought Pixis' speech was beautiful. But the transition between the stills and the animation was a bit jarring. 

With this slow pacing I'm not sure if they'll even get far enough to end the season well, much less to chapter 30.
>> ARTICLE
There will be chapter without any dialouge and only action, that should give them some head. Though I'm starting to worry that they will end it on chaoter 30, and not actually after that. 
>> ARTICLE
He sure does know his drinks. Better than someone else (not Eren) will, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
someone who reads the manga please tell me [Spoiler question](/s "if eren comes back to his senses and what happens to mikasa!?!?")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler Answer](/s "Don't worry she's fine, and he'll regain control")
>> ARTICLE
[Thanks](/s "I almost got a heart attack")
>> ARTICLE
wtf was that ending.
>> ARTICLE
I hope this isn't the pattern for the rest of the series. A large number of still frames then a burst of slick animation which are always always action oriented. I'd rather a more even distribution of effort, the episode would feel a lot less fragmented, as of now it feels like it is distinctly alternating between action and dialogue. 

Also just to make sure I'm not stupid, that high speed flying was probably a lot more sped up than it should be right? Pretty cool just seemed a tiny bit fast.

One more thing to add, some scenes feel too overly dramatized. I guess a lot of people like those quick zooms and shaking when they are just talking but I don't like them for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
This sucks to say, but if this show doesn't pick up I'm going to end up dropping it considering I already know what happens in the story.  Also, those still frames every 2 minutes are getting kind of out of hand and it's so obvious their whole budget went into the 3DMG scene (which, while cool, I thought was incredibly over the top and not in the good way).
>> ARTICLE
Still frames are still a distraction despite my best efforts to ignore them. Everything just feels a lot slower and drawn out even though the pace is technically the same as the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Its not really a budget issue, it's a scheduling issue. If they had more time to make each episode, there would be less use of stills. 
>> ARTICLE
The budget thing was more a joke, but my point still stands on the over usage of still frames and how all their efforts goes into the 3DMG scenes.

I really wish more time would be put into this show because the potential is there but the show is just really slow currently.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with all of your points. They are adapting about 1-1.5 chapters an episode and the pacing of each chapter tends to be all over the place. Some chapters feel like they take place over a 10 minute period, whereas other chapters take place over a 1 day period and this really wrecks the pacing of the manga and subsequently the anime. I have a feeling that the show will continue to alternate between fast paced episodes and slow paced episodes, because that is just the way the source material is written.
>> ARTICLE
anyone else feel like the ending scene was a waste of budget when it isn't even in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Eren punching at Mikasa? that happens in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
sorry i was talking about budget scene with Mikasa and Eren flying around.
>> ARTICLE
They have to find a way to burn all the money they are rolling in somehow.
>> ARTICLE
i think the budget isn't ridiculous high. They are using still frames and recycled scenes to save money.
>> ARTICLE
they needed to put the budget somewhere for this episode. I thought it looked pretty nice, no complaints on that. the budget for this thing has to be way more than most shows anyway (total speculation)
>> ARTICLE
They do cut a lot of corners. You will notice that this show has a lot of still frames.
>> ARTICLE
When I saw Eren grinding, I instantly thought "damn, he even pulls a drifting mini-turbo".

>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend it?

I've only seen a bit of the original Shakugan no Shana, not really my cup of tea. Superpowers and romance I guess? Look into it, it's not bad, just not on my radar.
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Zero no Tsukaima? 
>> ARTICLE
I have not.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, it's fine, I was just going to say that the characters are similar, and I feel like if you like one, you'd like the other.

The show itself is alright, don't expect a masterpiece. The main thing about the show is the characters and their development. Going into it, I expected more action, unfortunately it didn't reach my expectations. Not only that, the fights themselves aren't visually interesting, it's more so the actual feeling to each fight that makes them more interesting. What I mean is that the animation itself is fairly simple, being a giant slice or what not and enemy dies instead of flashy detailed sword fights. But when the fights themselves happen, they hold more emotional value, like protecting someone close.

So, it's more catered towards the story rather than the action, which might be your thing. A lot of people liked it, I personally wanted more fighting involved. If you like Tsundere characters, Shana, the main character, is definitely one of the better ones :P

EDIT: If you want a synopsis, just check out MAL though. I just gave what I thought about the show as a whole. I did watch all 3 seasons as well.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I had that suggested to me by Hulu. It looked cool so I'll probably watch it soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty god damn good.
>> ARTICLE
Can I turn this into a discussion about Shana?

I really liked the first season and some of the second, but I felt like it was becoming less of a plot and action thing and more teen romance harem drama thing, and stopped watching it. Was that just be being dumb? Does it stay good?
>> ARTICLE
I found the second season to be dull, however it picks up again later.  The third season is rather different and the end is really good.
>> ARTICLE
Well. I kinda liked the heavier focus on romance. It was refreshing at the time I started it.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is saying it's creepy, but I think it's pretty freakin' cute.

I dunno, I skipped through it. I was already pretty hyped for the next chapter, but I completely missed those details in the 49th chapter, so now I'm even more hyped. Although more than anything, I got that animehype. The anime's "filler", such as stuff that happened on the 24th episode, 23rd, and the 21st or 22nd with the bodies were great scenes.

Eren in Titan form is basically a miniature Evangelion without any armor. Seriously. The uncontrolled rage. The regeneration. The roars. The positioning in the neck (well technically the entry plug descends into the abdomen). Emotions controlling you. How fucking cool it is. Five bucks says that [*Neon Genesis Evangelion* episode 20?](/s "the soul of Eren's mother is somehow necessary, and that that's what Dr. Jaeger injected into Eren").
>> ARTICLE
I thought he injected something to give him amnesia, so that he wouldn't remember that interaction with his dad. 
>> ARTICLE
>This shot will impair your memory. That's why I can't explain now... Listen to me. Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement. This power will help you then! Their memories will tell you how to use it. Eren! If you get to the basement someday, you'll learn the truth... The path will be harsh and cruel, but you must make it there! If you want to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else, you must master this power!

--Dr. Jaeger, quoted from episode 9
>> ARTICLE
That sounds like the real power is in the basement.
>> ARTICLE
no, I'm pretty sure he got the injection way before the mother died. The injection is like a distant childhood memory he can't fully recall because of reasons.

No it was after his mom died. The day the titans attacked Eren's dad had the key to the basement. When he injected him he gave him the key.

Are you sure? In [episode 18,](/s "when EVA-01 has eaten Zeruel and its armor is exploding off, Ritsuko says that the armor wasn't really armor, but bindings to keep the Evangelion under control.") Wouldn't it follow that an Evangelion without armor would be out of control?
>> ARTICLE
Out of their control, not it's own. They want and need the Eva under control to fulfill the Dead Sea Scrolls prophecy. 

[NGE](/s "Remember, Eva-01 is the key to Third Impact. The rest of the Eva's are based on Adam while it's based on Lillith, so that they can combine the two Fruits and create the perfect being aka tang world. An impact is the changing of the dominant beings in the world. The first impact was Eve creating humanity, shifting the world from Adam to us.")

I feel that seemed like part of Erwin's plan.  If he wanted a way to make the MPs spring into action, he needed to convince them that there could be a titan within the walls.

Can you make a gif of Hanji casually walking off the rooftop?

This is kind of random, but I appreciate the fact that Mikasa actually had to dodge those large rocks. A lot of times, boulders are merely used as special effects in anime...
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe no one has mentioned that first GIF. Easy to be overshadowed by all the turning-into-Titans business, but COME ON! 3D MANEUVER GEAR TRAPEZE SHOW! Shame it didn't pan out...

edit: And as for that first newly-added one, somebody needs to try and make that in a 3D animation. I need a still-camera perspective of that.

edit2: I knew you would post a GIF of Annie transforming. Now we just need that slowed down. Man, I'm awfully demanding tonight, aren't I?
>> ARTICLE
The best part would be if that was complete accident. And the reason the guy got caught is because he was thinking "Shit how did i end up going back at her??!?"
>> ARTICLE
Did you see how Mikasa used her gas to try and get back onto her feet after she dodged the kick?!
>> ARTICLE
Erwin has to be thinking something along the lines of "does that bitch have any idea how much we've spent on giant nets and harpoon cannons?!"  between that and funeral costs, the recon corp has got to be completely broke.

Also, Armin has become considerably manlier than Eren, which is odd coming from the one holding the title of "best girl" in a shounen show.

As time goes on it's clear that something is VERY, VERY wrong with Mikasa. It's understandable that she would have issues considering past events but she's starting to come off as someone who could just snap at any moment. Especially since she clearly loves Eren but so far he hasn't shown much interest in her. 
>> ARTICLE
love fucks you up
>> ARTICLE
hope she goes full Yuno Gasai on Eren... Yandere Mikasa might just be best Mikasa
>> ARTICLE
I really hope she doesnt!
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more. It'd be too cliche if Mikasa ended up with Eren and boring if she accepted rejection. She needs to go yandere.
>> ARTICLE
If they make Mikasa the main antagonist eventually I will flip shit in a good way. Not only would it be a great twist, it'd be something with a lot of emotional depth behind the betrayal (by one or the other).
>> ARTICLE
While that sounds fun and all, the overarching story is as apeshit ridiculously crazy as it can be.  I don't think there's room or reason to turn her into an antagonist... or so I think. But knowing the mangaka, anything is possible....
>> ARTICLE
Her parents were brutally murdered in front of her, she was kidnapped and had to murder one of her kidnappers.

Then she saw her new adoptive parents (well, at least one of them) be brutally eaten alive. Eren is everything she has in life, her savior, her love. There are real people that go bananas because somebody looks at their boy/girlfriend of two months.

I think it's reasonable to except a lot worse than some "issues" from her. 
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa was actually facing away when Mrs. Jaeger was eaten. Hannes was holding her under his arm, facing forward, while he had Eren over his shoulder, facing backward.
>> ARTICLE
She saw what was going to happen and turned her eyes away.
>> ARTICLE
I said it was understandable...but it looks like she may go from "damaged" to "Yuno Gasai."
>> ARTICLE
He should've just said yes. Mikasa would've gone berserk and ended it in 30 seconds.

But then what happens to Eren?

He gets his dick chopped off.

Hanji: "ah, it grew back"

She cuts a piece for herself, and then word spreads, and soon, everyone has a copy of Eren's dick.

No. Everyone has a Copy of Eren's steamy hot dick, except for Mikasa. She has his dick.

He takes a dollar apiece.

Whenever she talks like that, I always thinks she sounds just like Edward Elric from FMA whenever he is nerding out about alchemy.

That fucking second half man, that was some sick nasty shit. I'm once again reminded on how good the OST is, the music during the Eren transformation scene, damn. All those slow episodes? 'twas just saving up for these kinds of episodes, and it was well worth it.

Kind of reminds me of [*Steins;Gate*.](/s "A half dozen episodes spent trying to stop a dystopian, CERN (oops I mean SERN)-controlled future, Okabe realizing his love for Kurisu and having to give it up, tearfully returning to a timeline where Kurisu dies, Mayuri doesn't, and the world will progress without SERN ruling it. 'Ring ring, telephone.' Okabe picks up to hear 'I need your help to stop World War III!' It struck me as kind of ludicrous.")

Eren is forever going to be a murderous badass if he has Mikasa's strength and Arwin's intellect to back him up whenever he pussies out.

>> ARTICLE
Eren being a bitch for 3/4 of the episode but went alpha with that titan falcon punch really made that... 
>> ARTICLE
In the manga, if I remember correctly, he transforms much earlier (during the tunnel scene).

Although they drag out his inability to transform for longer, and make him look more like a bitch, I feel this dramatic tension allowed for a lot of cool fight scenes between Annie and the others, as well as awesome extra dialogue for Armin and Jean.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the extra scenes of action was cool, but it wasn't in favor to Eren's side. In the manga he transformed as soon as he acknowledged Mikasa's words about the world being cruel, because I believe it was the same words he gave to Mikasa to get her to fight the kidnappers (correct me here if I'm wrong).
>> ARTICLE
Sorry bro, I do believe you are wrong.  The "it's a cruel world" thing is something Mikasa figured out on her own, no other character mentions it except when Eren acknowledged her in the tunnel.

What he said back at the kidnappers was "you gotta fight to survive".

I actually find it quite interesting that even though it's a very grim world in general, while mostly similar, all characters have a distinctly different view of it.  If you compare the character's worldviews, it's like looking thru a kaleidoscope.
>> ARTICLE
i mean...he did get impaled by that wood. you have to take that into account to
>> ARTICLE
And he bit into his hand 5+ times, so it's not like he wasn't trying. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't know how annie let that happen, she can sense and stop any number of other people that are much quieter and smaller. A thundering, angry, loud, Eren-titan? Nope, don't see coming and gets punched in the face.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the next step after this is all cleared up should be teaching Eren hand to hand combat. Like seriously getting his martial arts up there and having people jumping him daily so that defending himself becomes second nature. Cause.. I'm tired of seeing him fight like Superman with no form and getting his ass whooped.
>> ARTICLE
He know how to fight hand-to-hand, it's just that the reasons he chooses to transform are usually rage inducing.
>> ARTICLE
But if you really really know how to fight it's second nature to throw a punch in a particular way, it's almost normal for you to defend, deflect and attack in the way your training has programmed you to react without thinking, instinctual.
>> ARTICLE
Eren becomes an animal when he changes, even unconscious skills are lost in the furnace.
>> ARTICLE
Anger clouds even the most ingrained instincts. That's why they make such a show of Annie's dead pan face.
>> ARTICLE
Not really a spoiler since it already happened in the anime, but in the manga [spoiler](/s "Eren is the best in hand to hand out of all the recruits.")
>> ARTICLE
Better than Annie?
>> ARTICLE
I guess. I only read up to Trost because I didn't want to spoil anything ans they haven't really showed Annie. But when he fought jean it was mentioned there.
>> ARTICLE
Eren is third behind Annie and Mikasa. You see flashbacks farther in the manga that Annie did a good bit of practice with Eren back in training. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Well Eren's also a lot faster and bigger (harder to dodge)
>> ARTICLE
Maybe overconfidence? "Heh, I can hear that big stupid lug approaching. This is going to be fun. He's probably going to end up breaking his own--" **BOOSH**
>> ARTICLE
Did she also miss the sky turning yellow and the massive lightning bolt?
>> ARTICLE
Uh... maybe she's not particularly bright. "You know, there sure seems to be an awful lot of lightning everywhere I go."
>> ARTICLE
"Why is there always lightning when I transform. Worst. Luck. Ever."

>> ARTICLE
But did she see the moonwalking bear?
>> ARTICLE
Armin really deserves some credit this episode for running into the fray like 3 times when the odds were he would die. He's had some great character development.
>> ARTICLE
I can never get over how amazing the soundtrack it. I'm so pumped throughout the whole episode!
>> ARTICLE
Hiroyuki Sawano is a beast. Love his work.
>> ARTICLE
[A simple summary of those last 5-ish minutes of the Episode.] (http://i.imgur.com/7Zbdu1K.png)
>> ARTICLE
I see this picture all over the place but it never fails to make me laugh, regardless of the tear-jerking context of those few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
My God, the message that this show is giving is the exact opposite of what we have grown so accustomed to. The power of friendship doesn't overcome all, in fact depending on people has been the cause of most of the suffering Eren has experienced.   

There's no third option that leads to everyone having a happy ending, and hesitating to act has just as terrible consequences as making a poor decision. What surprises me is why it took Eren so long to finally get this into his head since when he was much younger he didn't hesitate to kill those kidnappers. I suppose that his familiarity with Annie was a part of it but still...

If not for that kidnapper scene I would say that Eren represents the traditional anime protagonist. Every traditional idea he holds is figuratively AND literally stomped on. He's still pretty annoying but he's managed to become more interesting; for a time he was starting to really become annoying. He's not a bad character per-say but I feel he could have been better written when it comes to some parts of his personality.  
>> ARTICLE
It seems to me Isayama chooses to develop Eren with a single core lesson each arch and since he's the main character the results of that development are held off until the finale for a climactic fight. 

So that being said, I thoroughly enjoy Eren in the 3rd arc. 
>> ARTICLE
The kidnapper scene was exactly along the line of the entire show though. It helped emphasize the fact that you have to be a murdering batshit insane person willing to risk your own life, in order to survive in this world. Eren doesn't just rescue Mikasa like a knight in shining armor. He's a little kid who straight up murders the kidnappers. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the kidnapper scene shows how much courage Eren actually has. Remember the part when the titans came into the city the second time and some of the soldiers got straight up eaten? Basically everyone stood there watching scared shitless like frozen and couldn't do anything, except Eren who immediately went from 0 to 200 mph to avenge his pal. 

Of course as a result of that he got his leg bitten off instantly but that's a different story.
>> ARTICLE
That was the coolest 3d Gear animation I've seen so far. There have been prettier bits of animation, but it gave me a greater sense of just how *good* these guys are, the weight and speed of their movement, like [the Cirque du Soleil stuff](http://i.minus.com/inmdQwp2Fbxsx.gif) going on with those two guys. [Sideways Mikasa](http://i.minus.com/iDgrbDATheBFH.gif) rapidly switching between her two lines was cool too.
>> ARTICLE
Overall I felt this episode kept up a good pace, but I wish there was some sort of closure to look forward to with the finale.

Thoughts while watching:

At the beginning of the series, I thought Eren was going to be a lot more relentlessly driven and vengeful in a Lelouch-esque way.  Instead, he alternates between insanity/kickassery and being a total bitch.  I was really not having his shit today.  That said, his face prior to transforming was off the charts (complete with blood bubbles at the corners of his mouth - nice).  

Jean, on the other hand, has been getting progressively *more* badass, and has worked his way up in my list of favorites.  

Also, Levi cracked me up at the beginning - "What are you talking about? I'm always talkative."  
>> ARTICLE
> I wish there was some sort of closure to look forward to with the finale.

I think that's why they're adding some of that great filler dialogue and making callbacks to the first arc that weren't in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
[So fucking metal](http://i.minus.com/ibdRaXXXJC346T.gif)
>> ARTICLE
In a way, Eren alternating back and forth is more realistic than if he went all insane/kickass or all bitch. He hesitates with Annie because they were somewhat close during their trainee days. Even if he doesn't harbor romantic feelings for her, he sees her as a comrade, and as a human being. Humanity's/Eren's fight is supposed to be against Titans in a black-and-white fashion, but Annie being able to transform into a Titan blurs the lines. 
>> ARTICLE
OHHHHHH YES!!!

 a rematch!


 I like that they had a plan to set Annie up in the first place. Eren was a bit wish-washy about it. . .that's expected, honestly. He didn't wanna believe all the way up to seeing it with his own eyes. *sigh*
 
 Was that Mikasa getting a little jealous?!?!? :) She had some serious Higurashi eyes going for a second there.

 Mikasa and everyone else trying to get a piece of Annie looked insane.   This is shaping up to be one of the best endings of the season.
 

 (this episode showed up on Crunchy right after I had just finished watching Gatchaman CROWDS. . . .had to be an hour ago or something. crazy)
>> ARTICLE
Did...Eren have feelings for Annie?

That aside, at least we're in for another Titan MMA match next week.
>> ARTICLE
Eren was introduced as a straightforward boy with strong ideals and a black-and-white perspective of the world. Annie kinda put him in his place and made him realize that it's foolish to run off ideals alone. 

He didn't give up on his ideals or anything, but his character grew both physically and mentally in skill and perspective because of her. Of course he would feel uneasy when someone like that directly betrays you.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. That feeling is called friendship.
>> ARTICLE
So it's strictly platonic? The way Mikasa phrased it made it sound like he had a bit of a crush on her. Maybe I just read it wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's exactly what she was implying. He didn't give a straight answer.
>> ARTICLE
Now that this season is coming to an end next week makes me sad. 
>> ARTICLE
*dat [nose](http://i.imgur.com/TWRspTM.png)*
>> ARTICLE
Her secret weapon. When all of her fingers are cut off from people escaping when she grabs them (seriously if both Reiner and Mikasa could do it without having planned to do so, Annie's gotta rethink that strategy), what kind of attack does she pick?

She picks her nose.
>> ARTICLE
I can't get over how good the soundtrack is, and how well placed it is.  Linked Horizon was a great choice.  As for the actual episode, I knew that Eren was going to transform, and I think it's actually a bit disappointing.  
>> ARTICLE
What song started playing as Eren transformed again? Someone linked it a while ago, but I forgot what it was.
>> ARTICLE
It's just called "Attack On Titan". It's the first song in the OST.

[Here's a link to the part of the song where he transforms in this episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8ISbYIXICE&list=PLBvg_WyIsKYLDnCKodFYRqFfpZrnWQfLZ&feature=player_detailpage#t=150)
>> ARTICLE
god that is so good. thank you very much!
>> ARTICLE
The music is definitely one of the best things about the anime.  I couldn't tell exactly what set this apart from other animes that I've watched, until I realized how the music was so damn enjoyable and how well it worked into the action scenes.  Top notch production all around.
>> ARTICLE
all i have to say this week is that doesn't levi look so handsome in non uniform ;D

jokes aside wow cliffhangers! and im assuming something about next week as soon as i saw erens eyes, dunno if im right but its killing me not knowing what goes down as a non manga reader :p

When Mikasa said: "Her face resembles the female titan" I was like FINALLY! /slowclap
>> ARTICLE
You know, I'm a man with few strong emotions. I don't know why, I've just been that way for a few years now. I have my ups and downs, but they tend to be comparatively small. The question of "how's it going" is always answered by "good," with "I guess" mentally appended. For me to experience a strong emotion is no common occurrence.

The sheer excitement and amazement I display when watching this show is phenomenal. In the minutes leading up to Eren's transformation, I had arms tensed, legs starting to bounce on the floor uncontrollably. I would have been shaking my desk had I been holding on to it. I was trembling all over. As he transformed and he was about to be shown on-screen, I may as well have been a paint mixer. I think I thrust my fist out in amazement/solidarity when he socked Annie in the face. If I wasn't so drawn into the show, I would have stood up and cheered. As the show ended and my excitement had nowhere left to go, I just ended up flailing all my limbs in random directions. I sat back and kind of convulsed as the credits rolled.

This is one of (if not the)strongest reactions of any kind I've had toward anything. At this point, it's not even about whether the show is good or bad. You could throw a perfectly legitimate, completely supported criticism of one of the flaws of this episode/show at me, and I would say, "So what? What other show has me do... THIS?" and flop about on the ground.

It's a bit hard to really put into detail how mind-numbingly neutral and even-tempered I am sometimes, but even if you don't get the magnitude of that, surely you can appreciate that this show makes me lose control of my limbs.

**tl;dr *Attack on Titan* is better than jizzing**

Also, this fucking show and its flashbacks. Annie has transformed into the Female Titan within Wall Sina, massive casualties and destruction are about to happen, the Titan boxing match of the century is coming up, TIME FOR A FLASHBACK! It works, though.

[Welcome to the "I watch anime/consume media because I'm an emotional junkey" club](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/1mja8i/monday_minithread/ccaf2jb?context=2).

Know from your senpai that slowly, the frequency and height of the emotions rise, and rarely you even feel a tingle at the back of your throat in real life, as you form it into narratives and then imbue it with emotional significance.

And with that, I'm going to sleep.
>> ARTICLE
You know, it sounds like that could be me, but really it isn't. I enjoy the anime I watch and am often emotionally touched by it, but it's never like this, (almost) never a physical reaction. Just a smile, or a laugh, or a palm to the face, sometimes even an awestruck look. An elevated heartbeat if you're lucky.
>> ARTICLE
>also, this show and its fucking flashbacks though

I have to admit, I'm rather proud of the creators. Instead of giving us 20 minutes of recap, they actually have us quite a bit of action. And that's good. I loved the 3DMG segments. 
>> ARTICLE
They love to put that "camera on a rocket orbiting the characters" at the end of episodes. I really like how there's no generic speed lines/backgrounds in these segments: you can see precisely where the characters are in 3D space.
>> ARTICLE
That's probably one of the most visually impressive things about this show. Following Mikasa as she maneuvered Annie Titan was crazy and disorienting but I knew where exactly she was in relation to her surroundings. The animators really outdo themselves when they use 3D maneuver gear.

Yeah, uh, those sound effects when Eren was biting his hand was just...gross. Seriously, that shit was nasty - I didn't feel anything when I saw the broken up corpses before in the show, but something about Eren repeatedly chomping on his own hand is creepy and disturbing as fuck. 

Also, wow, Mikasa-Annie cat-fight over Eren? Settle down, you two, he's really not worth fighting over.

Oh Jesus, Hanji, you are one fucking crazy bitch. You're still best girl though <3

Wow, Eren, it took you two fights with her to finally get a hit in? Noobcake.

Man, it's weird how often this show oscillates between mind-numbingly dull and fast-paced awesome. Hopefully, it'll end on a strong note. Looking forward to next week, which is the first time I've said that in weeks.

I feel like Jean has grown so much on me. And of course his character has grown a lot too. When he looks at the MP he says: "I could have easily been those guys". You realise how much he's grown. From being the big pussy he was in episode 5 to fighting Annie head on. I love Jean's character development and how ironic his fate turns out from his choices as a soldier. Him and Armin are definitely my favourites.

Notable mention to the cool cat near the end.
>> ARTICLE
Eren was so much less of a bitch in the manga. He transformed right away after Mikasa said [the world is a cruel place](http://imgur.com/a/XJkp3). I can understand the filler though because they want to end it around chapter 33 I guess.
>> ARTICLE
So I just read the manga chapter for this episode and it's weird how they have Eren transform right before Misaka and Armin are about to jump out of the hole. It looks like they skipped the whole part of him being trapped under the rubble. Odd.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing. I think it was to drag the episode out so the last episode would end on "that". 
>> ARTICLE
That's because Eren being trapped under the rubble was an anime-only scene. Manga came before the anime.
>> ARTICLE
90% filler episode  
awesome filler
>> ARTICLE
I like how they showed all the muscle forming around Annie and the skin covering said muscle. Much cooler than seeing Eren disappear in a cloud of smoke/steam and Rogue Titan emerging.

Damn Mikasa makes some freakish faces. Dat face she made while asking Eren if he still had reservations about fighting Annie was pretty crazy.

And another intense episode. So sad the anime is almost over.
>> ARTICLE
I hope the Eren will have a little more self control in the rematch. He's so disadvantaged because he just goes into a raging, mad explosion of anger, compared to Annie, who's so goddamn calm.

Also, Annie didn't kill Mikasa when she had the opportunity, when she fell down. I really don't understand her character, or her motives.

the animation of the 3D maneuver gear fight scenes is so much better in this episode in my opinion. A whole lotta craazy from mikasa

ERMAHGERD THERES A TITAN IN THE CITY WHAT THE FUCK.

Alright, Im sure the army has *some* kind of backup plan here. And last episode managed the excellent trick of being an extremely entertaining twenty minutes *without* spending absurd amounts of animation budget. So Im quite excited to see where they go with this - frankly, the fact that the army went so completely all-in on their Annie hypothesis (putting the words of Erwin and Armin into action) is by itself quite exciting, and demonstrates the overall military apparatus being both more intelligent and more decisive than weve seen previously. Does this mean we get more Pixis? Possibly a spirited brofist between Pixis and Erwin? A boy can dream.

10:29 - [This is really nice.](http://i.imgur.com/stJVDqx.jpg) Erens the same dumb shounen protagonist hes always been, but Armin is learning - the ploy in the forest has taught him that victory requires discarding sentimentality to truly see all available options, and the show is immediately putting that character growth into practice. Excellent work

10:34 - [Great argument. I can see why the fans like you](http://i.imgur.com/JDmTrgI.jpg)

11:22 - [Theyre also bouncing nicely between the flashback and current situation](http://i.imgur.com/8EyQvT2.jpg).

11:57 - [*This* is *fantastic.*](http://i.imgur.com/QeGVSr0.jpg) Yeah, Erens too sentimental to be a real soldier yet - so *use* that. Play off his even *more* pronounced attachment to you two to give him a clear goal. A rational manipulation of his best friend for the sake of the mission - Armin is *really* coming into his own as a character

**And Done**

Another great one! The first half of that episode was a little frustrating, since Erens development is always so protracted, but it was really satisfying to see Armins growth put into action. And that second half! Man! Didnt think they had that much budget left in them. Very satisfying action, and complemented by little star turns from virtually the entire central cast. Titan is certainly finishing strong.

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
This series deeply frustrates me. Mostly because it is so, SOOOO dam good, beautiful visuals, music, great voice acting, cool setting, amazing action scenes (Especially from this episode, seeing more awesome 3D Manuvering gear moves.. and no Levi Supersonic Spins thankfully) -- It just grinds my gears that it drags and drags, pointlessly so. 

That whole struggle Eren was going through was complete BS. It served no purpose but to drag things out even further. You knew, from last weeks episode, that this, was going to come down to a brawl between Annie and Eren, this time no holds bar, no hesitation. Yet while we did get some awesome action from Mikasa n' Friends chasing down Annie, it was still frustrating watching Eren be a little bitch the entire episode. 

His whole prior drama was that he made the wrong choice, that because he refused to act, a massive amount of people, including his new friends, all pointlessly died. I get it, he was struggling to accept that Annie was the Female Titan, but no one else was having issues accepting this or taking action, why? Because shes murdered countless amounts of their friends all in the pursuit of Eren. Eren knows this and has seen this, so why did it take him so long to flip the anger switch in his brain? It made no sense because by doing nothing, he was once again just letting Annie kill more people, this time potentially Armin and Mikasa. Eren knows that hes basically the only one who can really bring Annie down. 

So.. that frustrating little Rant aside. Of course it was a /fantastic/ episode as usual. AoT never ceases to prove that its the best anime of this year, despite some of its flaws. 
>> ARTICLE
If the main character always acts as he should, we would't even see the others fight.

That applies to almost evey anime and movie out there.
>> ARTICLE
erens transformation was filler because in the manga he transforms after mikasa tells him "its a cruel yet beautiful world" to which he replies "it sure is" bam titan eren smacks annie in the face!!
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Much of what happened in this episode was filler content. Eren didn't hesitate for very long to transform in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
they are definitely going to end the season on the last pg of chapter 33 which is why their has been so much character based filler recently 
isayama mentioned on his blog that the jean levi and erwin scene was supposed to be in the manga but he cut it out so they added it to the anime 
in the manga eren comes to the realization that one or both of the most important people in his life atm will die if he doesnt go titan yet the anime turns his motivation into genocide wtf?
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure I'm not the only who sort of despised Eren in this episode. While soliders are dying left and right, he refuses to believe that attacking Annie is the right choice. CLEARLY she wasn't the cause of the massive loss of forces in the expedition, and CLEARLY she didn't kill Gunter, Erd, or....Or Petra. Poor, poor Petra.

DAMMIT EREN GET YOUR SHIT STRAIGHT. It only took you a whole damn episode...

EDIT: DAT MIKASA ACTION THOUGH. Besides Eren, everyone else was totally badass in this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
He could't wrap his mind that his friend is a Titan who has no qualms killing hundreds of people. Can't transform because you are fighting someone you were suppose to protect. He realizes that human Annie is still a Titan. He vowed to destroy all Titans as revenge for his mother/friends/soldiers that were killed. Unleashes rage, finds out humans are Titans, kills all of humanity. 

>> ARTICLE
i agree.

he tried to find a reason desperately to excuse Annie's behavior. the only way he summoned the will to fight was go mad with rage because everything else failed.

Eren's a very good character since he doesn't simply do things as people sway him to, regardless how well intentioned.
>> ARTICLE
>he refuses to believe that attacking Annie is the right choice

It's not that he refuses. He's just conflicted that a friend he's known for 3 years is the enemy.

Heck, Eren had one argument with Mikasa in the 1st arc and he instantly tried to kill her upon transforming rather than lifting the boulder.
>> ARTICLE
It's not like we even know exactly what's going on with Eren. Everyone assumes the subtitles correctly portray his mindset, and that all the assumptions presented about transformation are correct.
>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair Eren was not controlling the Titan during that scene.

Alot of Filler. But I like it.

Loved the scene when Mikasa was discussing about Annie when they were in the tunnel. Mikasa knew Eren had 'other feelings'. What is amazing was the fear depicted in Mikasa's eyes.


>> ARTICLE
>The fury that once made him make that vow on that fateful day now  spurs him on to destroy the world.  *cue end of the episode*

I now fully understand why everyone hates cliffhangers
>> ARTICLE
At first this anime started off as something pretty good but nothing special but, now its just so good. I love that it has consistent themes that don't need to be said all the time but rather picked up through the character's actions.

My favorite part so far has to be when Armin says, "To defeat monsters you have to be willing to throw your humanity aside." That speaks volumes. Annie is willing to do it. You can tell by her reactions in the previous episodes by the way she talks and reacts to people that she isn't inherently bad. But just like Armin says this episode, whatever reasons she has causes her to let go of her humanity.

You can also see that in Eren at the end. Listen to his voice; he goes from his normal voice to a more aggressive and sadistic. Read and feel the emotion of his words and the images he remembers. He starts off helpless then starts to remember what Annie has done, and finally snaps when he remembers his mothers death. He sets aside his own humanity at that point. "I'll wipe you out" "I'll kill you" "Don't try to keep your hands clean" "That's right the world is cruel". All this is being said while Annie is being shown. In these moments Eren has never looked so much like his titan form before.  Unless my prediction is wrong, Annie is so fucked next episode. 

>> ARTICLE
Kept thinking Eren needed to stop being such a pussy when he was crushed by the rubble...until I noticed he was impaled too. Damn, final episode is gonna be cray.
>> ARTICLE
Damn Eren, dont think you could rage face any harder. Also dem 3dmg scenes. delicious. And Mikasa putting her crazy face on

How the FUCK do they manage to make every episode a cliffhanger!

All these people complaining about Eren not transforming immediatly...

I'm more irritated at nobody checking that he was resolute in his conviction towards detaining Annie before they started the mission.

Nice one Survey Corps, lets not check to see if our main weapon will actually work. I mean, they could have at least asked, instead of suddenly finding out mid battle. They all know his transformation criteria.

Still a good episode though.

I'm going to come out and say it. This show has the best soundtrack that I have ever heard of any anime/film/video game. It's truly magnificent.

I love how psychotic some of the characters are getting in this fight. And also how Jean and Levi have a bro moment.

Also maneuver gear seriously needs to become a thing somehow. It must happen.
>> ARTICLE
Having the feeling that titan transformation not only requires a goal and a wound but also metal or some other mineral in order to ground the lightning. At least it would explain the significance of the cannonball, the spoon and Annie's ring, alluring at some kind of focus item. 


Also wondering if the hunger of the mindless titans is explained by assuming them to be "flawed" and incomplete versions of the titans that are spawned with a human host, their inferior gestalt hinting at being caught in a state of incompleteness, when compared to the intelligent titans. So their hunger could represent an instinct that longs for a host in order to become sentient, they only way they feel they can achieve this is by devouring humans. Them eating or hurting humans might also be connected to the infliction of a wound which seems to be necessary in order to spawn a titan. Them being drawn to humans might underline a strong connection between human and titan.

Raises the question why they exist. 


Assuming that the intelligent titans are closer to their original true purpose, they seem to be manifestations that allow their hosts an empowered state, manifestations vary in their abilities however the state doesn't seem to be supposed to manifest for long times, as it was indicated that there is a potential danger to lose yourself into the process and to fully fusion with the titan, not considering that the state seems to tire their human hosts in order to keep sentience, indication that there's a training effect which ultimately might make them useful to a society.



I wouldn't be surprised if titans were common even farther back than 107 years ago, seeing how these walls had to be built in a relatively short time by mankind itself, I doubt they would have been able to do that (seeing how they struggled to get artillery mounted up there), without having had some help of intelligent titans, seeing humanity's current state there must have been a fallout and over the century the detailed circumstances of this fallout might have faded away and titan became just titan, while the knowledge got lost.


I speculate there must have been a failed experiment somewhere down the road, that resulted in massive amounts of titans being spawned without a host who then turned against humans, in their desire to fuse with a human host. A motive could be that titans not requiring a human host make good pawns to be fielded into a conflict of power.


Maybe that lost society had intelligent titans at its disposal but they might have been very limited in amount, maybe a shortage of capable human hosts that were able to spawn them - building the corner stone of the might of a state of power, that as usual someone tried to overthrow and messed up in the process.

This episode was just so beautiful. Regardless of the andrenaline from the story itself, it's art was top class (Mikasa/eren's discussion about annie, the scientist, Jean and Armin, the trapeze). The music was beyond extraordinary, and everything just felt so perfect. 

Where can I get the OST?

As always, the music was fucking amazing! This scene has so much more impact than it did from the manga. Not saying the one from the manga sucked, though. 
>> ARTICLE
To anyone else who has read the manga. Did they also use the scene with the multiple hooks in the manga? 

I don't remember seeing that in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it wasn't there, the point where mikasa says the "world is a cruel place" is where he transforms in the manga. so everything inbetween is anime only
>> ARTICLE
So, anybody else think that Mikasa has also had a similar thing done to her by Eren's father? Like, there's something underneath her skin. When Eren first got captured in the forest and she was battling Annie, she starts steaming from her eyes. Maybe we haven't seen all Mikasa has to offer yet.

Nah, the steam was Annie's

you are going to be so pissed with where the anime ends next week cause its a massive wtf? cliffhanger!! haha

Right after Eren transformed there was a quick scene of a cat relaxing on a staircase next to a pool of blood.

In this episode, Armin said that in order to turn into a titan, you must "let go of your humanity." We also saw that Annie did the Kira laugh and then transformed. Also, every time Eren transformed he was in a blind rage. 

So maybe the cat symbolizes a primitive beast (titan) and it being next to the pool of blood emphasizes that it is not civil at all.

Annie seems to react very harshly when she hears eating or devouring. When Eren was going nuts back in the forest, he said "I will rip you apart then eat you!". Right after that, Annie quickly acted and pushed him back even though she didn't hear him. In this episode, Hanji said to Annie "this time I will be the one devouring". Annie then reacted by escaping from their trap.

I don't mean to be rude, but this is the anime-only thread. I'm not saying "GO AWAY, YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE," but... don't tease us with "oh just wait 'til you see what happens *next week*!" Please don't influence our expectations.

Fair enough, but it was meant towards the overall rest of the story in general and not just the end of the season

Wow, they, uh. Seriously ruined a lot of things for me this episode, and the last episode. Eren doing a complete character 180 for no discernible reason, Araki's seeming utter inability to even conceive of the enemy as being slightly sympathetic, his inability to even reach elementary levels of competency regarding character interactions...ugh. The anime just really, really seems to want to sell Eren/Mikasa over anything Eren and Annie have and really, really wants to villainize Annie. Just to make things simpler. 
>> ARTICLE
|Araki's seeming utter inability to even conceive of the enemy as being slightly sympathetic, his inability to even reach elementary levels of competency regarding character interactions...ugh

I have no idea what you're talking about. You're the only one interpreting things like that. If you scroll through this comment wall, you can clearly see many people second-guessing Annie's evilness.
>> ARTICLE
Well, good for them. Perhaps I went too far, but I certainly feel as if that's the angle he's trying to sell, at least.
>> ARTICLE
anime only watcher here: i like Annie. 

in spite of that i'm fully aware at this time that everyone wants to carve and torture her EXCEPT for Eren and Armin - and maybe Mikasa but she doesn't *really* give a shit as long as Eren's fine, if he asked her to calm down she would.

Armin mentioned in his peptalk that Annie might have her reasons plus she's shown to be highly intelligent compared to everyone else. i'd be surprised if they'd even manage to capture her.. and i'm hoping Eren will and take her away for some civilized talk.

she never had a chance to speak to him after he was known to be a titan with all the crazy things happening.

on another note.. was probably the first time anyone spoke about/made Eren think about [Eren's feelings](http://i.imgur.com/I7Ostyl.jpg). i mean.. he did admire her skill back in training camp but i doubt he'd fall in love only on that. as much as i love Mikasa i don't see any legitimate shipping going on right now.
>> ARTICLE
Then that's really awesome! She's my favorite character, and I love it when people like her. It's just that they really do hard to make her difficult to like, I think. 

There isn't any legitimate shipping going on at all (that's been shown yet) but the anime does make some directing choices-- for example, zooming in on Mikasa's face when Eren is having trouble transforming-- taking a scene that's really supposed to be all about Eren and his reaction to Annie being a titan and making it almost seem like a healousy thing? when that's not really what it's about, to Mikasa she doesn't care if Eren has feelings for Annie, as long as they *don't get in the way of Eren fighting her*. But it seemed like they were trying to sell it as Mikasa being crazy/jealous, and the anime in general tries to sell the Mikasa/Eren relationship (Mikasa holding Eren's when she separates him in Jean back in episode 3, Mikasa gripping Eren's hand during the end of episode 22, although Eren noticeably doesn't hold her hand back, it seems). 

We'll see more of Annie, though, I'm sure. Next episode's gonna be a doozy no matter what.

Jean was jelly in training camp of Misaka's attention for Eren, Misaka's confused about her [feelings](http://i.imgur.com/5OHYpmK.jpg) [toward Eren](http://i.imgur.com/iPLO7bQ.jpg).. though definitely has a [strong protective instinct](http://oi42.tinypic.com/w1smzn.jpg), Eren's been kind of [an ass](http://i.imgur.com/uJJMyz4.jpg).. i don't know if i can call his attitude stoic but he did have moments where he was concerned for Misaka and genuine buddy to [Armin](http://i.imgur.com/1tF3YJo.jpg) who has his moments of mutual respect with Annie.

Eren pisses me off.  He's such a cliche bitchy main character.  Every other character shed their bitchy phase.  Mikasa and Armin are on another level right now.
>> ARTICLE
As someone pointed out above, he's not supposed to be that bitchy, that was just filler.
>> ARTICLE
I started reading this manga the other day and made it to chapter 5. Then, I got bored of it. Should I keep reading it?

Not if you're expecting to learn anything new. There are some surprises but they haven't revealed anything earth shattering yet.

Well I mean should I keep reading the story? I haven't seen the show.

Oh sorry!  I misunderstood.  Yeah keep reading it gets better.

Ok thanks!

After all the shit all these people have gone though it's pretty clear why they're all so worked up this episode. Everyone just wants this to be over, but Eren keeps dragging it out with his damn melodrama.  cite Mikasa in the tunnels.

Is it me or was the budget for this episode lower?

I'm expecting they had to shuffle budget for this week to next week :P

I personally enjoy the filler, considering a lot of it is action :) I think it's just frustrating cause we got to wait a week....but if we were watching them in a row it would be fine.

Well, 25's gonna air in theaters, so we've known for a pretty long time that they would save the actiony scenes for next week.
Not that I mind any amount of filler if it's about Jean though.

So is it going to be longer than usual since it's airing in theaters, or still twenty minutes?

Petra :(

I'm glad those annoying ass side characters are dead.

EREN DONT YOU BELIEVE US? WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU ONE BIT BUT DO YOU BELIEVE US?????

Then proceed to not believe in Eren and got themselves killed.
>> ARTICLE
Eh. To be fair they could have just said that to guilt-trip Eren into not fighting so he could GTFO of there.
>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair he did not won too.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, they really weren't wrong in their decision to prevent Eren from fighting at all costs, even if it ultimately cost them their lives. The Survey Corps is acutely aware that humanity **will** lose the war against the Titans if the calculus of power does not undergo a dramatic shift. They simply lose too many soldiers per enemy slain, and they can't replace them fast enough. I mean, what, they're accepting recruits as young as twelve. They must be desperate. Eren is a game-changer, and if they lose him, they will be almost entirely out of options.  

It sucks that Eren had to watch everyone die, but the only reason that he even has a chance of being recovered right now is probably because the other soldiers sacrificed their lives. The Female Titan was severely injured and had already expended a great deal of energy in prior conflicts....and Eren*still* lost. He almost certainly would have been overpowered immediately if he'd gone against her when she was at full strength and there might not have been any chance of recovering him. 

Tl;dr. "Believing" in Eren would probably still have gotten everyone killed, because--face it--the boy has determination, but he still lacks maturity and skill and it's gotten him killed at least once. 
>> ARTICLE
Not saying it wasn't the right thing to do. Just saying that as a viewer, those side characters got old real quick and got really annoying to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Well in their defense Eren also got his ass handed to hin as well. At least that had a solid plan and formation, while Eren just went Berserk.
>> ARTICLE
Could have been 1v5 but nope. Gotta do that character development and tension build up :/
>> ARTICLE
You can tell just how mad Eren is about the situation though, like they say, you can't know whats going to happen but he's weighing the current situation against the idea that he as a titan could have fought her with Levi and the other four and that *would* have been so much better. 
>> ARTICLE
eren got his ass beaten by a female titan who was unable to use her arms 
lost an eye and slashed repeatedly 

>> ARTICLE
Stupid, stupid Eren, only know going crazy on tittans and then waste time thinking about stupid things instead of kick her ass quick before she heals... mehh
>> ARTICLE
Fuck you! Petra was the best character!

Is anyone else kinda put off that the only member of Levi's squad that anyone cared about was Petra?

Petra girl. Penis like.
>> ARTICLE
I care more about Hanji

have people read the manga here?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the others were cool, like the tongue biting guy. I just never remember their names. It also might be because Petra is much more prominent compared to the others. 

Petra was my favorite character in the series though. The only one who comes close is Sasha though.

Season 4 is gonna be a hell of a roller coaster.
>> ARTICLE
While it's sad that the four of them got wrecked. I do love how this show doesn't pull any punches when it comes to killing off characters. Gives you the feeling that anyone could bite the dust any time.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as Eren decided to let them fight without him I knew that they were going to die. Well, I knew that at least one would die and was pretty sure that if nothing else Petra would still live.
>> ARTICLE
That, and with the side speech being given by the commander, you knew some bad things were about to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Well, except for Eren, Mikasa, and Armin.

Other people have been killed off so quickly it's more of a surprise if a new character *doesn't* die. 
>> ARTICLE
Technically we did think that Eren died in the beginning when he got eaten  by the titan that almost killed Armin.
>> ARTICLE
Even with the main cast, I still get the feeling that they could still die. As much as that would anger a lot of the fans of the show. But that is just one of the many things I love about this show.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'm still not convinced the big three are all that expendible. They seem to have a lot of story left. The rest though? Borrowed time.

Potato girl, you can have anyone else, hell take two Armins but leave her out of it.

Giants are attacking my town

And here I am, eating my potato

Peope are being killed right now

But baked potatos are good when they're warm.


For those monsters people are just food,

In the same way potato is food for me

Why wouldn't titans stop eating people

And start eating potatoes?

My combat gear lies beside me

Ready to fly me wherever I want

Potato fields are vast and well guarded

You can't navigate there without some technical advantage.

Scout corps are the best of the best

They are the humanity's only hope

If not for them, titans would surely win

And take all of our potatos, as well as kill everyone of course.

On the other hand, the female titan was set up to get fucked twice before.

Yeah, it's pretty clear at this point that she's both exceptionally powerful and extremely competent.

I dreaded the day this episode would come out because then I'd have to watch the animated version of the 3 squad members die.  But Jesus, they did not go out without style.  The fight was just beautifully animated, all three of the fights actually.  In the beginning I remember people talking about this being a regular Shounen, and it kind of still is but it definitely isn't like the others.  Can't wait till next week.  Trust me it just keeps on getting better.
>> ARTICLE
The squad death in the anime was more jarring than the squad death in the manga. It must be something about the music and voices, maybe the blood too. Even though I knew what was coming, I was like, "KILL HER!" The animation was just gorgeous too.

On the Shounen note, I'm usually not into this kind of stuff (read: I love Shoujo), but the story is really gripping and the fight scenes come off as skillful and artistic rather than chaotic as a result of being too action-packed. edit: and I'm not just hanging on for some Mikasa/Eren romance action...although I wouldn't complain if we finally got some.
>> ARTICLE
Just seeing Petra's body bent a little back from the tree and blood everywhere gave me chills.  There is just something about seeing something animated that makes it so much more, I can't explain it.  Don't even get me started on the OST's, those things are fucking gorgeous.  I don't personally consider this a Shounen because it isn't just powering up and saving the day repeatedly.  It has twists and turns and so much more of a darker setting.  It just keeps getting darker and darker.  Usually I can expect most turnouts in Shounen but I am so lost and I love it.

"There's no way he/she can turn back into a titan so fast." -*Wrong*

 This is the Game of Thrones of the animes.

 Btw why does Eren just stops on [this](http://i.imgur.com/n5PgFrH.jpg) scene ? Did the female titan do something special or was he just tired? 

 On a side note it's more clear each episode that the only one that could be inside that titan [is](/s "Annie").
>> ARTICLE
she showed him something so unexpected, he had to stop and think "..........what?". my guess is she showed him a vagina.

This would be unexpected. The first known titan to have genitalia.

>This is the Game of Thrones of the animes.

Oh child...
>> ARTICLE
It's at that moment that Eren realizes who the female titan is.
>> ARTICLE
You'll find out soon...
>> ARTICLE
I think she did a roundhouse kick so fast eren didnt see it. her stance seems like she did when it shows the tree falling.
>> ARTICLE
I believe, that she used her hardening ability to cut through Eren's hand, face and the tree, as with her stance it is probably because after swinging her hand she is off balance.
Also with her fighting style it definitely [makes it clear](/s "that annie") is the female titan

He recognizes who the titan is after fighting her. I'll leave at that cause the juicy details will come soon.

Non-manga reader here. I think it's really really obvious in the anime too (though that may be partly because of the opening and knowing my tropes), but apparently some people don't think so.
>> ARTICLE
The female titan is getting a lot more face time and more detailed close-ups in the anime, so that's a part of it.  The drawing style in the manga is really sketchy, so it's easier to miss clues.
>> ARTICLE

They didn't show it because this happened after the fact. The scene you linked from the manga is a flashback.
>> ARTICLE
That's so easy to figure out simply by just looking at the Titan.  At first I thought it was Mikasa run amok and she had gotten the same treatment from Eren's father as he did.  I'm still wondering if she has some Titan in her.
>> ARTICLE
I KNEW IT, i just couldn't think of her name. Its Fucking her, i knew two episodes ago!!!
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to really hope that it's not, just to mess with everyone by going "You know how we've been making it pretty obvious who this is?  Well screw you guys, it's actually this guy, Greg, who you've never met. He's actually [suspected person]'s father, which explains why you might think is was them.  And sorry, did we forget to mention that humans don't always take the same gender when they transform?".

He noticed [slight spoiler](/s "the female titan's stance from episode 4")

eggxactly

I haven't read the manga but I'm guessing it's because he realizes that the female titan has the [](/s "same stance as Annie. I mean it's been obvious since the beginning, they look extremely similar.")

There's no way Eren's mother will get eaten by a Titan again.

You know an episode is good when you open your eyes so wide that both your contacts fall out, seriously, both of them.

Wow I was not aware that could even happen. This anime is serious business.

They need put that on the box.

"WARNING: Hold your contacts!"
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, Mikasa really is on a totally different level. Can't wait for next week to see her team up with Levi.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, what if Mikasa had been a part of Levi's squad from the beginning of the mission, and she was involved with the fight between the Female Titan and the 3 squad members? I think she could have tipped the scales in that battle (much like Eren realized he could have if he had transformed sooner).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it would have worked out so well. The reason the three were doing well at first is because they have been together for a long time and have experience working as a team. Mikasa would have probably thrown that balance off. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, her coordination with the other squad members would likely be way off. 
>> ARTICLE
Shes too much like levi, they both seem to do things alone.

I can see it now.

"EREN ARE YOU OKAY"

"EREN RUN...I MEAN FLY"

"WTF ARE YOU GUYS DOING COVER EREN"

I started to think I could trust in maybe a few characters I like staying alive.

Why do you do this to me AoT? 
>> ARTICLE
The only characters that will stay alive are probably Erin, Levi, Sasha, Mikasa, and Armin.
>> ARTICLE
I would say just Mikasa and Levi in the end. I can see Eren dying eventually because the show keeps hinting at it. And Armin's weak so I can see him going out like a light once he discovers the entire titan plan and his purpose as the genius is used up.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing armin won't die unless he's telling this story from the grave. 
>> ARTICLE
It could go like this: 

Armin - Oh my god the titans are blankity blank and they're after blank.

Mikasa - It can't be

*Colossal Titan steps on Armin*

I basically meant that once Armin figures out the titans secrets and tells someone about it his use in the show will have run out besides being a berserk button for Eren and Mikasa.
>> ARTICLE
Considering he is a master strategist I can see him replacing Irvin somewhere down the line. Right now he is still not cold enough to make tough decisions and send people to their graves, but he is completely different from what he was in the first few episodes. He might become ruthless and strong by the end of and anime, would be a cool bit of character development.
>> ARTICLE
I think Armin wil survive it all. The whole point of him as a character is to show that fighting isn't all about strenght. Would be pointless if he just dies before he sees the end.
>> ARTICLE

3 minutes of recap was a bit off-putting, but holy shit that episode was intense.  Especially since Mikasa flipped shit.

If I was watching this on normal broadcast TV, I'd probably be pissed.  Recap + OP + title card + commercials is 5-7 minutes down the toilet before we finally get to new stuff.

But watching this show downloaded?  I don't even care.  It's all just immediately skipable and none of my time is wasted.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of Japanese viewers also download raws or use online streaming sites. Even if you wanted to watch it on TV, anime timeslots are terrible.
>> ARTICLE
3 min recap, 18 minutes of episode.

I ain't even mad.
>> ARTICLE
i definitely never want to get on Mikasa's bad side  
>> ARTICLE
They ate my Eren. I ate their species.
>> ARTICLE
I think you mean they ate him again
>> ARTICLE
would be hilarious if eren just keeps getting saved then eaten again later and it keeps repeating.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't get saved last time though, he just fucked up everything around him, even when he was an armless titan he still didn't require assistance.

Now that you mentioned it...

Reminds me of the whole Mario-Peach thing. So does that make Eren a princess?

Thank you Mikasa! But our Eren is in another titan!

I'm curious. Do you know how much farther the manga is compared to the anime? I can't wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
This episode ends around chapter 29, the manga is currently at 48.
>> ARTICLE
Trost is 1 Arc.

Female Titan is 1 Arc.

Next Arc is Utgard (Won't be animated this season)

Current Arc is halfway done I'd say. Once it finishes, they should have enough material for a 2nd season
>> ARTICLE
The current one seems like a big arc though, unless they go the not-giving-away-answers way.
>> ARTICLE
This one covered chapter 29 I think and there's 48 in total.
>> ARTICLE
That was. Without a doubt. The best episode so far. HOLY FUCK.

I remember last episode recap thread, someone said they wouldn't be able to take it if Petra died. I'm sorry, friend. That surprised the fuck out of me.

The three squadmates killing the female titan was *so awesome* I had trouble containing myself. The entire time I was thinking how cool what I was watching is. I was excited, but mostly gripped with fear that something terrible was about to happen. I mean, they were doing so well! Their coordination! That was amazing! The female titan was *afraid*! But... are good things allowed to even happen on this show?

I got my sad answer quickly afterwards.

And that wasn't even the end of the excitement! The pure **rage** that Eren felt, that fight sequence, Mikasa's own rage afterwards, and at the end Levi + Mikasa! Oh my god, things just keep getting better.

I really, REALLY hope that female titan doesn't survive/escape this whole ordeal.

Also:

1) Clearly, Eren's new top priority should be close combat training. He's got the rage and the strength. Just give him the technical skill and no one will stand a chance, especially once he starts developing his own unique powers (like hardening skin of the Female Titan).

2) I wonder who will be part of hte new Squad Levi?
>> ARTICLE
> That was. Without a doubt. The best episode so far. HOLY FUCK.

My thoughts exactly. This might be a bit dumb, but the reason why I haven't read the manga is because I feel anime is a medium that can convey more (voice acting, music, animation, etc.) I was blown away this episode and I can't wait until next week! The only downside is...we have to wait a week ;_;
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but his inexperience with controlling his titan body and his unstable mental state caused by losing his entire squad due his decision, made him lose control of himself for long enough for her to escape.
>> ARTICLE
The dude is an unexperienced kid. I'm surprised he has able to catch the female Titan off gaurd and make her scared. I'm also worried about Mikasa letting her emotions get the better of her. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't do much with full mount when your fists explode from hitting things.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was that he was too wrought with emotion to think clearly. In that position, he could've aimed for the neck, or pummeled the cheeks at an angle where his forearms are parallel with the ground at impact (like the Carlton dance, only instead of dancing, you're wrecking a face), or held the head in place with one hand, or possibly even twisted the head off. Oh how I cheered when he finally got that one punch in, though, sending her soaring into the air!
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty mad he kept going for head blows instead of attacking her torso...  He didn't even need his hands- *elbows, bitch*!

Or alternatively, he could have grabbed her with one hand to hold her still while attacking with the other.  I guess he's mostly going on instinct in Titan form, though.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the whole time while he was waiting for his hands to regenerate that he could just bite her head off easily there!Come on,he has a massive jaw and sharp teeth,he could easily destroy her neck!
>> ARTICLE
Thought he was gonna do an epic headbutt to her face. 
>> ARTICLE
He could've gone in with the elbows, or just bite her face off. 

However, in the interest of drama that's not the best thing to do. Much more exciting for Eren to get taken than to kill the female titan then and there. 
>> ARTICLE
How about not aim at the head an your fucking fists won't explode. Can't move their chest enough to dodge in that situation.
>> ARTICLE
Punch at her chin or throat instead of the for head and she can't just lean away.
>> ARTICLE
And you dont have any genitals
>> ARTICLE
He could have used less power in his punches, thus not explode his hands on misses. But the main issue is he didn't control the female titan at all. He should have used elbows and pinned her down before unleashing a heavy blow like that, or just elbow her in the face many times, because those aren't able to be dodged easily from full mount. 

But we can't have Eren fucking her up just yet, can we? ZZZZZ :(((

>> ARTICLE
for all the talk about erens close combat skill he hasnt learned one of the most important basic lessons their is a adage which goes something like this
"if a opponent shows you their fists you can challenge them however if your opponent shows you their palms RUNN!!" i think you can guess why that is 
>> ARTICLE
Instead of punching he could have started putting pressure on the neck and head, or gouged an eye, or grabbed her head in one hand to keep it in place. But he was mad and people fight shitty when their mad. 
>> ARTICLE
there are a number of chokes that only require position and weight.
>> ARTICLE
He needed more hooks and less jabs.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah aiming for the ground really isn't wise.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why he even waited for the hands to regen honestly, I feel like if it were me, I'd have just gone strait for her throat with my teeth.
>> ARTICLE
or with your now exposed bones.
>> ARTICLE
His open mouth was like a few feet from her face, he could have just started chowing her face off or something.
>> ARTICLE
Quite. I was deeply perplexed by the fact that he was sitting there waiting for his hands to regenerate, when he could have simply gone for the throat. He certainly had no problems doing so when it came to the Titan that killed Thomas. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...he really needs to work on NOT punching so hard that his fists explode. Although it's still pretty damn badass.
>> ARTICLE
he shoulda stared biting/elbowing/shoulder slamming, anything besides waiting on regen vs an opponent that's so much better at regen they can prioritize where they do it.
>> ARTICLE
If he knew how to focus his healing he could have gotten one hand back quick enough to perhaps at least rip out her eyes again and start again on the arms. But since Eren only knows how to berserker, that would never have happened.
>> ARTICLE
Or alternatively, stab her with the bones sticking out...
>> ARTICLE
But the bones are really weak in comparison to our bones, they'd just snap like twigs without the muscle around them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's what I learned from this episode more than anything else really, that the Female Titan is far more experienced and must have been either a Titan for a long time or had someone to train here.
>> ARTICLE
and that eren had a big advantage via pure brute strength compared to the female
>> ARTICLE
God fuckin damnit this episode was epic.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn female titan, not only do you manage to piss of Eren, but Mikasa and Levi too?

The hate train comin' for ya, and I'm all for it next episode
>> ARTICLE
CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKER
>> ARTICLE
I knew Erwin's monologue wouldn't bode well for the squad but jesus, that was brutal. RIP you brave bastards. 

Also, I have a feeling Eren was doing well in his fight (the female titan did not expect that) but then he got stuck in a tree. And whatever the hell that twitchy fit he had was. Damnit Eren.

So we have a pissed off Mikasa, a pissed off Levi, an extremely pissed off Eren and a severely fatigued female titan. Female titan's so dead. We just need Eren to burrow out of there like a goddamn chestbuster, to maximise deadness. 


>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the female Titan wasn't at the top of her game. She was probably pretty tired at that point. Also I don't think she was expecting the amount of raw power Eren has in Titan form.

It seems like to me the female Titan relies more on strategies and using the environment to her advantage rather than rely on strength alone. Though against humans she can rely a bit more on her strength simply because they're completely outmatched.
>> ARTICLE
I also think the Female Titan really cares about her own life.  More so than Eren does.  Playing defensive and waiting for an opening is more her style.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I think Eren's out for now.

For now yeah. But we've all seen what happens to titans that piss Eren off.

I hope it becomes more of an annoyance than anything.

Mikasa: Damn it!Eren was eaten by a titan again.

Armin: (sigh) I'll go get my swords.
>> ARTICLE
Armin: "Time to prepare another speech!"

Even Armin has cut more titans than Eren so far

good fucking work, man.

I swear Levi is the most badass character I ever saw in a series. This guy allways remains with the same fucking [facial expression](http://i.imgur.com/vXs3xQZ.jpg) but you still know, that he actually cares what just happened and is probably filled with more hatred than Eren. He still manages to stay calm as fuck and do the actually best he can.

And this Episode we [learned](http://i.imgur.com/ZaxTsKT.jpg) again from him. 

Cant remember the last time I saw such an intensive Episode from any anime.
>> ARTICLE
Whenever a badass anime character gets shadowy eyes like that, you know shit will go down.
>> ARTICLE
The way Eren fights.

Hajime no Kyojin
>> ARTICLE
I know. I was just thinking "use your damn legs" the entire time.
>> ARTICLE
Now there's the fight I was wishing for. 

Looks like Eren lost it for a while. Gonna eat all the titans!

Real sad that Gunther and the others are dead. I really liked them. RIP guys.

I'm wondering why Eren's eyes widened before Female Titan knocked his head off. Perhaps he figured out who she is?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah It seems he does find out who she is, but in the manga they show it much better
>> ARTICLE
This episode definitely strengthened my theory of who is in that Titan. Huge similarity to a particular previous episode (hand to hand combat). But there is something more that this episode made me think about. 

Hand to hand combat. Previously, they talked about how it's weird that they are trained in hand-to-hand combat at all, as they would never use it against the titans. But maybe the reason that they got trained in hand-to-hand combat is that they *expected* people to become titans. The government is hiding something. They are also probably responsible for turning *her* into a Titan. 

This definitely reminds me of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood in how [Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood spoiler](/s "there are authorities that really are good guys but then there are the even higher-up people that are actually the bad guys.")
>> ARTICLE
Your theory is pretty likely to be true. The higher ups in the government are probably using Titans as a means to control the people and give themselves more power.

They were so well done as characters, the first characters that I really tried to like before they got eaten, simply because I thought they were too good to get killed.... I was so wrong.

Well, they didn't get eaten...

You are correct sir.

[Got this from /a/.](http://i.imgur.com/rRwiSBm.jpg)

This scene was done very well in the manga.

[Devour ya](http://img.batoto.net/comics/2012/01/12/s/read4f0f338d3596f/img000012.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
Damn, where does Female Type get a comb big enough to get hair so perfect? Look at Eren compared to her. Sorta makes sense really, his hatred compared to her composure. She's very precise while he is in blind rage.
>> ARTICLE
Just so I'm clear on this, his face is spazzing out cause he's just THAT pissed?
>> ARTICLE
I think its because he just hasn't learned how to control his titan body properly and it acts out when he mentally freaks out. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's his 'titaness' that makes him flip out. You know, titans natural craving to eat and butcher people.
>> ARTICLE
I really think it's just Erin being completely psychotic towards titans. He's like that when he's human.
>> ARTICLE
Episode spoiler:

Loved the titan MMA match.

And how many times does Eren plan on getting eaten by titans?
>> ARTICLE
thats pretty much all the titan fights. mma awesomeness. 
>> ARTICLE
My heart wasn't ready for any of that.  
Also, did Erwin say that the colossal titan was a human? It almost makes sense, considering that he just happened to appear for the first time a few years back, does that mean the armored titan is a human as well?
>> ARTICLE
More than likely any Titan that seems to be intelligent to any level is a human.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that depends. As someone pointed out in the forest, one of the titans started trying to climb trees, implying that they're capable of learning. So all titans possess some form of intelligence. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the series in full detail. Right now you should know who the female titan is by the fight scene alone. The other titans will make sense as it continues. This series hints things pretty subtlety.

Episode gave me goose bumps. Fucking going into each week without knowing what's going to happen next is the only way to experience this show.

No next week previews and not a manga reader.

10/10 episode. Can't wait for next week's ep.

The preview for this episode literally gave off nothing.

>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasn't read the manga...

Is it me, or does Eren seem to have insane strength compared the female titan? (Not including her hardening ability thing) Eren seemed to be hitting way harder than she could. Maybe it was because she was tired from all the other stuff, but even so, it just seems that Erens' titan form has incredible strength (possibly due to his immense hate for the titans).


But fuck, what an awesome fight in that episode! I have been bitching to myself the last couple of episodes for him to just unleash hell on that female titan, but he kept going along with his squad. So glad he finally did it. Let's hope he does it more often! >_<
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I equate Eren in titan form to Trunks and Vegeta when they were ascended saiyans fighting Cell. Strong as fuck, but also incredibly slow.
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind she was not fully healed, she had one eye and both arms messed up. At the end of the fight when she fully regenerated she just destroyed Eren.
>> ARTICLE
That's testosterone for ya.
>> ARTICLE
... The female titan cut his head off AND A FRACKING TREE in one strike...

Maybe she was playing with or testing him a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand how that happened.
>> ARTICLE
She did a roundhouse kick with her sharp crystallized shin, cutting through him and the tree. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see, thanks. Was somehow too fast for me to even pick up on. Eren has gotta learn some of that crystalline hardening maneuver. 
>> ARTICLE
I think she was hesitating to kill him for whatever reason. It looked like she was always on defensive and isn't willing to make a move. But eventually, she couldn't take it any longer and decided to finish him off.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the fight she was either retreating or getting hit. She was about to run away but then turned around again, Eren freezed and looked at her and then got slashed. I think in the end something weird happened that isn't clear yet.
>> ARTICLE
She can crystalize her shin to make it sharp, making it easier to kick through things. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in terms of raw strength it definitely seems like Eren-Titan has more than the female Titan. I mean, when he went to punch her, he hit the ground so hard his hands broke. I'd imagine the different special Titans have different strengths, weaknesses and skills. 
>> ARTICLE
He also punched her so hard even with her blocking it she was sent flying through the air.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa is fucking pissed
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga. I knew what was coming. But holy mother of fuck, when the squad died, it hit me like a brick wall of feels. The way they portrayed Levi coming across their body's, one after another was done excellently, and hit me harder then when they died. The fight between Fem titan and Eren titan was good, but the head twitchy mental break down was a bit odd. And Mikasa, Oh Mikasa, will you ever get your precious Eren back?
>> ARTICLE
have you seen this? http://i.imgur.com/1kUv1G9.jpg
>> ARTICLE
This episode was intense. Much badassery all around.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad that I have not read the manga as all of my friends have done. I believe that just made this episode even more intense and crazy. 
>> ARTICLE
This is absolutely my most favourite episode, I was shaking throughout.
>> ARTICLE
Eren with full mount decides he's gonna kill her. Proceeds to go for the only part of her body that can still dodge an attack. Just punch her through the damn collarbone next time.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa is just a badass in general
>> ARTICLE
The entire Eren vs Female Titan bit was awesome. One of the best choreographed fights this series has had.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't long enough. That fight took up like 30 or something pages in the manga.....I was expecting more titan vs titan battle than what we got. I LOVED how fantastic a job the animators did in communicating Eren's sheer rage though. Even the female titan seemed to be scared.  
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, Fight scenes in printed media (or other, similar mediums) don't translate to a lot of time on screen. 30 pages honestly sounds about right to get that much content, and that's assuming that the manga choreographed EVERYTHING that happened on screen.
>> ARTICLE
If they made the battle any longer it'd be another 4 hour Frieza vs. Goku.
>> ARTICLE
FINALLY Mikasa gets to do something.

Please tell me Mikasa will be taking over as the main character again, even if only for a little while. She's so much more fun than Eren.
>> ARTICLE
As much as mikasa is a great character , she isn't main character worthy for a shounen because besides emotional growth in skills there isn't much for her to improve or gain. as for eran  , he's learning a lot about his titan form / his past with his father/ and soon *(i won't spoil anything)* he'll start to grow into a wiser young man.

Imo he's much more interesting atm.

>> ARTICLE
Really?  You don't see any ways in which Mikasa needs to grow?  The way she is now, she would burn down the house if Eren tripped on the stairs.

I'm looking forward to seeing if she becomes a real, autonomous human being at some point.

Unless you meant to say shes *does* need to grow emotionally, in which case I misread your statement.

Turn wiser into more angry and I agree.

I'm sure she knows whether he is alive or not, considering she was the one who ate him
>> ARTICLE
I started this show 3 weeks ago and bingedwatched the fuck out of this. For once I resisted my hardest not to follow up with the manga to a series only because I knew this particular anime could deliver.

I think it just paid off exponentially just now. That was amazing.

Although I do have a question for the manga readers of this series; what parts did you find was done better in the manga so far compared to the anime?
>> ARTICLE
I reckon your probably referring to this episode specifically, but theres only one thing that jumps out at me and it's about the order.  

In the manga it goes from sealing the hole in Wall Rose to the training arc. Then it jumps to the aftermath which makes [Spoiler for stuff thats already been aired](/s "Marco's death much more shocking")
>> ARTICLE
I think the pacing is a bit better in the manga as the anime can really drag on with the exposition.  The movements in the fast action are easier to follow in the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
My new desktop background is [this](http://imgur.com/NfvSKGN) after watching this epic episode.  I was freaking out the entire time as shit just kept going DOWN.  This 7 day wait is going to be terrible.
>> ARTICLE
Some thoughts:

"Don't have faith in your friends, or you'll kill everyone." Nice lesson...

Mikasa: "Eren got eaten! ...I think he'll live."

And I know this makes me a terrible person, but I couldn't help but wonder if Petra peed herself when she got smashed.
>> ARTICLE
I like how the recap at the beginning is pretty epic this episode, even if it is a recap.

Remember Eren's reaction at 19:07? [Slight Spoiler](/s "He was reacting to the Female Titan's stance. He was reminded of episode 4.")
>> ARTICLE
Noticed it immediately, reminded me of one of my favorite quotes:

> "It's that moment of dawning comprehension I **live** for."
-Hobbes
>> ARTICLE
Well that was great! 
>> ARTICLE
Best episode so far. God damn I love this anime.
>> ARTICLE
It has to be fucking ANNIE LEONHART, NO FUCKING DOUBT... that fighting stance and those move looked so familiar, I remembered exactly how ANNIE fought from Episode 4, I even lined up EP4 Annie vs Eren, and EP21 Eren vs Female Titan (Annie), it matches almost fucking 100%, there is no doubt in my mind that it isn't Annie, however, I sense that she is in no way working alone, someone else, someone close... and you know fucking what? I just realized this but in EP4, BOTH EREN and RIENER see ANNIE sneaking back in (apparently RIENER knows that she does it a lot without getting caught). She was also the one out of the six that SAW EREN transform, she also is the ONLY FUCKING ONE that isn't in the fucking Recon/Survey Corps. (JESUS FUCKING AIJSIJUJRWIHAHLULSHAISHIDDI) ALL EVIDENCE POINTS TO HER! AAAAHHHH! WHY THE FUCK CAN'T NEXT WEEKS EPISODE COME OUT NOW!!!  
>> ARTICLE
Oww.. My feels... Seriously this episode had so much happen, yet it was all so fast. Man I hope next weeks episode has something happy happen :(. [Episode spoiler:](/s "Eren hulking out was fucking epic as all fuck!")
>> ARTICLE
pretty well done imo. The Hammer happened a bit later in though. 
>> ARTICLE
I practically got shivers when it showed Eren inside the titan with that sadistic smirk. Also how in the world could anyone possibly stand a chance against the armored titan if the best of the best were all slaughtered by a human titan with seemingly no special qualities. 
>> ARTICLE
>no special qualities.

Ya know, other than crystallizing it's skin, making it impenetrable.
>> ARTICLE
and being able to call other titans... and being able to switch between human and titan quickly, easily, and in full mobility gear... and to prioritize healing....
>> ARTICLE
Just food for thought if you think everything would've went peachy if Eren decided to stay with the others to fight the Female titan.

1) Eren requires a relatively straightforward motive to turn into his full titan form.

2) When Eren was more calm and composed discussing what to do. Note how he was hesitant on transforming, that means he wasn't fully committed to plunge into a fight there and then. This was the same with last episode also.

3) If the rest of the squad Eren was with didn't trust him like they do with each other how would they have fought differently to how they did with Eren on full retreat?

Just for the people who were on the fence about when Eren made his decision.
>> ARTICLE
1.  He had a straight forward motive until they cast doubt on him. Even going so far as to guilt trip him.
1.  Mute due to 1

1.  Eren would be a major distraction, especially since she can't outright kill him. All he has to do is hold her or knock her down for them to strike. They can also back him up any time she gains advantage, they don't have to participate until it is advantageous. Even without trust they were very skilled.

>> ARTICLE
I reckon on any other day the squad would be able to win the encounter against Female. With Gunther in the formation their attacks would be more lethal and would chop off her neck before she even has time to regenerate... Not to mention the ability to retreat when things seems off instead of being blinded by rage and has that white line fever.
>> ARTICLE
I blazed through all the episodes and I've learned two things:

If at any time some form of hope, optimism, or joy builds up, it'll be [swatted down](http://i.minus.com/iC5EUFP6aS1sK.gif) [in an instant](http://i.minus.com/i4BvffMo4EQsO.gif). And anything Armin says or thinks is correct. Guaranteed.
>> ARTICLE
Levi + Mikasa? Unstoppable.

Definitely my favorite episode so far.
>> ARTICLE
Stunning episode. In particular, Petra's dying position was really disturbing. I think it's gonna haunt me for a while.

I know everyone here agrees about how badass Mikasa is, but between all that badassery, she seems to be a bit, how should I put it... psycho. maybe Yandere even. The way she talks almost feels like she's refers to Eren as a possession, rather than friend/family. "No matter where she goes, I'll kill her, rip her apart, and get you out of that filth." I've never heard a Nakama say something so creepy. The way she says "sono onna" almost as if the female titan is a competing female bitch or something. Throughout her chasing the Titan, she's got that dead look in her eyes.

She says that they're "family". She may even admit that she likes him. But I think that's a mask to deeper, more fundamental motive.

When I think about it, Eren maniacally rants about exterminating Titans, and while I'm sure he'd love to do that, looking back at episode 5 (I think), right before he saves Armin and gets eaten, the driving force for his will to live is not "kill all the titans", it's "I want to see the outside world".

I think what they both say publicly, and what they might even believe is their life's purpose, is very different from what they want deep in their heart.

Eren, to see the outside world. Mikasa, I fear, may have much darker motives behind her affections toward Eren.

The angel in me hopes I'm just reading into things too much. The devil in me relishes the thought of seeing Mikasa give herself to darker desires.
>> ARTICLE
mikasa is like batman if he had someone save him from joe chills
remember both of her parents are   murdered right in front of her eyes
 and then she is saved by eren from a life of being sold into  sex slavery
  "if you fight you live if you lose you die"!

I wanted Eren to land at least one good shot to her face. He only got the one body shot in.

God damn was that an intense episode.
>> ARTICLE
I had goose bumps all over my skin. I was shaking a bit. That episode was so intense. I have no words to describe how good it was...
>> ARTICLE
That was beautiful that's all I got to say.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking everything was going to be fine when Eren decided to trust his friends. It's an anime, trusting your friends always works I naively thought. Cue blue colored flashback about never knowing if it'll turn out fine. Cue sad music. Cue my tears ;.; Like others have said, this anime reminds me of GoT, what with most characters being expendable. The fight scene was beautiful. Last EP people were complaining about the still shots. Now they see where the extra money went to, and rightfully so. Some other people have mentioned of AoT's (GoT, AoT, they're literally one letter off) subtle hints to future events. Levi's speech, [fem titan spoiler!](/s "Annie's fighting stance in EP 4"), etc. To any manga readers, has there been any other hints in past EPs that haven't happened yet other than the fem titan's identity?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty obvious that Eren is alive, I reckon the female Titan ate him to take him to her rendezvous as a way of carrying him, that's what I'm guessing

EDIT: please don't reply with any spoilers, *please* 
>> ARTICLE
Sasha dies I riot...
>> ARTICLE
Best episode in the series. This is why I love anime. How the episode came together, the story, the music, the emotion. Everything was perfect. The way they led me to like the new characters in Levi's squad and then just suddenly kills them off.. and then you can feel Eren's emotion when he transforms to avenge them. This episode was the definition of emotional roller coaster, done in the best possible way. 

I am glad I didn't read the manga. My buddies read the manga and they thought the episode was just "good".
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode really captured what the series is all about: emotion. Eren is constantly fueled by revenge, Mikasa is only ever emotional when it involves Eren, etc. It even seems now that the most stoic of characters (Levi) are beginning to show that they really are just human. Can't wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
Bit surprised that they didn't show the female titan's fighting stance when she sliced his head in half.

At this point he already knows who it is.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, time for episode 21, or as Ive surmised from reactions around the internet, The One They Spent All the Money On. Sweet! My body is extremely ready to see a lot of money turned into a lot of animation. *How will they handle the spy?!*

**Episode 21**

3:10 - ...and now, three minutes in, the recap finally concludes. Jeez, they *better* throw some money at the screen. Damn shounens...

5:38 - [I do so love it when the smart characters talk.](http://i.imgur.com/0jD6RfX.jpg) Its much easier to feel engaged in the conflict when I feel the protagonists are making intelligent choices for intelligent reasons, as opposed to losing because theyre just dumb as fuck

6:34 - [Interesting conclusion.](http://i.imgur.com/YBMibcB.jpg) Again, nice to see characters accept new information (the titans are intelligent, and its likely many of them are human) and immediately work out its implications 

8:01 - [Sweet](http://i.imgur.com/w8mtIFJ.jpg)

8:40 - [Really nice back-and-forth here.](http://i.imgur.com/FnV2aLb.jpg) Erwins calm conclusions directly playing off the decisions Erens making instinctually

8:58 - [This really isnt the time to be offended by his lack of faith in your friendship.](http://i.imgur.com/tyHr87C.jpg) Goddamnit, shounens

10:56 - [They *are* pretty badass.](http://i.imgur.com/QyoiwZX.jpg) This feels like the kind of scene this director was born for

11:47 - [Aw man, she was faking!](http://i.imgur.com/hCUPGI7.jpg) Oh that tricksy titan

12:16 - [Shit!](http://i.imgur.com/ZdDSqOW.jpg) I was starting to like these guys, too

13:08 - [They werent lying.](http://i.imgur.com/TnnRElu.jpg) This is quite the episode

14:21 - [Well, its not really the show I wanted, but I *guess* Ill accept giant titan wars](http://i.imgur.com/urBiH39.jpg)

15:16 - [This is not a nice episode](http://i.imgur.com/gzv2buq.jpg)

16:52 - [Kinda funny that this is taking back two full episodes of character development,](http://i.imgur.com/xNF5Yz1.jpg) but I actually like that Erens becoming more set in his incredibly wrongheaded ways. Even negative development is good development

17:46 - [Nice to see Eren in such a good mood](http://i.imgur.com/LYh2FR2.jpg)

19:30 - [Holy shit you guys.](http://i.imgur.com/9CLOtvs.jpg) That was that was definitely a fight. Damn

19:43 - [Dear lord](http://i.imgur.com/Krlbn8K.jpg)

20:05 - [Not buying it.](http://i.imgur.com/i6jrVnA.jpg) Sorry show, but you cashed in your ability to make me afraid for Erens life a dozen episodes ago

20:56 - [Berserker Mikasa is awesome](http://i.imgur.com/nOYCLph.jpg)

**And Done**

Man! What an exciting episode! Fast-paced, tons of extremely sharply animated setpieces, and yeah, thats pretty much all it needed. Pure, glorious action entertainment, complete with some pretty shocking losses for the good guys. Still cant believe they killed [my favorite character](http://i.imgur.com/lAlbHcL.jpg). Ah well, such is life. NOW GIVE ME MORE DEATH

Wow this episode was freaking epic, I got chills and my palms were sweaty through most of it. Next week needs to hurry up.
>> ARTICLE
When both of Eren's hands were broken and he roared in the Female Titans face!!! OMG!!! I came just a little.
>> ARTICLE
Eren should just use all his left over energy to transform AND BURST OUT OF DAT BITCH!
>> ARTICLE
Probably THE most elite titan-killing squad, just getting wiped out like it was nothing. These human-titans are on another level. Can't wait to see Mikasa and Levi fight together in the next episode, but it'll probably just be reconnaissance.
>> ARTICLE
Recap was meh, but the episode was a slaughterfest and overall seat gripping goodness. But Petra, my love.....
>> ARTICLE
This episode wasn't good for my heart. It was so tense that I almost stopped breathing!
>> ARTICLE
Shit, I cried. I didn't even tear up for any episode of Attack on Titan before this, but for this one...I cried.
>> ARTICLE
I can just feel the sadness that is coming off of Levi and he doesn't even need to show it
>> ARTICLE
I actually fucking cried...I can't fucking believe it but I did. I really fucking liked his squad god fucking dammit
>> ARTICLE
PETRA!! NOOOOOOO!!
>> ARTICLE
[Completely ridiculous speculation](/s "...Is Dot Pixis the Colossal Titan?")
>> ARTICLE
As awesome as everything is, it gets tiring to be able to predict that the humans will fail at mostly everything when against the titans. 

Eren couldn't even land a decent punch, him getting eaten again, entire squad dying more or less, didn't even get to find out who is in the titan ugh..... another week... 4 more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
What? Eren didn't do that bad. He sent her flying with an uppercut after she punched his jaw off! And he got her into a full mount, if it wasn't for his inexperience with controlling his titan body and unstable mental state at the time making him lose control, he would have been able to capitalize on his superior position and take her down. Obviously, the Female Titan has more experience fighting with and using her titan body.
>> ARTICLE
I know he did as best as he could but it would have been so much better to get one of his super punches to land. Each time he moved the female titan's eyes went wide thinking she would get injured in someway but nope. He did well in the beginning but after going mental just tapered off.
>> ARTICLE
I would have thought this episode sucked if it didn't have so much good to counter act the 3 minute recap, levi finding his squad dead (It just didn't feel as emotional as it did in the manga they were really lazy on his eyes until it got to petra) and that random end, really what the hell was with that? 

The fight was so good though and they did a perfect job at eren's rage.
>> ARTICLE
I think Levi is depicted as someone who knows what must be done and that there is no time to mourn his fallen comrades.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah idk how it was done in the manga but i thought the "lazy eyes" showed how he could be emotionless when he needed to be and it really worked well.
>> ARTICLE
That episode has been the most epic one yet in my opinion. Seeing Mikasa in action was just pure epic. The battles between the titans though, oh my.
>> ARTICLE
I can't get over how good this show is.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Watching Mikasa and Levi take on the female titan next week is going to be epic. A shame that there's only 4 episodes left until the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode yet. I love Mikasa and I'm happy she gets some screen time now, cant wat for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Epic episode was epic.

Feel bad for the Levi squad since they did end up becoming meat shields in the end.

Eren rocked the titan fight and got so damn good hits in, too bad it took too long and he got sliced. Wish they didn't pop back to see the dead bodies of the Levi squad so much, but meh. I'm pretty sure we all feels worse that petra had to die since shes the cute girl.

Female titan seems OP, doubt erens dead, seems that the whole objective was to retrieve Eren and disperse. Mikasa and Levi unite in next episode, hopefully they'll be able to coordinate their attacks in a well animated style.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait another week. What chapter does this correlate to in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
The moment eran went titan. the music. the animation and the way he moved. the feelings. GODDAMN they did such a good job , i got goosebumps.
>> ARTICLE
The was intense. Even though I already knew what was going to happen, Im still amazed.
>> ARTICLE
I swear, action-wise, the second half of this series is just impressing the hell out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Struggling to remember the last time an MC had so many death scenes, and dramatic, epic death scenes as Eren LOL Mikasa is a bad ass love that character 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIIIIT
>> ARTICLE
As a reader of the manga who wasnt expecting to be amazed by stuff that i knew that was going to happen

my expectations were blown. I was on my rockers for the entire episode (When the action started). Holy Shit
>> ARTICLE
Now I'll just go about my day with my heart in a million different pieces. 
>> ARTICLE
definitely a favorite episode.

that titan fight was as intense as i would have hoped, and then [some](/s "count me among the 'it's annie' group now too"). 


 Eren's gonna die more [than](/s "optimus prime") I guess? 

 
>> ARTICLE
The fight was great but Eren made some derp faces, these episodes should stop ending at the best parts.
>> ARTICLE
PETRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OMG LEVI AND MIKASA TOGETHER!!!!!!!! THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.
 
>> ARTICLE
Soundtrack at 13:10. I. Need. Now.
>> ARTICLE
HHHNNNNNGGGGGG

This show makes me want to find a way to travel into the future to see the next one. Seriously, how can this get better?
>> ARTICLE
So when Eren Says, I really want to Eat her... is that Him talking or the Titan talking?
>> ARTICLE
Finally! It's about time they [spoilers about certain characters] (/s "killed off characters the audience may give two shits about. RIP Petra"). 
>> ARTICLE
That song during the middleish of the episode is grand and fits quite well. I hope the OST has all soundtracks, whenever it'll be released.

Only 1 OST is out and has very few of the songs that's in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Paging someone who makes gifs, can someone make a gif of the Female Titan shrimping out from under Eren's guard?

Its at about 17:50
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I was not ready for this episode at all. Got into bed, turned on the TV and loaded up the crunchyroll app to start watching some anime on an uneventful Saturday night. After this episode I don't even think I want to watch anything else. So much action, what a truly epic episode.

I'm super tempted to read the manga now to find out what happens next but I think I will just be a victim of suspense for the next week. 
>> ARTICLE
after that titan UFC fight with Eren, the female titan ran like a bitch when it saw Mikasa...I don't blame her!

i swear Mikasa is like the new Chuck Norris. "a titan attack Mikasa by surprise, after hours of pain and agony......the Titan died"
>> ARTICLE
OK.... So this is seriously the best episode of any anime I have ever seen.  This had my going crazy every single second.
>> ARTICLE
That was one furious round of Mike Titan's Punch Out going on.
>> ARTICLE
I'll miss Auruo...RIP you magnificent bastard.
>> ARTICLE
Eren was legitimately terrifying.
>> ARTICLE
So how many times do they plan in killing off the main character?
>> ARTICLE
All I could keep saying was oh my fucking god just kill the titan already so OP.
>> ARTICLE
I believe Eren is losing his humanity as he continues to utilize his titan powers. He stated he wanted to eat Rose, that's not a normal human action
>> ARTICLE
Was the blood dissolving off of Mikasa the Titans, or is she part titan as well?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure it's just Titan blood. The same could be seen when Reiner was caught by the Female Titan and ripped her hand to shreds.
>> ARTICLE
You see this when the survey corp try to defend the female titan from the other titans and you see stream coming off of them.  This happens a lot throughout the series
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it was Titan blood.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
This episode got me wondering a bit. Manga spoiler discussion below here, so just warning you.

[Manga Spoiler](/s "What do you think would have happened to Armin had Christa not shown up and he ended up telling Reiner who he thought the female titan was, assuming that is what he wanted relayed to the head of the survey corps? Jean overhears, Reiner kills Jean on the way back to the formation leaving Armin to die? Or maybe Reiner would have tried to convince Armin otherwise? It's hard to tell the motives behind the shifters.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga ](/s "reiner has a dis associative personality disorder
so i dont believe he wouldve killed them given his actions in the scene with the female titan where he SAVES JEANS LIFE!")
>> ARTICLE
[response spoiler] (/s "hard to tell really, I don't think he would do that, I think keeping his cover would be his primary goal in such a situation, although he would probably warn her when getting back into town so that she might not fall for any traps.")
>> ARTICLE
I love this show, but sometimes I stop feeling bad. You know Levi and Mikasa are ridiculous, and you know Eren can go Titan mode, why not utilize them? EVER? you'd rather throw away countless lives than just get things done no problem.  Drives me crazy.

Also that formation was a bad plan, and they really should just learn to live underground.

That's about all I have to say. I love you AOT but sometimes your logic makes me sadder than the deaths your logic causes. 
>> ARTICLE
If they move underground, then the whole thing will become like a prequel to Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
I swear the female titan looks just like Mikasa. If they are somehow related, I give up on humanity. If that  titan has Mikasa's blood, no one will live.

>> ARTICLE
I'm really confused as to how people don't know who it is, I think it's really obvious, I won't spoil it, so don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how they look similar at all? Mikasa looks like she's from Asia (dark hair and eyes), and the female Titan looks European (light hair and eyes).
>> ARTICLE
All I want for Christmas is a spin-off of The Epic Adventures of Levi and Mikasa, with the occasional cameo by Titan!Eren.
>> ARTICLE
the 5min opening sequence was pretty shitty but one the most well animated and insane episodes ive ever seen in anything

>> ARTICLE
At the end of this episode, I let out an evil laugh. I think that was me expressing my sheer joy after watching...
>> ARTICLE
Oh my word , what an epic episode.

So well directed and emotional
>> ARTICLE
several epic fights, leading up to some unfortunate endings. Overall a very sexy episode. 

However, the one thing that I found weird is that the female titan chose to eat Eren in the end and it seemed like she was making sure she didnt kill him. Maybe she has plans for him.
>> ARTICLE
my reaction in this episode... HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK! WHOA!
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny how it keeps flipping to conversations taking place somewhere else, that immediately tell you what is about to happen right before it does.
>> ARTICLE
JESUS CHRIWST HOLY SHIT SDKFUHSDFKJSDHFSKHF


THAT WAS AN AWEASIMADOIAS EPISODE
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, can't wait to see the next one.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fucking shit. I can't believe what happened this episode. Petra :( and mikasa almost losing her shit and eren getting his titan head chopped off and then him getting eaten. I hate waiting for a new episode every week.
>> ARTICLE
So I have a good idea who the titan might be but I refuse to believe just yet. Real shame I have a whole week to have it in my head before ep 22. This was a crazily wild ride this episode, so awesome (the fighting) yet so horrible (the deaths) too. I'm worried for Mikasa, it was a good thing Levi stopped her from trying to attack. Eren would probably be fine, but how much more can she take? Last time she thought Eren was dead she pretty much gave up the will to live.
>> ARTICLE
It's taking everything inside of me to not look at the spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
I was NOT looking forward to the episode where my beloved Petra died :(((
>> ARTICLE
God was this episode suspenseful. Throughout the episode the female titan interested me a lot. Not knowing what she was thinking was just... Anyways when Eren transformed i had a mini orgasm. Im like holy think this is what i was waiting for. The only disappointment of this episode is I still don't know the female titan. The suspense is just building up. Can't wait for the climax. Please no manga spoilers. Thanks    
>> ARTICLE
its episodes like this that remind us why SnK is so good

my expectations were satisfied to say the least 
>> ARTICLE
I read this and it still feels unexpected. 
>> ARTICLE
My main fear is that when the female titan's identity is finally revealed we will be forced to sympathize with her for some reason, because I'm really looking forward to her getting wrecked.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else recognize who the female titan was when they started fighting?
>> ARTICLE
Such an exhilarating episode. Even after reading the manga, my heart was pumping. 

Edit: Also, poor Petra. Gets me everytime :(
>> ARTICLE
This anime truly shows no one is safe in this world just an amazing episode !
>> ARTICLE
This episode is why I love this Anime, it gives you characters that are developed enough to get farther developed later but not so much that you get attached and angry if/when they die
>> ARTICLE
The contrast of Erin's berserking and A%$#'s Military Fighting was really cool to watch.
>> ARTICLE
what's that? lackluster animation recently? where'd i hear that?
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa mama bear mode engage!
>> ARTICLE
Damnit when are they going to let Eren-Titan train in combat?!
>> ARTICLE
WHY THE FUCK IS MIKASA STEAMING WHEN THE BLOOD ON HER FACE DISAPPEARS??

Edit: It was the titans blood. :(

its the female titans blood evaporating!!

>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did he see something that made him pause that let the female titan have enough time to slice his titan head off
>> ARTICLE
..... I think it was super obvious that he paused....
>> ARTICLE
And this is why this show has the most agonizing cliffhangers
>> ARTICLE
am I the only one who thinks the titan is for sure the blonde girl that was the only one that didn't join the survey corps with all the people from her training group?
>> ARTICLE
Poor Petra. Her death made me sad for a second time

>> ARTICLE
I think he'll regenerate and turn into a titan inside of her. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't think he had the reserve to do so though. That was some brutal forced eject
>> ARTICLE
This has to be the first time that i felt chills despite reading the manga beforehand for any anime. I spent like an entire hour just rewinding even though i knew exactly what was/is happening. 


>> ARTICLE
It took 5 episodes to finally see the epic battle I have been waiting for,this has got to be the most exciting episode so far! My spine tingled when Eren finally turned into a Titan again! Cannot wait for the next episode :D
>> ARTICLE
Eren's realization that his choice was wrong, and alot of the scenes in the fight where much more emotional, impactful, and straight-up better looking in the manga, (probably because it all went by so fast, in the manga you have time to let each panel sink in), but I'm still glad to finally see my favorite scene animated.

My next favorite scene'll be in the anime next episode(?). (Ch.30 pages 37-42 for those wondering which scene.)
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of game of thrones , everything seems to be alright when they  actually beat the sht out of the female titan  ,Aaaaand after few minutes they are dead :( so yeah pretty much anyone can die at any point of the anime 
>> ARTICLE
Eren's alive. He's alive. He has to be alive. Right...? 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I am 95% sure who the female in the titan is...but I dont want to say anything on here in case I ruin it for some. So on that note... BEST ANIME OF 2013!
>> ARTICLE
I read all the manga last week and after seeing this episode I wish I hadn't.  There were parts where I had shivers down my spine and I didn't really get that by just reading.
>> ARTICLE
...they....they all died...there is no hope!
>> ARTICLE
I just went back to watch ep 17, apparently there were tons of subtle hints/info in that ep; not a manga reader, but [I have found these interesting items in ep 17](/s "1. Reiner is very, very likely the Armored Titan and he is obviously working with the female titan, Reiner took off his hood so she can recognise him and not attack him; 2. The female titan came from the expedition's right flank, which was the intel given to Reiner's squad as to where Eren is placed (the survey corp commander has intentionally distributed misleading intel to confuse the spy/ies, you see Jean and Armin having different intel also); 3. The female titan has the ability to know what human thinks by touching their heads; 3. The female titan changed her course after rendezvous with Reiner, heading towards the centre point of the formation (Reiner gave the info Armin mentioned to him roughly 15min into the ep); Armin noted the course change at the end of ep 17. TLDR: Reiner possible armored titan; Armin gave away important info unintentionally; Eren needs to learn how to use titan abilities pronto; Why didnt Reiner and Female titan kill Armin I dont know, Reiner was obviously shocked/stunned by Armin's analytical prowess, which if it was me, be concerned if he's gonna jeopardise mah titan plot")
>> ARTICLE
So much suspense it literally made my heart hurt! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time hoping that no one wouldn't have died.
>> ARTICLE
So I just got the one with different subs than what I usually watch and I really have to ask what pompous jackass decided using Old English was a good idea? Does he think he's Tolkien and some sort of great Beowulf scholar? 
>> ARTICLE
The group put out an interview where their translator explained his choices. It's as pretentious and pompous as you may anticipate.

That was worse than I thought. 
>> ARTICLE
dang i need to stop reading the manga BUT i can't help it!
>> ARTICLE
I'm so pumped for this Saturday. Levi and Mikasa fighting together... gonna be gooooood.
>> ARTICLE
WHY DO THEY KEEP KILLING EVERYONE. OK now that I vented that I am really happy to see this show pick up again, I started to like the show less when they gave Erin the power to turn into a eoten so all the story that came after that started to make me lose interest with that said. I loved all the combat this EP with the Multi Axis Mobility Gear that gear was the reason I started to love the shit out of this show which is why I was sad to see Erin get something that made his gear more or less obsolete. Also props to the writers for having the balls to kill as many characters as they have to make the story feel more real and emphasis the fact that they are fighting a losing war.
>> ARTICLE
Okay so what's the deal with Mikasa? Is she part Titan too? There was steam coming off her face so Idk if that was her own blood and she was healing or if it was the female titan's evaporating off of her.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it was Titan blood.
>> ARTICLE
first time here.  The link just goes to a 2min preview not the actual vid

What was the song that played during their attack on the female titan?

Wait until 22, LEVI'S VENGEANCE!!!
>> ARTICLE
Titans are OP as hell all hope is lost :(
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode was so intense that a little squirt of pee came out while i was watching.
>> ARTICLE
Discovered this through r/naruto post. So glad I did. It's been a rollercoaster coming from an anime manga (naruto) that hardly kills off main characters (still love Naruto though) to this. Levi's squad were my favorite characters and I was wide eyed like Eren wishing for the Female Titan to die just like Eren did. Just so much emotion in this series. The last time I was so mad at a villain was when Jiraiya was killed by Pain. It's like that throughout this entire series for me.
>> ARTICLE
Petra! Never forget:'(
>> ARTICLE
Why nsfw?
>> ARTICLE
It seems to be how threads show in red text in the main /r/anime thread titles.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I'm still really confused on why the female titan started crying when Mikasa and Levi took Erin away...
>> ARTICLE
Not even the manga has thus far told us why that happened...

>> ARTICLE
There propably will be many seasons to come... Why does stuff happen so slowly, they havent accomplished much
>> ARTICLE
I might be a little fucked up for thinking this but they totally could have killed the female titan after slicing off all that arm meat. Instead of going straight for the neck, if they had instead gone for the stomach two well placed cuts would have caused a hunk of flesh to fall out one person then flies into the wound. That person sheaths one sword then breaks one on the musculature of the titan so you would have one smaller blade. Then making full length incisions at the rear of the wound the person could dig themselves deeper into the wound varying the path so they aren't as easy to pull out. Eventually you would reach the actuall stomach of the titan. Unsheathing the second sword and then breaking it on the stomach lining the person would then have two shorter blades. They then could use the blades to climb up the inside of the stomach into the esophagus. Stopping just below the vocal chords or just above the collar bones the person then starts cutting perpendicular to the esophagus to probe for the spinal column once there you just start fucking shit up until the titan falls down dead. The person could finally cut their way out of the neck or go back and try to come out the way they came in.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I thought that too, but then everybody is always splattered with titan blood, which should also be really hot, but no one seem bothered by it. And also the first time Eren was eaten, he should have been severely burned going down and while being in the stomach juice, but he wasn't. I don't remember how hot they said they were suppose to be, but by what I've seen I thing the titan might only be hot shower temperature.
>> ARTICLE
Nah man, apparently wasting time so she can regenerate is a better way to go. Why go for the killing blow when you could doodle around cutting up her stomach?
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't be doodling. It would probably be a safer way to assure a kill.
>> ARTICLE
You do realize that she regenerates right? Time is of essence here
>> ARTICLE
Yes she regens, I know. She doesn't regen instantly though. It takes time to regenerate, and creating a wound that grows would mean it would take longer to regenerate. If regeneration was an issue they would  not have started attacking the arms to begin with. Even if her arms did regenerate she would have to pull herself part to get to them, which would then open up another opportunity to attack.
>> ARTICLE
They attack the arms so that she's not blocking the nape anymore, otherwise they can't get to it
>> ARTICLE
They attack the arms to go in the stomach and up the esophagus to destroy the titan and capture the human.
>> ARTICLE
She had both her arms up, why do you even need to attack the arms if you want to focus on the stomach? Did you even watch the episode?
>> ARTICLE
1. Attack the shoulders
2. Cut into stomach 
3. Get into stomach (**she can't pull you out or kill you**)
4. Climb up the esophagus
5. Wreak havoc
6. Get out through nape

If you had read my statement you would have noticed
> could have killed the female titan after slicing off all that arm meat. Instead of going straight for the neck, if they had instead gone for the stomach

Stating that if instead of trying to cut through the front of the neck to get her head to fall down exposing the back of her neck (which ultimately got them killed) , they could  have gone into and up the resemblance of a digestive system (which would have been protected)

what i saw was titan sex....... brutal titan sex.......

After this episode, I broke down and read the manga.

i really liked the way it showed how eren has so much brute strength that his own body literally destroys itself 
            also did anyone else noticed when mikasa started steaming and the blood from her face disappeared maybe her and Eren's father experimented on both of  them just throwing out a fan theory

Oh my God. Fuck.

I'm not kidding, this was one of the best single episodes of anything I've seen.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS/HINT








But rewatching episode four puts so many things in perspective
>> ARTICLE
The spoiler tag instructions are on the side bar.

>> ARTICLE
Well as someone who hates this anime but read further in the manga. I loved this part because it had characters I wanted to see fight which is Mikasa and Levi. Sadly I thought this episode was meh and the manga was much better. Don't think there is anything left for me to see either so pretty much done with this SnK shit. I think maybe 1 more Hanji part way later on which they'll need another season or 2 to get to it and no doubt this anime will get it because of it's shit hype around it.
>> ARTICLE
Implying that it's not good enough to have more of the series animated?...

Also, it's not shit hype, Sword Art was shit hype..

SnK might be a bit overhyped, but it deserves its fandom waaaaaay more than SAO did (which was not at all, btw)..
>> ARTICLE
Quiet you, SAO was awesome.  Had some great fights and the story was cool.  
>> ARTICLE
nsfw?
>> ARTICLE
its good they died they should of worshipped the titans instead of walls maybe thats why they got stepped on haha
>> ARTICLE
On man. I want to spoil so badly but I must refrain the urge!
>> ARTICLE
...they didn't worship either.And how would worshiping the titans stop them from getting killed?
>> ARTICLE
[Major Manga Spoilers](/s "That guy is spoiling the manga. The church in the SnK world 'technically' worships both walls and titans, but they don't know that the wall is made out of titans yet.")

Edit: Downvotes of course. I may be posting manga spoilers to help understand but at least I spoiler tagged it.
>> ARTICLE
Stuff like this really puts in perspective how goddamn terrifying titans would look in that world. That walking towards you would cause pants-shitting levels of fear.
>> ARTICLE
In that world? You maybe meant our world, because it's already terrifying in their world and even when I read the manga/watched the anime I felt some terror when imagining what would happen should a titan show itself while I was walking my dog.
>> ARTICLE
That could be a sitcom. "Meet the Titans!"

The Titan family (the Colossal and Female Titan as mom and dad, the others are their kids) moves in across the street from the Jaeger family and all sorts of whacky antics happen!
>> ARTICLE
People give Hannes shit in episode 1 for running from the titan but really who wouldn't in that situation?  Those things are fucking nightmares.
>> ARTICLE
Now I know why every human character in the series seems to be scared shitless of the titans. Then again, Eren's titan design is inherently more intimidating than regular titans. 

This makes me realize how good of a decision it was that the author decided to make the titans 4-15 meters tall. I imagine it'd be less scary if every Titan was the size of a Colossal. 
>> ARTICLE
Why humans would be afraid of Titans? They freaking eat their families dude.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe humans need to fucking buck up and stop being little bitches that get scared by giants that eat their families. Fucking cowards.

Every human character is scared of them because if ones close to you your probably going to die.

[this](http://seiga.nicovideo.jp/seiga/im3174265) was posted on the 10th of June 2013. that might not be the original source either though, i can't read japanese, but it was posted before

i think they've just stolen the art and claimed it for themselves.

shame i would have liked to have found the original artist, so i could look at more of their work

*That's* what was bothering me, I was trying to figure it out. The building doesn't look terribly tall (maybe 2 stories) because it looks to be a relatively normal building. Also compared to the rest of the buildings it looks pretty normal in height so it doesn't seem like it is ridiculously big.

So it makes it look like his proportions are that of a dwarf. His torso has to be around the same length of his legs.

Woah. That looks amazing.

The shading looks rough but maybe that's just his/her style.

so like, there has to be a point where the word "sketch" does not describe the picture anymore. This thing is very well done and I'm sure it wasn't just a quick doodle in his match class.

Dem triceps
>> ARTICLE
I actually don't really like how the triceps look.

Looks like the artist took some liberties with the anatomy which makes it look rather strange to me. It's shaped rather strangely it looks more like a squid than a horseshoe like it is supposed to.

The delts also kind of bothered me as well. What is that tumor between the triceps and the biceps?

Haha, yes, a sketch. Major props to whoever drew this!

Should reply to one of the OP's comments, that way he's alerted.

>> ARTICLE
Call me hipster if you want, but I just couldn't bring myself to buy any SnK merch, especially in the US here. The show has exploded in popularity so much now, that I feel like a tool even talking about the show now.

Probably because overseas fans seem to only latch onto like 1 or 2 shows for an entire year+ ... barely seeing anything else, and drown almost everything else out. Right now it's SnK and SAO. Before that it was Durarara!!, etc.

I give the vendors props for not gouging completely on the price. But I fear it's a Chinese knockoff then.
>> ARTICLE
"I don't want to support shows I may like because a lot of other people like it too."
>> ARTICLE
Because everything else gets drowned out. It's too much. And too many people just buy Chinese knockoffs anyways, which doesn't give any money to them.

A decorative anime plate MSRP is like $15-20. A small wallscroll half the size of the ones you see sold at most conventions goes for $35 in Japan. Official Totoro plushie 12" tall? $100+

What are the chances any of those bags are official products?
>> ARTICLE
You're right, maybe "support" was the wrong word.  I meant just showing that you like a show.

I won't call you hipster. You're just a tool.

I'm pretty rough with my backpack, do you think it could take a lot of wear? Dragged on rough surfaces, cut resistant, weather retardant?

As /u/Lucaiie pointed out already, it is from Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. Originally a manga by CLAMP, it was later made into an anime.

I believe it's the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle wings! :D
>> ARTICLE
lol yeah, because even to the people who don't know it's from an anime, the symbol itself is still pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
this is exactly what went through my mind when i saw this. it looks cool, unique, and people who haven't seen the anime would have no idea where it's from.
>> ARTICLE
Could you comment on the comfort and the build quality?

I currently have a backpack that has a hole in it, so I'm looking for a new one. Have you tried putting a laptop in there? Does it feel like it might fall after a year or so of use? I longboard, which will innately have more wear on it. Comfort is a plus!
>> ARTICLE
That's actually why I got this one xD. If you have like a 11-13 inch laptop it'll fit, but mine is 15.6 inches so it doesn't fit, since it's too tall on its side. It's very comfortable when I wear it and definitely feels like it'll last a while, however towards the back of it there's a little pocket that I put my keys in, and I can definitely feel it when I put it on since there's no padding between it. Overall it's very soft where it needs to be and I'm very happy with it all around.
>> ARTICLE
Do you think I could squeeze in a 14 inch laptop?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely :)
>> ARTICLE
I saw your other post with a screenshot of things inside of it. Perfect size for the moleskine, there! :D I have one, too!

My laptop is 16.5" diagonally and 13.5" tall on its side. What do you think of that? Luckily I keep my keys on my person! :D Thank you so much for your response! I'll more than likely buy one by the end of the night! :)
>> ARTICLE
Let's see... 16.5 diagonally and 13.5 tall would mean using the Pythagorean Theorem it's about 9.5 inches wide. Yay, I can math... anyway, yeah you can fit that in no problem. I took some measurements just to be sure and you should be good with a little room to spare.  

Amazon should be paying me for sponsorship xD

The print feels really nice and I would trust it to hold up for a while.

Is this made out of actual "cloth" (like those hipster/retro backpacks) or is it just the typical plasticy nylon that most backpacks are made of?
>> ARTICLE
It actually feels like slightly-thicker-than-normal khaki. Definitely not the typical nylon like my last one. This one feels a lot stronger.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I was sort of hopping it was made of cloth, but I guess this is cool.

Now I just need to find a place that ships to Canada and hope I don't get hammered by duties.

Seems really nice. Thinking I may buy one myself. If it's fine, may i see some pictures of the inside? Is it roomy?
>> ARTICLE
[Sure!](http://imgur.com/xmVdNvm) It's big enough for all my school stuff, the only problem is that my laptop (a 15.6 inch asus) doesn't quite fit in it with all of my binders.  Other then that, everything works awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Nice book you got there, Wall cultist!
>> ARTICLE
:)
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking the look of this so I'm going to throw some questions your way.

If I didn't put as many binders etc in it would a 15.6" asus fit? Pretty sure that's what I have as well haha.

How does the print feel quality wise?  Any chance of it peeling etc?

How well do you think it will hold up to daily use? I longboard around, which helps me keep my load in my smaller backpack that I use light, but I would still be putting a bit of use into this.

Thanks OP!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I have an Asus A53SD, and was able to fit in in with maybe 2 or 3 1.5-inch binders once I took the sleeve off of it. It did look a bit tight, though, and I don't know how much I'd trust it in there since it's pretty much in there naked. 

The print quality is very nice. I think it'll be okay as long as you don't smash it against anything and keep it safe.

Overall the material it's made of feels much stronger than my old one; kind of like a really thick sort of khaki. I would trust it to hold up for a while.  

Hope this helps :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, exact same laptop as mine so I guess that answers my question, though it's broken right now sadly (take extra care around the powerjack, don't let it heat up too bad. I think i might be able to sew in a few straps to keep it stable though. perhaps something slightly elastic to keep it snug.

That's a good idea

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, my school is pretty open with that kind of stuff but I know it can be difficult in other places. The trick for me was to surround myself in like-minded people, and then the haters seem like nothing to me. 

PS, I made myself [headphones with cat ears on them](http://imgur.com/diHy155). Your argument is invalid xD

In all seriousness, it just depends on whether or not you want to go out and find people who have the same interests as you. Hope you find people like yourself :)

Oh! In high school I hung out with the dweebs and anime nerds, I dressed goth, all that nice stuff! I graduated 2 years ago and I'm in college now, so typically people grow out of dressing up and stuff unless you're going to an event (like a convention). And yes, I'm ashamed to show my love of anime to my university. I do have many friends who also love anime! They have no problem showing it, it's just me. XD enjoy high school! It was awesome! Oh and niiiice cat ears!! Those are nicely made. :) see that's fine! I just get jittery when people go out with the ears/tail combo with the stupid choker. -.-

What leak?

Some animator from China doing the outsourcing posted saying how he's annoyed that they have to get this complex action sequence out by this date, and it's in ep17
>> ARTICLE
Lmao sounds like it's going to be crazy. I hope the animation isn't done half assed. And isn't ep, 17 weeks from now?
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has read the entire manga and is up to date, let me inform but not spoil for you, the fact that it will indeed pickup in action - there's a point in the manga where battling goes on for about 15 chapters straight(pretty much) and these are big ass 60 pagers too :P Plus this show introduces some of the biggest and darkest twists in plot around, so stay optimistic! :D
>> ARTICLE
Ah don't get me wrong, I'm all caught up. But my memory kinda sucks so I forget what's gonna happen in the immediate future. I wish I hadn't read the manga because I still do remember the big plot points and I enjoy watching the anime so much better. Thanks for the advice anyway.

But oh man it's so worth it

At the pace it is going I would bet that we won't see any action again until episode 18.

It's not like every show is constant action. It's a slow point now but it definitely ramps up.

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I'd liken this show to Geass' pacing. A little slower in parts maybe, but there's a slow episode here or there, then shit hits the fan for a couple of episodes until there's a slow one again.

The only difference is Geass basically shifted their episode marks to the right on the plot graph. I don't know if anyone else agrees or noticed, but Geass almost always ended on a climax or rising point.
>> ARTICLE
Actually he only slept for one episode. Ep11 finished with that brofist to Mikasa
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree! This episode was a nice change of pace from the last 2-3.
>> ARTICLE
That is because this episode animated the rest of Volume 4 which was a total of around 60 pages. The last 2-3 episodes had been going around 30 pages from the manga.

The pacing did surprise me and I am glad they ended it here since it is the perfect spot. I really thought they were going to only do half for the episode and save the other half for after the recap.

Anyways great episode can't wait for the new opening and ending and the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
Will there be actually a new OP & ED? I doubt anything can top the current ones.

Yes they have been announced since a while back

#2: "Jiyuu no Tsubasa" () by Linked Horizon
Ending Theme:

#2: "great escape" by cinema staff

>> ARTICLE
Why is it that shows are never happy with utilizing the same OP for a full season? It always seems like the first OP is the better one t0o but I would not mind being pleasantly surprised.
>> ARTICLE
lol well personally I don't mind the way I see it the more openings the better. The first opening was created in mind for the first 12 episodes. It doesn't show anything that happens after that point. They had it planed out that after a recap episode when starting a new arc they would have a new opening and ending. Already listened to the first opening enough times and want to see if they can make another opening just as good.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how legit this is. 

"Jiyuu no Tsubasa" 2nd OP - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJJ5AW9ysVs
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else think that the [purple ground particles](http://i.imgur.com/NSgtVAU.jpg) were odd? It's at 10:43. Was it some weird aesthetic choice or did they just not put a proper texture on it? Because it looks pretty rough. The more I look at it, the more it looks like the animators just ran out of time. 
>> ARTICLE
The episode was aired in a very incomplete form. It's about 80% done. It's like Psycho-Pass 18, but less noticeable due to the amount of action in-between the bad scenes.

A minute later, 11:44, they recicled two scenes in two very bad spots during the climax: first Eren carrying the boulder (we should have seen how a new titan was entering throught the hole), and then Mikasa running on top of a roof (when she was suppoused to be on the ground).
>> ARTICLE
[There's more](http://imgur.com/a/322Ww). I thought gg just got a bad raw but apparently it aired like that
>> ARTICLE
It just looks like the animation was a bit rushed. More reason to get the Blu-Rays, I suppose, but this was pretty apparent, even for a TV run. Not just derpy background faces, but some very bright texture-less particles. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems they really need to do the recap episode, since there's a lot of other weird stuff as well. That moment before Annie takes care of the titan going after Jean, there's a really weird slowdown to a still image of the titan, then a speed up from a still image of Annie back to animation. Then you just have a shot of the city with titan-falling smoke over some roofs. Also, when Jean manages to get airborne there's a seemingly useless shot over the city with the 3D gear sounds on the background. They don't really have any artistic merit so certainly they were really running out of time/money.
>> ARTICLE
stylistically.. Eren's whole boulder carrying business had lots of effects happening in various colors - eyes switching from gundam green to regular -. i can forgive a bunch of purple bricks as artsy.
>> ARTICLE
But looking at it closely makes it obvious where one layer starts and the other ends. It just seems like even if it was just them making it more stylish, it would be blended better than that. 
>> ARTICLE
hah, don't go there man. while toying around in photoshop a while ago i started to see layers in any and every anime. kinda ruined the immersion for me a while. you want to analyse less and blend what you see yourself as much as you can
>> ARTICLE
You're probably right, but it helps if those "off" bits aren't bright purple. I probably wouldn't have gone back to look at it that closely if it were even just colored similarly to the ground.

Creator1: Hey, isnt a three minute long complete recap of the last two episodes, a bit unnecessary? 

Creator2:[YOU IDIOT!](http://animeaudiolog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/shingeki-no-kyojin-ep-7-titan-vs-titan.jpg) What about all the people who started watching this show from episode 13?! 

Creator1:I er 

Creator2: Or our viewers with alzheimers who cant remember any of the previous episodes?! 

Creator1: Im sorry Youre right, I was being inconsiderate. Nobody loves our audience more than you. 

Creator2: No need to apologize if you understand. Now, Ive heard that seeing moving images on the television screen can be bad for the eyes so 

(But other than that start, it did make pretty good progress. So I'm happy)

This truly is Attack on Stills.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mind the stills one bit for two reasons:

1. You can't help the fact that you have no money. We can't blame the animators, we can only blame ourselves . . . and the studio . . . and the Japanese in general. 
2. It did sort of give it a feel that I didn't entirely hate like someone telling an old timey story(which is kinda what this is considering the first page of the manga).

However when Mikasa dodged Eren's punch and they manipulated the frame to make it look like she was in motion, that just looked cheesy. I do not like that one bit. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping the stills get filled in during BD production but who knows.
>> ARTICLE
that would actually be an excellent reason as it would boost bluray sales by 8000%
>> ARTICLE
Those are fine reasons to have stills, but the problem is how much they overuse them, only to then have the completely over the top, high budget, beautifully animated 3DMG scenes. It drives me crazy.

 I'd rather they paced the budget so that the stills were used only when appropriate (The spit-take, for example, was NOT appropriate, while the face off between Eren and the Colossal Titan WAS) and so that they could add some movement to shots where absolutely nothing but one character's mouth is moving. (Not counting the perpetual eye trembling....)

Considering she's the best of the best I'm pretty sure they'd take her, and Armin has a leg up since Pixiv likes his planning.
>> ARTICLE
Due to the backwards way their military recruitment works, the front-line guys of the survey corp don't usually get the best of the best. They take anyone they can get, which usually means anyone who can't score well enough to get a safer job in the Royal Guard. Plus a few eccentrics like Eren who actually want to fight.

Yup. To join the Scouting Legion, you have to be really good, or really have a few screws loose. Bonus points if you're a cocktail of both

That music while he was moving the boulder had me in tears man. So epic.

It's so strange. Thinking about it logically, there's nothing to cry about - rather, there's nothing that's plain 'sad' about the scene. But it's the triumph, combined with the tragedy of people willing to throw away their lives for the first glimpse of hope for victory in their entire lives.

I guess I'll be the dumb ass to ask. When did Eren kill 4 titans in human form?

He didn't. Badassery points =/= Titan kills.

Lmao! Thanks for clearing that up.

Rereading his comment I clearly see that it's labeled, I really am a dumb ass. I skim too fast when reading.
>> ARTICLE
eren didnt kill 1 single titan in human form during the battle of trost his stats in human form are kills-0 deaths-1!! which means his kill ratio is garbage 
>> ARTICLE
Well to by fair he did not died. You can see him alive (without an arm and a leg but still) in the belly of the titan.
>> ARTICLE
i consider having your arm and leg bitten off and in the process of being digested for lack of a better term a death because if he wasnt a human/titan he wouldnt have been able to escape so he was done thus his kill ratio 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I was suprised he lived in the belly too. But by the fact that he did not died i mean he's not immortal (probably). If someone would cut his head off he would die.

I believe that the whole ep.13 deserves one huge badass point.

The scene after they cut Eren out of the titan and then they are saved by Levi. When they said: "Who is that?" I couldn't help but think: [Araragi-San!](http://myanimelist.net/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya).

So what was the deal with amnesia? Did he forget most his past now or were they simply referring to the parts with his dad's experiments that he no longer remembers?

The recaps and credits just seem to be compressing the episodes...It's like 10-12 minutes credits/recap/preview and 12-14 minutes of actual episode. Though I guess its quality over quantity.

The actual content goes from 5min to 22min. So yeah, 3 mins less than usual length
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think that throw-up is how other titans are made? They eat until they are full throw up that big thing while it acts like a cocoon until they grow.
>> ARTICLE
My assumption is that they are all somewhat like Jager. Titan weak spot is where he sits when in titan form.
>> ARTICLE
Also when Armin is trying to get Eren out he says it's like he is fusing with it or something like that, maybe the thing eren got injected with was a more finished version of something lot's of humans were given 107 years ago! 
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like a reasonable assumption, considering I don't know the answer for lack of being a manga reader.
>> ARTICLE
I literally yelled when Levi showed up, so epic.

Eren looked like the Titan Atlas when he carried that round boulder on his shoulders 
>> ARTICLE
I think that was what they were going for. Atlas was burdened with carrying the world on his shoulders and as of right now, Eren is in the same position.
>> ARTICLE
Pacing was fine this episode, with some EPIC scenes to match.

Really sad that the elite soldier commander dude got chomped, I thought he was insanely cool and could've been boss character.

Seeing all the dead people including Titan vomit was kinda horrid though. Not bad, but it was shown really well how terrible all these deaths are and the toll it takes on the survivors. 

Levi (I think), captain of survey corps. makes a bit more of an appearance and hes a pretty cool character. It'll be cool learning mroe about him when the next arc seems to be Eren joining the recon corps and taking the next wall after we watch the recap episode.

Good episode, keep the pacing like this and titan can remain a 10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
When Eren lifted the boulder, I had a gush of tears to my eyes. I was like, humanity is saved.


>> ARTICLE
So after the comment "the giant and armored titan are just like you", that got me thinking. What if those two titans are actually humans who transform too and do it for evil, no clue on purpose though?
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they will recap the upcoming recap episode.

When Armin was taking Eren out of the titan  he was saying how Eren was stuck, do you guys think its possible that each time Eren uses the titan power he slowly becomes one with the titan?

if anything, the colossal titan and the armored titan might have been humans. . . or at least, that's what Erwin made it sound like

Can I say, that this series makes me care for every single character, no matter who dies or saves someone from being eaten only to be eaten themselves, minor or major, I still freak out a little bit and feel sad. not alot of series can do that for me.

Also, Erens awesome "Do you even lift" music and scene was totally epic
>> ARTICLE
After seeing the scene with bodies i was afraid it would end like this. I'm glad they showed the scenes in the prison cell. It would by too hard to wait 2 weeks for another episode.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode yet IMO. Erens speech about freedom along with the music and scenes of the battle went together perfectly. Not only that but they went back to showing just how dark and brutal the Titans anf the war against them really is. Finally they showed more of Levi's character. Damn this was a good episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, the titan vomit... nasty.
>> ARTICLE
That episode really gave justice to the aftermath of a battle. No beer fuelled feasts of the victors, only the grief over who we've lost, and giving them the respect they deserve. 
>> ARTICLE
So can we assume that titans started like eren(not exactly but able to use the power) but fused completely with the Titan?(haven't read the manga so not spoiling just thinking out loud).
>> ARTICLE
Okay I know this thread is basically done but was anyone else seriously annoyed that Marco could have killed that titan that was about to get Jean when he came up behind the darn thing? I mean they don't kill as many as they seem to be able to.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the military should learn simple physics, As far as I can see, the boulder is perfectly round and somewhat smooth.. Titan Eren should have just rolled it over and carried it when it's near the hole. 
>> ARTICLE
and killed some shorter than average titans on the way.
>> ARTICLE
Well... There were some trenches and obstacles in front of the hole in the wall. 

But yeah.
>> ARTICLE
physics always takes a back seat to the dramatic !!
>> ARTICLE
I am getting sick and tired of these recaps in the beginning of the episode. There is no reason that a recap should last 3 minutes long, this is ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
There is a reason though; The studio doesn't have unlimited budget, and if they didn't have 3 minutes of recap it'd probably mean more stills during the actual episode, which would make even more people angry.
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt good. I wish the next episode wasn't a recap, but I can understand the reasoning behind it. I really can't wait to see how Eren handles being in the Survey Corps with Rivaille constantly up his ass. I'm sure there will be some future conflict between the two. 

I just wish they wouldn't make the intro recaps so damn long.

Also...RIP 104th Trainees Squad Marco Bodt :C
>> ARTICLE
Just finished it, I thought it was really good, shame about Ian and Marco though. I really like how Jean was an asshole who's turning how hes acting too.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff that waiting for this episode was intense.

So happy that Levi got his lines. 
>> ARTICLE
I know this comment will probably get buried, but something's been bugging me. They've got a ton of engineers, but no one's thought of plugging the wall with liquid concrete or a pile of rocks poured from directly above the hole, on top of the wall? No need for this titan stuff, and they could do it in relative safety with less than 200 deaths I'd wager (to at least plug the hole, maybe not kill all the titans inside). Am I not seeing something? I know it was done by Eren in the original story, but it still bugs me.
>> ARTICLE
The major problem with this show: too many fucking characters. Everyone is a type rather than a fleshed out human being which is why when people like Marco die, I hardly care.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's kind of refreshing, actually.  It leaves a lot to the imagination.  You feel like you have SOME semblance of connection to each of the characters regardless of how much 'screen-time' they get.  You're acquainted with mankind as a group as you experience these minor characters in juxtaposition to the major ones, which is fundamentally important for the theme of the anime, I think.

.....Who the hell *is* Thomas?

Remember when the Titans first showed up in Trost? Eren and the gang were all "Yeah! We're gonna kill some Titans and get laid later!" and started flying though the city all happy and stuff? Thomas was the first one killed before everything became hell.

Not exactly how that scene transpired but close enough.

>Marco die, I hardly care

I don't think you should. The point is that Jean cares since he bonded with'em over kawaii-tan's death among other things = Conveying the characters inner turmoil done through action/events instead of dialogue/inner monologue. 

I don't mind it.. but i am expecting important people to die before the final curtain. I'd be pretty dissapointed if they wouldn't.
>> ARTICLE
I cared a lot when Marco died and it helped to establish the true danger looming over the major characters.  Marco is just as much a member of mankind as anyone else - and that message hit home for me.
>> ARTICLE
No, I think it's just that the fairly minor characters are the ones who die. The important characters seem to be pretty safe.

In other words, if they're a red shirt, they're dead, while they're mostly safe otherwise.

After the past 2 episodes, this one was incredibly satisfying. I was afraid that this show was going to turn from good to bad like Sword Art Online did. There were a lot of good things about this episode. Eren's whole boulder scene was really intense and had an amazing song to go with it. The part where Marco's corpse was found by Jean was pretty emotional. It was also nice how we got to see how what titans do with their victims. I was, however, disappointed how the first 3 minutes was just a recap of the mostly uneventful past 2 episodes. Once we get past next week's recap, I hope the show keeps up this pace and doesn't lose it again.  
>> ARTICLE
Thoroughly enjoyed the emotional shock of the newer recruits. Makes for some good character depth.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I don't even know where to begin. The pace broke into what felt like a full sprint after the jogging in the previous two episodes. Goosebumps all over from the OST in this one. I was waiting for the inevitable failure but he made it though, AND we got to see Levi.

Bad form but I'm gonna hijack to tell the story of how my girlfriend, who is by *no* means into anime, got me watching this last night, *with her*! (this NEVER happens)

So I'm on my computer, actually trying to do some work (didn't happen), when for no apparent reason I can't remember if it's the ASPCA or NSPCA (turns out both are things, N for Nevada) so I google it.  I go to the site and the girlfriend sees all the cute puppies and hijacks my computer to look at them.  Ok, I'll go busy myself elsewhere (~~queue~~ cue (thanks _F1_) *Last of Us*).

So she eventually tires of looking at the dogs (or maybe she just finished looking at *all* of them) and goes over to her various video sites to, presumably, watch her Korean shows (btw she's Korean).  All of a sudden I notice that what she's watching is a) animated and b) speaking japanese.  Whaaaaa?  What's she watching an anime for, this isn't usual for her by any means.

I stop playing for a bit to check it out, when I notice the characters all running around on 3d maneuver gears (haven't watched a single episode but had heard a ton about it; was high on my list of stuff I need to watch, just hadn't gotten around to it).  ~~Que~~ Cue "Holy shit that's Attack on Titan!"

So I proceed to put it on the tv so we can both watch.  She immediately regrets her decision to have queued it up, but after only the first episode, it's "Ok, c'mon, next episode, hurry!"  We proceeded to marathon the past 12 episodes, watching together.  A momentous first in our house.

Thanks *Attack on Titan* for being such an awesome show.

tl;dr my non-anime watching girlfriend queues up AoT and we end up marathoning the first 12 eps.

Can someone please tell me what chapter this episode falls in the manga and based on this will there be another season? Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the whole manga but I'll say what I know. I believe there are at least two solid manga arcs remaining that have already been released, and the story isn't really coming to a close. I don't see how they can fit the impending story arc in any less than 7-8 episodes, and possibly more if they don't keep a brisk pace. It is quite lengthy, at least as long as the Trost arc. If they plan to tell the whole story, there will be multiple seasons.
>> ARTICLE
This episode covers both chapter 14 and 18. (Ch15~18 are the training arc back then)
>> ARTICLE
I've come to terms with the recap in the beginning of each episode. I just sort of blindly poke around until I'm at the end of the OP.

That being said, this episode was pretty cool. I don't even lift but god damn lifting seems intense. Levi seems like a douchenozzle. There was a bit of closure at the end of this episode (nice change of pace from the cliffhangers) but I'm somewhat disappointed to see that the next episode might be a recap.
>> ARTICLE
When they first heard Eren stamping around I thought for a second that perhaps Colossal or another big titan was gonna show up. Nope, just Eren being a boss. 

Oooh epic song in this episode.

Awwww yeah Levi saving the day like a boss.

Ahhh yes. Hiroshi and Daisuke, together 4ever.

Guys don't get fooled by who red the manga. I got tricked and red all the story until the last manga to check if really the plot deviates like in Gatnz: this is not absolutly the case. The story is good and the plot is always focused; obviously you can't pretend no stop action so Watch the anime!
>> ARTICLE
No one has said that the anime deviates from the manga. For the most part the anime has been extremely faithful to the manga. The Jean scene from this episode wasn't in the manga, but that doesn't break it at all.
>> ARTICLE
Very well done episode.
>> ARTICLE
Good anime, too bad the episodes from 8 until the 12 one were soooo slow paced.

Had it kept the same pace from the first half, this anime would have been easily the best in the last... 10 years, maybe. It is always a shame when the productions slows down the plot just to get more "content".
>> ARTICLE
Finally things happened! This episode seemed so much faster than the last few. Titan Eren finally got control of himself, we see Captain Levi again, and it didn't end on a huge cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
Also, I appreciated the scene where Annie was apologizing to someone who died. Showed that she actually did have some compassion in her.
>> ARTICLE
Finally the show is picking up, the pace was painful as hell with the last few episodes.  

Oh great, recap episode next week...

Is there just one discussion thread for this episode? Because I am itching to discuss that [](/s "Annie moment during Jean's rescue")...

It's so confusing having Captain Levi being VA'd by the same guy who does Arararagi. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda want to see some new people kill the Titans. I feel like it's always Mikasa and the top tier group. I know it make's the most sense but still.
>> ARTICLE
Just a theory but perhaps when titans puke out the humans, the puked humans become titans?
>> ARTICLE
Man Rico's such a badass, I love her character design. I'm glad she got a bit of the anime's stylish action treatment.

Good episode but I still don't like the idea of insert songs.. They're so taste dependent, they need to sick that epic sounding orchestra. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kind of scared of Episode 15. When they showed Marco's corpse, it looked as if he had been turned into a Titan somehow. To make matters worse, no one knows how he died. Finally, notice how they're wearing masks when they're collecting the dead corpses. It honestly makes me think that they're going to be turned into Titans via viral infection or something along those lines. 
>> ARTICLE
Since the titans throw up anyone they eat due   To their lack of digestive organs, wouldn't it be safe to assume that anyone in those crystallized balls might turn in to titans? That might be the solution of how there are so many even though they dont reproduce.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry man, once you are dead you are dead. It's not like they are still breathing like Eren
>> ARTICLE
Not for certain....
>> ARTICLE
The reason he looks like that is because he's been left to rot for two days. I don't know too much about diseases, but being around dozens of decomposing bodies is unsanitary enough to warrant masks and gloves, so it's pretty unlikely that it's a titan infection.
>> ARTICLE
Or it could be because 3 day old bodies smell pretty rank.
>> ARTICLE
And are great ways to spread disease too.

More fighing pls

Well, was expecting the episode to end with Rivaille showing up to save eren and co.

Was a good episode, glad they finally wrapped up that arc

So next episode is a recap followed by an episode of really bad quality. Dem purple rocks and cut scenes. What the hell is happening...

So messed up that titans regurgitate the humans they've eaten once they get full. They literally eat humans for no reason other than to kill them.

Does anyone know how long this series will last? I really hope it's gonna go like FMA:Brotherhood with like 60 episodes, the way it's pace is going that'd be great, but I have a feeling it's just gonna be 26 or something.
>> ARTICLE
the manga is going to be very long so i dont think 60eps will cover it theirs also the possibility of animating the "before the fall "novels in order to give the manga time to gain some distance on the anime one other thing if their is a second season IT MUST BE 12 EPISODES THAT WAY THE ANIME WILL NEVER CATCHUP TO THE MANGA!!
>> ARTICLE
So far they have 24 episodes only
>> ARTICLE
Marco Bott! Nooooooooooooooooo!

If episode 14 is a recap of the past 6 episodes only, it will be the best episode yet. Plus, nobody will even realize it is a recap as it will feel like a normal episode.

someone else noticed the not finished color here http://i.minus.com/jZKUmUXfu0AwI.bmp
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was just my phone being shitty.
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't realize at first that it was unfinished color. My brain just defaulted to Gainax coloring even though this is not done by said company.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone think there was some weird editing choices in this episode during the opening sequence with Jean?

Random bits of slow motion, a long shot of some scenery while you could hear action going on and that random shot of Annie's face in the middle of nowhere.

Other than that, fantastic episode. Probably the best one so far behind the episode where Titan Eren slaps the shit out of some titans.
>> ARTICLE
the production has been rushed to make it out during spring originally the production team wanted to have the series ready for fall however they where vetoed so the animation has been pressured with time constraints otherwise the entire series would be the quality of the 3dmg scene with mikasa and eren from ep 11

Damn, the curse of being too popular for your own good. I hate that money hungry execs mean that we're getting a slightly lesser version of the show.

I was really impressed with this episode. the 2 before it were really slow and I hope that they stop spending so much time re-capping stuff from previous episodes and focus on the plot progression more.

ALL I KNOW IS MY LIIIFE IS GOOOONEEE. God damn this soundtrack is amazing. OST Of the freakin year.

In the next couple of episodes something is going to go horribly wrong, think about it. The Armored titan and the colossal titan have just disappeared from the earth, one rather literally. Its only a matter of time before they show up again and Eren isn't going to be much help then as his titan form is what 15 meter class and the colossal titan is 60 meters tall! I doubt he will be able to even hurt the Armored titan either. Something big is going to happen.

I let out a breath at the end of the episode I didn't know I had been holding.

YEAH! now hes gonna take down that hippie titan, DDT his ass!!

Eren gets EATEN:

The whole show reminds me of TTGL. Monsters suppress humans into living in small, closed off spaces. After a long time the monsters break through and the humans fight back.

Well, I do personally. I remember watching episode 1 without having read the manga. I was so amazed (the music, the art, the op, the everything) that I just couldn't hold it and had to read it.

Ha. I had same thought process when I read that part of the manga. "There goes his leg." "There goes his arm." "Maybe he can get some kind of automail." Then he got eaten.

He might end up with a megaman type cannon for his arm/leg, because obviously he can't die 5 episodes into the story, unless I'm missing something and he isn't the main character.

Yeah, I think he might actually die and he wasn't really the main character after all. Watching this, he reminded me exactly of [Gurren Lagann spoiler](/s "Kamina from Gurren Lagann, how he always looked out for Simon and died in the battle sort of. I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same thing.")
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think so either, but I doubt there's gonna be any coming back for him. Maybe the story will focus on Mikasa and Armin (perhaps he mans up a bit and carries on Eren's dream or whatever.) But if that's the case, switching main characters, that's pretty interesting. But I don't know how I feel about that just yet.

We've already had it foreshadowed that Erin and most likely his sister too had a far from normal upbringing in the hands of a mad scientist. My bet is Erin is able to regenerate like the titans.

No seriously, I was ready to sit down and watch Eren go apeshit on the titans and see the graduates get some nice kills.

NO. THEY GET KILLED INSTEAD. Holy crap I was so looking forwards to seeing these people interact. Way to mess with my emotions. The last 5 minutes or so my jaw dropped and stayed that way until the credits.. Actually even after that. Holy hell.

To tell the truth we should have expected it, they showed us how fast the multiaxial gear works in the very first moments with the legion. When they come back decimated it's an immediate hint that the titans are fast moving.

Not really, the momentum of the show is amazing, bet most people forgot that he had the key and the trippy dream with the injections, chances are he has a healing factor.

It'd be a weird scene if Eren actually had some healing ability, and reformed out of a pile of steaming Titan shit.

I actually really like Jean.  He's like a realistic human put into an insane anime world - he acts and talks the way I would expect a normal human being to react given his situation.

**This freaking show, man.**

Huge Ass Titan is a total punk, showing up outta nowhere, kicking the wall, destroying the cannons, and vanishing. Misaka gets clingy, Eren is a jerk to her and gets eaten, and Armin loses his shit (appropriately so).

Not me.  I still get chills watching this scene unfold in action.  Holy crap, Armin and Eren's good bye speech... and then the fucking chomp.  Daaaaayyyyyymn! Even know what's going to happen I still can't wait for the next episode.

And watching all the little extra scenes not in the manga is great too.  I thought that scene between Eren and Jean was beautifully done to further develop their character and motivation.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa got clingy, but Eren was right to tell her to stop being selfish. She was a top graduate and has more responsibility than just trying to ensure Eren's safety. 
>> ARTICLE
You're right, and I felt like it was very good of him to say that. I wanna know more about Misaka, through - her origins, why she's seemingly devoted her whole life to Eren, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I've been trying to figure out their relationship too. Like where the hell shes from and why shes singularly devoted to him alone.
>> ARTICLE
Guess you already noticed but, in case you haven't, we will see all of that in the next episode. It won't be pretty.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa's backstory explains a lot. Definitely defines who she is.
>> ARTICLE
Man that whole interaction between Pixis and Lord Waldo, that's anime only right? I don't remember that in the manga.

Either way, it's redundant now to say how great the show is, it manages to kill it every single week. If people want to ask where the budget is, well here it is. Best episode yet.

I'm really glad they aren't trying to find away out of silencing the gore of this series, this just makes it that much better. I'm not really surprised where they ended this episode at, but waiting week after week for the next episode is *fucking brutal*. Going to redundantly call it and say that the next episode is gonna kill it.

Well in this universe, the titans defy the laws of thermodynamics, being able to regenerate tissue in mere minutes, teleporting (in fact IRL the teleportation of such a large mass would have released enough energy to vaporize everything instantly anyway) without requiring any source of energy that the humans know of.

Holy shit! Eren just had his arm and leg bitten off, and then eaten! He seemed to be doing alright against the colossal titan too.  This show is incredible for not holding back on the gore.  Glad to see that Eren's not the automatic hero, but I never anticipated this.

Also, during the initial entering of the titans, did anyone else notice that one of the titans looked like the one who killed Eren's mother? I was anticipating a confrontation there, but maybe that's for later (don't think Eren's dead quite yet since he is the MC). Maybe the injection his father gave is a titan strain which would allow him to regenerate his limbs back. It's a bit out there but that's my theory for now. 

The scenes when they were using the maneuver gear were freakin amazing too. Top notch animation throughout. 

Next week, seems like we focus on Mikasa's backstory. Should be an interesting watch and hopefully more titan fighting action. Can't wait! I'm really tempted to start reading the manga.

yes, but it's a bit unreasonable to compare a japanese shonen series to an  adult American fantasy series as they are completely different, each with its own unique style of storytelling. I am 99% sure that Eren is not dead since he is the main character in a shonen series which will follow the shonen trope of the hero MC or at least something similar. Had this been GoT, Eren would definitely be dead though

that's true, and it would definitely make the story interesting with some nice character development, but I think that the author's not going to do that. I haven't read the manga either so I guess we'll find out next week... hopefully

when was this injection scene? did i miss it?
>> ARTICLE
it was a really short flashback scene after eren escaped from his town, I think episode 2
>> ARTICLE
thanks!
>> ARTICLE
>Maybe the injection his father gave is a titan strain which would allow him to regenerate his limbs back. It's a bit out there but that's my theory for now.

This is my theory, too. The timing of the classroom flashback exposition scene explaining that titans can regenerate lost limbs in a matter of minutes, only to have Eren *lose some limbs* later in the same episode is far too coincidental for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still wondering what's in his old basement and if it will help save the humans in any way.

Eren's dad is a doctor, so I expect it to be biological research on the Titans or something, maybe a biological weapon, like anthrax.

Didn't his dad inject something into Eren?

I'm going to laugh really hard if that turns out to be a red herring.

This is the second time I see this reference being made with today's episode. I'd like to know why?

Allow me to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Attack on Titan, is in fact, Attack on Eoten, or as I've recently taken to calling it, The Eoten Onslaught. Attack on Titan is not a proper english phrase by the author, but rather a shitty translation by some editor's lackey that has no meaning in the proper english language and was probably translated by Google. The Eoten Onslaught is the proper translation fo this Manga's Title, made useful by the hardworking translators at Commie, Webster's, Oxford and the Queen's Royal Palace.

Many weeaboos users read a modified version of the Eoten Onslaught manga every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of the Eoten Onslaught which is widely read today is often called Attack on Titan, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the the Eoten Onslaught, translated by Commie.

There really is a Attack on Titan, and these people are reading it, but it is just a shitty translation they use. Attack on Titan is engrish: a japanese delinquent's attempt of speaking a language he was too stupid to understand while he was in highschool. This lackey is an essential part of an manga ecosystem, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete manga published. The lackey is normally used to get coffee or to draw backgrounds for the manga artist: the whole system is basically Attack on Eoten - a better, but not correct translation - or the Eoten Onslaught. All the so-called Attack on Titan distributions are really distributions of the Eoten Onslaught
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think it's justified to call it that, but it's justified if you actually make a Commie distribution of Attack on Titan.. If you actually make your own distribution of Attack on Titan, you get to name the thing, but calling Attack on Titan in general "The Eoten Onslaught" I think is just ridiculous.

Everyone else has already properly conveyed my feelings of holy shit-ness and OMFG, so all I really have to say is this:

1) Is it just me, or did Mikasa's face get a little less hard? By that I mean she tended to have this gloomy facial expression combined with this really hardened look in here eyes. This episode, though, it feels like her eyes got this really vulnerable, "moe" quality to them - the idea that she's the strongest recruit just feels less believable now. I hope it's a temporary thing, I was really looking forward to a badass female lead who doesn't suffer from "Chickification."

2) A note on technology - I'm surprised they haven't considered using something like grenades or fragmenting shells. They use gunpowder/guncotton, and they obviously know how to build somewhat complex ammunition based on the second intermission slide, so it's not a major leap. Use the hand-thrown grenades to blind or disable them temporarily, and then launch an assault on their necks while they're distracted.

This scene made for an amazing contrast between how the soldiers/audience expect it'll go vs. what ends up happening.

I am exhausted after watching this episode... It repeatedly crushed my hopes. Every time I thought there was just a small bit of hope left, a titan just came along and took a massive bite out of it.

I don't know how much longer I can last without resorting to reading the manga...
>> ARTICLE
I thought that Eren would be able to get up and kill a Titan even with a leg missing, but then he went and got himself eaten and lost another arm. And his squad got completely decimated besides Armin. My expectations were clearly too shonen because this show is killing EVERYBODY.

Well, Armin's not gonna last long either if he doesn't recover from the shoc and GTFO.

Ah yes, the GRR Martin effect.

That's what's fucking great about this, really.

The transition was good in the manga but it's just so awesome in the anime.  They really are doing a great job of showing how excited these guys are and then they just do a 180 as these Titans just go LOL NOPE NOMNOMNOM
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of giants, where they fuck shit up and everyone dies 
>> ARTICLE
GAMER OVER MAN... GAME FUCKING OVER !!!!!!

There are no action scenes of guys shredding titan neck. People are dying, getting eaten and shits gotten so real there is no time to think why is that titan's eyes sooo googly and stuff? We know the big muscle maniac has a thought process, we know he can evaporate from thin air, and we know with the present technology and defense set-up, humans are still losing horribly.

Besides this, we got some information about the titans themselves which was interesting, seems as if they've been sent by a god just to destroy the human race, but apart from that, the real shine of this show was not the deaths/gore and shit getting real but a flashback. Maybe memory would probably be better, Armin taking out the book with information of the real world, we see the excitement two young boys living like livestock who dream of a life where they can take in so many unknown things of their world. This scene clearly shows Erin's drive isn't solely focused on revenge for his mother and countless others, but for the basic human nature of breaking free and embracing the mysterious world past those walls.

This is of course gonna be hard now that Erin lacks a foot and an arm while only understanding what roof tile tastes like and being caught inside a giants stomach, but I digress.

Next episode seems to be focused on Mikasa, so hopefully our favorite girl becomes even better.
>> ARTICLE
FUCKING HELL GUYS.

I HAVE EXAMS HOW DO I STUDY LIKE THIS

FUUUUUUUUU
>> ARTICLE
My guess:

Titans are artificial, probably created by the church to give them more clout. 

Colossal / Armored titans specially made to keep influence in the outer colonies - less people like Armin and Eren who want to break free of the walls.

Eren's dad knew about this or figured it out, and discovered part of the process. The injection he gave Eren is part of this process, and gave him the regenerative powers of a titan (and possibly more.)

Thus, after a short delay, I expect Eren to be back up and running. This  will be covered up by Armin and possibly Mikasa as they try to understand what this means without attracting too much attention.

I'm guessing they didn't show potato girl this episode because she's a cheery person and would not have been right for the mood of this episode.

Oh how I wish people actually "got" this besides the meme reference. It is actually very clever of gg in hindsight, but only in hindsight.

Oh god gg... that's just horseshit quality.

It's a reference to a common Japanese expression that says exactly that, when translated. That's not what Eren said, but it was meant to be a nod.

It wasn't a meme, it was a clever use of a meme.

I don't see any room for discussion. This is just meme inserting. I'll wait for gg's v5 next week.

I can put up with Eoten. Shitty translation and memes not so much. Back to Commie!
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that their decision to change it to Eoten Onslaught makes their script about a 100 times longer.
>> ARTICLE
Not defending it, but it wasn't just stupdity. Really just gg waving his dick around, same as commie, just not as ubiquitously. 
>> ARTICLE
That's actually an idiomatic expression from Japan that simply has no proper translation in English. It's pretty much always the same controversy over it, whenever it shows up in an anime. It's a classic line.
>> ARTICLE
I know the classic line. The point is that that line isn't actually what Eren says. He says which is literally "I can't die at a place like this."

For comparison, Shirou's line in Fate/Stay Night is , which specifically mentions being killed.
>> ARTICLE
[Added to the list.](http://i.imgur.com/Jj53sln.jpg)

Hmm, it seemed more like a "I can't allow myself to die here" than the "I cant die" thing. "I can't allow myself to die here" seemed to fit in the dialogue a lot more

Very literally: "I can't die in a place like this", more liberally: "I can't let myself die here"

gg, who translated it as "I couldn't die even if I were killed here", were making a reference.

Isn't that something said in japanese in other animes too, "I couldn't die even if I were killed"?

In other anime they actually say that. Here, they don't, but gg decided to translate it that way anyway.

HOLY SHITTING FUCK THERE'S A TITAN AT THE GATES WHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO NOW.

**Episode 5**

3:57  Wow, they did an *awesome* job conveying a sense of momentum, scale, and speed in that encounter. I think they were going for something like how we must appear to flies, and it certainly worked  the slow but unimaginable power of the titan, the constant whiplash of the three dimensional cords... good stuff

5:07  The lone doll in the street, pretty much the required marker of an abandoned town. We lose more dolls that way...

5:48  Nooo Franz and Hannah, don't let the camera catch you solemnly swearing to protect each other! Noooo...

6:45  Goddamnit Armin. Wait in the fucking car if you have to.

9:42  This scene is pretty vintage samurai fare, right down to the holding back in order to let your lord maintain his ego. But it's executed well enough, which I guess is kind of the point of all of this  it's taking some classic shounen ideas, some classic war film ideas, some classic samurai film ideas, etc etc, and just making a well-executed riff on them with a fun core concept. Nothing wrong with that

10:30  It seems like this whole army really likes the idea of keeping their most useful soldiers in the least useful/dangerous locations. I guess according to traditional warfare, this makes sense, since highly valued skills are generally about a soldier's use as a tactical/strategic thinker or leader, and you'd rather have your grunts kill their grunts than your best be mowed down in a melee. But *here* the "best soldiers" are just the best fighters, plus the titans have no hierarchy, do not know to focus on targets of opportunity, etc... you'd think it'd be better to use the best soldiers wisely throughout the battlefield, not just have them guard the rear.

Although, considering that scene with the lord and Pixis, this could very well become a plot point, where our brave and talented recruits lead to some structural changes in their lose as slowly as possible focused military

12:21  I like that this whole episode is just Eren walking around and Kamina-ing people into shape

13:05  Holy shit he even headbutted her.

13:45  I couldn't die even if I were killed here. Well, *I'm* not above saying it. Hate to tell you, Eren  people die if they are killed

15:00  Eren just sitting politely in class, mouth agape in his silent horror face.

The pacing of this episode is pretty weird  a minute of frenetic action, titans start attacking the city, and now we've found time to introduce some new characters, run through three separate pep talks, and have a biology class flashback. Not sure about it

15:16  Why did historic guards wear wizard hats? Wait, fuck that, why don't *current* guards wear wizard hats?

16:08  Ah, I get it. I'd already read past this point, so I'd forgotten we hadn't fully established how their battles work yet. That's certainly something the show needed to do before we got into the action

16:45  And now with this fourth pep talk, along with thinking about the skill analysis from last episode, I'm actually pretty content with the work here  they're not just hitting classic scenes or buffing our impression of the leader, they're clearly indicating leadership potential. Which hopefully means this show will get pretty damn tactical about the various roles our heroes play within the squad, which I am all for

17:15  Yesss, these close cam shots are awesome. I love the sense of speed they're creating here

**And Done**

WELL SHIT. Squad crushed, main character devoured, mankind is doomed. I think I'm gonna go sit down for a while.

[](/s "Why?")
>> ARTICLE
I hear GG are pretty liberal with their adaptations, something with wich some people disapprove of (not me, I like the extra thought put into adapting beyond mere translating).


I'll take "Sasha ripped a giant fart" over anything else.
>> ARTICLE
Guess which is gg and which is Commie.

EP3:

>**A** 

>Connie: "Hey, what are you doing?? Did you just wipe your hands on me?"

>Jean: "It's the trust between people"

vs

>**B** 

>Connie: "H-Hey! What the crap? What the hell did you just wipe on my shirt?!"

>Jean: "My faith in humanity."

EP4:

>**A** 

>Eren: Ready the artillery! Four groups! Prepare for battle!

vs

>**B** 

>Eren: Fixed Cannon Maintenance Squad 4! Prepare for battle!

I know. The romaji is typesetting.
>> ARTICLE
I'm willing to put up with some more liberal interpretations of the naming conventions (Eotenas etc.) if the translation actually makes *sense*.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I knew which is which because I followed how gg needed to update to v3 for their subs because of this and how they used "fuck" a lot. So far, it seems they are fine with translations, but have firmly decided on using different names for 'titan' and the maneuver gear (I believe).
>> ARTICLE
>Multiaxial Maneuvering Gear

My brain, why gg.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was commie's translation? I know gg are using the officially licensed and translated manga for terminology and names and not the scanlation that everyone has read.
>> ARTICLE
Multiaxial Maneuvering Gear was Commie though wasn't it?
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was a great name. It is a device that uses a grapple and then propels you when you are at the end of the wire, thus allowing you to "maneuver" around any "axis" 
>> ARTICLE
It's called 3D Movement Gear in the manga, or 3DMG for short. Christ knows why they made it to that though, it's too much.
>> ARTICLE
I actually like this way better than 3D movement gear. I think that multiaxial is a better descriptor of the way it works. 
>> ARTICLE
It's also excessive.
>> ARTICLE
Too generic. It only moves in three axes, why not call it 3D?
>> ARTICLE
Technically it uses many more axes than three. The person is the point, the line is the radius, and the perpendicular line that the grapple attaches to is the axis. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Commie fucked up the terminology. But I read the manga and know how things are called, it's not as important as a better translation of the entire dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that changing the name to Eoten Onslaught makes their script about 100 times longer.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the first example, Commie seems better. Maybe a little too wordy based on the second example.
>> ARTICLE
Translating is hard. Especially when the dialogue includes a lot of antiquated or extremely formal vocabulary. Source: I tried subbing Hakuouki a long time ago. It didn't go well.
>> ARTICLE
I think editing is harder. Transforming a "meaning" into a good "line" takes some serious skills.
>> ARTICLE
So aside from Eoten and Multiaxial Mobility Gear, would you say Commie has more fluid subs that still convey an accurate meaning?

Because I can tolerate a few changes in terminology. 

PS: I feel like Commie's translations resemble the script of an English dub for the show - do you think so too?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has read the manga,

I implore you. Don't. Just don't.
>> ARTICLE
without spoilers: why not?
>> ARTICLE
**FIRST REASON:**

Only one 40ish-page chapter is released per month. I found that I've been losing interest in the fandom entirely because of just how long the waits are. The Naruto/One piece model of having one 15-18 chapter released per week contributes to a more fun waiting game, and the writing tends to be better because the author has less space to work with. The Attack on Titan manga is heavily inclined towards having a lot of useless, non-story progressing panels - which I'm sure has much to do with how long each chapter is. 

The point is, the waiting game and the fandom is better served by concise weekly releases rather than month-long waits between chapters. The community can't just talk for an entire month in between releases...the weekly model is much better for fostering an active community in my opinion.

 **SECOND REASON:**

Attack on Titan is much better as an anime than as a manga, due to the realism and high-speed mobility, 3D gear, and intense combat. Seriously, half of the entire manga is battle, which is much better handled in anime than manga. Your end experience with Attack on Titan 3-10 years down the road when the series finishes will be much better if you stick with the anime.

You aren't gonna miss anything anyway. I've never before seen an anime that stays more faithful to the manga than this one. If anything it's just outright better.

I'm not going to pick up the manga (I like the anticipation, frankly) but I'm going to take a stab and say the Titan's will turn out to be protectors of nature or something, and are killing humans because of human deconstruction and abuse of nature throughout history.   
  
So they kill humans because humans are seen as a threat to everyone/everything else around them.

And then the last minutes of this episode happen, holy fucking shit.

the last 5 minutes : DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ

My guess: Those "injections" in the dream actually happened in some form outside the dreams, which just use memories as material.

The injections are probably something directly from or derived from eotenas and will cause Jaeger to regrow the lost limbs like an eotenas would.

>> ARTICLE
The begining of a damn good show is what is happening.
>> ARTICLE
Since I see many many people saying they want to read the manga:

I myself, after episode 4, couldn't wait and just dived into the manga. (And finished it up to date that night lol.). Of course, reading before watching can detract from the experience somewhat, but I think that the story is of such quality that it'll still be great reaching all the plot points a second time around. (And the twists are frickin HUGE). Also hugely important is just how difficult it is to draw these ridiculously complicated fight scenes in manga: it simply, as a matter of media, works much better in media. Hence, I think the anime is worth watching, even with manga read, just for the quality of the fights scenes alone. And, as everyone reading this thread has probably noticed, the anime stands alone as being quite amazing already =p.

TL;DR: I would probably hold off reading the manga, for the experience, but it won't really hurt your enjoyment of the anime very much at all if you decide to read it now.

My recommendation: Read the manga, or stay the hell away from *any* comment threads.

To everyone who wants to go ahead and read the manga,

Trust me, as someone who has read it. DON'T DO IT. The manga only releases one 28-page chapter per month. Just stick with the anime, cliffhangers from hell and all. Your end experience will be much better.

>> ARTICLE
I love how this is the first anime I'm being updated with while reading the manga. This episode is probably making some want to read because of how insane the cliffhanger was at the end, so my opinion is: definitely go for it. Getting fully updated in the manga was a blast, and watching those scenes unfold through the anime episodes are great.
>> ARTICLE
I have already watched the manga. I generally don't watch anime adaption of manga since I already know what's going to happen but I decided to watch this one since I was really curious how they would adapt the events of this episode. Man I wish more series had false protagonist like that, love the shock. 
>> ARTICLE
Great episode the CG looked really smooth. Day 35, people around me are starting to convert to manga; it seems i am the only survivor. Also, was anyone else sad that Sasha was absent in this episode?  

>> ARTICLE
I already read the manga, so i'm actually in the know of whats going to happen.

But i'm really happy at how they turned this episode out! The brutality of the fights, oh man!

Really looking forward as to how they do the next part!
>> ARTICLE
Everybody understands why people run in fear from these things now, even when they're trained to kill them, right?

There's no more questions, right? :P


>> ARTICLE
Ah, so happy to see that I was spot on with my guess for how this episode was going to end. The tears and disbelief of non-manga readers is just so delicious.  
  
But on to the episode. Great execution from the source material. I kind of wish I didn't expect what was going to happen, but it just makes me eager to see how the anime adapts what comes next.  
  
Only gripe is the repeated, repeated explanations for how to kill a titan.

[NHK Imagine-nation on Attack on Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oD8q37mac0)

Awesome episode. Thoughts while trying to keep the spoiler to a minimum...

* Wow. The gore is glorious. I am slightly disappointed at the lack of chomping down the other 2 squad mates, but they gave enough details to make it hit hard.
* Timely flashbacks and original contents. As mentioned by others, part w/ John was interesting. It makes Eren less of a standard MC and more of an actual leader, imo -- this quality was somewhat lacking reading the manga, but the addition is very welcome.
* Chrtista (sp) makes another appearance here. Where's mah potato girl though?
* The pace imo is going really well. I wasn't quite expecting for the plot to be moving along this quick -- yet I think its a coherent story so far even by itself.
* How fast Eren got shot down was very well executed. Everyone's expecting him to do work and BAM! Leg's gone.

[ * Damn Mikasa is made so much more clingy/vulnerable here. You can see the doubt and indecision in her shaking eyes, you can hear it in her voice. That wasn't there in the manga (I didn't feel it anyways), part of what made Mikasa such an unique character. That added feminine touch...idk, I don't like all of that. Hopefully that gets fixed in the next episode or the one after that, when she gets to showcase her badass-ness. ](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Manga Mikasa felt plenty feminine to me, specially when she was around Eren. I think the anime is portraying the contrast of her character pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched the first 5 episodes this morning. This is incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen brutality and gore work toward the plot in such a way that this show has.   

Seeing these people killed so horrifically, by the hands of these titans who are just perpetually smiling with their big stupid ugly fucking faces...I *hate* the titans and I want them all to **die.**   


Really enjoying this show. At the end of this episode I *needed* go to read parts of the manga to find out what happened. I won't spoil anything, but I will say I'm still not sure how to feel about what I've learned. 
>> ARTICLE
As Zoidberg would say:
moar, moar, MOAR!!!

This anime is like a drug, once you start you can't quit and you want to watch the next episode as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
My speculation from what we've been shown so far is that the Titans must be some sort of weapon, assuming this world is technological and not magical. If magical, then they are the equivalent of some kind of summoned demon or monster. However, everything suggests this is more technological, so they are probably some kind of ancient doomsday weapon that has gotten loose or are being run by another group of humans across the world.
>> ARTICLE
I wish the nobleman was not such a cartoonish imbecile villain. If they showed him to be a normal guy who suddenly panics upon onslaught, it would be much better.
>> ARTICLE
This is a dream. It has to be a dream because they've just killed off the main character 0_0. Unless Eren is somehow so badass that he can cut through the Titan with one arm left. 
>> ARTICLE
I always wait for a certain fansub group, so I'm always late to the threads and discuss in /r/TrueAnime's weekly post instead.

Just as well, since these threads are supposedly full of manga spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the two main groups doing this one both released within about 10 minutes of each other. Somehow I've managed to steer clear of manga spoilers so far. Somehow.
>> ARTICLE
The only subs I can find call the colossal titan a behemoth etonea or something 
>> ARTICLE
"Eoten" (plural "eotena") is from Old English and referred to a type of man-eating giant. Grendel from the Beowulf story was an eoten. 

While it's arguably more accurate than Titan in a mythological sense, approximately nobody should know that word, so it's not a useful translation. The literal translation of "Kyojin" is "Giant", which would have worked just fine for everyone involved.
>> ARTICLE
But *how* would do we know that Giants are big? For all we know they might be normal sized.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, probably related to the word "ettin."
>> ARTICLE
Quick theory a friend suggested. What if the Colossal Titan's appearance is something or someone transforming into it? What if it's Eren's father? Also, the fact that Titan's don't need sustenance, but still attack in a coordinated way (Colossal kicks down outer wall, Armored Titan barrels through inner wall), and still eat humans is indicative of some intelligent being pulling the strings. My guess, Eren's Father, we haven't seen him since episode 1 and we still don't know what the hell is in the basement.

My poor heart can't take anymore of this show. T_T

All I can say is until fully confirmed I'm assuming Aren is still alive. My hope is next episode either he or someone else cuts him out of the Titan's belly. Then he'd get cool prosthetics. Also, random, but what happened to potatoe girl? No show for the whole episode.

My reasoning behind refusing to believe that Eren is dead is that they wouldn't want to redo the opening just five episodes in. So far, this reasoning has failed me on all other occasions.

[Shingeki No Kyojin Spoiler](/s "When he got eaten by that Titan....my first thought was 'This is not the last we will see of Eren' it's just a hunch considering i haven't read the manga but from some rumors i heard. He shouldn't be dead") Can't wait for the next episode though. Episode 5 was sooooo intense. 
>> ARTICLE
So, What I am getting from this anime is that the titans are some kind of war machine. The foreshadowing with the outside world, making it seem like these titans are some kind of war machine destroying a nation.

that was way too much like a league of legends game

one person gets caught, the another makes the call to start fighting on his own, whole team forced to join the fight, everyone dies

that being said, great episode. i'm curious to see how eren makes it out alive from this

i think we all knew that the titans weren't going to be easy to take down. after all, almost all the equipment had been present from day 1 (maybe they have better cannons now, but that's about it) and most people got utterly slaughtered by the titans. eren was just hyping himself up way too much.

i didn't think he'd go in a full on suicide rush though

Surprisingly, even after a hundred years of experience, the soldiers are really stupid and useless. Blindly jumping out to a battlefield, not knowing about the ability's of the enemy and letting them self catches so easily, while attacking the titans head on individually...it's as if they were just trained to get eaten.

Not only have they a crucial lack of tactic and knowledge, but even a complete lack of useful tools. I would thing they just use some bombs to kill the titans neck from a distance, or at least blind him for a while. Or the could use simply poison, as greedy as the titans eat everything humans right on the spot...

But no, simply rushing out, getting killed, and following up to the next generation of flying food...
>> ARTICLE
1.  They didn't know about the jumping titan. 

2. They are the new batch of newbies so don't expect experienced thinking when someone else made a bad mistake 
>> ARTICLE
They haven't had 100 years of experience since they have been safe from titans for 100 years. The only ones who have had a large amount of experience fighting titans and are the best at it are the Recon Corps, who have been going outside the safety of the wall and fighting titans to the death. However, the Colossal titan attacked after the Recon Corps. left, thus depriving the human forces of their best and most experienced soldiers.

Carrying bombs would add weight for simply a distraction. Their main advantage over the titans is mobility, an experienced soldier can easily manuever around a titan and kill it with no need of a distraction, as you'll see later. Plus the cannons are the main uses of gunpowder and wasting gunpowder in this resource limited nation for simple distractions would be a waste. Plus, the only thing you can use to cause severe enough damage is those specialized swords due to the titans hard skin, and even those dull pretty easily hence all the replacement blades  they carry, and giant cannons. 

Have you seen the Titans weird biology? Who knows what poisons works against them, or if any do. They may look lie people, but their biology is different. They can survive without eating and can instantly regenerate damage not done to the back of their necks. We have no idea what could be used against them.It's not like we've been capturing live subjects to do experiments on. Everything we've discovered is through direct combat outside the wall. Plus, they eat nothing but humans. What, should we leave poison people in their paths? They don't eat dead people, just living ones. Who would risk their lives for that.

Plus, they were all rookies, and the one they looked to as a leader was a brash and reckless idiot so they followed him to their death. It happens a lot.

also, the abnormal titan hit the church with Thomas halfway in his mouth, one would think Thomas would've been dead already.
other than that: shieeeeeeet.
>> ARTICLE
This is how I feel after watching this episode.
http://i.imgur.com/jMgJg1V.gif
>> ARTICLE
The writing in this show is so, so bad. Between the horrendous, overreacting MC and the horrible side characters (GRR, I'M A BAD GUY LORD I DON'T CARE ABOUT PEASANTS MWAHAHA) and the *ridiculous* melodrama (The Mikasa turn at the end jesus christ my sides.) this is probably the let down of the season.

The manga isn't nearly as bad about this kind of stuff either, the plot for this story is * fairly* solid, but the adaptation is taking the worst elements of this thing and putting them to the forefront. I have a feeling it's just really shitty direction, and looking at this dudes record, it's no surprise.

EDIT: Also, I get the feeling i'm a little jaded here, I know where the plot is going, so that factor of the anime doesn't do anything for me, it's kind of a background thing while I watch the on screen reactions to what's happening. So, I'm seeing a lot of people reacting to what is happening, but not how, why, and the way in which it's happening. (The two former aren't really too off, it's the later i'm looking at.) So, I think that's why all of this is coming off as so damned mediocre so far, the plot is still there as I remember it, but the characters that are being fleshed out suck. But iunno, maybe it's too late to call anything, we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
I won't ask why it's mediocre because I know I'll only find big discrepancies on what works for you and what works for me. But,

>So, I'm seeing a lot of people reacting to what is happening, but not how, why, and the way in which it's happening.

Is people wrong about their reactions? Would you expand on this?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, that's a good question. Now, with stuff like this, I'm not one hundred percent you can be *wrong* about your entire approach to it, but I'm finding the approach a lot of people are taking is not the one I think is really important for I think constitutes a good anime.

Flipping through the comments, I'm seeing a lot of reactions to the big reveal, of course, it's a big deal, but I've yet to see anybody look at the bad aspects. Like the stuff I mentioned, melodrama can be aight, but it's becoming so consistent it's turning just plain funny, and definitely not endearing to a series that takes itself waaaaay too seriously. (For the most part.)

But I think it comes from the genre, of course people aren't going to dig heavily into character motivation and realistic characters from a series about giant monsters and spiderman sword Just Cause 3 belt things, but not seeing *anything* about it is really disheartening. Maybe people are just riding a hype train and who says anything against it gets buried, or maybe I just have an opinion that not many people share. Either way, just about everything surrounding this series has been letting me down in one way or the other. At least I still have Gargantia.
>> ARTICLE
It's just that the bad things you mention are there in the manga. I recognize that the anime original Lord was over the top, but that scene worked great to introduce Pixis early. In the manga, his introduction felt too fucking convenient and is part of the convoluted narration. Just remember where the flashback of the injection took place in the manga.

Then, melodrama?

>[ridiculous melodrama (The Mikasa turn at the end jesus christ my sides.)](http://i.imgur.com/LRaGzjO.png)

You even have those *wooooshhhh* JoJo-esque onomatopoeia for added effect. 

>The manga isn't nearly as bad about this kind of stuff either

Think again man. The manga is melodramatic as fuck, and the anime rides on that aspect of it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god you're right, I think my mind is filling in blanks. Maybe there's something about the way manga is laid out that makes it less obvious, but that's still pretty bad.

But Pixis had a wonderful introduction in the manga, the whole wall thing works way better then the stupid lord bullshit.

Eh as a long time anime fan, anime is anime and the ending to episode 5 isn't something completely shocking since Iv'e seen this before. It took me by surprise yes but I'm not shocked by the gore or what happened probably because I believe he'll come back somehow. Even if he doesn't and Mikasa becomes main character that's a win-win for me because Mikasa is the best character in the show thus far next to potato girl Sasha, and the blonde female who knocked Eren on his ass who I can't remember at the moment in name.

I really disliked episode 1 & 2 actually, glad I stuck around but when I first seen the titans I thought they looked like fucking godzilla sized naked japanese men, aka stupid. The only ones I thought looked awesome and threatening was obviously the one who towered above the wall and kicked it in, and the armored titans. Now the regular titans look a little better or maybe I'm just used to them but still dumb. Plus just many other little nitpicks.

I just wonder which one is scarier

eaten by those big awesome looking titans, or got your body chopped in half by those seemingly cannon fodders that still dominates your every moves.

Oh god its SAO all over again.

While I agree and really hope thats the limit to the Deus Ex Machina's I think this has more going for it because of the distinct lack of major fanservice.

I got chills when Levi asked everyone if they could kill Eren. I mean, the Survey Corps were in that room, and they didn't say anything. Damn.

To be fair the Survey Corps aren't any stronger then regular soldiers really... As you can see at the beginning of the season they get slaughtered by the Titans just as easily as anyone else.
>> ARTICLE
Scouting Legion are elite as fuck. Still they are human so they can die but the main difference between the Scouting Legion Soldiers and the Military Police/Garrison is they have balls. Everyone in the Scouting Legion seems to accept their death without much hesitation except [Manga ch 35 Spoilers](/s "Mike Zakarius")

>> ARTICLE
2/3rds of the soldiers don't see actual combat (Unless a wall is being breached, and even then, 1/3rd doesnt).

Scouting Legion sees combat quite often, and they've trained so many different tactics for titan combat
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the MP accounts for 1/3 of the soldiers, as only the top 10 cadets can join.
>> ARTICLE
The survey corps are the most experienced and brave soldiers of all 3 branches. The reason why they take so many losses is because there are no buildings to escape from titans. When they're outside the walls they can only use their horses and lure titans into areas with large trees. The MP are probably the weakest though as they don't do much beyond the innermost walls. 
>> ARTICLE
The beginning of the season was what was depicted 5+ years ago, wasn't it? Before the titans broke through wall Maria, and everyone thought the survey corps was a waste of food. The current survey corps is a lot stronger.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think so... the Corps has been around for a long time before the first episode and never manage to really accomplish anything other than get themselves killed. And in the years sense Wall Maria fell it doesn't seem like they've managed to do much... Yes some of the Leaders are pretty strong but...
>> ARTICLE
What I mean is, the Survey Corps back before the Titans started attacking again had no motivation to be strong. Someone like Levi or Eren ("I want to kill all the titans everywhere!") would not exist if not for the horrific events of the first titan invasion.
>> ARTICLE
but wasn't Levi in the survey corps before the invasion?
>> ARTICLE
Eren's 15 currently, and I'd estimate Levi to be about ~3 years older than Eren. The wiki says that "they spent approximately four years in training", about a year after year 845. This means that Eren was about 10 when wall Maria was attacked, which makes Levi about 13. Even if Levi was some kind of prodigy, he still would've been physically underdeveloped and thus unfit for any type of Survey Corps mission. Using this evidence I don't think Levi was in the Survey Corps before the invasion.
>> ARTICLE
Levi's age is generally assumed to be in his twenties, despite his small stature. [Manga Spoilers](/s "It was said by Hanji that he was a widely feared criminal before being recruited into the military, which was even before the attack on Wall Maria.")
>> ARTICLE
Oooh, my mistake. Thanks for the correction!
>> ARTICLE
Don't you mean the Recon Corps?
>> ARTICLE
The name varies a bit from translation to translation.
>> ARTICLE
it's because it was all an act by the Survey Corps. So of course they wouldn't be saying anything.
>> ARTICLE
I liked how Eren stuck up for Mikasa 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, one of my least favorite parts of the series was how mad he got at her when she said they were family
>> ARTICLE
Whenever Eren yells at Mikasa, I just get the feeling that he's being an enormous douche. 

Yeah, sure, go ahead and yell at the person who's saved your butt countless times, is easily many times more powerful than you are, and has never left your side no matter how deep in shit you were in. 

Yeah, go ahead and tell the person who grew up by your side, is prepared to turn against the world to side with you and still trusts you even after seeing you turn into an abomination that you don't even consider her to be family.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but Mikasa is way too reckless at times, and puts other in risk unnecessarily. For all I know, if it wasn't for Armin, they would all be dead, by now. He is much more cold headed than her, thus much better at making decisions. On a side note, I love the sequence in the new opening that hints at this quality or Armin.
>> ARTICLE
I actually don't think that he said she wasn't family because he wanted to be mean, but because when his mother died(and later when his father presumably left) he resolved to becoming strong enough to take care of himself and wipe out all the titans on his own. So every time Mikasa saves/helps him, he is reminded of how he still needs the help of others(which is just natural, but he's got this idea that he has to be strong enough to shoulder it all alone). Because part of what caused this sentiment is that his family is gone, conceding that he still has a fimily member left would stand in the way of his quest for revenge(technically he is dragging her into becoming a soldier, because he knows she'll follow him, and he already didn't like it when she and Armin told him the'd follow him into the Scouting Legion). Additionally, he doesn't want her to put herself in Harm's way; in the specific situation defending him would obviously be a way more dangerous mission than luring titans away.

So I think that he's just being dishonest with himself and trying to rationalize making revenge his one goal in life when there are in fact still things from his old life remaining(like his adoptive sister). He's obviously also kinda brash and doesn't always think before he speaks(and generally has a problem communicating his thoughts/feelings in an appropriate manner). Actually not that surprising when you consider that he's technically a traumatized teenager....
>> ARTICLE
I think he said they weren't family because he wants to bang her, simple enough

so do i it was my favorite scene in the episode

[deleted]

I hope he's gonna die... No one can possibly survive long with Mikasa THAT pissed off. And you know what? Ill probably cheer if Levi dies in a terrible and painful way. I hate that guy almost as much as I hate Joffery now...
>> ARTICLE
What why? Levi saved Eren's life.....
>> ARTICLE
I just don't like him as a person. His mannerisms and attitude just make me angry. I would have preferred a scene where Eren breaks the chains in anger when they accuse Mikasa and gets himself shot by the MilPol, but shrugs the round off and proves his loyalty by maintaining his proper military bearing (sort of like Armin at the Wall) and salutes the supreme commander through the gun-smoke. But maybe that just me wanting my characters with god-like powers to be represented as such personality wise. Really i feel it wouldn't be off from Eren personality as written so far and it removes a character i hate from the equation. But that's just my opinion.

Idk, that doesn't really fit Attack on Titan though. Nobody is a "godlike" character in the show. It's part of what makes it so interesting. Humanity is desperate and weak. It's not like Naruto where Eren just goes ham and rapes everyone because he gets mad. The people in that show are weak. 
>> ARTICLE
If being able to heal hyper quick and being able to turn into a 50 ft tall walking killing machine that is near indestuctable is NOT a god like superpower I have no idea what is...
>> ARTICLE
But he can still be killed by them. And the healing isn't instant. He's stronger than the rest, but isn't overpowered by any means. 
>> ARTICLE
If he is stronger than the rest not by talent or training but by forcefully gained superpowers, why isn't that called overpowered?
>> ARTICLE
Because he's not powerful to the point he can just dominate everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
At this point nobody can rival him. So yes, for the time being he is overpowered and dominates everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Because he can be... *overpowered*?
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. I only watched the anime but I don't like him already.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing: Levi is better than Mikasa, the only one, it seems. Levi would beat Mikasa in a fight, any day (at least, as far as we are in the story).
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only one who thinks Eren actually deserved his beating. Levi is the only "character" I've liked.
>> ARTICLE
I think Levi would kick Mikasas ass if he wanted to.
>> ARTICLE
Did you miss the part where he saved Eren's ass from capital punishment by punching him  in the face?

Yeah...he is arrogant,  and not necessarily a good guy, but he hasn't done anything morally wrong so far in the anime. Wanting him to die is kind of...extreme.
>> ARTICLE
But... but... Levi is **AWESOME**.
>> ARTICLE
He had the balls to save erens life. If he would not do that eren would by dead by now. He's a hero humanity needs not the one humanity deserves.
>> ARTICLE
Before I saw him in the anime, I always thought he would end up being a total douche based on all the manga art and fanart and such. But he seems to have turned out to be a pretty cool guy. I was surprised when he comforted a dying comrade during his debut in the anime. 


I mean at least he's chaotic good compared to Joffrery's lawful? evil. Sorry for the DnD alignments, only way I could describe it. 
>> ARTICLE
Joffery is more Neutral Evil in my opinion as we wavers between Chaotic and Lawful. And I can agree that Levi is a kind of Chaotic Good. Still don't like the guy but that's more of a personal opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see how he can be unlikable.
>> ARTICLE
Jean? Stop posting here!
>> ARTICLE
Hu? Who's Jean?
>> ARTICLE
I honestly think for characters like Levi and Joffery you have to look at them in a different way. I can't say much for Levi yet because I don't have any back story on him, but when you look into the character of Joffery you really see him in a different light. Which is why he was one of my favourite characters in GoT.
>> ARTICLE
no one is as bad as joffrey not even levis arrogant ass what did you think of the scene where eren pleads for mikasas life i loved it and the scene also shows eren didnt intentional attack mikasa in titan form he really does care for her 
>> ARTICLE
I loved that scene too! (up until the beatings but i just get annoyed whenever Levi is on screen, i REALLY don't like him) It will be interesting to see how the anime handled the development of the relationship between Eren and Mikasa. I really like them and hope the writers of both manga and the anime continue to evolve that particular sub-plot.
>> ARTICLE
it was the first time Eren actually spoke with goodwill for Mikasa in a loong time. was rather relieved he consciously cares for her given his recent human/titan behaviour
>> ARTICLE
i know its one of his character flaws he doesnt realize how good he has it with mikasa and armin 
>> ARTICLE
upvoted not because I agree, but because that is an opinion I never expected to read.
>> ARTICLE
You got balls for saying that... everyone in this thread seems to have an interest for Levi..the odds are not in your favor.
>> ARTICLE
I stand by my decision and am prepared for the consequences! 
>> ARTICLE
Levi's a better fighter than Mikasa.
>> ARTICLE
Plot armor is best defense against a superior opponent lol Mikasa is one the 3 main characters and so is functionally immortal and unbeatable.
>> ARTICLE
In this show. Does this really seem like a show that plays nice with *any* of its characters?
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to play nice. She could be getting her ass handed to her but all plot armor does is guarantee that she wins in the end. Maybe Levi goes in for a killing blow and she manages to get her blade up at the last minute to impale him. idk. Plot armor doesn't mean she wins hands down or easily just that she will eventually win.
>> ARTICLE
You are not a true anime fan if you have NEVER seen an anime where a good guy dies or a bad guy wins. Or at least where it fakes it for long enough that you think they died.


>> ARTICLE
Because true anime fans have to see that. If you haven't and you considered yourself an anime fan, NOPE YOU'RE WRONG.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for explaining it. Although unless you needed it, i think we all understood it with my explanation

>> ARTICLE
I was being sarcastic. You're an anime fan if you like anime. There's no "true" anime fan. An anime fan is an anime fan.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I mean, Eren for all it's worth lost two limbs, then was eaten. Still comes back, fully intact + titan powers. Plot armour still seems to be holding strong. 
>> ARTICLE
eren also lost a tooth this episode and it grew back shortly after. it's not just plot armor that's causing the regen but DNA manip.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can see a scenario where Mikasa is sacrificed to force a change in Erin for sake of the plot.
>> ARTICLE
im dropping the manga the instant it happens also its been foreshadowed mikasa will have children by her mother during her flashback 
>> ARTICLE
Tch, man. If they fridge Mikasa I'll be so pissed.
>> ARTICLE
That's a fallacy though. The main characters seem to be doing pretty well. How many close training buddies have died?
>> ARTICLE
Idk why honestly. In the anime at least, he's portrayed as a fairly decent person. His ways might be different than most, but in a time where the entirety of humanity is at stake, you need to do drastic things. He allowed that one guy to die in peace, and he may have kicked Eren's ass just now, but it seems like he did it to prevent Eren from getting executed. 
>> ARTICLE
Woah, woah, what? Joffrey? As in Lannister? Nope, does not compute. Nobody is near Joffrey levels of shittiness (unless you're a Frey).

Or a *Snow*. It's that black bastard blood.

You're the first person I've heard say that. Most of us, myself included, think Levi is one badass motherfucker.

I won't say that he isn't a badass. Doesn't mean I still don't have a deep loathing for the psycho little bastard.
>> ARTICLE
Have you read the manga or are you saying that from the anime impressions? o.o
>> ARTICLE
both. I never liked his character. Everything about him just rubs me the wrong way.  I'm sorry but I just REALLY hate him.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've spoken to a couple that thinks that way. They said it reminded the worst aspects of their drill sergeant or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Based on only anime, I have the same opinion.

>> ARTICLE
He did it for one reason and one reason only: to get Eren out of the hands of the Military Police. He had to prove he would kill Eren if he ever became a threat.

He's not wrong, he's just an asshole.

As someone that's read the manga and knows what's going on, I'd like to shoot him down if he tried to spoil it for me

It's really a shame that such a good series can be ruined by a few spoilers.  Scums like that deserve some real karma heading his/her way.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently banning all of his accounts isn't enough. Let me get an admin.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a way to IP ban someone? I really couldn't care less about the spoilers but I'd hate to see some jerk ruin a good show for all the others.
>> ARTICLE
Mods can't do that unfortunately
>> ARTICLE
Of course not, I mean from the admins.

Though even if they could, I doubt they'd ban the person just because of this.  Thanks for doing a good job keeping the trolls away from /r/anime though, you mods rock.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! The entire series was just ruined for me ;_;
What did I do to deserve this?
>> ARTICLE
At least now you can go enjoy the manga? May as well make the most of it. ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, you can still enjoy series knowing what happens in the future.  You can see how it gets to that point, the cool fights, intense arguments, and seeing them learn what you know already is half as fun :)

I already got spoiled (I kinda did it myself) but I honestly don't mind, I'm still pumped as hell for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I've already been deleting his comments in the thread. The same spoilers have been posted 4 times.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, damn trolls. Well, thanks again for being a great mod. I don't want anyone else's day ruined. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for baring with me. I'm the only one on right now. Apologies for being spoiled. :/

I got one from /u/plorked, who is probably one of his alts given the account creation date, with the title "just a question". It wasn't a question, it was SnK spoilers. Please ban his ass too, he seriously messed up my day.

(I can take a screenshot if necessary.)

I already banned that account and it's all I can do at this point.

Good to hear. Thanks for all your hard work! We all appreciate it.
>> ARTICLE
He just made another account, /u/halloth2
>> ARTICLE
Kill it, kill it with fire.
>> ARTICLE
no, you need to cut the back of his neck!
>> ARTICLE
Tell the mod, he keeps regenerating.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the court scenes in the manga because they gave more insight on what is going on inside of Wall Shina. For me it seems, the people inside of Wall Shina are living in a distorted world were the public opinions are created by the mass media, in this case newspaper and pamphlets. As I guessed they live as good as insulated, cut off from the rest of the walls. That is why they are afraid of everything.  
Eren's monologue was kind off more detailed in the manga but it got the main points through and calls the MP what they really are: Cowards.  
I always love how Mikasa enters "Yandere-Mode" where she wants to kill everyone off who tries to harm Eren.  
Overall a great episode and a great prologue to the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
shes not a traditional yandere!! my favorite scene in the trial was erens conviction to save mikasa from being killed!! 
>> ARTICLE
Aah i can already smell the S&M fanfic's of this episode between Levi and Eren "Do you resent me for punishing you?" "N...no Ssir" "Good dog" 
>> ARTICLE
i know he's not the type to say this but:

Rivaille: "I-I-..It's not like I wanted to s-s-..smack you senseless! baka!"
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, "already?" Fangirls were on that shit waaaaay ahead of this ep, especially since the 3D gear lightly resembles bondage ties.
>> ARTICLE
"I understand that the new swimming anime has underlying yaoi themes, but so does ours but with THIGH BONDAGE."
>> ARTICLE
It's an exciting season for the fangirls. Eye candy as far as the eyes can see.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, Levi is a sadistic bastard... and I love it.  All the Recon Corps squad leaders are weird as hell, yet really awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if he's "sadistic", but he certainly enjoys being on the upper hand.

Also, I don't read the manga, but the dialogue at the end of the episode feels like Levi had an alternate agenda then just using him for his squad; he actually wanted to save his life.
>> ARTICLE
This is late, but I died when the girl with glasses(I can't remember her name right now) just flung herself at the bars of his cell. He must be like a dream come true for her. 
>> ARTICLE
For future reference, Hanji Zoe.
>> ARTICLE
Levi did what he had to do in order to keep Eren alive. I think he wanted to show the military police that he and his squad is capable of being able to keep Eren and the entire situation under control. If Eren had shut his face, the assault probably wouldn't have been necessary.
>> ARTICLE
I think Levi was waiting for a reason to do this, because firstly, it means Eren will **never** question his authority, secondly, shows that Eren isn't on the precipice of blowing the fuck up and killing everyone since if he wanted to, he could have broken the chains, titan'd up and then started to fuck shit up. Lastly, shows everyone in the room, who holds Eren's leash, so to speak. 
>> ARTICLE
Levi and Zoe were awesome in this episode! I love Levi.
>> ARTICLE
I really feel like I need to point out Zoe is Edward from FMA, but probably nobody cares.  Yay Paku Romi!
>> ARTICLE
nice call. Rivaille's character reminds me of Wrath from FMA.

not because of VAs though. on that front.. he didn't sound Araragi-like at all in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
...I thought she sounded familiar...
>> ARTICLE
No love for the smooth Irwin?
>> ARTICLE
Well he's seemingly normal, no one loves the normies... now let's talk about Zoe :3
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the brutal treatment was mostly done to prevent Eren's execution. As someone above mentioned, it was to show he can control Eren in both his human form and titan form. 
>> ARTICLE
the only person that could've screwed up during the trial was Mikasa. giving into her emotions would've been fatal for their case and luckily Armin was there to pick it up before she made a scene. i think Eren got the gist of it pretty quickly.. he was just surprised.
>> ARTICLE
And probably also to show that he won't treat him as an equal, but as a tool to be used for humanity, to appease the conservatives and the military police("bla blah I believe in training **dogs** with violence").
>> ARTICLE
Also to show the judge that Eren can control himself. Taking that kind of beating and  not turning in a Titan & killing everyone says a lot about who he is.

Though due to the grand and glorious power of plot armor I REALLY doubt Levi could kill Eren. ever.
>> ARTICLE
He COULD, but that won't ever actually HAPPEN due to the armor.
>> ARTICLE
Levi could kill Eren at anytime. That's the whole point of the scene. Even though Eren can't die for the sake of the story, he is by no means the strongest character.
>> ARTICLE
nah, he would trip on plot and impale himself or something. lol
>> ARTICLE
Well, to me he seems like he plays a vital role towards the end of the story, but I wouldn't doubt he dies at the end (the strongest always die at the end)
>> ARTICLE
One slice to the nape, done. Easy

Plot armor is harder than adamantium.
>> ARTICLE
Dude seriously? I've seen like four of your posts on this thread and they all deal with plot armor.
>> ARTICLE
You have to stop viewing everything as an outsider. In their world, it's quite likely that Levi is skilled enough to kill Eren. Just because he's the main character and that probably *won't* happen doesn't mean it isn't believable in the context of the story.

To the other characters, it's *not* a story and Eren is *not* the main character.

Wait, what? That was a joke, I've only watched the anime.

I'll delete the comment. I honestly had no idea that I was correct.

Damn that was actually true? I only came here to see the screenshots, and now my day is ruined :(
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. I'm assuming it was either true or dangerously close, judging from that response and the amount of downvotes I got.

Don't worry about it though; I don't know any more than you do. Just don't sweat it.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I haven't read the manga but someone already spoiled something like that happening for me, it's really a bummer and I don't want it to happen to anyone else. Although I don't think you're completely right about that but it's close, I think?
>> ARTICLE
I accidentally spoiled some of the twists for myself while trying to find out who Levi was after someone mentioned him before I got to his introduction. :(
>> ARTICLE
Yah, it happens. Still sucks though.
>> ARTICLE
My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to look it up: it isn't true. lordgiza thought it was a spoiler, probably because of my odd phrasing, but it isn't.
>> ARTICLE
I really like the new OP animation in combination with the new music. The faded headshots for everyone is quite beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
The OP sounded too... happy and march-ish in my opinion. The ED however is really good. I find it a lot better than the 1st ED.
>> ARTICLE
The OP animation is really good, much better than the first one.  The song, not so much, but hopefully it'll grow on us.

ED is great too, just this time the imagery is not as fitting as Mikasa's from last time.  Ah well, can't have everything.  Really excited to see the next arc especially coming from the OP...
>> ARTICLE
When the beginning of the OP came on I legit said to myself, "What Dafaq is this!" But it got better after the intro of the song
>> ARTICLE
The ED is pretty good as well. 
>> ARTICLE
The only problem I have is [this](http://i.imgur.com/yDIcPrt.jpg) does not match up with [this](http://i.imgur.com/T1bk1gg.jpg) even remotely, but it's truly a nitpick.
>> ARTICLE
Dude Eren is a scrawny little dude.
>> ARTICLE
Levi's even scrawnier.
>> ARTICLE
but he isn't. He 5' 3" and weights 143 pounds. He's considered Overweight on the BMI calculator and it's pure muscle. He's just really short.
>> ARTICLE
You son of a bitch, I'll never be able to unsee that.
>> ARTICLE
15 years old? The hell? I will never understand anime ages.
>> ARTICLE
Shinji, Kamina and Eren are all within 1 year of each other's age. 
>> ARTICLE
No Kamina is 17-19 and shinji is 14.
>> ARTICLE
Always add +5 years to any characters you encounter. 
>> ARTICLE
The new OP probably won't top the old one in terms of hype but it's still pretty good. 

People seem to miss one thing this show really focuses on: The fact that human feelings are realistic and actually exist. This isn't some superhero anime where everyone is fearless and let's go on killing sprees etc., there are actual aspects that have to be considered. 
Fear of the unknown, in this case the stability of Eren's titan form is completely logical, especially to those who haven't witnessed it in action.

I love Levi. He's been one of the better developed characters even though he hasn't gotten too much screen time or dialogue. The show has definitely picked up strong considering a few episodes back it was lacking in many aspects.

I return to the old feeling of looking forward to the next episode on the edge of my fancy spinning leather chair.

EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK THERE IS A USER /u/HALLOTH WHO JUST FUCKING PM'D ME A BUNCH OF SPOILERS WHAT THE FUCK WHY
>> ARTICLE
I liked the OP much much better this time.  Titans don't bleed right so Armin was covered in human blood?  
>> ARTICLE
Titans bleed. See when Eren-titan first saves' Mikasa. And I thought that was Eren?
>> ARTICLE
I was guessing Armin.  Ok well it was still my favorite part of the opening.
>> ARTICLE
I was guessing as well, though I thought the explosion afterwards was that of a transformation, which is why I think it's Eren. And it is a great shot. 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, you're name even gets me in a non-LoL related sub-reddit.
>> ARTICLE
This is why you RES tag him as NOT DYRUS in all caps so there is never any confusion.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, some dickfuck called HALLOTH just pm'ed me a bunch of spoilers. And I read it. You fucking asshole, there's a spot in hell for you. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn Levi does not fuck about. I can see him becoming one of my favorite characters even though he beat Eren. I can't wait to see the Survey Corp in action. 

Also, I find it interesting that Eren can [Ep14] (/s "regenerate without turning into a titan"). That could be useful, so hopefully they make it to the basement asap. God I want to read the manga, I can't wait to see what happens. 
>> ARTICLE
If you want them to get quickly to the basement so you know what's inside... just know that reading the manga won't help you. 

Just stick with the anime for now. Believe me, this season surpasses the first one in every way possible.
>> ARTICLE
what if in the next episode it opened with her saying "oh wait there's the missing tooth"
>> ARTICLE
It's probably only minor things like what was shown that can do that without going titan 
>> ARTICLE
I bet he never gets hangnails.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, lucky bastard! 
>> ARTICLE
When he lost his tooth he was already steaming like he was going to transform 
>> ARTICLE
I believe Eren mentions.. (correct me if I'm mistaken) that even the Priest (religion) shows up to the court as well. It is also stated that **FIVE** years ago the Church had no power/ or saying. AND NOW, for reasons most likely connected to the Walls destruction, as well as the fear of the Titans, religion has gone up in the social ladder of the society. One theory in the past threads hypothesized that the Church (religion) had a dominance in the whole estate. And was believed to be a possible cause of the Titans. But now that it has been cut out, there are much more variables in place and far less constants to determine a reasonable conjuncture. We are being feed much more than is explained, we do not understand much of society beyond the Military (presently) nor past incidents/experiments/etc with the Titans. Only that they showed up and 500 yrs later here we are. From last season it will only be descending up hill from here, as I fear the complexity of the show will only continue to rise.  
>> ARTICLE
Iirc the titans first appearance was 100 yrs ago. The only thing I'm questioning is how they managed to erect the walls quickly enough, I mean look at the size, it's massive.
>> ARTICLE
the walls where already their however their is a very interesting secret behind the walls construction which is answered much later in the series 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I know that, I'm up to date with the manga
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Not me. When he started liquefying Eren with his foot, I was like "WTF Levi?!??" but I caught on to what they were doing soon after.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he just defused the palpable fear in the room. Eren was starting to scare everyone, and Levi had to show that Eren wasn't *as dangerous as everyone thought*, so that he can be turned over to the survey corps.
>> ARTICLE
I saw it at the ending of 13.5.
>> ARTICLE
Don't hurt me, but I actually think I liked both the second opening and ending better than than first OP/ED, in terms of the overall package (Guren no Yumiya is probably the better song, but I loved the visuals of the OP and the style of the ED. I mean, raining blood? Armin pulling an Eren-face? Hell yes). 


>> ARTICLE
You're not alone here. I also preferred the second OP/ED
>> ARTICLE
Dude, the new chorus trumps the first OP by miles. It's the perfect theme song for the scouting legion
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, this new OP serves as an hymn to the scouts, while the first has just a bunch of action sequences sequenced.

This is the perfect OP for this season ;)

After "self defense shows a fundamental lack of humanity" I expected Eren to go "What would be human then? To roll over and die?". That would've fit great with the whole vibe of the trial.

I wanted Mikasa to go rambo and kill everyone when Levi started to kick Eren.
>> ARTICLE
As cool as Mikasa is, I think she'd still get whooped by Levi though. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, the show has spent the whole time building Mikasa as unstoppable.
>> ARTICLE
5yrs experience in the recon squad vs 1 day as a soldier even with mikasas amazing skills shes not ready for that yet 
>> ARTICLE
you underestimate the powers of Plot armor.
>> ARTICLE
How many times have you mentioned plot armor in this thread?
>> ARTICLE
plot no jutsu, plot-kai and plot plot no mi
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I would say we haven't even seen the best of Levi yet.
>> ARTICLE
Levi was brutal. Looks like the producers aren't going to tone down the gore and blood as much as before seeing how much of a hit it is I assume. I'm all for it anyhow, it enhances the viewing experience.
>> ARTICLE
I initially liked Levi. Thought he was an awesome character, especially when he was comforting his dying comrade. However, when he was beating on Eren I slowly started to hate him. But when I realized what he was doing I was like "Levi, you son of gun...."
>> ARTICLE
Im surprised I'm starting to like Armin as much as I am.
I really hated him at first and now he's starting to become a little more of a doer and a little less of a philosopher. 

Now if only he could conjure up another emotion other than freaked the fuck out.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that no one has mentioned it yet, but this episode has finally introduced a new element: religion. (I don't remember it being called Wallism in the manga, but apparently that's what these subs say)

And Levi-tan demonstrates why he's my favorite character. Things are starting to pick up, and hopefully they continue at a good pace.
>> ARTICLE
> Wallism

*facepalm*

Let me guess, Commie?


>> ARTICLE
It's not new - the very first episode shows someone preaching about it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes but as Eren said, at this time, they had no power.

Current Humans killed by Titans: **96** deaths, **21** additional deaths possible.  

Suicide count: **1**  

Nothing much happened, gave a badassery point (pixis point) to both Eren and Levi. Eren for making people crap themselves and Levi for just being a stone-cold bastard.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Levi say Eren killed twenty titans?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, when Mikasa was talking about how Eren saved her.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently only onscreen events count. He hasn't counted the ~300 dead in the battle for Trost. 
>> ARTICLE
There was a number given of how many deaths there were during the Battle for Trost and I believe around 206 were confirmed dead.
>> ARTICLE
After that episode he did mention this 

>Current Humans killed by Titans: 96 deaths, 21 additional deaths possible.
It is litterally impossible for my eyes to discern the mess in that crystal puke, so I ommited it.
The official count given by the anime for the total of the event was 207 dead.
>> ARTICLE
> Not sure if her face is funny or the stuff of nightmares

Scared the shit out of me when she hit the bars. I thought it was Sasha in food scavenging mode for a minute, until I saw the glasses.

I would love to join the Survey Corps. I hate those cowardly MPs.  The Survey Corps are full of madmen? I'm pretty sure that's what makes a powerful army. Sign me up
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you have to be somewhat mad to constantly go outside the walls and face the titans, watching your comrades die. I love it though.

Not to mention your 3DMG is useless outside the walls/city. Also, titans are fucking fast.

God damn, I freakin' love Levi. He basically made Eren his bitch in this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like the 'new' cast of characters introduced. I think Levi and Zoe are gonna be great characters that we'll love (hell we already LOVE Levi). And OF COURSE the new OP fails in comparison to the first one, no many can go up against that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still concerned how they keep talking about the king yet we've not even seen him yet.

I'm sure there's a conspiracy brewing and it relates to the Titans somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Levi is an insane bastard, but I respect him for the shit he pulled with Eren. I was really pissed when he started beating Eren up, and how furious Mikasa became, but then I realized why he was doing it. Very awesome. And the whole tooth thing was just insane.

Eren is Deadpool. Confirmed.

I actually quite like it. I love then ending though.

For me the new ED was disappointing, but it might be because I will miss Hikasa Yoko's voice.

Love the animation on the OP! The song, not so much, but we'll accustom to it.  I won't give away anything but the OP has me really excited about the coming arc.

BTW watch out for random PM's, some guy named Halloth is trying to spoil the show for all the others.
>> ARTICLE
Levi is best sociopath.
>> ARTICLE
That cliffhanger was *amazing*
>> ARTICLE
I am in love with the new opening.  The way it opens, the German, then the wicked guitar riff, and finally the quality of animation through the whole thing is just amazing.  The first opening was something special, and this one is just as good to me.  
>> ARTICLE
Holy sht that new OP! Those scout legion spirits! Those animation! Those teasers! That sense of grandeur! Fkin love it already!

So, chapter 34 confirmed?
>> ARTICLE
33/34. The latter half of 34 could work as part of Season 2's opener. And at this point, not having a Season 2 would be heretical as fuck, even if it takes a year or two to roll around.
>> ARTICLE
Unless the author says fuck it and throws a shitty ending at us. Those last 2 chapters were boring as hell.
>> ARTICLE
I certainly hope the 46/47 talkfest will not continue further, even though I personally found it fascinating. I suspect 46-48 (if 48 delivers what I expect) will make a good singular episode, albeit with a slow first half.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, by boring I meant the story wasn't progressing much but seeing them talk is interesting and gives some insight on their thoughts
>> ARTICLE
i hate stories with too little exposition and unexplained character motivation shifts like most shonen mangas 
>> ARTICLE
Well, my only issue is that they're throwing more questions at you then answers. It's not a bad thing at all, I'm just looking for solid answers because a lot of stuff so far has just been suprises more then answers.
>> ARTICLE
do you read one piece? for a comparison its currently 714 chapters and we still DONT KNOW WHAT THE ONE PIECE IS when you compare that to the 47 chapters of snk which equates to about 94 chapters of a weekly manga you can see how mangakas and authors in general play mystery and villain tag mystery and villain tag means to introduce a new mystery and villain before the current one is defeated heres a example from op just incase you havent read the snk manga in one piece their was a island called punk hazarad the main villain of the arc was a guy named ceasar clown but it turned out he worked for a larger org run by another villain who works for another one and so forth do you see what i am referring to 
>> ARTICLE
94 chapters and they still didn't go to the basement
>> ARTICLE
714ch vs 94 and the basement isnt the end of the story its only a mcguffin which will lead eren to make a decision as to what hes going to do after having obtained the information 
may i ask why havent you responded to my previous post? ill checkout your podcast 
>> ARTICLE
the ending of snk is far away isayama keeps opening up the story with new mysteries and villains so dont expect a quick ending also why does everyone have adhd! when it comes to manga pacing 
>> ARTICLE
I know, but the anime is halfway done with this season and it's still pretty far from the manga. And the manga is progressing so slow, it took them 2 chapters to leave the forest and they haven't done much in there either besides talking and hinting at crap. It's frustrating is all.
>> ARTICLE
the anime should animate the novels during the gap year they are called ' before the fall" which will allow the manga to progress far enough for a new season of material also isayama helped with the novels because they cover the invention of the 3dmg and a character im very interested to see hes more badass then levi because his backstory is similar to gatts from berserk and I WANT TO SEE IT ANIMATED 
>> ARTICLE
Before the fall? So it includes the events of titans first attack?
>> ARTICLE
the novels cover 3 protagonists one is about the guy who invented the 3dmg which if youve read the manga is very important to establish a timeline for the age and identity of a major character introduced later in the manga the second story is the one im most interested in because it centers around a guy who was born after his mother was killed and thrown up by a titan he was found alive next to her dead body very similar to another badass manga character namely gatts from berserk 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta get all the info outta the way at some point before you get to the action. Imagine if 46/47 were 8 weekly chapters instead? It'd be torture. (Kinda like One Piece can be)
>> ARTICLE
And the new intro is badass as hell. Really fits Jiyuu No Tsubasa well. Zoe slamming into the bars like that surprised me. She's an odd one. No scratch that she's pretty weird. Reminds me of Mari from Evangelion. 

Aww he doesn't even have a hammer to slam down for order. That sucks. That's a badass beard though.

Still hate Levi so far. He's a badass for sure. Hell he's got the balls to beat a guy who can turn into a rage version of a titan. Still don't like him treating Eren like that. Doubtful he ever warms up to Eren either.
>> ARTICLE
The actual credits in the new opening are pretty badass. The song is good. It's not better than the original opening song, but it IS better than the full-length original OP song  >_< 
>> ARTICLE
The music is better in the old opening and ending. But it was a sick episode as usual, except for the recap last week. 
>> ARTICLE
The new opening was really nice. I did not like the song to much but the scenes that came with it were stunning.

Anyone who has UneditReddit, Be careful, there are manga spoilers in this thread.  I suggest turning it off unless you already know what's going to happen.

There was minimal action, but damn this episode was invigorating!

Loving the new theme music.

The tooth already growing back gave me chills. If he can regenerate in human form, can he be killed conventionally?

Watching Eren get his ass beat in motion may have just hurt more than in the manga.

Zoe's a kinky broad, eh?? :)

I'm not so sure about what Eren is getting into here. Anybody as bad ass as the Survey Corps might have a few screws loose from what they've seen. . .and that preview makes it look like these guys are weird.

 I think I'm going to like them a lot.


 We've spoken about the new OP (they actually topped the first :O)
 but what about the new ED. That song kicks ass. I thought it was the Back Horn (Gundam 00 OP) at first.

Seems like we won't see much more Sasha since she hasn't been seen for a while and we're transferring the action over to the recon corps

Okay, I read through the comments and I didn't see anyone mentioning it.

I currently hate the Military Police/Royal Gaurd(whatever they're called)as a whole right now. They're all a bunch of cowards. Seriously how long are they going to let their personal fear dictate their actions?
>> ARTICLE
Until the Titans come knocking on their door, I guess?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, the irony...
>> ARTICLE
Sure but at least everyone else is currently doing stuff. Both the Garrison and the Recon Corps have shown to want to apply Eren's abilities in the field and are confident in being able to control him but the Military Police just decides to kill him off. That's just disappointing especially coming from the elite.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it was pointed out during the training arc that the top graduates usually choose to opt for the police branch, basically those that are best trained to slay titans stay away from them and it kinda sucks. 

>> ARTICLE
Exactly I mean they even went over it in the show. They work hard to live the easy life. It really sucks.
>> ARTICLE
Their job is to kill titans and maintain stability. Eren is a titan who messed up their lives. Sounds ok to me if they want to off him.
>> ARTICLE
I get that but they've completely given up on trying to use him like the Recon guys want. Ordinarily it's understandable but you can see it in the way they act and the way they speak(including the things they say). All of their current actions were based off of selfishness and fear. My point is they let their fear dictate their actions far more often than they should. I mean they're supposed to be the best of the best and here they are worrying about not controlling one titan. I mean I understand its Eren titan but they can see the Recon guys aren't worried so why should they be? All in all if they were trying to kill him because they were trying to do their job that would be great but this is just cowardice and selfishness.
>> ARTICLE
At this point you are overthinking it. The show needed a conflict so it was simply a case of rangers versus police for the sake of having a dispute. Of course and their reactions are stupid and most likely wouldn't be as such in a normal situation. But we wouldn't have tension otherwise. It is still a shonen you know. Motivations and common sense are not as deep as people make them be.
>> ARTICLE
i think its much more accurate as to how people react in a similar situation where fear overtakes the population at the mere mention of anything my i direct your attention to human history including recent history namely the"war on terror" and how people have begun to justify the governments actions for them despite their obvious violations of human rights so snk seems very apt in that regard 
>> ARTICLE
> obvious violations of human rights 

You are comparing rights people have in a modern democracy with military dominence to that of a dark age dystopian monarchy which has military disadvantage over the enemy. So no, your claims don't stick.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know but the guy giving the proposal to kill him didn't seem scared. He said there will be civil war (people that want him dead vs people that want to use him). 

It sounded to me like he said let us kill him so there isn't war, went as far as saying let us get all the info we can before killing him (still see him as valuable). 

>> ARTICLE
As a follow up sorry for the long rant-post. I just don't like to see people like him who are supposed to be strong and yet are still as afraid as he is.
>> ARTICLE
Nile Dawk? Yeah he definitely said that though it sounded more like an excuse to kill him if anything though what you're saying makes sense since that is what he said. The thing is though, let's think about this for a second. The military police is made up of elite soldiers. Nile Dawk is the commander of the military police which means he's the best of the best regarding the military police. The thing is though, on two separate occasions he very much did show fear. The first was after Eren was done lecturing them the first thing he did was order an office to get ready to shoot him. No logic behind that decision making. He just got ready to execute him right then and there. The second was when Levi was beating up Eren. Dawk said it was dangerous to hear him up because he might turn into a Titan. He was afraid of him turning into a Titan. Now I understand they didn't have their gear on them so killing him would be quite a bit more difficult however, he's a commander which means he's intelligent. Shouldn't he have noticed that Levi  wasn't worried? Which means he didn't have anything to worry about? Levi was adamant that he could kill Eren Titan and although it's hard to tell wouldn't it be safe to assume Dawk is close to our possibly more skilled than Levi? I know it's hard to believe but one is a Corporal of the Survey Corps while the other is the Commander of the Military Police. I would imagine Dawk would be confident in his ability to kill Eren Titan especially when seeing that a lower ranking officer is alright with it? Though Levi is very skilled I would imagine the Commander of their elite forces would be pretty good too. In their works it has become the norm to be afraid of Titans. The minority is made up of people who don't understand the true power of Titans or those who are confident in their ability to fight them. In just saying it's disappointing to see someone of his stature show as much fear as he does.
>> ARTICLE
that was an amazing ep

love where this series is going and i like Levi alot for some reason
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I find annoying is why no one suggested this: Eren's body was not already donated to science.  Not for dissecting, but ALIVE so he can still be used as a titan, but also to find a way that other soldiers can become titans just like him so they can build an army of titans to fight against the other titans and take back not just the walled city, but the world.
>> ARTICLE
They don't have our technology to do that apparently. It is much easier to go to his dad's basement and get whatever he left there instead of trying to find a scientist as talented as he was.
>> ARTICLE
They have scientists/researchers among the Scouts (like the chick that sticks her face between the prison cell bars), and also... why do you think they want to get to the basement? To get more answers.

the plot is advancing about as fast as a godsdamn episode of one piece. 
>> ARTICLE
the episode wouldn't have been this good had they rushed through what was shown, imo. somebody mentioned that Eren's speech in the manga was even longer..

i think they did a good job this time around.
>> ARTICLE
it was just boring, the courtroom scene was stretched like taffy, and up until erens little quip the episode consisted of different people repeating the same things over and over again. I mean... basically nothing happened in today's hunterxhunter, but at least nothing happened in an interesting way. 
>> ARTICLE
lemme tell you exactly what happened:

- shown people getting panicked over eren
- shown MP's wanting to murder eren
- pixis talking to smith highlighting the judge would kill eren if he'd want to
- implied eren is anxiously waiting for days
- eren meets genki zoe and smelly mike 
- [jag scene](http://www.coverbrowser.com/image/bestselling-movies-2006/715-1.jpg) where almost everyone who was introduced/discussed over participated in the chat
- shown that next plot will involve Eren and Rivaille faffing about on the other side of the wall.
- shown and outline plan for retaking wall maria via Calanes to Shiganshina
- shown that religious dicks pray on populace's fear and get power
- Rivaille talking and dealing smack cause he doesn't want people to fuck with his business - and Eren understanding him
- shown that Eren actually cares for Mikasa for once.. (last time was when they were both 9 and puberty must've changed things..)
- eren being buddybuddies with Smith and Rivaille
- shown that Eren has regen in human form

it's an information dump, granted.. not exciting, but to people like me who don't read the manga a little drama is much appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
90% of that could have take place in 5 minutes. and some of it completely unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
it could have.. but then it would feel rushed and disbelievable. [some things are more important](http://www.thedramateacher.com/elements-of-drama-tension/).

Index I and II are  good examples where going through many things fast homogenises the story into a generic repetition.
>> ARTICLE
the first four bullet points were completely irrelivant to the plot, and actually reduced the tension because nothing said during the trial was even a little bit surprising. 

we've already had like a dozen speeches so far about how everyone needs to put their faith in Eren if they want to survive, a good story avoids that kind of repetition for the viewer, and simply implies a broader audience receives the speech, rather than just showing it over and over again. 

skillful tension is something like when Eren got eaten, that was tense, this is what is known as just a boring repetitive plot line, where I only watch because 1 out of every 4ish episodes are absolutely stunning, while the rest, like this one, make me want to pull my hair out.  
>> ARTICLE
>the first four bullet points were completely irrelivant to the plot, and actually reduced the tension because nothing said during the trial was even a little bit surprising. 

It showed a state of unrest from within the wall and that the people are not as unified as you think. The potential uprising is a major point within the whole trial since they are arguing for a good way to calm the citizen down with their different approaches of handling Eren. Pixiv's chat is just character introduction to the judge, which is still important otherwise you don't know how the trial is going to play out. Eren being anxious is a normal human behaviour. At last he didn't act like other shonen leads who just yells. It shows a calm and mature side to him, when apparently most of the audience think of him as a raging kid. Character development.

>we've already had like a dozen speeches so far about how everyone needs to put their faith in Eren if they want to survive, 

Different target audience. Pixiv is to the beaten army, Ivan is last minute onfield captain talk which is an extension of Pixiv's speech in the face of uncertainty. Irwin's to the court and those who never seen the situation that happened. Where's the third one?
>> ARTICLE
> At last he didn't act like other shonen leads who just yells. It shows a calm and mature side to him, when apparently most of the audience think of him as a raging kid. Character development.

He mocked everyone in the courtroom. Same thing.
>> ARTICLE
It's a calculated move which reaps the reward, he's just following what the Scout Legion told him to do. Different thing.
>> ARTICLE
> skillful tension is something like when Eren got eaten, that was tense

that was the climax. the tension was all the bravado and the preperation beforehand where you were made to believe the humans were actually going to counter-attack and after all that training (carried across an entire episode) that the main characters were going to prove themselves.

that's tension and that's what's going on every time those three episodes pass by in order for the fourth to be amazing. the same thing is happening in railgun right now and people are still surprised..

mattaku..
>> ARTICLE
no, the climax was him turning into a titan, tension makes you worry about what happens next, ie "how the fuck is he gunna get out of this?"

the speech didn't make me care any more about the next episode, the only valuable or tension inducing moment in this episode was when levi said he would be taking eren under his wing on an expedition.

 the rest was just story filler, because regardless of whether or not it was in the manga it failed to actually make anything happen. Along with the several minutes of flashbacks intermingled in the episode, *right after a godsdamn recap episode* it's mildly infuriating. 
>> ARTICLE
Several minutes? You mean the few 5+ seconds of evidence presentation?
>> ARTICLE
On paper, no event can be filler or boring. Imagine if the trial was done Kaiji style. The simplest of actions would feel awesome and exciting.
>> ARTICLE
The pacing of the whole show is a mess. Important things like the people who were sent to be killed on episode 2 are skipped, and people talking about minor things take up entire episodes.
>> ARTICLE
so.. 

people who die, fast = **important**

details on things like 'where do we stand and where we're going from here' = **minor**

i really need to read the manga just to see if this show deserves the bashing it gets or they're actually doing a good job for *an entirely different medium whose [completely different approach to presentation](http://hellboyanimated.typepad.com/just_a_tad/2011/02/comics-vs-animation-storytelling.html) nobody's considering*
>> ARTICLE
Man, priorities. If no time is invested on seeing people dying, everything else becomes minor by default. 

"We need to survive, unlike those other guys who died. Yes, they died because we told you so. Now let's be grumpy about it for two episodes even if we gave you no real basis for it."
>> ARTICLE
no idea if you're just a troll or you really mean it.. but i did bother going back to watch highlights of episode 2 fast.

priorities, as you say, are showing people dying that mattered at least slightly. a titan genocide on display for even two minutes would be boring and irrelevant.. so they stuck with some still frames and narration showing armin saying goodbye to his grampa and crying for him afterwards surrounded by mikasa and armin.

they died because humanity couldn't provide resources for all of them. it was clear and referenced in other episodes as well.

you're not giving this show enough credit. i believe you if you say you've read the manga and you feel better about the story written down.. but that only means you prefer the written medium to the cinematic one. as an anime only watcher i enjoyed the show wholeheartedly thus far and felt it was a consistent presentation.
>> ARTICLE
All his posts showed that he never read the manga but just spoiling himself from wiki so he could pretend that he did. Just ignore him, he's just a kid who think he's smart for bashing a popular show, without any solid basis
>> ARTICLE
Are you saying 15 more minutes of his grandpa TALKING then GOING out and being MASSACRED with the rest would not ADD ANYTHING? Instead of that, here are some stills and a monologue. Yeah, they died, next.

That would be overly redundant as it won't add anything extra to the purpose of the scene. Not to mention time wasting. It was something that was overlooked by the people back then, and shall stay this way in presentation

you obviously dont watch one piece on a regular basis heres the pace comparison one piece 17pgs per episode and snk 44pgs per episode its not even close !!!!!!

He sniffs you and then smirks.... kay

New arc starts out strong leaving me with lots of questions and expectations. Feels like we're just ditching all the survivors from basic training and replacing them with an eccentric group known as the Recon Corps. It does kinda make sense though that you'd have half a screw loose to go out outside the walls abandoning the only safety left. 

I gotta say the military tribunal was a cool set up, made a military legal system that works well in the Titan universe. Darius is an interesting character as well. Makes me wonder what you gotta do to become top-rank. His VA sounds really familiar to me as well, and seems to fit perfectly for the character. 

The military police sound like like cowards as Eren stated in his epic monologue. Those who don't know the dangers and live in rich high society of the inner wall really should just keep their mouths shut. Mikasa made a scary face at Levi, but I'm sure any raection like that would make sense when Eren got the tar beat out of him. Makes me curious how Armin and Mikasa will manage to rejoin Eren if hes in the Recon corps.

Final thing I want to mention was this idea of Eren being the key object for rebellion against the inner wall. I didn't think much of this situation at first since it just sounds crazy, humans killing humans while Titans are outside the doorstep waiting to eat the survivors. Wasn't until the ending preview where the narrator spoke of the Recon corps. being not some ordinary soldier, but in actuality... Revolutionaries

Walking and talking. I didn't realize Aaron Sorkin was writing for anime.

Reading comments makes me assume that watching this episode will piss me off.

Edit: New OP is OK... but it can't go up to par with the first one. Police and the inner walls are blinded by fear too much to see what kind of asset Eren is.

Levi is a bastard but I guess he saved Eren's life by beating him up and damn Mikasa was ready to kill everyone just to protect Eren, that is kind of cute and romantic.
>> ARTICLE
she wasnt going to kill everyone she just wanted to kick levis ass which unfortunately shes not capable of at the moment interestingly levi has a kind of fixation with eren and mikasas relationship because whenever he speaks to mikasa he asks her this question for some reason "why do you like him so much?" "what is your relationship"? does levi have a thing for her or is he like a friend whos trying to give mikasa a hint that eren isnt good enough for her i dont understand it myself

Did he really save his life, or would he have regenerated if he was shot with a rifle?

This show jumped the shark when they brought Eren back. It's been nothing but a ploddingly-paced pile of shit ever since. Nice to see that even with a week of lead-time, they managed to fill half the episode panning over still frames.

It would make so much sense to kill the MC without revealing what his father was injecting into him. Grow the fuck up. There's a reason for everything and this show definitely doesn't leave any split ends so far. if you want death, just keep watching the damn show and shut up.

The animation of the 3D maneuver gear never fails to impress me, so damn nice to look at
>> ARTICLE
Agree, but I hate all the still frames they had when the Titans came rushing in.
>> ARTICLE
It's weird, but I never noticed still frames in anime until someone mentioned it on an anime forum I used to frequent. After that, I couldn't stop seeing them in every anime I watched since.
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda like watching those old History Channel shows. They show a photograph (still image) and slowly move and zoom in/out for affect.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, there's another thing to sit uncomfortably and *notice*.
>> ARTICLE
That's because stills shots and camera pans are totally normal and people are wining over AoT not satisfying their unrealistic animation standards for a TV show. I think that because Attack on Titan looks better than most of the shonen shows of the last few years, people think it's reasonable to ask for perfection.

You are noticing more now because every animation studio out there take their shortcuts when it comes to taking the most out of their animation budget, and using stills, camera pans and face close up shots are the most common "tools" when it comes to budget managing. And the way Attack on Titan is handling the balance with the stills fits better than SHAFT's well known creative aproach in all of its shows.

In any case, the show had only one episode with huge animation flaws, and that was 13, which was as incomplete as Psycho-Pass EP18. Other AoT episodes also had some animation hiccups that most people fail to notice because of their bias on stills. For example, in EP17, which was praised for looking excellent, at 18:50, there's a missing transition fade-in effect for Armin's layer that's missing, he just pops up in a single frame. 

Now, to me, THOSE are the animation flaws we should never see much of in the anime we watch. I don't mind if the director decided to use stills for a scene as long as it fits. And this week's carnage was very well portrayed to me and I have yet to find an iconic scene I preferred more in the manga than in the show.
>> ARTICLE
>looks better

Completely subjective. If people think it looks like shit, then it looks like shit to them. If you think it looks good, then it looks good to you. You can't force your own opinion on others like this. If someone doesn't like stills in their anime, then it's their opinion. I think SnK looks like crap most of the time. I think there were plenty of sweet looking shonens past few years and SnK looks just cheap to me, but if you like it, that's fine, everyone has their own criteria. 
>> ARTICLE
>Completely subjective.  If someone doesn't like stills in their anime, then it's their opinion.

I'm not a big fan of the "Opinions Card" as an argument, because it kinda kills any sort of discussion when taken to an extreme.

>I think there were plenty of sweet looking shonens past few years

Such as?
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero, Madoka, JoJo, Mondaiji, Magi, Mirai Nikki, SAO. And these are only those I actually watched. 
>> ARTICLE
Errmm... out of those, only Mirai Nikki, JoJo and Magi are shonen. And I find it very ironic that you mention JoJo. Because that anime, can easily be called "Great Stills: The Anime".

From your examples, I think you are just speaking out of pure personal bias, regardless of facts.
>> ARTICLE
You completely dodged my point by asking a question which doesn't address your own personal bias towards SnK and anyone who disagrees. 

Also all of those are considered shonens not that it matters much considering the point I am trying to make. 

I never said I don't like stills. I said you can't dismiss someone's opinion just because their criteria are different. 

There is basically no such thing as objectivity, but regardless. What facts do you think there are? Your opinion is not a fact. And taking opinion as a fact because of "the discussion wouldn't happen otherwise" is still not a way to go. Others wanting for more is completely fine. Following your reasoning, you could accept anything as good, because of "it's just a TV show". 

You can't treat someone's opinion as a fact, because it isn't a fact. And everyone discussing should keep that in mind. It's best to treat opinion as opinion and the only fact should be that it's actually an opinion. You say SnK looks good, I disagree, then we can proceed to tell eachother why we think that way, not why it *is* that way. The argument being an opinion doesn't necessarily render it pointless in a discussion. 

So moving on, why do you think a guy who doesn't like stills is wrong by saying that SnK has bad animation because of stills? They are an easy and cheap way out and in a show like SnK which doesn't have much to offer in terms of story, characters and world, good animation should be important as a redeeming factor. But when the animation is mostly stills of colored manga pages, what is there left to enjoy? 
>> ARTICLE
>Also all of those are considered shonens

Fact: This is wrong. There's no consideration to make here. Your new is showing.

>You can't treat someone's opinion as a fact, because it isn't a fact.

Conversely, you can't transform facts into opinions. It is a fact that Jojo abused stills, yet it is on your list of "good animated shonen".

> But when the animation is mostly stills of colored manga pages, what is there left to enjoy?

Fact: That is wrong as well. I don't even like the show that much.

Well they went in alone she is likely handicapped slightly from just transforming back erin would be a titan (because we need a titan on titan battle) and he would have the most dlite squad on the whole recon corps

Yeah but that would be pretty bullshit if she could just become a titan for an hour, get like a thousand massive arrows launched at her, get devoured and then just become a titan again instantly without punishment.

Maybe she has experience as a Titan whereas Eren's only ever transformed 4 times, two of which were incomplete.

Honestly reading the manga didn't take away the effect of the anime for me. It's still awesome to watch every week despite knowing what happens.

>> ARTICLE
whenever humanity seems to get its act together with a plan or a maneuver everything comes crashing down due to one or more surprise which isn't completely unpredictable.

this plan to capture the female titan, the initial counter-attack before Trost was torn apart.. the only thing they've achieved so far is by Eren *eventually* plugging that gate with a boulder.

it's a miracle they even lasted 100 years.

takes a while to show dialogue with the size of this cast and it shows, not that i mind.. if anything i'd like more from every member so it's a shame when they show a quick gasp or repetitive lines.

the villain's hood is one of the best i've ever seen: keeps shielding his/her face from three directions despite the obvious wind s/he'd endure while maneuvering. would buy!

it's episodes like these that highlight just how much better an experience it would be to marathon the show instead of receiving weekly pieces.
>> ARTICLE
I actually stopped watching at episode 12 because only getting weekly updates was pissing me off. I couldn't stand the Trost arc lasting two freaking months.

Came back and started watching again earlier this week out of peer pressure, and I gotta say, marathoning it was so much more enjoyable. Now I'm back to dealing with the cliffhangers again, though...
>> ARTICLE
You could wait until the manga has been completed and adapted ;)

 * 12 Titans  (Ten 15m class and Two 5m class)
 * 6 Pixis Points


* **Levi**  
 * 9 Titans (Nine 15m Class)

 * Has a habit of standing on titan heads and talking to them.



*  **Annie:**

* **Zoe**  
 * 3 Titans (One 15m Class and One 5m Class)  
 * 1 Pixis Point  



* **Reiner:**  
 * 1 Titan (One 5m Class)
 * 1 Pixis Point


*   **Potato Girl:** 
 * 1 Pixis Points  


*   **Female Titan**  
 * 13 Human kills
 * And 1 Human in her Human form so it would seem at this point. (not sure if that should be added to the total killed by titans)


*   **Krista**  
 * Marriage Count: 2


Current Humans killed by Titans: **123** deaths, **22** additional deaths possible.  
  

OK so for the scenes which were essentially flashcards, I counted a kill for each one with a cut in its neck, or for a soldier in the picture shown to be clearly attacking. 
  
So for that I counted:

 * 6 for Soldiers 

 * 1 for Zoe

 * 2 for Levi 

I didn't give anyone Pixis points.  
If anyone wants Pixis points added to someone, just state who and the reason.

Suicide count: **1**    

Horse Death Count: **13**

That was a very buildup episode, I felt something was gonna come and surprise me and it did. That potato-girl intuition seems overpowered though. Welp, we all know what's to come for next week, can't wait to see who it is! And it's a female! 

^Petra ^was ^extra ^cute ^this ^episode.
>> ARTICLE
Over powered? Have you ever heard the screams of an animal that is just about to die? It is ridiculously haunting and chilling. Now, change that dying desperate animal to a Titan, and the whole scenario gets amplified. Both her intuition and reaction were very very real. 

>> ARTICLE
How do we know her intuition didn't include the part where the titan successfully escapes the other titans clutches and going straight to where Eren is being protected afterwards? A titan dying is one thing, but it's another when its all a part of the plan.


>> ARTICLE
And that's a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
The title has [Spoilers] in it for a reason..
>> ARTICLE
It's suppose to be spoilers up to and including that episode. Not spoilers for what's probably a couple episodes from now.
>> ARTICLE
It was in the episode.. It was a major part of this episode. Do you understand what I'm talking about? The female Titan surrendered herself to other titans but managed to reach Erens group in the end of the episode. Killing Gunther reaffirms that. There isn't anything we haven't seen yet that is said.
>> ARTICLE
So yeah you've managed to spoil something you don't even know about on accident by way of wording. Bravo.
>> ARTICLE
It's only a spoiler if you know what happens from the manga, but this anime only, again, I haven't said anything to my knowledge at least, that hasn't been seen. 
>> ARTICLE
It's been seen, just not obvious yet. I was kinda mad that they give it off in the anime.

Also, it's a spoiler depending on how you read it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been likeing Petra more and more.

^hope^she^doesn't^die
>> ARTICLE
Dang Female Titan has a pretty epic roar as well.

Oh that was a clever trick, drawing all the titans inward.

Man Sasha looks really stressed there.

Wow that's a really suspenseful ending. 

Definitely picking up the manga when this ends.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is crazy, like a fox.
>> ARTICLE
Female is so OP, nerf plz.
>> ARTICLE
I knew something was going to go wrong because they were all like "yeah! don't underestimate us!". But the next episode depends on what Levi is doing.
>> ARTICLE
Just a guess but I think female Titan is gonna face off with Eren, kick his ass and just as she's going to finish him off, Levi will get her
>> ARTICLE
i'm hoping s/he's not gonna die or everything they've done so far would be in vain. after he went to the trouble of threatening the femtitan he could very well just slice her limbs and tear his/her body from the titan plus it would look so goddamn cool!
>> ARTICLE
Way too much exposition in the first half. Even though theories were explained it just felt like they kept discussing topics in circles...(Good for the seiyuu if they were being paid by line, though I guess). Thank goodness the second half picked up...

And DAT ROAR. All I could think of after that: http://i.imgur.com/qoCiuHx.jpg

P.S. It feels like the animation budget for Eren himself suffered this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell what was better, the Unit 01 berserk roar or the Female Titan's scream (I think scream is a better way to put it? Just trying to differentiate, though). Both were pretty chilling, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think Titan Scream wins this one, but Unit 01 waking up in Eva 2.22 (I think it was that one) and going God Mode is probably the best "oh shit" mecha/titan moment of all time.
>> ARTICLE
SENPAIIIIII~~~
>> ARTICLE
So...how is Titan going to end, with 5 episodes left?!? What kind of ending A cliffy for a 2nd season? It can't go off the manga (Soul eater style) but it can't end with a 'and everyone lived happily ever after killing titans' style either. I can't keep from reading the manga for a next season that won't air for 2 years!

Catching up with the manga, which is released monthly (which I don't mind). I guessed about 2 years. Since they went through 25-ish chapters (not a manga reader) it'll take 2 years for them to have enough material to make another 25 episodes.

While some say this is just an overrated shounen, I find this to be an exceptionally well done anime in terms of presentation. I hold it in high regards but it does suffer from over hype. So it might even be a normal shounen, just done well.

Oh god how do I organize my thoughts to sound coherent and not jumbled

> Oh god how do I organize my thoughts to sound coherent and not jumbled

write them down, any words that come to mind. re-read them to yourself and adjust until they make sense. read more literature to improve.

>it does suffer from over hype. 

definitely. whenever a show had a successful manga, their readers would flip their shit over how supposedly good this should be and then bash it for any flaw.
>> ARTICLE
shounen haters will be like that. It's not hyped up for nothing , it's actually a very interesting and enjoyable story with excellent animation and a soundtrack that just sticks into peoples minds.


Don't overthink and worry about the other /r/anime-ers opinions.

~~[Crista](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130811104042/shingekinokyojin/images/9/96/Christa_close-up.png)~~ or 
[Annie](http://www.entravity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/shingeki-4-12-annie-leonhart.jpg) as the 
[Titan](http://www.entravity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/shingeki-no-kyojin-female-titan.jpg)

~~On the side of Christa, she let Armin live, found the horses, I don't remember seeing her in the same frame as the Titan, and just after half way through I think it was, the guys on boarder guard asked where Crista was.~~

On the side of Annie, she just seems to be a shady character and I dont remember if she was in the same frame as the titan either. She also looks a bit more like the Titan than Christa.

That would be my prediction.
>> ARTICLE
God they gave Christa and the female titan the same features and hair and everything, what a tease. 

And to bring up a point I made before, [the eyes of the titan and hair color seem to pretty much confirm it's Annie, at least to me.](http://i.imgur.com/Q9qNCZs.jpg). However the question comes up as how she managed to get the Survey Corps uniform...
>> ARTICLE
she did kill a whole bunch of them.. maybe while the steam was up she tracked back to a solder and grabbed his gear OR she carried one of them between her toes.

i also had no doubt it was Annie. i'd be shocked if it turned out to be anyone else since they just look too damn similar. if they'd have chosen a more sketchy artstyle like in Eren's case it would have been more ambivalent.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Annie imo. Besides the look (that stone cold blue-eyed stare...), she has the training and discipline to be so in control as a titan. To top it all off, she is the only one who among Eren's classmates who didn't join Survey Corps.
>> ARTICLE
Where did you see Annie train titan-control?
>> ARTICLE
It's gotta be Annie. As soon as I saw the female titan the eyes stuck out to me and I've been yelling about how much I hate Annie for it ever since.

edit: and the nose, how could I forget. It HAS to be her.
>> ARTICLE
Also Annie is like the only female character that was introduced and not part of the recon corps.  If they have the figure hooded that means that its someone the audience knows, and they are hiding it from us, suggesting that the female titan is someone we know. Adding in the light blue eyes, blonde hair, fighting proficiency and distinctive nose, I'm reasonably confident that the female titan is Annie, and have been since she fist popped up, and we knew that it was a human inside
>> ARTICLE
And not to mention Titan Annie was really good at fighting. Human Annie was also extremely good at fighting as show in the earlier episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Those two portrait shots you chose are like opposites of each other. A warm smile and a cold stare.
>> ARTICLE
When I chose the picture I was more focused on the layout of the hair for the pictures rather than the smile/stare 
>> ARTICLE
Christa is at the edge of the forest while the titan is trapped in the middle.
>> ARTICLE
Just looked back and yeah I saw 
>> ARTICLE
Christa was shown speaking to someone whilst fem-titan was caught up in the metal ropes this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Annie didn't join the recon corps...Dun dun dunnnn
>> ARTICLE
Those other titans really hauled ass. I had the impression that the forest was quite a bit larger. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess since they're still going with it it must be true, but I always thought them assuming there was a person in the titan just because Eren could control one was odd. Did I miss something? Also, Who fired the first green smoke round? I thought it was the person inside the female titan since it didn't show a face, but the the person drew their blades when they saw the second smoke round. So the commander shot the green smoke round first? Why? And why was the female titan looking for whoever shot the second?
>> ARTICLE
I was asking the same question, but after re-watching the previous episodes with a friend, I am now under the impression that the top brass have suspected the existence of human-controlled Titans since the fall of Zhigaishina. When Eren first reveals his ability to transform, he is immediately accused of being an enemy that has infiltrated their ranks-- almost certainly because they had *already* been considering the possibility. Members of the Garrison explicitly note that the Armored and Colossal Titans had been observed to appear in a plume of steam before 'vanishing' upon the completion of their tasks, suggesting a possible transformation; it is likewise unlikely that military leaders had missed the fact that the Colossal Titan was acting intelligently by destroying the cannons in episode 5. They have been probably suspected that the both the Armored and Colossal Titans were living within the walls as humans for quite some time now, and became certain they had infiltrated the military after the deaths of Sonny and Bean. This is also why no one has been trusted with the true purpose of the current expedition except veterans from a period preceding the fall of Wall Maria.
>> ARTICLE
The hooded figure shot the first smoke round. Eren's group shot the second in response, assuming it was Levi. The hooded figure then drew their blades and headed towards the group, now knowing exactly where they are. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't feel like they're just assuming, there was mention that Levi must have deduced a "spy" in their forces because of the way the wall was breached, so I think he has thought it through very well. It feels like they're just assuming because we aren't really given much more information than what Eren and a few other squad members know, and that isn't much.
>> ARTICLE
Same person shot and drew, so he knows which way people are coming from
>> ARTICLE
Despite the non-stop talking in the first half of the episode, we did learn quite a few things. In the 2nd half of the episode though...oh man. Judging from next week's episode title, it sounds like things are going to get REALLY ugly.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, episode 20. Last one was bad, not gonna lie. The sum total of its progression was Eren runs through forest, decides to actually follow orders for once, it engaged in a bunch of redundant characterization, and the characters finally learned Titanification is triggered by injury PLUS a specific goal. Thats not a lot of content, for twenty minutes of anime. I guess if I watched more shounens Id be used to this, but I dont, and Im not. The pacing sucked.

However, when this show is good, it can create either solid dramatic moments or at least sweet action setpieces. So lets get to some of that.

**Episode 20**

0:38 - [Hi Eren.](http://i.imgur.com/DmC1N0E.jpg) Anyway, just thinkin bout plot. Not something I usually do, but kind of appropriate for this show. They had a whole big trap set up for the mystery titan, so it seems clear that this wasnt a test run (which always seemed like a hilariously wasteful idea), but instead a chance to use Eren as bait against something they suspected would happen. Meaning the survey corps know there is some intelligent force arrayed against them, or at least titans + intelligent individuals (their two captive titans were killed, etc). The plot thickens!

0:42 - [I guess this really is pretty okay.](http://i.imgur.com/jk9KNLQ.jpg) Probably the closest translation of following orders means betraying your own sensibilities, but the stakes are too high for ego here we could get in a shounen like this

3:55 - [Or, you know, not at all](http://i.imgur.com/YAEhtnm.jpg)

4:17 - FIRE THE SPARE ROUNDS! [Thats right Commander get it all out](http://i.imgur.com/tZ0rJWh.jpg)

4:23 - [I like that tree texture.](http://i.imgur.com/D7xssvJ.jpg) The visual aesthetic is just pretty distinctive over all, of course. Definitely one of the shows strengths

5:06 - [Do we really need every character to confirm they did indeed fire cannons?](http://i.imgur.com/QMg6rjO.jpg) I guess this is the show catching the audience up to speed on they planned it all along, but that really should just require a single aside. Switching between the storytelling of this and Gatchaman is rough

5:10 - [Man, I wonder what HER perspective on the cannon situation is](http://i.imgur.com/1cDhqel.jpg)

5:24 - [Very nice.](http://i.imgur.com/jUpOfxv.jpg) Hey, you know what else is beautiful? [Uchouten Kazoku.](http://i.imgur.com/HbmoeBS.jpg) Yes, I will be using these writeups to pursue my own devious agenda. Sue me

5:40 - [Interesting.](http://i.imgur.com/pQ1S2bO.jpg) Even the base ones arent so mindless after all

5:56 - [Jean gets full marks!](http://i.imgur.com/AaqEdYI.jpg) Keep it up, obvious best character

6:24 - [Well, thats kinda what you do when youve got a mole, lady](http://i.imgur.com/7dEWIFX.jpg). Really great tsundere frame there

7:43 - [Of *course!*](http://i.imgur.com/TV79A78.jpg)

Is it just me? Am I being too hard on this show? It really feels like its dragging out plot points, but I could just be justifying that old chestnut of an accusation, Hating Something Because Its Popular. I mean, I dont hate this show. Not at all - I dont think its great, but I dont have anything against it. Right now it just feels like its taking forever to get through stuff the audience obviously knows, and since only one thing is happening at a time, it feels extremely slow

8:14 - [Aside from Jean, all my favorite characters are the comic relief](http://i.imgur.com/M8ddFl3.jpg). Which is kind of funny, since the comic relief is normally by far my most hated character in virtually any anime. ...which might again be a poor reflection of my relationship with this show

9:19 - [yes Yes YES](http://i.imgur.com/QEjKXK0.jpg) Armin with the hard truths! Man, this is the kind of stuff I was waiting all last episode for

9:34 - [YESSSSS.](http://i.imgur.com/oHArhR5.jpg) THERES TOO MUCH AT STAKE FOR SELFISH EMPATHY. Man, took them an episode and a half, but we finally hit the actual lesson of last episode

10:12 - [Okay, I guess last episode is forgiven.](http://i.imgur.com/2cj9KWC.jpg) So much for wishy-washy feel-good shounen ethics. This is *war*

10:20 - [Couldnt have said it better myself.](http://i.imgur.com/BLsEk5j.jpg) Let the rabble chatter of right and wrong after our deeds have bought them [the breath they accuse us with](http://youtu.be/8EMLbKNcKww)

10:45 - [Oh thats just rude](http://i.imgur.com/rDq6h63.jpg)

13:14 - [He *is* pretty dreamy](http://i.imgur.com/aHLqKdA.jpg)

13:53 - [They are getting some lovely images out of this forest](http://i.imgur.com/Kfu2Kqa.jpg)

14:59 - [Be careful.](http://i.imgur.com/Hk0BWZ8.jpg) Thanks for that, Potato

16:02 - [Dat signature Levi spin](http://i.imgur.com/w2B9AlS.jpg)

17:29 - [Its not a pleasant job](http://i.imgur.com/IaMF7Up.jpg)

18:20 - [This is all actually coming together rather well.](http://i.imgur.com/IYg7v6c.jpg) Last arc basically set up the pieces, I guess, and this arc is the one where our characters are learning what this conflict really means, and what a soldier really is. Thats solid, and plays into the war-film angle that I think is one of this shows strongest tricks

20:19 - [Man that guy is good at flying backwards.](http://i.imgur.com/Rh0szKf.jpg) I like this post-adrenaline banter, too

**And Done**

Ooh, very solid finale. The transitions between Erwin and Levis group were well-directed, they created a nice false sense of security with the banter, and they built to the betrayal very smoothly. Solid episode in general, actually - the show got much more serious about its premise, and pushed the central characters towards an understanding of the "whats necessary for victory" idea that's definitely one of its richest possible thematic veins. Ready for the next one!

I am curious what you think of the character design in this show. Especially that of the characters faces, they are quite varied in structure and expressive, you often talk about that in Uchouten Kazoku. Shingeki has an extremely dramatic way of showing character expressions. Personally I think it fits with the style of show that it is, [but some people might get turned off](http://i.imgur.com/kpQQvq5.jpg) by it.

The show tends to use these heavily drawn lines on the faces to convey shadows, especially in shots like [this](http://i.imgur.com/BLsEk5j.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/IaMF7Up.jpg). I know it is a completely different style to Kazoku, but I feel it is great when used to show Fear, Guilt or Rage.
>> ARTICLE
I like the visual design in general, including the more distinctive facial structures you point out. And it's true, that complements the very pronounced lighting very well. I think my only complaint with the faces is that they're too often contorted into that one slack-jawed terror/despair expression, which is too generic and overused to really convey anything meaningful to me at this point. But I'm not really a fan of the "turn every knob up to 11" way this show handles emotional or dramatic moments in general, even though that was clearly a deliberate choice they made.

Is it possible for a monthly-released manga to speed up and become a weekly-released manga?

The reverse has certainly happened, but I would think it's best to let the author do whatever is comfortable to him, no?
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that SnK chapters are around 40/50 pages long, when regular weekly-released chapters are usually around 25 long max.

We might not want that. More stress, less time for drawing and plot planning...It might be a good thing for us fans in the short run but not in the long run. :\

What an epic episode... I kinda feel lucky that I actually read the manga before the anime was even announced so I never had to make that tough decision of whether to read the manga or not. If so, that would be fucking agonizing because of how perfectly cliffhanger-ed they do the anime. At the same time the anime would also be a lot more enjoyable so there's always a trade-off. 

Also there's been a severe lack of Mikasa these episodes, I was happy to see her face even if was for a few words.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this show is getting so damn exciting!!! Especially the ending of this episode, holy crap!! Love the part near the ending where they were talking about how some of them pissed their pants on the first mission and how eren asked if it sprayed everywhere in midair. Can't wait till next week!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really into manga, but I know mangas like Bleach come out weekly.  Is there any reason why AoT comes out monthly?

Edit:  Ahh, ok.  I guess it makes sense for the manga, it's a bit disappointing for the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is released in Bessatsu Shounen Magazine which is a monthly magazine. It could be that the author couldn't cope with releasing every week or that the editors decided that the material is more suited to a monthly serialization. Koudansha, the publishing company, also has a weekly magazine so I feel that the latter is more likely. Looking at Bessatsu's line-up, there's a bunch of dialogue heavy stuff such as Aku no Hana and Joshiraku. To keep readers interested, the monthly version, with its longer page length, would allow the author more flexibility in dealing with the ratio between dialogue and action. Fifteen pages isn't really adequate for the amount of dialogue in AoT. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely the reason why I read through the Manga after I caught up on the episodes, was worth it though. I wonder how long AOT can last at this clip before it potentially catches up to the Manga. Will they FMA 2003 this, because that would be disappointing 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually 20 chapters behind the manga right now, so it's close. I read a bunch of spoilers so I know what's going to happen, and I can't see them fitting it all into 5 episodes. It's probably going to be a big cliff hanger ending. 
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader I just noticed a major flaw in Ervin's tactics. Levy's group and Eren should have stayed with the rest of the Scouting Legion and would have been more safe, stronger in retaining the female titan and if needed Eren could transform and strenghten the forces of the Legion. Instead they moved FT's objective away, leaving the elite soldiers away from the battle. Ervin is smart, but sometimes makes a giant mistake.
>> ARTICLE
Is anyone else bothered that Levi's blades break and it shows him with new ones right away? I know he could have replaced them but the blades.  were back so fast he wouldn't have had time to replace them. 
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone seen [this](http://i.imgur.com/ghcevQZ) chick in the opening around 2:30. I'm willing to bet she is our titan.

Fairly certain that's Mikasa

Anyone know why it wouldn't come up like that? It happens from time to time for me for some strange reason :/
>> ARTICLE
The part that really trips people up about spoiler tags is either forgetting the /s or the " " marks inside the parentheses, if you miss either it may show up correctly for you in RES post preview, but still be just a link for everyone else.

I'm not sure why the RES preview post acts that way, but it's always wise to check the post once it is up.

I did check, that's how it came out :/

Are you running RES by chance? I have noticed some hiccups when it comes to subbreddit specific functions. Though spoiler tags exist in a lot of places, they seem to be a large culprit of errors of this type.

I'm not sure if there is any correlation, but it seems to be the only variable in cases like this.
>> ARTICLE
I think they just turned of their CSS or the "Use sub-reddit style", turning these off messes up spoiler tags.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I hand't thought about that, I supposed a streamlined browser, or certain settings either on your browser, on reddit, or RES could mess with how that tag shows up. Most likely some combination of these factors.

Which makes this more complicated than I thought.

You dun goofed with this post. Fix the spoiler tags.

Well, that's what you get from there being no spoiler markdown in reddit (ie built-in, not a subreddit hack. It might seem to work fine, but breaks as soon as subreddit styles is switched off (maybe because they are using a userstyle, and style conflicts), or one goes into a user's page: spoilers in full view!)

We don't know nearly enough to judge her (or most of the character honestly). As someone who reads Game of Thrones and Walking Dead ive learned to not judge characters, it just makes you judgemental and you end up hating characters based on self-confirmation bias alone which is dumb :/

Even the manga doesn't drop that much background on her.

Some great art, though I notice a lot of them try to downplay her larger nose...
>> ARTICLE
And give her larger breasts.

Some of those are way too cutesy for Annie, and it seems a lot of artists took liberties with her nose. That said, they're all fantastic, just some of them don't really look like Annie.

after browsing [thousands](http://i44.tinypic.com/r9r5ac.jpg) of SnK pics you run into all [sorts](http://i44.tinypic.com/j5a03p.jpg).. i do have a limit where i don't consider what i see as "Annie" though.

There are a lot which look more like Christa or Christa and Annie's love unexplainable love child.

There are some artists that draw fanart of certain characters.

There are other artists who draw the same girl over and over with different hairstyle and clothing.

This is usually the case only with the more inexperienced artists. They are afraid to draw out of their comfort zone cause it will look bad.

That happens in 90% of mangas and 60% of comics, it's pretty dumb really but i guess it makes the whoel process faster

Before anyone says anything here. I want to warn you all to use spoiler tags before talking about episode 23.

It's really disappointing how many otherwise good artists opt to forgo her distinguishing nose and draw her like a blonde barbie.

I'm kind of disappointed by how many artists didn't bother to give her her distinctive big, hook nose - its not exactly a traditionally beautiful feature, but it's part of Annie's profile so not seeing it seems weird. Oh well.

here's the big question

do they ever get the chance to have that meat?
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I actually rewatched the scenes in question to see how feasible this would be and found some inconsistencies.

You see Sasha put the meat in one of the two crates, both of which have a lid.  But when you see the crates near Eren a moment later, the crates are completely open.

Assuming the latter is correct, it is not only likely the meat got blown out of the crate and who knows where down the wall, but it's likely covered in dirt (not that it would matter to Sasha or the rest).

SO MANY SPOILERS

^/s
>> ARTICLE
People have criticized Eren for being too focused on the Titans, to the extent of lacking other significant character traits, but I thought it was really cool how he basically single-handedly convinced most of the rest of the top 10 to take the fight to the Titans instead of wasting humanity's best talent hiding in a bunker, so to speak.

Then shit hit the fan, of course, but I'll eat my hat if the way Eren helped his comrades prepare mentally for the inevitability of an attack doesn't help them all along the road.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's his defining characteristic. He's a zealot. He's not terribly bright, he's not gifted physically and his skills aren't too out of the norm. He is just so god damn dedicated to his goal. I always think it's stupid when people dismiss him because that's the "only" thing he has.
>> ARTICLE
He's the best at hand to hand combat
>> ARTICLE
...After he just got handed his ass by Annie in the episode?
>> ARTICLE
Well, let me refrain myself, he is the best hand to hand by the end of the military school, in the anime they didn't point this out, but in the manga, when Jean and Eren fight they (other students) stated that Eren is the best hand to hand, he even has Annie teaching him as you can see in some flashback in chapter 17 and 44, so yes.

[Here the pic where she tells Eren that she'll train him](http://i.imgur.com/Gw7BHTf.png)
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]

Probably, actually if they didn't show the training arc before the first attack. It was a flash back after the first Titan Attack and Eren has a Flash Back with Annie in the last manga chapter too, so yeah, later they gonna show more of their relationship. 
>> ARTICLE
>rephrase myself

FTFY. And yeah, that wasn't really clear in the episode, I just assumed the move he used on the guy in their argument was something he picked up from his fight with Annie, there was no real clear implication that he would actually be able to beat her.
>> ARTICLE
Annie used feet. 

Ref??? Ref??? 
>> ARTICLE
He also seems to be adaptable and a fast learner. This is shown when he performs the takedown on that guy in the mess hall (name escapes me) that Annie used on him only a few hours before, which surprised even her.
>> ARTICLE
>I always think it's stupid when people dismiss him because that's the "only" thing he has.

I agree with this, he made the freggin top ten of the graduating class.  Even if he wasn't gifted, he's clearly progressed to the point where he's above average.

Read the manga and SnK does not preach about friendship bullshit like most shonen manga. It takes the MuvLuv Alternative path and makes you question about [humanity's stupidity](http://i.imgur.com/tps5ibW.jpg) at their most desperate situations.
>> ARTICLE
His utter disdain towards the titans is another great character trait of his. It doesn't show up in translation, I think, but whenever Eren says that he'll wipe out/exterminate the Titans, he says "," (not a single one left)-- "," a Japanese counter word that you would only use on small animals or rodents. He just hates them so much sometimes it's kind of comical.

Honestly I don't recall ever feeling this long of a wait for any other anime.  Perhaps it's because new episodes get released on a weekend instead of a weekday? When a show aired in mid week at least I had a weekend to distract me from the wait.

Either that or the show is just too damn good.  The last few minutes of this episode definitely got my blood boiling.

Sasha is turning out to be the best minor character so far. She may be the butt of a lot of the jokes, but she is proving to be completely badass when it counts.

FMA had those scenes to remind you of the susceptibility of the characters, while SnK needs no proof to do that I believe.  I think it's exactly what we'll be seeing in the next episode.

Fellow Manga readers, please don't say anything. Not even something like "it's explained, but I won't reveal it!". Frankly it's annoying and doesn't add anything. At the time of writing a good number of the comments are just saying things will be explained later. Let the anime only people speculate themselves.

Anyway, I can't wait to listen to the OST. The OP doesn't even need to be mentioned for how awesome it is at this point, but we've had two songs so far with actual lyrics. (and in english!) I'm certainly hoping they continue with that kind of thing.

Also, seeing the 3Dgear being used in an animation is fantastic. I can't wait to get to the ass-kicking next episode.

[Manga Spoiler](/s "If it ends where I'm assuming it would, for cliffhanger purposes, the anime only watchers will likely shit themselves")

Again, please don't spoil anything manga readers. I'm trying to be vague in my spoiler. We've all been victims of accidental spoilers, don't ruin it for others.
>> ARTICLE
It's terrible. It's like people with Game of Thrones.

"Wow, so and so is awesome."

"I'm sorry"

Fuck off, stop ruining that shit.
>> ARTICLE
everyone just needs to say yes when they ask the question we all know they are going to ask
>> ARTICLE
People also need to be patient with the show as the 'plot holes' become answered in time.  I keep seeing comments suggesting that everything should be understood immediately.

Given the popularity of the manga and the length of the series, I haven't been worried about it myself.
>> ARTICLE
I hope wit studio gets blessed with continued budget raises and pump out sequels fast because I am already losing my mind thinking about how I'll lose my mind waiting
>> ARTICLE
What's even more amazing to me, if you try to play along with the OP, you'll notice that the riff and verse is the same melody (with some key change) repeated milliions of time.  The chorus is the same thing, with a slightly varied melody repeated bar after bar basically.  It's the *arrangement* of the musical score that made the OP sound so awesome, and amazing what they made out of 2 simple 1-bar melodies with slight variation.

While we're on the topic of music, I just want to point out the theme of the OP and ED is so dead-on with this show, I'm left awe-struck every time I think about it.  The OP lyrics is obviously referencing what Eren said in the first episode, and the ED lyrics is obvious to manga readers.  The songs are wonderfully written to boot.

And I agree, I can't wait for the OST.  Top-notch soundtracks from start to finish.  I so love this series right now.
>> ARTICLE
"Mikasa? su casa!"

...Fucker...LOL.

>It's the arrangement of the musical score that made the OP sound so awesome

You mean all the orchestra behind the band? I really how like the air instruments, the strings and the loud percussion mix together with the very motivating lyrics.

And yeah, OP is Eren's thoughts, ED is Mikasa's thoughts.

[I made a thread warning about this topic but it went ignored.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1cfmtb/just_read_shingeki_no_kyojin_mangas_latest/)

Read the manga as a vaccine to the upcoming spoilers. But these threads have been way better than SAO threads when it comes to that. I could count the "OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SECOND ARC!!11" comments by the dozens in each of those early SAO threads.

Still, I agree that this attitude: "Shut up it'll be explained. Don't speculate because it'll be explained. That's theory is stupid because it'll be explained. I want to spoil you but I won't because it'll be explained". It's fucking annoying.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I think I'm either going to read the manga or just avoid these threads from now on. Maybe I or someone else will make an anime-only thread next week. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I really think there needs to be separate threads for anime only and for manga. Cause the manga readers are holding back and the anime only people are getting vague and hints and spoilers  
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, but as a manga reader, the last 3 threads have been super sketchy. There were either outright spoilers not labeled as spoilers or people weren't being careful with tenses and certain word choices that actually reveals quite bit even though they think it might not. This thread has been somewhat better but there was still one spoiler that wasn't labeled. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.  Sometimes it's hard to resist answering people asking questions with obvious answers (to you) in a vague and non-revealing way.  Personally I tag everything that is remotely a spoiler, but sometimes it's the unintended ones that escapes us the most.

Just like the top comment right now about the colossal titan.  If nobody knew the answer you'd damn right expect there to be lots of speculations but it's highly possible there's no real answer to be revealed in the future at all.  But now we get "it'll be explained", which implies there's actual *reason* behind it.  It'll spoil the fun for the smarter audience who are good at catching stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I mean, I'm not even responding to questions like this because even if it is tagged with a spoiler, it will completely ruin the story for them, especially if one of them accidently mouses over it. Some of the spoilers for this manga are just insane.

Damn, another epic ending. Its definitely hyped for a reason.

I'm liking the animation style more and more. They're doing a really good job of making the characters look scary when they're angry: Annie during training, the drill sergeant peeking in to see what the noise was, and Eren in the last shot.

Some of the animation is nice, but the stills are frustrating. Between Sasha's reaction to Mikasa eating the bread in the last episode, and the sequence with Annie fighting Eren and Reiner, the use of stills really kills the moment.

Why are stills called stitches?

Because they are stitched video frames. From [this](http://imgur.com/a/0ZJoM) to [this](http://i4.minus.com/iboWK3EfPwPDGK.jpg).

Non-manga reader: At first I was a bit worried about character overload. I know we've seen some of these in the previous episode, but giving them all names and personality traits, and then still having other characters who weren't in that top 10 list or named at the beginning show up was a little overwhelming. 

However, considering the end, I don't think it will be a problem anymore. At least I hope not. If I had to tell you what characters have stuck with me and why, it would be the main 3 (Eren, Armin, and Mikasa), Sasha (Potato Girl), Jean (grey hair and wants to join Military police), Connie (because he's short and buzzcut), and Annie (badass blond with a sharp nose). 

Characters who haven't stuck with me: I can't remember the name of the dependable blond guy in the top 10, and I don't really remember anything about the two brunette guys in the top 10. There's another blond girl in the top 10 who I remember helped Sasha last episode, but I didn't see her this episode (I thought she was Annie at first). Then there was several other characters who spoke (like the "married couple"), or were even named (like Samuel, the guy who Sasha saved). 

This is just my impression, and anyone's mileage may vary. Perhaps as the show goes on, I'll get more familiar with the ensemble cast (if it matters), but it's pretty rare for me to really be overwhelmed by the number of characters.
>> ARTICLE
It's only 4 episodes in, we'll get use to it! 
>> ARTICLE
Well the big 3 are pretty much the main cast while the "top 10" recur pretty often. But still this story has a ton of characters that come and go. And by go I mean... yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Hah, I think I'm doing pretty much exactly as well as you are - main three, jerkwad, potato, buzzcut, brutal girl, nice blond guy from ep 3 who I should remember better.

I may have a problem with names.

I thought that as well less damage if they broke in but after reading more into the manga you can guess why they didn't have more walls. Sorry if that doesn't help can't go into more detail without spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
"The fools, if only they had built it with six thousand and one hulls! When will they learn?!"
>> ARTICLE
You may have forgotten as it appeared **very** early in episode 1 - with that preacher rambling and yelling at others - but the main religion in the circle-town-whatever-it's-called basically considers the Walls to be "holy" and as such trying to do any modification is basically heresy and even adding new guns takes a lot of red tape.

Keep in mind that 50-meter tall walls that look to be 10-30m thick takes an enormous amount of resources to build; perhaps they didn't have enough material within the walls' boundaries to construct those enhancements? Not to mention that the outer walls are something like (~5-600km? The chart in the 1st ep is either off or the math is wrong) in diameter... that's *enormous!* 
>> ARTICLE
The diameter distribution is hilarious. Each wall defends 1/3 of the human territory. So, from space, it should look like this:

[Center - Military Police]

|Innermost Wall|

|Inner Wall - Kicked in EP4|

.

|Outer Wall - Kicked in EP1|
>> ARTICLE
Yep - the author/animator ***failed*** math class - in the diagrams given the outer area looked to hold roughly 45-55% of the entire land mass... 

Though I'm not sure exactly on that % as I haven't done any math, but it looks to hold a *lot* of territory percentage-wise!
>> ARTICLE
I remember reading a note from the author that the walls were too big to draw in scale in a manga page. It's more of an issue on how non-proportional are most of the walls representations in the anime/manga.

[Here's a good shot from EP1.](http://i.imgur.com/vTxvt2k.jpg) The subs don't make too much sense (250km is not nearly identical to 100km), but  at least it seems that the math makes some sense.

This episode really did a good job of bridging the end of their training to the beginning of all the action, way better than how the manga handled it.

This anime still stands strong above the rest for sheer epic-ness. I love all the scenes and the other character trainees are starting to shine through.  Sasha fart! lol... and just Sasha herself is terrific. Eren's determination still shines through which makes me really enjoy his character and I don't know if I could ever not like Mikasa. Keep going strong Titan anime, the real action begins next week and if its anything like we saw near the end of this episode I'm sure it will be great. Also gotta remark the Levy character looks interesting.

On a side note, which scene seemed scarier to you :P

When I saw the scene from which you got your second screencap, I imagined the CT saying, "Did somebody say meat? Can I have some?"

My thought. Lesson of this episode: Meat is bait for titans.

Well, humans are made mostly of meat.

Yes, but often hidden under a layer of clothes and dirt. Some fresh clean good smelling piece is just a better bait, because it works instantly as proofed ;)

I just watched all 4 Episodes in one go after (for some reason i can't figure out) I didn't pick this up at the start of the season. 

I can't help but feel sorry for you guys who have had to wait a week in between each episode, that shit must have been torturous. 

Basically i'm fucking speechless, literally everything in this anime is fantastic. The very *very* rare comedy, which isn't for comedy's sake, but to highlight the growing camaraderie, the frankly epic 3D move machines, everything. 

The bit where he was so close to panicking at the end, i was hoping with everything i could muster that he would switch and take control and he delivered with that final scene. 

Edit: The end of the op when they are all jumping above the rooftops. Shivers every single time. 

What else is there to say, we're in for a treat guys. 
>> ARTICLE
So what chapter in the manga is this right now? With a 26 episode season, I was wondering how things will line up.
>> ARTICLE
They're sort of doing the chapters out of order, because the training parts were done as flashbacks in the manga (for no reason at all, it continually fucked up the flow of the story). I'm glad they did it in real time instead of a few flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
The anime went a bit out of order. The training stuff from last episode and this one was chapters 15, 16, and 17, and the last part of this episode was chapter 3. The first two episodes covered chapters 1 and 2.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha. Think I should read the manga now? I had one thing about the titans spoiled for me.
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in the story and can still watch an anime fully knowing what's going to happen, definitely go for it.

I say that because it'd be much better to spoil the anime for yourself than to have others spoil it for you.  The story is too good to let others ruin it for you.

I read all the chapters to-date, and I am still enjoying the heck out of the anime.  I can't speak for you personally, but for me there's still lots of fun seeing the anime transition and hearing the fabulous VA and OST.
>> ARTICLE
Do whatever you want. The anime won't cover the whole manga of course, so I don't think it really matters when you read it.

This might be too late to get noticed, but can anyone explain, or link me to an explanation of the 3D gear? 

[Here's a good pic I got from the episode](http://i.imgur.com/w67ePH4.jpg) for reference.

I *kind of* get it, but there's a lot to their rig that is a mystery to me. It looks like the anchors are fired using gas combustion and then they just Spiderman using those, but why are the swords connected by wire too?

And what's in the big rectangle boxes on their thighs? It looks like that's where they get their swords from, but there seem to be other metal objects in the boxes. In addition, the swords themselves seem to have [some sort of handle](http://i.imgur.com/OvsHRrm.jpg) (like a bicycle break). 

And I see the gas chambers on top of the boxes, so those must be for the anchors. 


>> ARTICLE
The manga has released some details on how it works (Kinda). I'm pretty sure the anime will show it as well later on in the show. But if you want to know now, goto http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Three_Dimensional_Maneuver_Gear and click on the two images there. Those were the pages shown in the manga (Not sure if that's all of them)

edit: In fact, both of those pages were revealed right where this week's episode ended. [Link to the exact manga page](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/6241/shingeki-no-kyojin_v1_ch3_by_gantz-waitingroom/44)
>> ARTICLE
Their swords are pretty much box-cutters. The sheat contains replacements for their blades that break and go dull.

Compressed gas fires the anchor and it also uses gas to retract them. That's why at the end of this episode, Eren's gear left a trail of gas while spinning around even if he wasn't anchored to anything.

Really loving how the anime actually presents things in a logical chronological order, as opposed to the myriad flashbacks that are used in the manga. Honestly, some of the ways flashbacks were incorporated in the manga were unnecessary and confusing. 

Looking back, actually, there is one conversation that I wish the anime hadn't truncated, but so far this adaptation has exceeded my expectations. Love it.

Animation is top notch, loving this show. Only thing that worries me is it turning into a monologue anime with 2 mins of action which is resolved 3 mins into the next episode with the remaining minutes given over to more long monologues. I hope this next ep is 100% Titan action, lets see Eren's words put into action

That last two minutes is perfect to suck anyone into watching this. I know a guy who would totally watch this if he had time for it.

[Those eyes!!](http://i.imgur.com/OokStfM.jpg)

I mean really what is up with Mikasa's eyes? I know quality is lower when they have to draw people from further away but those eyes!!
>> ARTICLE
Last episode displayed a couple new strengths that both surprised me and gave me a good deal of hope for the show going forward  an ability to pull off great jokes using melodramatic direction tricks, and a genre savviness towards classic war films that led to great, evocative story-sharing and character-building scenes between the recruits. It was definitely my favorite episode yet, and has raised my expectations for this show kinda considerably. Now we just need to see how these new tricks hold up when the Titans come knocking.

**Episode 4**

0:15  Categorizing them as the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan instantly made me think of Shadow of the Colossus. This is a good thing

0:52  Where have I seen this OP before? Oh right, on everything

4:04  I think I'm just a total sucker for these strategic assessment styles of battle-anime, but I'm loving this stuff

5:25  Yeah, this stuff just kills it for me. I love character analysis, and when that's actually put to narrative purpose by having some mastermind character critically assess the usefulness of a core cast... well, let's just say I had a really fun time with Code Geass

8:15 - Sometimes a soldier can't back down... *like right now!* -faceplant-

Were there this many jokes in the manga? I really like how the show is balancing drama and release at the moment, but it's a very different rhythm from the first act  I guess those first two episodes were basically supposed to act as a prologue of the level of tension we'll eventually build back up to.

9:47  I'm really liking this stuff. They established her personality and worldview in no time during a pretty exciting sparring match that also furthered Eren's own thinking. Very tidy storytelling

12:30  Yeah, this show's JoJo as fuck. Applying the exact same level of dramatic action-line pans and close-ups to this whole 'Safe living is a farce!' 'Fuck you buddy!' *'Cool it idiots.'* '...okay Mikasa.' *'Goddamnit I'm so jealous!*' scene pretty much proves to me that this show is utterly in control of its own seriousness level, and is happily riding the we love this scenario and are utterly committed to it, but fuck you if we don't get to have some fun with it too line

13:05  Oh Sasha, you beautiful bastard you

14:10  Once again, this show uses the we'll be right back screens (what's the actual word for them?) to impart some actually interesting, specific information. A good trick. Also, I extend my deepest sympathies towards the few members of that top ten who haven't already received a few scenes' worth of characterization. Your sacrifice will not be in vain

15:07  I paused here just to actually check the manga and make sure I hadn't somehow skipped chapters, but... yeah, unless there are huge flashbacks beyond the point I read to, pretty much all this training stuff was just added for the anime. *Awesome.* So happy to see an adaptation actually get ambitious and try to think how to best serve the core concept, not just how to directly translate the original text. All of this training stuff has been great, and has served so well to establish a diverse set of characters that I already have some attachment to. Excellent, excellent work

-edit- Other commenters have informed me this stuff actually does show up, just much later on. In that case, I'm very happy they moved it earlier - I really appreciate knowing and having some vested interest in all these characters before the shit hits the fan

16:36 - I don't care if I die so long as I can be useful. Well maybe using that big analytical brain of yours instead of feeding it directly to a Titan would actually serve that purpose kinda well, Armin

18:07  No side characters stop being happy that means you gonna diiiiieeeee

19:30  YES! POTATO LIVES!

I don't why I ever doubted her. Good to have you with us, Potato

**AND DONE**

JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS EPIC. Oh man was that ending ever fucking amazing. Timing on the Colossal Titan appearance: amazing. Potato's epic heroism in saving Samuel: amazing. Eren's totally badass taking control of the situation as the music crescendo'd: amazing.

I had my doubts before, but this episode was *so fucking good.* I loved the end of the training, I loved the ways they established a core set of recon troupes that I already know and care about, I loved the mix of self-aware humor, JoJo-esque winking drama, and legitimately effective badass drama, the visual style is still really solid...

Okay, this show has entirely proven itself to me. That was sweet. Can't wait for the next one.

> unless there are huge flashbacks beyond the point I read to, pretty much all this training stuff was just added for the anime.

Yeah the training arc was a flashback later. It's good that they added that here for more coherence but it's a shame some parts got removed because of it.

>Were there this many jokes in the manga? I really like how the show is balancing drama and release at the moment, but it's a very different rhythm from the first act  I guess those first two episodes were basically supposed to act as a prologue of the level of tension we'll eventually build back up to.

I get this feeling that after the first two episodes of just pure adrenal terror situations these last two episodes did a good job of slowing things down for a moment. Five years passed in the show and by slowing down and throwing in plenty of humor and character development during the training it helped to impart a sense of calm that sort of helps the viewer relate how humanity is getting back to normal. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the pacing of the last two episodes did a good job to imply how humanity had started to forget how easily they were overrun and how willing and ready they were to just get back to business as usual (And to forget about losing a quarter of their entire population). At least that's the sense I got looking back.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really like the semi-tense but still hopeful status quo these episodes created. I think they did a ton of work in general - how much they established the characters, the relationships *between* the characters, all their various battle-related specialties (hell, even Potato's crazy rescue stunt was foreshadowed by their instructor describing her as an improvising loose cannon), how their system of combat works, the way their backgrounds have filled out my understanding of their world...

I have gained a whole damn lot of respect for this show over these past two episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Fyi, there were massive flashbacks in the manga.  It makes sense since a manga can't go into backstory in its third chapter considering how cutthroat the manga industry is and that this is a monthly manga.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually going to add a little spiel about this after checking the other comments, but I figured it was too off-topic. But I completely agree, it really sucks that manga just can't afford to employ certain kinds of storytelling based on their issue-to-issue commercial nature, and it's very nice that the anime crew realized the drama would come off much more effectively if you already cared about the characters when the Titans came back

I thought the same thing, but isn't the word order backwards? The word for "Attack/Assault" comes first, implying that the Attack is the thing that owns the Titans. As weird as it sounds, I think the title literally translates to "Attack's Titans" or "The Titans of Attack." Taken a little less literally, I could see how "Attack on Titan" could make sense.
>> ARTICLE
Thats Commies reasons for how they've subbed things however Attack on Titan is whats being used from official sources.

I worry that the the anime will beat the manga and that the writers will expand on it on by themselves, either way I am sure it will be a good watch.
>> ARTICLE
Nah don't think so. 5 chapters +- 1 for 4 episodes. For 2 cours it'd be about a bit over 30 chapters. Manga already had over 40
>> ARTICLE
This might be my most favorite episode so far just because of the amount of 3D gear action we have seen. We can definitely expect the next few episodes to be one hell of an arc.  CAN'T WAIT!

Lots of character development here as well. It seems like they are making certain characters shine among the others which is really great! Ryner and Annie right now seem to be the most likable ones alongside Mikasa. ("Sir. It was Sasha's fart."X))) 

I'm really liking how they switched around the arcs from the manga. It really allows you to be more involved with the characters.

while I've read part of the manga, I have to say Eren is the most infuriating character I've ever watched. All he does is yell at people and be a little bitch. I was so excited for this anime considering gantz and berserk got me back into anime after 10+ years. I've never wanted to see a main character die so badly since school days. (fingers crossed)

Yeah, you need to read the manga. The story is not going in the direction you think it is going.

I'm getting real tired of shit like Eren's little spiels every five seconds. I like this anime, and the manga is cool too, but the writing can be really, really terrible at times. The melodrama can come out of nowhere, and it's so damn jarring. And I don't care if Eren is a little zealot, it still makes for shit characterization, just like almost all melodrama.

Like whenever he saw the guard captain, "Hey old friend-o congrats on the promotion. "Oh lol thanks man sorry I let your mom die." *Dramatic* *eyes* "It's cool, I'm a big kid now." So, so, so very stupid.
>> ARTICLE
I like how the first thing he thought of was, it's my chance and didn't panic, just dragged himself up and made a sick twist summersault.

My only doubt for this show is if eren will turn back to the way he was because of despair or something along that. I also don't like how mikasa babbys him, it's so emasculating as a viewer.

Do you read the manga? because if you don't there is a flashback and what happens in that flashback makes you all like... Well shit if that happened to me I wouldn't even let him leave my sight for a millisecond

Does anyone else not understand how from the get-go the main force lost a whopping 1/5 of their troops when the most combative part of their half of the mission seemed to basically be dangling in the air and luring the Titans from safe heights? Might need some clarity on this one since not everything was being shown...

With that said, Mikasa continues to be badass (Perhaps a bit blindly so when it comes to Eren).
>> ARTICLE
I'm alarmed by how fast they're constantly losing troops. Unless birth rates are insanely high, I don't know how maintaining a military will be possible in the future.
>> ARTICLE
It's not often that you have to fight so many titans, especially within the city. Id say probably twice so far in the past 100 years
>> ARTICLE
But if they lost a fifth of their troops in a relatively lower-risk mission like this when the goal isn't to engage Titans but to play bait, how will they deal with the actual fighting later on? I feel like the mangaka wanted to make the mission seem really high-profile by using the 20% casualty number, but it just seems nonsensical to me. 
>> ARTICLE
Those are the reserve troops or trainees, the elites are in the inner circle or still returning back from the mission. Also as Jean has showed things could go south very quickly
>> ARTICLE
But when the soldiers actually fight in the city, they have the advantage because tall buildings allow for optimum use of 3DMG. Once they're outside the gates, the terrain won't be ideal for fighting Titans at all. I guess it's a good thing Eren's a Titan because the odds are so lopsided against humanity.
>> ARTICLE
yeah.... you make a good point. there's trees is some places but they have no chance to fight in an open area
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they mention early in the series that horses were kept alive while 20% of the human population was thrown at the titans due to lack of food because of the horses being able to out-speed a titan?
>> ARTICLE
damn.
>> ARTICLE
they did mention luring the titans to the wall. i imagine (from experience luring animals at grandmas and stuff..) they exposed themselves to danger - the point of the whole Mibani? team's showcasing to running up the wall.

titans won't just clog together in one place without giving up if there isn't some teasing.
>> ARTICLE
You see, it just took one soldier to say "LEEEEEROOOOOOOOOY MJENNNNNKINNNNNNS".
>> ARTICLE
But even from the clips that were shown a lot of the soldiers were merely hanging out in the air along the wall...but now that I think about it maybe persons were needed to actually go deep into the town to ensure that all the Titans followed them to the corner, hence leading to casualties.

Edit: But then again Jean and Annie and co. seemed to be doing that as a last resort as seen in the latter half of this ep?? So I don't know any more.

It was moving at a good pace and then this episode just kindof killed it for me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this episode, though good on a stand-alone basis, was a disappointment. I was expecting that damn hole to be filled in this episode. Between the two minutes of pointless recap at the start (do they think we have Alzheimer's or something?!), and the several minutes of looking at people's faces, paning screens, and other useless content, we didn't have all that much plot progression anywhere in this episode, on any count. Honestly, the most significant event in my opinion was Mikasa blushing when she was told to "save her boyfriend."

It's honestly fucking ridiculous that they put in two minutes of recap per episode, **and** plan on having all of episode 14 be a recap. I mean, really? I'd prefer to have interviews with [Hajime Isayama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Isayama) in those first two minutes over this shit. I don't need freaking recaps to remember the storyline.

To those who bring up the lack of manga content, I am 100% OK with the anime having a shortened number of episodes, or alternately, we could have filler content, which I wouldn't mind if it was done well.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't just slowing down for the sake of dragging it out - if they kept up the pace of the earlier episodes they were on track to catch up with the manga. They had to pack as much as possible into the first few episodes to catch everyone's attention, but in the long term, the question ends up being would you rather slow episodes or a skipped season/lots of filler? It seems like the producers chose a slower pace. Then again, this episode has (iirc) the first significant amount of filler content of any episode so far. The mini-side story with Jean's gear malfunctioning isn't in the manga (or at least, not in nearly as much detail).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's correct. It's already impossible for the anime to cover all of the material currently released in the manga from what I've seen. They seem to be keeping to the same pacing as the manga as before, the manga also took basically an entire chapter for the same amount of detail, however obviously reading it makes it feel like it's moving at a faster pace than watching it at a set 24 minute increment
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad they did it this way. This episode was all about the question "How far would Armin and Mikasa go for Eren's sake, even if he failed them and disappointed them in the worst possible way?". I think it dealt with that masterfully. It wasn't about people fighting Titans this time. It was about people fighting themselves.

(The answer, of course, is "To hell and back".)

A few more minutes of Titan-fighting would have been nice, of course. What the hell is Levi up to at this point?
>> ARTICLE
>What the hell is Levi up to at this point?

every time they mentioned "Elite troops" this was on my mind. where the fuck is Rivaille and wth is he doin? since they did show him once.. i assume he will show up dramatically at the season end and have some sort of gigantic Code Geass S1 Suzaku intervention moment.. or not?

They got word that the Titans had invaded after their own battle, and Irvin orders them to retreat (episode 9) So I imagine that they'll be showing up soon.

On the other hand, I bet a lot of people would *really* be complaining if it, say, had a faster pacing and caught up with the manga, going beyond it and eventually damaging the quality of the story, like many animes have done.
>> ARTICLE
This episode is filled with fillers. Reading the manga in this arc was a lot more exciting.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with that point, but it (the anime) actually seems to be following the manga pacing about right... it's been about a chapter and a half or so per episode. This is no exception. It's just faster to read the chapters than watch them (reading a chapter takes a couple minutes, but the episode is 24)

I'd be fine with it if they did more character development to go along with it, but they aren't. Its just people talking about the plan and being afraid of death. Everyone just goes on and on about how afraid they are of death, but no one has presented a motivation for living save for Erin, Misaka, and to a lesser extent, Armin. The characters from training camp really should have had their motivations fleshed out more by now rather than just saying that they want to be in the inner walls or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Do humans need a reason to be afraid of death? A big motif in the show seems to be the arbitrary desire for humans to survive despite what the world throws at them.
>> ARTICLE
No, but I need some reason for them to want to be alive. Being afraid of death is bland, I want to see what you care about, what you're passionate about, the one thing that you care about in this dark world, and I want to see you fight and struggle for it. If I don't get that, and its just "I could die anytime now, I'm so afraid of dying" every episode, then I'm not going to care about the character or the world, especially when every character spouts it. Isn't this military of theirs voluntary? No one got drafted, they should all have reasons and motivations to getting into the army. Titans should have done shit to their families and their towns, but we only here about Erin and his "I have to kill all the Titans because they killed my mom" motivation.
>> ARTICLE
Best soundtrack in a single episode of the year. One of the best soundtracks contained within a single episode I've heard in a long while, especially for a non final-episode episode.

Man. Gotta love that Gregorian music overtones.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man... Alright. I think I have an *idea* of what's going on.

I think that the Titan are just humans sleeping inside the Titan body. Just look at it. When Armin was smashing Eren's Titan body, all Eren saw was him smashing on his house window. Everything seemed fine to Eren. Perhaps once the human inside the Titan body falls asleep completely, the Titan then takes control and does whatever it wants.

The only main question I have, is how the hell are there so many Titans? I assumed from previous episodes that all Titans are humans. But doesn't that mean that humans would have to be turned into Titans some way? And if it's "you get killed by one, you become one", type scenario, how come all the other humans in the stomach of the titan Eren was eaten by didn't become Titan? And even if they did, does that mean that there are humans outside the walls getting eaten by Titans and being constantly reproduced? 

Gah, so many questions.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe there's a fourth wall way out in the wilderness and a bunch of people are still living on top? Maybe outside that wall there's another faction of humanity and they just let the titans roam around between the fourth and third as guard dogs? Or they baited all the titans between the third and fourth, then slipped out and closed the gate behind them and they've since been trying to rescue the rest of humanity, which is providing fodder for the titans. 

The titan producing phenomenon might just be a bacteria or parasitic plant type thing that lives in the digestive tract of titans, that could reconstruct a useful version of a human in the droppings of titans. Kinda like mistletoe. 

Edit: oh, do they shit?


>> ARTICLE
Also, it seems like the people inside the Titans get to live some kind of ideal dream life. For Eren, it was living with his family.

Maybe the Titans are powered by human dreams or souls or whatever?
>> ARTICLE
I think it was more likely just the shock and fatigue making him hallucinate rather than a built-in feature.

Titans are pilotless bioweapons. They eat looking for a pilot. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the only reason Eren could become a Titan in the first place was because his dad injected him with something.

>> ARTICLE
I think that's it.. But I mean it can't be a coincidence that Eren came out of the same spot that the Titan's weak spot is. I have another theory.. But this one is extremely outlandish.What if the Titans are in control of themselves? What if the Titans are just a separate human civilization that wants that territory? I mean, in episode 11, Dot Pixis says that if there were a larger threat to mankind, mankind would unite. Maybe the "Titan Project", to make mankind unite, was abused. What if a group of people used the Titan's power for their own gain?This is probably unlikely but I wanted to share anyway.
>> ARTICLE
If the titans were fully controlled by humans I would expect their plan of attack to be better than "bump ineffectively against the walls hoping human snacks come down so I can eat them"
>> ARTICLE
Well, this Episode, we've seen that Eren couldn't control his Titan because he was in a dreamlike state. Maybe the humans in the Titans are in that same state, and the humans that want the territory are exploiting the Titan's natural ability to eat humans? That way the humans in the Titan's get a nice dream, while they let the Titan body do all the work.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say he was ever in control (at least not yet, maybe once he learns the truth?) of the titan.... What I think, is that when he turns into a titan his strongest thoughts and emotions is what takes over him.... Like the first time, he was thinking very strongly he had to kill them all, so when he turned he killed all titans in his path.... Last episode we saw his attitude towards Mikasa and how he hates to be treated as a kid.... I say that he was holding onto that grudge more than closing the wall itself so when he turned into the titan he instantly attacked her

Yeah, it's really slowed down. I got antsy about three weeks and read ahead just a couple dozen pages in the manga, and we're *still* behind where I got to.

Thanks for keeping this tally though!
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga. I do not mind the pacing of the anime. I enjoy watching the dramatization and the voice acting put into each episode that is almost page per page of the manga. I rather have it close to the story told than butchering it all up where it does not make any sense at all. More kick of the feels. Just saying. 
>> ARTICLE
Hm... having read some other comments, I guess my abilities as a critic have been somewhat stunted. A lot of people seem to have found the episode dull and uneventful. And I can see how people would think that, since it can essentially be summed up in "Eren was pretty out of it for a while but then began to get his shit together thanks to Armin"... But I just can't see it that way because I cared. I was worried that Jean was going to be eaten. Though I knew it just wasn't narratively possible, I still cringed when Arming stabbed the titan just in case he killed Eren... Maybe I've gotten too involved to be a good impartial judge, but perhaps that's precisely the quality needed to make a truly great show.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, most people expected the show to have the same fast action of the early episodes. So slowing down just to show so little per episode is indeed annoying. I mean, if you watch the opening music, you are prepared for action, not emos in ilusiions for 20 minutes.

no my friend, you're watching it as you should. take the time to let the whole experience seep in instead of mindless constant action that would lead to disbelief over the character's thought processes and emotional states.

everyone else is just typical shonen-action pacing lovers.. not that there's anything wrong with that but it's clearly not the case.

Nice of you to hand out a label to everyone who does not share your opinion of an episode.
>> ARTICLE
almost every episode's thread unless eren does something the main theme is "nothing is happening, progress too slow". have your label and stick with it. name one anime that had nonstop action and didn't sacrifice character development for it.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with your labeling is that you misrepresented people, like myself. I don't need action to be satisfied. Did Haruhi S1 have classic shonen scenes? Did Bakemonogatari have constant action? What about Maou sama? Or Chihayafuru? Or Mushishi?

No. But they were still good. 

Because non-"action" can be good. The quality of SnK's in action scenes are long, drawn out, and boring. Character development can be ENTERTAINING.

The first act of Inglourious Bastards was good because of the constant shifting of argumentative clout between Hans Landa and Lapadite which could be shown through reaction, dialogue delivery, and prop use via pouring of milk through who has the bigger pipe, and the changing of what is at stake as the camera cranes below the floorboards to reveal what Lapadite is acting for.

 This isn't action. But it is compelling. This happens in Gatari, and many other anime in which action is not present. This does not happen in SnK. I am getting tired of it specifically BECAUSE it is falling into the shonen standard of droll "character development", which in shonen is code for money saving, filler, and letting the manga get further.

I am tiring of SnK and this episode for AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT reason, almost opposite, of what you think. That is why it isn't right to shove a generalization on an entire demographic. Because then this happens. Why bitch abut it anyway? Because SnK promised me much more with the first two episodes. And because I have watched enough anime, and love the medium enough to expect better.


>> ARTICLE
you missed my sarcastic retort's point entirely. i dislike anyone crying when the show does not have an episode with nonstop action. take a look at my fucking mal list.. of course i love shows that have exposition, pacing, character development, tension, suspense, appropriate action and constructive/consistent worldbuilding.

>Because SnK promised me much more with the first two episodes.

[this is what sucks imo.](http://i.imgur.com/gekzG.jpg) who [the fuck](http://i.minus.com/ilRY0TcJizDqa.gif) promised you anything? best lesson life could ever teach you: you have absolutely no right to expect anything from anyone/anything ever. you *can* do it.. but it's childish and about as constructive as crying during your math exam. this holds especially true when it involves someone's artistic creation. everytime i hear of some writer getting shit/deaththreats from supposed "fans" because their work "isn't right"  it makes my blood boil.

expectations are selfish. imposing your view on someone else's work is selfish. 

the demographic that cannot understand/does not desire proper pacing or cannot understand basic principles of cinematography and just yawns and complains during scenes vital to grasping the characters, the flow of events and many other crucial attributes of storytelling is evident by the comments (and upvotes received as such) who simply noted their disgust over the supposed *drop in narrative quality* that this episode does not have, imo.

yeah people can mention the action slowed down from an observant point of view but when they correlate that with negativity it just shows what they're here for. comparing this show to dragonball Z or other filler-laden nonsense is [crap.](http://i.imgur.com/whFNUCG.png)

other anime (that i've seen) you may hate if you hate the pacing in snk: steins;gate, spice and wolf, ghost in the shell, ergo proxy, another. of course they're all fucking awesome for people who kick their ADD to the side.

so yeah i have no problem labelling haters and downvoting them appropriately. they can very well drop the show and buzz off instead of coming here to spew their [princess-like dissapointment](http://i.minus.com/iWCO4py5CR3xL.gif). [sigh](http://i.imgur.com/sZyMy.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I am merely disputing your generalization. But if you are going to critique my act of having expectations, don't do with insults. The thing that promised me anything was the work ITSELF.  To use an extreme and hypothetical example, if someone puts something of quality for the first few pieces of their work, why is it wrong to assume or hope that future works would be of similar quality?  It is wrong to bash a work because it defied your expectations, so I probably shouldn't whine about that. But what about the expectations about the medium that have already been set by other works before this series came to? Is it wrong to hold SnK to the standard of the rest of the medium? Because I find that to be more respectful.

 As for generalizations, I was disputing yours because you generalization is false. It just is, unless you're admitting you didn't make it. Your generalization was that people who don't like this episode are shonen action pacing lovers. I dislike this episode because I am AFRAID of it becoming shonen action pacing. This is being drawn out to fit into a manga schedule, and I feel that it's quality is lower for it. I don't give a shit about action. I just want to be entertained or stimulated. If your generalization was "they re just action shonen pacing HATERS" then maybe the generalization would be closer, but it is not logically sound to make universal statements because it only takes one case to prove it false, as many in this thread have already.

Maybe people who just want action in this series (I don't care, I just want good watching) find it to be the only entertaining part of the series? I don't find this episode particularly good because of the narrative quality and I do believe the,pacing is affecting it. I would be happy to debate that point separately.

pff.. if you have to point out all the specific characteristics of the group of people you're addressing to as well as the detailed input you're addressing them you'd never make a statement in your life. that's just "politically correct"/textbook definition rhetoric.. it's not a realistic critique. met this ' argument' a thousand times before and what it really means is " i have no other significant input so i'll just point out how what you say doesn't apply 100% without fail in this universe in all timelines.


just for the sake of this discussion i've rewatched the first three episodes. it had a ton of panned shots with despaired people, a lot of dialogue ranging from eren and mikasa with their family + surveying the returning troops all the way to their training camp. hell episode 3's plot involves eren's frustration over an inability due to defective equipment which leads causes everyone frustration in one way or another interseded with potato girl's dietary problems. literally nothing happens but a timeskip, ton of dialogue and frustration.. and it was great and received as such.

rewatched episode 12 right after that.. you know what's different? nothing. same exposition style, lots of dialogue, lots of waiting and despairing, lot of frustration and things going badly while waiting a full episode to realize the fault.

what is different now is that in episode 5 THAT happened and after there was episode 8 where another THAT moment went down. this crescendo was put in place tediously by the episodes that came before it as this one serves to prepare for the season finale of episode 13 since 14 will be a recap.

only genuine quality feedback that i have observed and admit the series to turn down is : recap before the OP and panned dialogue stills with significant characters (episodes 1-2 had 6 of them too but they featured meaningless people such as a town priest, unknown soldiers and plebs).

>everyone else is just typical shonen-action pacing lovers.. 

lol no they're not. if they did want that, they would have wanted this episode to be stretched out over 3 episodes. naruto's War arc? how about 6 minutes straight of naruto running. no dialogue, no actual anything, just music and naruto running.

followed by a filler fight and and some characters learning an important lesson...that they learned 80 episodes ago

I'm not sure I understand you, because twenty episodes of [this](http://ghostlightning.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/dragon-ball-kai-04-snake-road-son-goku-exhausted.jpg), is typical shounen-action pacing.

exactly.. have you even seen twenty episodes of SnK yet? out of what you've seen can you honestly say nothing happened?

It's possible that the ones who found this week's ep boring were manga readers, of which I am one. I really just want this part of the story to be over so we can move on to bigger and better things. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of people have this complaint about Gargantia as well. [I've heard some people complaining that]( /s "many of the early episodes where Ledo is getting adjusted to life with the crew were completely unnecessary and/or repetitive .") 

I think a lot of the people who were drawn to this show are looking for action here after seeing some of the 3D movement gear scenes and such. So even if you get a bit of character development or what not from an episode, it's not the action people are looking for. I think that is why they are upset.

In my opinion, if you had a show that was constantly filled with fighting and action scenes for 25 episodes, they would not stick out as much by the time you got to the climax and it wouldn't be as much of a big deal. But by having contrasting, slower moments, you can make the big encounters really memorable. I don't really mind if things slow down for a while every here and there. 

If anything, the fact that people are complaining indicates to me that they are already very invested in the show and are starving for more action. If it was a mediocre problem show, they probably wouldn't still be here watching it. Instead, the big scenes were powerful enough to leave a strong desire for more in people's minds. I would consider that a strength of this show.

**In short**, I think people are complaining about pacing because they want some more of the hard hitting episodes like episode 1 and episode 5 again, and this episode's impact was more of a firm love tap rather than a falcon punch. 

That being said, if they had the same budget but reduced the number of "wasted" or "dull" episodes by a few, we might have been able to have more awesome 3D movement gear scenes and stuff. 

Edited for grammar.
>> ARTICLE
Gargantia, the issue lies with the fact it was only a one cour, and they didnt have the episodes to waste with some of the crap they included
>> ARTICLE
I suppose it might be better if watching it all after it had aired, but when we get one episode a week it gets rather frustrating. I didn't mind last week's episode being somewhat slow. I have read the manga and expected the week's episode to go a lot faster, but man did they draw shit out.

I'm surprised/disappointed they haven't developed some kind of bomb/area of effect weapon yet. With the Titans being all grouped from the juicy human bait, having something that could disable/weaken the titans long enough for a easy slaughter. 
>> ARTICLE
Some of the cannon shot is "area of effect", but it's not particularly portable.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost impossible to have any sort of lasting effect even from single target shells with the cannons that the people have at that time, mostly due to the incredible regeneration powers that the titans possess. Remember, even if a titan's head is blown off, that only lasts a couple of minutes at the most. 

Combine that regeneration with the fact that titan flesh is apparently very resistant to damage (since they have to use a special type of super-hardened steel to cut them) and the end result is that humans simply didn't have enough firepower back then to do anything that effective against the titans.
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering. If you blow their head off. Dont you also destroy the vulnerable part of the neck? And im still curious why that spot kills the titan. What could be there that is so vital for the titan to function. At this point my only theory is that theres a human in each titan. Kill the human, you kill the titan. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing that this anime's definition of "blowing their head off" means anything above the neck, otherwise it should also destroy the vulnerable point.

As for why that spot kills the titans.... I have no idea. My guess is that their brain or nerve center is located somewhere around there, but yours could work too.
>> ARTICLE
they regenerate. i assume the humans don't have something that can blow up that huge cluster of titans as the shells they use barely blow up one of their bodyparts.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm glad to see the conversation I had last week with /u/masquonnage wasn't quite wrong. Though I must say I was surprised when he stabbed human Eren in the arm.

I want to believe he was going with the plan to cut him out and he changed his mind after stabbing him since that seemed to wake him up. I guess that's when he decided to reason with him again.

It's looking better than last week though. Seems Eren might pull through, but this doesn't bode well for the future. There has to be a way to let Eren practice control after this. They can't throw him out there like this again.

Want to call him a human weapon? Fair enough, but you don't just give a  gun to someone and expect them to use it perfectly. I hope the mission ends successfully so they can rethink their use of him.

Just nothing of worth happened, there seemed to be no development at all. It feels like 20 minutes of nothing just flew by.

I don't know how a lot of people seem to hate the pacing of the recent episodes. Ok, I have to admit the pacing has slowed down rapidly, but what do you guys prefer more? A rushed series or a series with an adequate speed? I'd prefer the second one. Personally I'm fine with the pacing, they add some details and tell the story more detailed, they're a nice addition in my oppinion.  
For example the introduction of Pixis, in the manga, he just appeared out of nowhere, in the anime he even got 2-3 minutes and got a proper introduction.  
As always I can cry every episode because of this epic soundtrack. Can't wait till it is released at the 28th.
>> ARTICLE
No wait, there's two things: anime with slow pacing and anime with slow story progression. Seirei no Moribito for instance is an anime with slow pacing in some episodes, but they still managed to have a lot of content in one episode. Shingeki no Kyojin is starting to look like they're deliberatly trying to extend the anime. The conversations have no meaning and are extended to a point where it's plain boring and doesn't make any sense. Why did it take Eren so long to realize that he was dreaming, and why did we have to spend 5 minutes watching him sleep with Armin desperatly trying to reach him and all Eren says is "Oh I can't understand what you are saying Armin".

More much needed psychological exploration of Eren, also giving more opportunities for Armin to reveal his awesome side. Maybe I'm reading too much into it (blame Gargantia which now makes me see a social issue subtext in every anime) but the whole "going outside" versus "staying hidden within/trapped in stagnant comfort" idea made me wonder whether its a reference to the issue of Hikikomori/ Shut ins. Just scattering food for thought.

I'm not reading into it.

It's more of a caged bird wanting to fly sort of thing, even if there are cats outside of the cage.

I don't think AoT is trying to parallel any social issues the way Gargantia is, however well it fits. AoT has always been about the "fight or die" message, so this is just more of that. 
>> ARTICLE
Why are people complaining so much about the pacing of the episodes? It seems like every time an episode isn't filled with Titans dying, humans dying, or some sort of destruction and general action happening, people complain about the pacing being too slow. I personally feel that the show is doing things right. Nothing seems rushed, or drawn out really. I actually like that we, as the viewers, are made to experience what these people are experiencing, right down to every last minute of it. Instead of Eren snapping out of it after a big speech like most typical anime, it takes some time to get through to him, and every moment that they wait for that is a moment where tension and doubt are rising, and that needs to be focused on.

Sure, we could have had a "Eren stops the cannon, Pixis has a plan, Eren fails, Eren snaps out of it" episode, but that would seem like they just mashed up as much as they could into one episode. The only thing I didn't like was the recap in the beginning, but I never liked recaps, even if I do understand the necessity for them.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like The Walking Dead, when nothing thrilling happens, fans get upset. However TWD is about 40-50min long than AoT. So I guess I can understand how everyone feels about the pacing. Like I said, I don't mind it. I wouldn't like a whole volume mashed up in 30 minutes, like some animes I've seen. Makes me upset when they do that, unless it works. Too bad AoT can't increase their production and air-time. But before you know it, the anime be wrapped up quicker.  
>> ARTICLE
I love how in this episode Eren was shown in the titan corpse as he was in his home with his family and he felt good there, but you can't achieve anything in life if you just stay comfortable and do nothing, you need to sacrifice some things, to go out and "explore the world", also this image leads me to thinking that all Titans have humans inside (which everyone pretty much called, as the part where eren is inside of that titan is the weak spot of titans) but also those humans don't want to get out and loose counciousness because they feel good, and think that they are in a place they are most comfortable in.

>[ACTUAL OPINION/THOUGHT ABOUT CONTENT](http://i.imgur.com/cDBctI0.jpg)

i loved the surface tension in this episode. the very nature of the song in the background, the look on people's faces - Mikasa especially -, the desperation yet willing struggle to carry on despite the reg flag.. this is the kind of stuff that great storytelling is made of. reminds me of half life as it excelled in these moments right before a massive event.

i believe eren knocking himself out may have released some chemicals (i'm not a doctor) that made him so numbed out to reality which lead to the whole scene where he needed Armin to remotivate him. still no clue as to why he went after Mikasa though.. does he really have some issues with our blushing deathgod princess?

for once we actually got a glimpse of a battlefield of humans vs titans.. can't wait for humans to actually get really motivated: once eren does put that boulder to the gate (if he'll do it?) they will all still have to cope with a ton of titans inside Trost... ah good times before half-cour finale!

well before he became a titan he was angry at mikasa for joining the elite squad, or maybe she was just the closest one.

Honestly, I'm starting to be disappointed in this anime. They tell you almost nothing in an episode. Any other anime would've managed to tell you the same content in about half the time. Attack on Titan has almost no story progression at the moment and they always finish with a cliffhanger...
>> ARTICLE
The amount of still pics in this episode kinda got annoying
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of people talking about pacing and I also agree that it's vastly slowed down and I think I realized why.

In the beginning we went through 5 years of story in about 3 or 4 episodes. Then we got 2 episodes of training. Then we got a series of fights and eren-titan showing up. While the last fight wasn't that long, it at least had fights to keep you entertained.

Since they returned over the wall we had a whole 2 episodes focused on them just talking and protecting themselves from being killed (about 10-20mins total in their time I'd figure). This is the first episode we've even seen any titan killing in about 3-4 episodes. So yeah, I think the pace is frustrating.

The good news is that we're getting character development at times. Armin grew a lot. We learned a lot about the elite soldiers and pixis (not so much on him though). 

But even still, this episode really frustrated me in another way.

With the way the last episodes ended we were lead to believe that Eren had lost his shit, which he did. But within the first 5mins of the episode he had knocked HIMSELF out... At least we got some titan fighting along the way but it was just frustrating to see him all lazy and tired.

I probably screamed at the screen a couple times,

"MOTHERFUCK, DO SOMETHING!"

Alright, finally got some time for Titan. It's definitely earned a fair shake this week  Pixis' focused and theme-outlining speeches from last episode definitely helped renew my interest in this show, and partially made up for the pretty terrible pacing and lack of meaningful action that have recently brought momentum to a standstill. It's also just nice to see someone displaying actual competence in this universe  getting down on humanity for their panic and weakness is great and all, but it's kind of an empty message if your portrayal of humanity is all babbling strawmen like the bearded officer. Pixis displayed actual charisma, got straight to the point when necessary, and used a handy dash of psychological warfare to rally troops in the face of terrifying odds. We know a recap episode is coming soon, so hopefully this episode will ride the current momentum into a fast-paced and eventful conclusion.

**Episode 12**

4:08 - We must win this battle. It still seems crazy to me that they're betting both Eren's power and the entirety of this fighting force on Eren's powers maybe working the way they hope they do. Sure, losing the buffer wall puts them in serious danger, but potentially losing both these resources seems far more risky.

I think I'd be more accepting of this as a necessity to keep the story moving quickly if the story actually *were* moving quickly in general, or if this show didn't place such an emphasis on plans and tactics. As is, it's a little harder to suspend my disbelief

4:58  Mikasa versus the Titan. That's a great image and a great moment

8:05 - Unlike us, he's an irreplaceable resource. *Thank* you.

8:29  It's Jean! SAVE US, JEAN!

9:07 - Minimizing losses is the correct tactical choice. The bosses are in the right! Jean always best character  I love seeing his strong understanding of strategy and absolutely terrible understanding of people slam against each other. Nice pep talk, Coach!

11:08  [Is this the screencap you fuckers wanted?](http://i.imgur.com/l8yJ4AG.jpg ) Pretty adorable, admittedly

12:07  Well, we're halfway through the episode, and so far Eren has successfully hit himself in the face and fallen down. Not exactly what I was hoping for

12:15 - During training, instructors will sometimes intentionally cut trainees' cables to gauge their reactions. That's pretty brutal! I'd say a mean little detail like that is worth a dozen terrified reaction faces

16:02 - Back then, Eren emerged from their weak point. I'm sure that's a clue about what they really are. And clearly *that's* a clue about where this story is heading

17:05 - Eren, get out of there! Eh. This is the exact same dramatic trick they pulled when Eren was basically comatose in front of the firing squad  and it wasn't very satisfying then, either. It's not about accomplishing some heroic task, with specific, defined obstacles (the way their raid on the gas supplies was, which is in my mind the only really successful action setpiece so far)  it's about them dragging out moments while we wait for Eren to wake up again. Maybe this works in manga format, but here each panel is several seconds of the camera zooming while the show attempts to build tension around a binary conflict (will he wake up, yes or no) we've seen before and pretty much can guess the ending of

I think that's all pretty obvious, so for the sake of making this writeup interesting, let me at least think about how *I'd* handle a moment like this. Well, first of all, I probably wouldn't be here  I don't think everyone slowly gets themselves killed while Eren, the one truly relevant factor, either succeeds or doesn't succeed is a very good use of this show's resources, so I'd probably have spent an episode integrating Eren's abilities in some dynamic way and then set up a mission where both his part and the part of the regular squad were meaningful and interesting in their own right. If I *were* in this particular moment, I'd say we need something to add relevant tension to the conflict. I'm guessing the best way to do that would be to run with that little flashback Eren had, and have a thematically relevant flashback to accompany Eren's awakened resolve  his inability to accept the complacency of the other humans has always been pretty key to his character, and maybe remembering that could also be the key to his ability to master the Titan. This would also make for a nice symmetry with Mikasa and Armin's own resolve-discovering flashbacks this arc

17:37  Oh look, they're doing that. That's good

21:11  Deserts and oceans and massive tracts of land! I'd make a Holy Grail reference, but I'm pretty sure massive tracts of land is just Commie being Commie

**And Done**

So it's looking like only incredibly strong primal emotions (I can't die here! I have to protect them! I was born into this world!) can actually guide the Titan? I guess that works.

Otherwise, pretty meh episode. I liked the stuff with our main trio's squadmates, but I pretty much always like their brief relationship-building exchanges. Otherwise, more redundant we're-all-gonna-die stuff from the peanut gallery, and the conflict with Eren was pretty much an exact copy of the second time he became a Titan. I'm assuming next episode will finally bring an end to this conflict  hopefully the next arc won't drag its story out to the degree this one has been doing.

Yet another slow, uneventful episode. Getting a bit tiresome.

This show started off so rapidly and just hit a complete brick wall here. We're coming up on 'Defense of Trost 9'. The past four episodes could have been one, two at the most, if all the speeches weren't so repetitive. I spent the vast majority of this episode just feeling pissed off that I was hearing the same thing over and over again.

I'm pretty sure it's just dragging out like this because they spent the majority of their animation budget on the first five episodes. I'm sure we'll see the conclusion of this arc in the next episode, but I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong about that and watch another five episodes documenting Eren's quest to move a fucking boulder from point a to point b.

I think its dragging because they wanted the arc to end before the recap episode.

AFAIK, episode on Saturday 6th was going to be a recap. So I can only assume next episode will be the conclusion of this arc. So if next episode is going to be as slow paced and will on a cliffhanger expect some butt-hurt.

The way things play out means if you were to sit and watch all episodes together in one sitting, the recap episode would make sense. However because we are watching it on a weekly basis the recap episode will feel totally silly and a waste of time.

I'm expecting that he'll finally pick the damn thing up half way next episode, then we'll cut away to some fights somewhere else, then at the end of the episode, we'll find out that Titan Erin is surrounded by other Titans.

Guess I should chip in my bit too; Like most, I feel like this episode has slowed down the pace by a massive amount and it is not something I am to happy at. In fact I got so annoyed that I ended up going and reading a few chapters worth. Just hope that the story arc after this whole mission thing has a bit more action, flashbacks are fine and all but that was not fun to watch.
Now the good parts:
This episode showed us some of the things that we dont normaly get to see, like what is actually going on in the battle field ect. It also showed us some of the OTHER characters(yes they exist) that are not normally shown all that much during the other episodes.
Althought the episode will be getting alot of hate because of the slow pace of it, it has its moments that allow you to feel like you know a little more about the characters.

Careful there, a few chapters can easily become more and then you're stuck waiting for monthly releases.

I got a Black Hawk Down vibe from this episode.  A downed titan being protected by the most Elite soldiers there is to offer.  While there wasn't as much action as most fans wanted, character developement was pretty interesting.  After the pacing has slowed down a bit, (a lot) I don't see the need in the episode recap.  (Is this still confirmed?)
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so I'm just going to state a little prediction here, (honestly would've fit better with the episode 11 thread, but still). I think that when Eren becomes a titan, whatever his emotion was when transforming will over-exert itself. Example: In episode 11, Eren became a Titan right after getting mad at Mikasa. Therefore, when he finally turned into the titan, he attacked her. This is just my random prediction though.

I'm surprised about the hype of SnK in another countries, I saw this episode at least 1~2 hour(s) earlier subbed in another languages.
>> ARTICLE
Titan faces get funnier and funnier.


I keep thinking Armin is going to get crushed between Eren and the wall (please don't)
>> ARTICLE
took some [screenshots](http://abiisage.minus.com/mbx0bQbJeevIVQ/) and did some [stitches](http://abiisage.minus.com/miSz2qTSUSdp4) that weren't already done. 

Kinda a slow episode but still entertaining. And those [scenery shots](http://i2.minus.com/iCOlCCvgayuYa.jpg) were really nice
>> ARTICLE
You know looking through those screenshots I noticed something. Mikasa wears lipstick. One would think a soldier training to kill giants would not bother with lipstick.
>> ARTICLE
At the rate it's going, do y'all thing there's a chance the series might carry over into a second season? I don't read the manga, so I don't really know how extensive the story goes.
>> ARTICLE
With the current pace, they have enough material for 75 episodes (5 of which will be pointless recaps).


>> ARTICLE
Damn... That Mikanyan.....
>> ARTICLE
Well, there were a lot of anime only scenes. Slow but good ep tho.
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't you guys rather have a slow pace than a finale episode where Eren and Mikasa fight off a hoard of Titans and then the show just ends with nothing major answered? The manga still has a way to go before reaching a conclusion and the most recent chapter was really slow on pacing. It also doesn't seem any different from the manga. Eren did have a lot of trouble controlling the Titan and Armin did have to help him.
>> ARTICLE
i swear attack on titan is such a trolling series. it always gets good at the the last two mins or so

but ill still watch the shit out of it
>> ARTICLE
FUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK WHHYYYYY must u tease me
>> ARTICLE
First half dialogue and the second half is more of a build up to the cliff hanger for the next episode.  I didn't like the pacing of this episode.  It felt like it was a 20 minute episode for 5 minutes of everything happening in that world.  I understand there are many characters and the point of views for them are important, but damn it just pick up the freaking boulder Eren!  I think I didn't like it because I'm not objective and my personal desires just want to see what the hell is going to happen next.  Impatience is a bad thing to have for this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've seen anyone facepalm so hard.

i like when eren went super sayian

Always bums me out at the end of the episode.  I really like this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or are the titans getting much more handsome 
>> ARTICLE
i have a feeling someone is gonna slash eren because they panicked while he is in titan form

>> ARTICLE
I hate it when things get all epic and it says TO BE CONTINUED. 

Also hate it when I come up on On going Series. 

When's the Next Episode?
>> ARTICLE
That's it, I can't take this anymore! I'm becoming a manga reader!
>> ARTICLE
DON'T GIVE IN BROTHER, HOLD ON
>> ARTICLE
Unsatisfactory ending for me. All the others ones were done awesome though, the intense build ups to the cliffhanger. But it didn't work on this one at all, for me at least. I was pretty pissed, the previous episodes usually had me saying "Holy shit, what the fuck!?" by the end but this one just had me saying "Man, what the fuck dude, come on..." haha
>> ARTICLE
I'm not reading any comments, because im only on 11. But, thanks for recommending this over and  over and over. I finally listened, and started this yesterday. Best anime I have seen in quite awhile.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it obvious, [I was born into this world!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88V9IcwtIeM)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't enjoy this episode, at all. It felt sooo slooooow and nothing happened.
>> ARTICLE
The worst part was the complete absence of Potato Girl. Since nothing happened this entire episode anyways, they could've at least stuck a shot of her in _somewhere_.
>> ARTICLE
i didn't enjoy last episode. This episode wasn't as bad.
>> ARTICLE
At least some titans died 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone that doesn't like the pacing just wants more action. I'm liking it so far because it shows everyone's character.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that there is a large amount of character development going on but after a while it gets completely redundant. How many clips do we need of Armin yelling at something to get that he's a good speaker and tactician?
>> ARTICLE
It was awhile ago but I can remember reading something regarding Episode 14 being a Recap of the anime so far, can anyone confirm this? If that's the case hopefully the pace picks up and shit gets done next episode.
>> ARTICLE
There were news about that, yes. Episode 14 will be a recap episode (which is both a bad thing and a good thing. Bad because no new AoT content, good because more time for the animator to make good stuff).
>> ARTICLE
I really hope the pacing gets back on track with the beginning of the anime.  This is starting to get annoying.
>> ARTICLE
if they did that they'd catch up and blow past the manga. in that case would you rather have an entire season of filler waiting for the manga to catch up or would you rather they make up their own story which everyone eventually hates for being too different?

Since I'd really rather have neither of those happen, I don't mind them slowing down and keeping to the manga
>> ARTICLE
My god, the pacing has gone real bad/slow. 
>> ARTICLE
So, did they run out of money or what? This is really pushing it as far as slow pace goes.
>> ARTICLE
Truth is, they have many staff problems to the point they will even do a pointless recap episode.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, the Titans are all lotus eater machines arnt they?
>> ARTICLE
This is turning into Dragonball with its pacing.
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan's shounen colors are showing.
>> ARTICLE
Man the episodes are good but it's been like 3 episodes and we haven't moved 5 feet. I thought they'd wrap up this storyline in this episode but they're taking their real sweet time.
>> ARTICLE
Two things are pissing me off:
1) the pacing
2) the recap during the intro. We watched the other fucking episodes, ok?
>> ARTICLE
the pacing is terrible
>> ARTICLE
Just another mention that pacing is getting really slow, even for a guy who doesn't know the manga material.

I did enjoy seeing the elite soldiers taking things into their own hands, showing why they were picked for being the best as well as the Mikasa blush.

The end when Eren finally woke up was a cool scene too, but I'm still disappointed I have to wait another week for something to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Soooo nothing happened except people dying. You COULD speed it up a little bit, you know. 
>> ARTICLE
What a fucking cocktease of an episode.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is better. The anime have horrible pacing.
>> ARTICLE
They're doing it like that so they don't catch up the the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Unless they pull a DAL it's literally impossible to catch up to the manga in 25 episodes anyway
>> ARTICLE
Definitely going to be one of those animes that have shitty pacing up until the last 7 episodes, then cram the entirety into it in those short 7 episodes. I've seen shows start out strong, and just ruin themselves like that too many times.
>> ARTICLE
But this show is not going to walk that path if the studio wants a 2nd season. Compared to the manga, it is a monthly one and runs around 50 pages, and so far the anime covers over 50 pages for each episode. In the current pace the anime is running, it's a chance that there's going to be a 2nd season as well. You also don't want an anime this good to catch up to the manga, otherwise it'll end up like blue exorcist or claymore (which is also a monthly manga).
>> ARTICLE
And Darker than Black.
>> ARTICLE
[Was Armin](/s "going to cut Eren out or actually do what he intended?")

Also with the recent episodes is anybody starting to get annoyed with Misaka and how she can't think of anything but Eren?

^^I'm ^^really ^^starting ^^to ^^hate ^^her ^^character
>> ARTICLE
I don't dislike her character, but I'm really hoping that Mikasa will start to care more about other people for future character development. 


>> ARTICLE
She does care about other people. More than anybody else in the show except maybe Armin. Notice how she put her life on the line by dangling in front of Eren's face?
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't show that she cares about other people, that shows she's willing to risk her life to try and get through to Eren. There's no doubt that she cares about Eren, I just want her to care more about her fellow cadets.

Eh, let me go deeper:

Can Minecraft create large npcs (with a very specific weak point) that can interact with the chain hooks in the video?
>> ARTICLE
Minecraft already has giant zombies that can be spawned in game. I imagine reskinning them and adding a weak point in the neck is entirely possible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you could create large giants that could knock you off your chain hooks, and that could only be damaged in the back of the neck.
>> ARTICLE
1 hit KO plz
>> ARTICLE
Large NPC's yeah. Interaction with the hooks... Possible to program the hooks to be non-damage entities. And then momentarily make the NPC a non moving object. It could be done.

>> ARTICLE
Download link is actually in the forum post near the bottom.  Sounds like you need a mod called Minecraft Forge before the Attack On Titan/"Hook Shot" mod will work.

Simplified walk through:  
1. Get [this](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).  You want the universal build of one of the recent versions.  
2. Get the mod [at the bottom of the first post here](http://forum.minecraftuser.jp/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=7783&sid=91167a85df6f169dc324fcb1661bd714).  I used 152_43 and had some missing textures, and I haven't had a chance to fiddle with it much.  
3. Delete META-INF and install Minecraft Forge.  
4. Install the hookshot mod.

Chainmail pants, two bows, two fishing rods, two arrows for the 3D Gear.  Firework + coal for gas.  The recipes are on his blog post [here](http://ghasts.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-519.html) as exdragon47 mentioned.

I've got some missing textures, so something didn't go quite right.  Fill up your gas, then use V and B to deploy your hooks.  Holding them will be a bad time.  Middle click to detach.  Ctrl will move you "forward" even in mid air, if you have gas.

Acts a bit odd under ground.  Would definitely be careful in the presence of lava.
>> ARTICLE
Can you elaborate on step 4? That seems to be the part where people are encountering the most problems.
>> ARTICLE
put the zip file in the mods folder after you have installed minecraft forge and run minecraft once. Minecraft forge needs to be installed inside the minecraft.jar file by deleting META-INF in minecraft.jar and then simply copy the files of Forge into minecraft.jar
>> ARTICLE
It's installing a Minecraft mod, just like any other.  You open the JAR in 7-zip or WinRar or whatever works for you, delete the META-INF folder, then copy in MinecraftForge and Hookshot separately.  You want to copy them such that the "net" folder ends up at the same level where META-INF was before you deleted it.

the sound it made right after "I'm gonna repay my debt", him shitting his pants?


 
>> ARTICLE
Nah think that's just the sound of him sliding across the floor, though I could be wrong haha XD
>> ARTICLE
I don't blame him at all. Imagine having to look up at that creepy fucking face. Nope.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's the face that he got scared of but rather the sense of helplessness / impossibility. I liked the way he judged in that situation. Even though he's a minor character (or at least what he felt like in the episode), he definitely has an understandable way of thinking (a little bit not sure if I'm using a correct description for what I am thinking).
>> ARTICLE
I felt that he judged that he had no chances. After all, they were completely unprepared after 100 years of safety. 

He realized that he was going to die if he tried to fight, and that the children would follow. So he turned around and did what had to be done.
>> ARTICLE
and it was his first time seeing a Titan up close. something that he was taught to fear his entire life.
>> ARTICLE
>he was taught to fear his entire life.

Well, I can imagine that he was taught that as a kid, but he's a soldier now. He said that he saw them all the time while working on the walls. He's used to them, so I don't think he was afraid of the titan. He just realized that taking it down it was far beyond his capabilities.
>> ARTICLE
He's used to seeing them but not up close. It was obvious that even though he's a soldier that he still fears them greatly.

Some indications:

- When Eren and Mikasa first saw them, they were drinking on their posts. They were confident that they would never have to deal with a Titan ever in their life as a wall guard.

- [Some manga spoilers](/s "He is a wall guard. Probably the lowest division in the army. He's good enough to be a guard but not good enough to be guarding the inner walls. This is pretty much the safest division you can be in if you're not a skilled soldier.")
>> ARTICLE
To extend, he's seen them before, but he's never had to *interact* with them before. This is the first time he's been at risk. Before that, it was like going to the zoo and looking at the alligators.
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought he'd be useless and unlikable but I like him a lot. I am amazed and impressed at how human he is. His first conversation with the boy about soldiers doing nothing and that fear scene are awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
It's nice that he's a more human character. The fact that they didn't shy away from exposing his hypocrisy when he actually had to face the titan was a very nice touch.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, it was a good episode. That titan at the end was creepy looking as hell [and] (/s "the way it ate the mom") was terrifying.
>> ARTICLE
That smile is worthy of the Joker.

Why so serious?  Nom
>> ARTICLE
Oh man! that part could've been a bit better if they didn't change some parts of it. Still a solid one! Very happy!. :D
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that you don't have to spoiler tag things within the episode itself since the thread is already tagged.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I know! That thing's smile was very disturbing, and I like how they make the titans look just "wrong". I'd say the hype for this show was worth it, it did a great job of "showing, not telling" with it's visual style and I was immediately interested in the world that the characters live in. Can't wait for next week's episode!
>> ARTICLE
Elongated arms, bloated stomachs, hunched posture, bizarre facial features... I hate them, they scare me.
>> ARTICLE
i think this has potential to outshine the manga 
>> ARTICLE
I think so too. Being animated can bring out so much more that manga style reading can't do. Hearing the voices, see colors (instead of black and white), etc, makes it a richer experience.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how Production I.G. remained faithful to the art style of the manga, but seems to have made the character design just a bit cleaner/more consistent. Looks really nice.

And animated 3D gear battles are just incredible.
>> ARTICLE
i actually was not a fan of art style of the manga, it felt kind of sloppy and disorganized. I only read up to around chapter 24 though, and  i heard the drawings got better later on. i could be just remembering wrong since i read it maybe half a year ago, I do however agree that the character designs in the Anime looks amazing 3D gear battles FTW! 
>> ARTICLE
3D gear battles? Hah! more [like](/s "3D gear murders"). XD
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, well no one can say the art in the manga is ideal, the thing is the mangaka was clearly a novice at his craft. But the story in what seems like his first published manga was just so gold that it exploded in popularity. It's just something you have to put up with for the story, but he has improved noticibly as it's gone on.

Plus in some way the sketchy and skoppy art added a lot to the general creepiness of the titans. The human characters can always use a bit of improvement though.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he's a novice when he could draw normal "moe" style competently. If you read ep30 it's clear that it's the way it's intended, brutal, meaty, and dynamic. It's a chapter with just fights, no dialogue, but the way it's drawn enhances the whole experience.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the art definitely gets better as time goes on, but the overall drawing style doesn't change, and it's this style that lends itself to making the manga look sort of gritty/dirty.

Still, the series is consistently interesting as it progresses, so it's well worth it to continue.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. A fantastic first episode. The art style is pretty unique but i really like it. The animation is top notch as i suspected from seeing the previews. The characters and story have pulled me in right away. The last sequence of the episode was really dramatic and much more brutal than i expected. I heard the manga is really gruesome in some aspects and you can tell they kind of have to censor what happened near the end with his mother but i think they pulled it off well.

All in all, i really enjoyed this first episode and will definitely be watching more.
>> ARTICLE
I think the amount of violence portrayed in the anime was quite good.  There have been plenty of horror shows with B movie slasher levels of gore, but always feels like a joke because it's so over-the-top.

Meanwhile here's a show where the monsters look like people drawn by a 7 year old.  By all accounts it should be impossible to take seriously, and yet the situation feels legitimately grim.  I'd say they nailed the spirit of the manga, and I'd hate to see them screw it up by trying to make it a gore-fest.
>> ARTICLE
Hey all!

Since the anime is finally out, I wanna invite everyon to check out the subreddit /r/shingekinokyojin . I made it so that everyone who would like to discuss the series with others, know more about the series, hear some new, see some fanart etc., would have a place to do them all.

The subreddit is still pretty small as I haven't really done much advertising for it just yet. But I feel that with the anime finally coming out and the series is getting more known around the world that people will slowly find themselves on the subreddit to discuss and share their thoughts on the series.

Anyways, if you are in any way interested in the series, do check out /r/shingekinokyojin .

As long as it won't be as censored as Deadman Wonderland was, it's fine.
>> ARTICLE
it was still pretty gruesome though. I was happy they didn't cut more gore out!

Especially on that part where the old lady got crushed by that big rock. 
I was like "OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!!!". Sick. :D
>> ARTICLE
Well after watching the first episode, they seem to censor the acts but not the out comes a whole lot, I say that's a good way to handle it.
>> ARTICLE
honestly as long as you kind of have an idea of what happens, you don't need to show everything. it makes it much more tasteful and less saw/hostel that way.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty happy that they kept it at least implied of what happened to the mother. I feel like it creates more of an impact in your mind. Loved the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
yea the fact that they made the blood just rain from his mother in slowish mo and the sound of the titan biting the mother makes it more intense instead of seeing everything in detail.
>> ARTICLE
Holy hell.

Take notes upcoming anime.  *This* is how you grab the viewer's attention in the first 90 seconds.

Went into this completely blind.  Big Titan + walls reveal made things interesting.  Badass guys on horseback, leader rolls out and rallies the troops, ultimate goal is only having a base outside.

Humanity?  Screwed.

Titans?  Horrifying.

Interest? So god damn piqued.

Things seem bad and we haven't even hit the freaking OP yet.  Then they get *so much worse*.  Hopeless seems to be a massive understatement, even if Big Titan has done everything it was going to.

Going by the map provided, more than a third of Humanity's entire world has just become Titan country.  Mass evacuations are going to have to happen, but it seems like most of the production happens in the inner walls (they have to cross the outer wall to get firewood, food is probably the same way?).  Well...  how did they even build these wall in the first place thinking about it.  Human Field is gigantic, and there's only one breach.  *Maybe* they can start building walls far enough away from the initial breach that they can hold on to some of the outer territory?  

Either way I get the feeling refugees are going to be treated horribly because gigantic monsters that eat humans *just isn't awful enough*.  Especially if the middle wall breaks and all of humanity needs to get into the center (the map shown doesn't seem to be drawn to scale, but there's no way shit isn't about to get real).

Man there are just so many questions about the world, and so much possible conjuncture about what happens next.  I really want to know what's in Chekhov's Basement, but at this point I wouldn't put it past this anime to hold it out as a ray of hope only to find out it's a gallery of "don't leave the walls ever because we can't beat Titans".

A few bits of still shots, especially when the wounded Recon Corps showed up.  But I really don't care since everything else was so great.

Confirmed pickup for the season.

Edit:  Rewatching some scenes, I just realized that the breach happened at one of the bulges on the outside of the outer wall, not the outerwall itself.  Well there's a small spot of sunshine at least.
>> ARTICLE
"Well there's a small spot of sunshine at least."

Except for the 200 foot tall monster that just kicks the doors in. :P
>> ARTICLE
*small spot*

At least they've got time to do *something* to try and secure the outer wall.

And you never know, it might get bored and walk away.

If I had to guess, biological studies and research documents about the titans.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, something like that.

Nothing *useful* mind, since he would have almost certainly shared that with the town, or at least the Recon Corps.  It's probably the exact sort of horrifying stuff you would use to convince a young boy that the last thing he wanted to do is go fight Titans.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it yet as I am at work, is it faithful to the manga so far? Gritty, brutal, with a dash of hopelessness?

It was a pretty solid, satisfying episode.

As a manga reader of this series, I was happy with what they did. They did change some bits but not alot.

Yes, yes, and yes.

A dash? Hah!

The best first episode this season by far. I just hope the production values don't go too far down the shitter, because everything here looked great.
>> ARTICLE
there might be some chances of the art quality going i think the further we go on.

i'm not sure but i think this is the same studio that did High School of the Dead. That anime's first episode used to be my very favorite one until this one.
>> ARTICLE
HSotD was animated by Madhouse. This is being animated by WIT Studio, which recently split off from IG, where they were division 6(?). They animated Robotics;Notes, Guilty Crown, and I think Real Drive.
>> ARTICLE
Heck, I'll say it's the best first episode I've seen in like, about 2 to 4 years since I've been paying attention to anime persistently.
>> ARTICLE
Holy. Shit.

As long as Production IG maintains the production value and stays true to the manga, this could easily be AOTY.

And, if done well, it would probably surpass the manga for one simple reason: the 3D maneuver gear and battles with titans were made for animating. The animation and sound during the recon battle were fantastic.

The only issue is whether they can keep it up. There are so many scenes with 3D gear, I'd imagine the cost of animating all of them well might be pretty high.
>> ARTICLE
That was incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga first so I'm gonna try to leave my bias behind me. A great first episode, we establish how the people live and that there hasn't been a Titan attack in quite while. We also see how powerful the Titans are by seeing how many people come back from the recon team and how many are injured and through the final moments of the episode by instead of attacking the guard ran away. The art is top notch and so is the animation, on how they zip around in the first scene. The music is quite good from what I heard too.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I thought the music was quite good. Plus, the OP is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Shit was serious, I want more.
>> ARTICLE
You could read the manga which has 10 volumes that are about 200 pgs a piece. They are pretty good and it seems that the anime isn't going too far off of the manga. Manga's really great btw.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I did that for Magi and regretted it.
>> ARTICLE
see it this way

the series composer for Magi is the one who brought us Guilty Crown

the series composer for SnK is the one who brought us JJBA.

See the difference?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I don't want to spoil it for myself while watching the anime series.
>> ARTICLE
after episode two i just said fuck it i want more, now i'm half way done the manga
>> ARTICLE
First episode this season I've truly been in thrall with the entire time. The art was fantastic and the world isn't based around some OP hero. The soldiers are horrifically weak for an action show and they know it. It's really a battle to survive.

I think the crowning moment of this episode was when Hannes decided to be the hero and stopped right before his moment came. The look in his face at seeing his enemy was just so real. 
>> ARTICLE
I got hit with the "Feel Cannon" when the mom cried for them to come back.
>> ARTICLE
"Don't go..." yup, all the feels!
>> ARTICLE
This is the only show so far this spring I've seriously felt like "SIGN ME UP". (note: I didn't see Crime Edge or Karneval yet)

the opening alone is better than anything I've seen so far this season. I was all pumped when it finished.

I went into this not knowing what to think necessarily (haven't read the manga at all), and I like everything about this.


The ending. . . .  .they watched Barefoot Gen didn't they? :)

 Can't wait for more.

I think it's allowed as long as you don't post links to download the ep

Okay sounds good.
>> ARTICLE
the near ending was intense as fuck
>> ARTICLE
if its anything like the manga the entire show is going to be like that
>> ARTICLE
Holy smokes that episode completely DELIVERED!!!! 

Seriously! As a manga reader of the series I am very satisfied with this first episode.

The intro set up such a good start. Showing what to expect and how the 3D Gears performed when utilized and it was SICK!!!

The episode was basically Chapter 1 with some chapter 2. I really don't mind it because the chapters are pretty long and there was barely anything added that wasn't in the manga.

There were some changes as well

- It seemed like they added an element where it should've been like about chapter 10 when it was introduced.

- I dunno if it was just the fansub that did but they changed the name of the Scouting Legion (They're the ones that goes outside the wall. It might still be the same. Maybe someone can clarify.

- What the mother said at the end was changed a bit. Supposedly, when Eren and Mikasa were already being carried away, she yelled "STOP! HELP ME!" to them and then she covered her mouth. I felt like having this at that part added more drama and emotion to the scene. It shows that even though the mom was ready to let go, at the very last moment, she can't but to feel the fear. To be afraid of dying in the hands of this thing that she was taught to fear her entire life. 

Overall, this episode was amazing, intense, and satisfying. It's probably my favorite first episode right now. It's the same feeling after I saw episode 1 of HotD.

Definitely looking forward to episode 2 next week.
>> ARTICLE
I found this posted on a certain subber's blog:

>No, were not going to use Scouting Legion because some manga translator translated it that way. Official translations used Survey Corps, but we think Recon Corps fit better given the nature of what they do (see opening scene).

I hate how ornery subbers get about stuff like that, but I guess it's decision at the end of the day.  I'm hoping another subber will pick up this show and offer "Scouting Legion" since that's how I read it in the manga and I personally like it better.
>> ARTICLE
Another sub group that picked this up renamed it to "The Eotena Onslaught" and called the titans "Eotens" in the subs. 
>> ARTICLE
this made me sad. :(
>> ARTICLE
Lol.

Commie.

If you have a chance, go to their webpage and read the wall of text that is the decision to call it that
>> ARTICLE
I read half of it and gave up, it's just another reason to avoid using their subs.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for this.

Yeah I also saw "recon corps" on the one i read as well. I was kinda sad as the official translations didn't even use Scouting Legion. It sounded so much better than the one they chose. 

Survey corps? hahaha. are they taking the Titan census or something?. It made them sound soft. X))


>> ARTICLE
Shingeki no Kyojin! Very excited for this one  this director can handle action scenes fine, all the problems of Guilty Crown were in the writing/characters. And what I've read of the source is very fun, intelligently crafted stuff. Let's do this.

**Episode 1**

0:25  Wow, I already love how strictly they're adopting the weird visual style of the manga. Those incredibly heavy lines separating characters from the background, those deep, ever-present shadows, the very distinctive and kind of off-putting facial designs... nice.

3:36  I didn't want to pause because the transition into the OP was so well-done, but that first scene pretty much confirms they're willing to shift the adaptation around to better fit the anime medium  within one scene, they established as much about the stakes and rules of the action to come as the manga did across several conversations. I mentioned this in one of my Maoyuu posts, but I think one of the most important thing an action scene can do is always present clear stakes and rules  you need to know what powers each side has and what their objectives are before you can clearly empathize with the conflict, or understand *why* some particular action is impressive, dangerous, or awesome.

By the way, it's occurred to me that it might be kind of hard to do the play-by-plays without murdering the pacing in a show like this, so my comments might just come when the show gives me a moment to breathe.

5:04  Love the colors, vivid line work, and backgrounds. They're using their budget well.

11:20  It's weird seeing cartoon characters overact this badly. At least the director's into it

11:34 - Well, that was heavy. Yeah, that was metal as fuck, dude

12:35  That's a really graceful way to fit in this supplemental, world-building material. I can't remember another show that used its ad break screens (what's the actual world for them?) in such a useful way

Also, unrelated, but for some reason I really like Mikasa's character. We haven't gotten into her backstory at all here, but she just completely makes sense as a person  I never have to question her motives, or disbelieve her reasons for having them

14:20  Eren's dad has a pimp suit.

14:40  Goddamn do I love this town's visual design

15:19 - You're beating me up because you know I'm right and you can't prove me wrong. Wow, what a succinct explanation for downvotes

15:34 - Enough with your crappy explanations! *raises downvote*

21:19  Difference between this dramatic scene and the last one? Everything. Stakes established, characters established, sympathies established, tension already in place  *this* is effective drama.

**And Done**

Welp, my expectations were met in a couple ways, and exceeded in a couple others, and only one of my actual hopes was disappointed. First, it was definitely smartly paced, and made slight changes while adopting the essence of the source  I feel that overall, this will be a Good Adaptation. Second, the visuals were just great in general. I really love how much they kept of the actual character designs and line work while working to make their world more lush and evocative. Finally, it seems this director might just love his melodrama a little too much  the only real offender here was that here's your son! scene, but *man* did that scene ever come off as ridiculous to me. Hopefully that doesn't crop up again.

Overall, I enjoyed it. I like a good story told well, and I think the source for this one is strong  I really like the dynamic between the main three, as well. If the director can keep his indulgence in check, this will be a fun, consistent ride.
>> ARTICLE
I feel you should drop the play by play, maybe just take some notes and then post something better constructed from those thoughts.

> here was that here's your son! scene

That reminded me of JoJo. No wonder why considering the man in charge of the scenarios.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It might work best for unintentional comedies (Sakurasou, Crime Edge), and less well for things that are actually good/consistent - or at least that don't have lots of sharply defined little moments to talk about independently. I thought it worked pretty well for OreGairu, but it was a tougher fit for this one - there just isn't as much to meaningfully discuss in a straight action show.

This week I'm doing it for everything just to test what feels effective, and I think the lasting play-by-plays might end up just being OreGairu, Crime Edge, and Gargantia, with standard reactions to everything else I'm following.

> JoJo vibes

That's a good call, but it was a weird disconnect from the seriousness of the rest of the material. It makes me wonder if this show will slip into more unintentional comedy as it gets more consistently action-y and tragic.
>> ARTICLE
I love the manga, but the emphasis on the Titan's emotionless smile at the end drew me in far faster than the manga ever could. Goddamn dude, terrifying.


>> ARTICLE
Holy mother shit of awesomeness!  
The OP!  
The blood!  
The tension!  


**I can safely say that this is the most interesting series I've seen so far this season**
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. Suisei no Gargantia can be something else entirely with Urobuchi in the team. 

But imho the setting for Shingeki no Kyojin (tragedy/survival) was far more promising compared to other anime we have at the moment (already checked the others except Suisei, Valvrave, Railgun S, and Hentai Ouji).
>> ARTICLE
Not him but can you tell me specifically which series are you referring to?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, thank you for this. I'll definitely check it out.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who doesn't read manga and is only ever exposed to stuff via anime, I decided to try this show because I thought the premise seemed good.   
My initial impression was that I *really* dig the art style. I kept pausing the show just to stare at scenes and the line work and everything is just so cool looking.   

Then, as stuff started going down....hoooooly shit. I was not expecting this kind of anime and that first episode really just rocked me. I'm not a huge fan of "goru" but this series is just so good visually, and the concept was good enough on paper...but seeing it unfold the way it did...this might end up being my favorite of the season when it's all said and done.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. It doesn't feel over-hyped, this one could be incredible. When shit goes down on the first episode, it's not really a slow start. That was really brutal and gritty at the end there and the titans have that creepy smile. *shudders*

When the recon squad was returning they used quite a bit of still frames of them riding in and a birds eye view still frame that kinda bugged me but the production values were good regardless. I'm liking this season thus far.
>> ARTICLE
Talk about the anime. Don't talk about the subs. It'll make my life easier.

This lives up to the manga for sure. The manga was epic and now this actually portrays how epic the manga is.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly one of the best first episodes I've ever seen. The fucking tension during this entire episode was insane, and everything about this so far is fucking crazy good.

The animation is really good here, and I really like how the characters are outlined so heavily in contrast to the background.

I feel like everything I've wanted from this was given to me so far, and I'm more excited than when I was on the hype train for this.
>> ARTICLE
That was just too good to describe. I don't think there's a single weekly viewer that will miss this one.

Can someone translate or just summarize this? It's from an interview with the mangaka (I think).

Does anyone know who does the soundtrack of this anime? It sounds kinda like Kaijiura, but not really.

Hiroyuki Sawano

I read the manga up until half a year ago and have to say. This first part was done much better than the manga. You get more hatred and feel for the MC than from the manga (he didn't feel as much as a brat in the manga). And the weight of great animation and style really just out did the manga.

But yeah, if you think this is gonna be another great 'linear' anime. You are in for a treat. 

Not really a spoiler (comparing this series to another) but

[It's got some things that remind me of Madoka Puella and kinda Pulp fiction in that its just executed well, but out of NOWHERE but yet still put in extremely well. ](/spoiler)  
>> ARTICLE
Oh my gosh. Holy shit. This anime got me excited for the next episodes.

It's great, and it's something that besides the very mild nudity of the Titans, it's something I can show to a random stranger which doesn't have sex related jokes/fanservice. Great animation, colors, music, camera angles, pacing, visual designs of the characters, town, everything. So awesome.

I'm glad there's a new show I can get excited about. If this continues to be good, it's going to surpass anime like Claymore so far ahead.
>> ARTICLE
The true test for this show's success will be if they animate the potato scene.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I kinda vaguely remembered they were giving Armin a female seiyuu, but the moment he opened his mouth I was dumbstruck at how girly he sounds. Cannot unhear Yozora.
>> ARTICLE
I say it fits him 
>> ARTICLE
That was a pretty good first episode. The production values are definitely good and the action scenes are very well choreographed. My only issues were that the director was trying too hard to sell the despair and hopelessness of the setting, which sometimes came across as really cheesy and melodramatic over-acting. I would have enjoyed it more if they toned it down a bit and exercised a bit of subtlety in trying to set the atmosphere. 

Also, I couldn't help but laugh at when Armin said, "there's nothing that can guarantee that [the walls] won't be broken down today", and then the town to get invaded like five seconds later. Talk about in-your-face foreshadowing.

Eren as a character continually annoyed me with his stubbornness and angst, although I guess that's because he's really still a kid and SnK is still a shonen at heart after all. I just hope his personality matures a bit as the series progresses. The end scene was pretty fantastic though, I was really impressed.

So, it was a little over-hyped for me and I probably didn't enjoy it as much as others did (i.e. I would definitely not call it AotS at the moment), but it was still a good intro to the series so I'll be keeping an eye out for it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. i don't like eren as well. 

Gogo Mikasa!!

Looking forward to this one.  Hoping it is as good as early reviews say it is.

Really pretty animation! I haven't read the manga but it was super intense and very sad! Definitely the most emotional and intense first episode of any anime I've watched.
>> ARTICLE
Epic first ep. I really like the theme of how the children wants to go outside(curiosity) but the sheltered adults don't want them to because they are safe inside(unwillingness to explore/contentment? can't find the right word). Welp, until a super giant made a hole in the wall and all hell breaks loose.
>> ARTICLE
Reminded me of Full Metal Alchemist for some reason.

Siblings who lost their Mom while their father is out on a trip.
 Eren is very similar to Edward (loud moth).
 The environment is pretty close to FMA's. 
 Eren seems to be the top dog in the Recon Corps which is like the Military in FMA


>> ARTICLE
How the story is going to progress i don't think it will be anything like FMA, but i can see your point.
>> ARTICLE
first impressions:

loving the art style, great departure from most anime these days -- very retro

is it me or do the daily life/emotional scenes resemble miyazaki's works in any way?

and obviously the weird-ass giants feel like they came out of gantz

action scenes are amazingly done

no nudity or japanese anime tropes in use for fanservice (no moe, no highschool stuff) 


i'm assuming based on the OP that this is just a quick flashback to the protagonist's childhood, or maybe that he'll be growing up very quickly in the next episode. well, either way, they just showed a *very* compelling reason as to why he'll fight the giants.

i also really like each of the characters, they all seem very believable, although i'll be honest: i'm not sure i've ever met anyone like misaka. i get that she's supposed to be in a protective older sister role, but it feels slightly overemphasized to me. oh well that's not really much of a complaint compared how cool this episode was.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I know I'm late to the thread but anyone else here have anything to say about the melodrama? I was completely turned off by all the forced emotional moments, e.g. the scene with the severed arm. It was absurd. The animation was gorgeous, but I might wait for the BDs if it means actually seeing some gore and not offscreen everything. Not really feeling it.
>> ARTICLE
Have you read the manga? The melodramatic scene was in the manga, pretty much word for word. They're really following source material. They only cut a little bit out of that gorey scene you're talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Ah!! I'm too late to the discussion!! Balls. I just watched the episodes yesterday and loved it. The soundtrack, the artwork, the concept. It was just, in plain terms, excellent. The Eotenas are horrifyingly wonderful also.

So very promising so far.  

The art style fits really well, it should suit heavy action scenes really well as the characters pop out of the scene more then average.  

Perhaps the first episode was a little melodramatic but i'm OK with that, really pretty, and the titans look pretty gruesome.  

If the storytelling doesn't become overly cliche and keeps a focus then i can see this being amazing.  

I feel like if i praise it too much it'll disappoint though, fingers crossed.
>> ARTICLE
I am very impressed with the adaptation, the atmosphere was very well done. The panning shots were a great addition to the original manga storyboards. 

One a side note, I find it hilarious that Inoue Marina will voice Armin :D. Though her voice is fairly deep.
>> ARTICLE
Really liked the way they are handling the anime. If anyone wants to get ahead you should read the mangas. A lot of interesting shit goes down there.

Art was top notch and they captured the emotions and motivations of the MC well.  I'm excited to see how Mikasa's backstory is done.  It's a really fantastic start and I'm excited to see if they can keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap Dat first episode!


I was so hyped for this when I saw the trailer I had to check out the first few chapters of the manga and after seeing this first episode I can say it delivered very well.
Great animation, really nice artstyle, epic music is epic - Oh God my ears! (Checked and it's the same guy who does Gundam Unicorn's music, no wonder I was eargasming) all in all a very promising first episode.


Also them Titans be scary as fck! haha
>> ARTICLE
Welp, shit just got serious and we're only on episode 1. The music for this show is brilliant, that was the very first thought I had. The epic orchestral/choir song in the very first fight was amazing. Had to pause it just to say "holy shit"
>> ARTICLE
That opening theme is fantastic. Seriously, has Revo ever made a bad song?

Hopefully the rest of the show will be as good (if not better) than the first episode. I need something for when Jojo finishes...
>> ARTICLE
Very excited about this show.  The first episode was fantastic.  I love the style and setting and can't wait to see what happens next.  Now, am I the only one confused about how tall the giants are? I mean, his mom looked so tiny in that Titan's hand.  Comparing regular titans to that big ass dude I would say they are around 10 meters or so.  It just doesn't make sense to me lol
>> ARTICLE
The Titans come in various sizes, from anywhere between 3 meters tall to 15 meters tall, but those are the normal ones, as obviously the 60 meter fleshless one is not "normal" :P
>> ARTICLE
Ah makes sense then.  I was like, they go up to that dudes Ankle but then are holding an adult like she's a popsicle! 
Either way, fantastic show!

That was epic as hell! And the animation is awesome! I can't wait until they get to the fight scenes. They really have that motion down.

Kudos to the mom in this episode.  She immediately works out the situation, keeps her wits about her, and calmly gets her kids to safety, all while having a fucking house on top of her.  And once they are safe, she dies in front of them so they can grow up to be Batman.  Mother of the year, right there.

this scene is actually a bit different from the manga. just  a bit.

I felt like having this at that part added more drama and emotion to the scene. It shows that even though the mom was ready to let go, at the very last moment, she can't help but feel the fear. To be afraid of dying in the hands of this thing that she was taught to fear her entire life.")
>> ARTICLE
Do they hear her when she shouts to them...please say that they dont : ( Also I noticed in the show when the Titan picks her up she strikes at his hand with her fists, that kind of said a lot to me like even though she had that moment of desperation where she didnt want to be abandoned, that she still tried to fight.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they did hear her. If they did, most likely the mangaka would highlight it more.

I think she tried to fight because of the fear. It was just overflowing out off her. It's pretty much panic actions with hints of regret. 

She couldn't do anything. Completely helpless. It's a scary moment in someone's life. 
>> ARTICLE
The mother's death actually made me cringe!
>> ARTICLE
Pretty freaking awesome. I'd like to know more about these Titans.

Reminds me of the Simpsons episode with the cola tooth race with Bart screwing with them.
>> ARTICLE
So I went in this blind, not knowing anything about it. 

The initial setting (humans hiding behind a wall, wall gets broken) reminds me of one of my favorite playstation RPGs, known as Legend of Legaia. Just wanted to point that out.

The way the backgrounds and the characters are very noticeable separate really catches my attention. I bothers me a bit but I can't say it's bad thing as I'm sure I'll grow to like it over time. It *does* look really good though. 



The music is fantastically epic, stands out, and fits really well. I love it. This is how you use a soundtrack.

Just by this first episode, this is a must continue show.
>> ARTICLE
The art direction is so visceral, and the voice acting is so heavy and hard-hitting. A fantastic piece of animated artistry, I will definitely be watching the rest of this series.
>> ARTICLE
As a massive fan of the manga, it didn't disappoint. I had a few tiny little issues, but not enough to go into them.

I do have a question, though. I hear it's going to be 25 episodes long. Now, by that they mean the first season, right? Because if they maintain their quality, and stick to Isayama's story which will hopefully also continue to be superb, then we should be seeing more, I'm hoping? 

I guess it's too early to tell, but I feel like if something of this quality doesn't do well enough to warrant more seasons, then it'd be extremely disappointing for fans like me. I guess I'm thinking ahead too much.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best first episodes I've seen in a long time.
>> ARTICLE
After watching that episode, I feel like I stumbled upon a soft cotton ball in a vast sea of lego. This series might actually be the one to stand out among them all. Can't wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Just saw it. First episode was epic, but I wish the production team didn't skimp out on the gory parts, especially when Eren's mom got eaten, but hoping they're going to release an uncut version on Blu-Ray.
>> ARTICLE
But did you see that lady getting crushed by that giant rock and blood splatters allover? That came out of nowhere! XD
>> ARTICLE
Same lady who got the arm, today just wasn't her day :/
>> ARTICLE
I know this is a stupid question, but whatever. Is the show any good so far? I don't really want to put in the effort of acquiring it every week if it's off to a slow start. I might just wait until it's done.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the first episode is slow. The action arrives at the end (and a brief action teaser in the beginning). However it'll quickly pick up after this. Wait until the next episode before you start watching if you don't want to wait. But waiting for the whole thing to finish is lunacy when the show is this good.

yep, the first episode was quite surprising, amazing animation and the story should be interesting.

Amazing first episode the level of animation is mind blowing cant wait for next weeks ep
>> ARTICLE
That was good. I didn't think they could actually make the sad scenes work, but they totally did it. I was tearing up with both mother scenes... 

Has the manga actually finished? I've only read up to volume 4, and have 5-7 pre-ordered.
>> ARTICLE
> Has the manga actually finished?

still ongoing
>> ARTICLE
Then I fear it suffering from typical shounen syndrome where the anime catches up to the source material and has to make up its own ending... well, let's hope it works out.
>> ARTICLE
it's gonna be a while before it catches up i think.

in episode 1, it's basically composed of chapter 1 and some of chapter 2. each chapters are very long and there was barely any added scenes in the manga so i am okay with it.

right now, there's 43 chapters in the manga available with chapter 44 to come out this week. If we estimate, it's pretty much gonna be at least 20 episodes until the anime catches up to where the manga is right now.
>> ARTICLE
This has the potential to be really good, wow.
>> ARTICLE
Brilliant episode, and the fact that an episode made a visceral impact on the viewer in the first episode itself makes this a prime candidate for anime greatness.

Was highly anticipating this series and the first episode didn't disappoint. It was great. Hope the rest of the series will be awesome. Here is my first impressions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh498wFO2rM

One of the best first episodes i've seen in my short experience in anime. But those titans are freaky as.

it's mouth looks like Ryuk from Death Note

nooo Ryuk's mouth is a bit weird but the titans are just.... disturbing 
>> ARTICLE
hey are gonna create a virus, spread it amongst the titans and gg!

Wow that was an amazing first episode. I have high expectations for this anime. Also this thread should be fine, since psycho pass from last season had no "legal" way to watch either and every episode had a discussion thread.
>> ARTICLE
well, not until 6 episodes in (then Hulu got it)
>> ARTICLE
I thought this episode was amazing definatly the best series from what I have seen so far. Obviously this is unfair judgment at the moment since only episode 1 of anime have aired, but cannot wait for episode 2!

Check out my first impressions I tried really hard to edit it so tell me what you think!:

What's in the basement Doc?

Seriously though, I wonder just how important of a story element that key around the Doctors neck and that basement are going to be, I'm thinking some kind of unpleasant realisation/connection about the titans and us, or something similair down there. 

They never actually touched on what kind of doctor he is, I see him as maybe something closer to a scientist and he seemed so calm and confident about the basement when the matter of the son leaving the town came up, that I imagine that there are maybe generations of research passed from father to son, over the decades down there, that its going to have very serious implications.

Seriously though, giving us a locked basement and a key around someones neck and no implication of what is down there, they know how to peak my curiosity, so much so that when I saw that the house had fallen down I was a little like "WHAT ABOUT THE BASEMENT?! Oh and your mum's there too, yea you probably want to get right on that i guess..."
>> ARTICLE
If this was set in the future and filled with monsters instead of titans, I could almost see this as a God Eater prequel...

As someone who hasn't read the manga, I would like to input that the amount of gore I saw was reasonable. I'm not a weak stomach guy btw (used to be a student nurse and saw a lot of stuff that I can't unsee...) so I was actually about to look away when the titan looked like he was gonna rip her head off or something but the camera cut away last second. It was great, as someone said earlier in the thread, the impact was definitely still there I was left saying to myself "Holy shit."

It was definitely a bit more gruesome in the manga, but they really didn't change much.

Just watched it. It is very, VERY good. However, it is off to a bit of a slow start. If you are on the ropes about watching, I suggest waiting a week or two so you can have a more substantial introduction to the show. I really enjoyed it, but it was a bit cliffhanger-ish.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, this is the very antithesis of a "slow start". Going straight for an *in medias res* beginning already concluded that.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, "slow" implies that not a lot happens. I wouldn't say this qualifies as slow; a ton of shit goes down this episode. It's not a bad thing to leave new viewers wanting more.
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading the manga right now because I got impatient and was curious about the coming show.  My impressions so far are that it's going to be a fairly dark series beyond the scope of the initial onset/predicament..however dark that may be. 

Conceptually, the series seems very similar to Claymore in a sense, without spoiling anything, it's the only show that feels similar.  I just caught up on the manga and whilst things are starting to move; there was a lot less covered in 40 or so chapters than I thought there would be.

Which makes me curious how long (episode wise) and how far they'll take this series. Guess it's time to watch the first episode now; or try.  Knowing how the story proceeds, somewhat disappointed in plot-choice, which makes me think that stellar animation aside it probably won't live up to hype. 

Below I'm going to list a fairly big plot spoiler from the manga that I find disappointing.
[Shingeki No Kyojin Manga](/s "The protagonist gains the ability to turn into a Titan, which completely does away with the whole 3D Grappling/fighting animation that made me curious (and excited) about the show.  This plot decision leaves a really sour aftertaste with me, because unless he actually learns how to 3D grapple, I personally, am going to feel cheated")

>> ARTICLE
>very similar to Claymore in a sense, without spoiling anything

Yeah. Massive spoiler right over there already.
>> ARTICLE
There's still a shit-ton of grappling in manga though.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting the MC to become a great grappler, but instead it turns into who can become the strongest monster. I was disappointed.

I don't think the story has developed into anything of the sort yet.

I've been looking forward to this Anime since I first read the first chapter of the manga. I knew this was bound to get an anime and hoped they did it justice. AND BOY DID THEY! This was amazing, I just hope they don't cut it off with like 25 episodes or something like they did to Air Gear or Magi and a slew of other shows. Off this first episode I already put this anime near the top of my list and by the time I've watched the last episode in the future this will definitely be at the top of the list. Amazingly done; if It can hold my attention as well as Lelouch of the Rebellion (and it seems to do so) then it gets an A++ in my book.

I thought that Levi just didn't want them to know that he was gonna fire a canister and think of him as weak/can't handle it himself, though I'm starting to feel I'm wrong now
>> ARTICLE
What? How would firing a canister make him appear weak? And even if they covered their ears, they could still see the smoke if it was a smoke shot. If he told them to cover their ears, its got to be some kind of loud shot. The likeliest possibility is it's some kind of sound signal for when they're inside the forest where it's difficult to see smoke signals.

Levi:

What exactly do you think is about to happen?

**EPXLOSIONS**!

That's what.

I mean, come on.

The cart went ahead, loaded down /w explosives. The captain and accompanying put down a metric asston of explosives, and Levi's unit led the female titan right to it.

I'm thinking the plan is Explosives -> ErenTitan -> hope for the best.

Granted, I'm not sure they were expecting another piloted unit rather then an automated or even aberrant glitch unit, but they clearly planned for whoever killed the captive titans to make a move on Eren, since he's the next best source of titan info, what with those two chopped up.

I know! I recently got caught up on the manga, and this is the first episode I've seen where I know what's coming. I am so delighted that it's just as intense, hell, maybe even more so with the soundtrack and screaming. Not to even mention the brutality, goddamn the female titan is scary!

Is the show more entertaining to watch having read the manga or is it better to not read at all and keep watching the anime exclusively>

As others have said, particularly leonardodicapricorn, I think it's just as entertaining. Though if someone was hell bent on watching the anime only, I think they would be okay. Both are equally awesome, mostly because the anime is so damn faithful.

I enjoy reading the manga, I think it's just as entertaining. Plus, I like knowing ahead of time what's going to happen. I thought once I read the manga I would stop watching the anime but the action sequences and soundtrack are great. I feel like I look forward to the future episodes more because I know what to look forward to and I can't wait to see my favorite parts animated. 
>> ARTICLE
It's nice how the show is really picking up pace again.
>> ARTICLE
I am wondering how far into the manga we'll get when the episodes are done, and if we'll get another season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm doubtful of another season, there's not enough manga content.  Season one will probably end up taking up a total of 8 volumes.  If the anime continues at the same pace, season 2 will go up to volume 16 which will not come out til mid-2015.
>> ARTICLE
the end of chapter 33 at which point the manga will have just released chapter 50
which means the anime will be 17 chapters behind!!
>> ARTICLE
It will probably end at chapter 33. I'm sure another season will be made due to the shows popularity.
>> ARTICLE
I really have no idea, since I haven't looked at the manga, but I really doubt they would finish the story by episode 25. This needs a second season.
>> ARTICLE
They are doing a manga chapter an episode. With the viewing it's getting in Japan, cause western sales don't matter to Japan, this will get another season.
>> ARTICLE
They are not. This episode covered part of chapter 25.

The show's ending at 34.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense to me. It seems like Western Sales are more like icing on the cake.
>> ARTICLE
They get some of the profits but not enough to really warrant more of a series. See Deadmans Wonderland. Killed it in the west, died in the east so no more came.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it feels like we'll get some huge cliffhanger that'll just go and tell us "read the manga if you want the rest" if they won't make another season. And I guess due to the popularity we'll probably get something more.
>> ARTICLE
Just hoping it doesn't go the way of Berserk, where they end on a cliffhanger and simply .... stop animating. TT_TT

That forest scene... Jesus Christ.. That female titans brutal. Damn cliffhanger though... Gotta wait a week again.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that surprised me too. Some people suggested that the titan is Annie because she looks like it, but would Annie really brutally murder so many people? 

I honestly don't know but we will see.
>> ARTICLE
She seemed to give no fucks before. It wouldn't be that surprising that she would kill in order to achieve her goal.
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that you're not really in control in Titan form, you're just driven by singular goal. Like Eren's "kill all Titans" and "punch self in face" prior to "move that boulder". 
>> ARTICLE
Without proper training/experience perhaps....I have a few ideas where this show might go I'm pretty pumped for next week.
>> ARTICLE
Who knows, Titan form seems to be a bit weird. She did stop mid swing when Armin shouted to Jean. Maybe pausing hearing his name? She also didn't seem to care about killing people so why didn't she kill Armin.
>> ARTICLE
Armin was trying to throw the titan off by suggesting Erhen was already dead.  She paused to hear the story and judge its merits (didn't believe it).
>> ARTICLE
Dudes my heart was pounding so hard when they headed into the forest. And when Ms. Titan started running towards Eren and them, and with Levi saying nothing...They're desperation had me on the edge of my seat; so enticing. It just seemed so hopeless. I'm kind of sad that Mikasa hasn't been getting much screen time lately, but I think it's ok. I have a feeling that she will soon, as usually she'll get involved with anything Eren-related if she could help it. I'm glad that Jean and Armin are getting the time they deserve. Armin has been proving himself over and over, and is no longer the boy we first met at the beginning. Rather he seems to be the link between the audience and the story because his deductions have been matching mine the entire time. And also, I love Jean. He's just so human and I'm glad they're giving him screen time. He has slowly become one of my favorite characters, as this expedition is really fleshing out his character. 

Dear god, so much death this episode. Seeing that guy get spun around like a toy was amusing and horrid at the same time. That titan is so intelligent when it comes to battle. I caught myself yelling "oh god" a few times when the Shetan slaughtered those soldiers. So OP. 

 I seriously want to see a Titan vs Titan fight, the preview really foreshadowed something like that; although, I wouldn't mind if they found another way to dispose of the Female titan with clever tactics. We'd get to see more of Levi or Erwin's commanding capability and how they deal with something so strong and different than what they are used to.

But a Titan vs Titan fight would seriously be great. 

Glad the pacing for this show has finally picked up within the last few episodes.

EDIT: God I loved the music, I don't care what anyone else says. Shingeki is OST of the season for me.

>> ARTICLE
I can already tell it's gonna be 20 minutes of Eren having a mental conversation. Because fucking production crew, that's why. 
>> ARTICLE
Nope, it's gonna be pure action for the rest of the season!
>> ARTICLE
Oh? Source? Or is that just wishful thinking?
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga
>> ARTICLE
Is the show better than the manga or vice versa? I'm debating whether or not to catch up by reading the manga.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion the anime is way better, but that has to do with it being in color, animated, having voices, music etc. I did not regret reading the manga at all because it is still very good and honestly raises more questions than give answers. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I think they're going to try to stretch the episodes. They're a ways from catching up to the manga, but it's really not THAT far off, production-wise.

How does opening 2 have spoilers
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "You can see Eren in titan form emerging from the ground, kind of, and you can see him fighting+you see the female titan in a cityscape background towards the end, which indicates that the two will be fighting in a city, as they do during the capture arc, which is why I'm pretty certain they're gonna end the show around chapter 33/34 which corresponds to the end of said arc.")

>> ARTICLE
Its obvious as hell they will end at 34. There is no where else to end.....
>> ARTICLE
They can end at 33
>> ARTICLE
same thing lol
>> ARTICLE
I'm like 90% sure they are going to stop at Chapter 33 which means they'll have to fit about 1.5 chapters per episode, which I think is doable.
>> ARTICLE
someone has convinced me that chapter 34 is a better endpoint and with the way they have changed back to a 1.5 chapter per episode format they can get there really easily. 
>> ARTICLE
I really just think it depends on what type of ending they prefer. They are both huge cliff hangers but one is [Slight Manga Spoilers](/s "a lot more wtf than the other. ")
>> ARTICLE
wtf? reveal at the end of chapter 33 is the perfect place to end the first season!
>> ARTICLE
manga reader here  the next 7 eps are full of action 
>> ARTICLE
[Congratulations!](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/2006791_o.gif) Eren, you've realized that the only real titans that you need to defeat are your own emotions. You can learn to love yourself and others!
>> ARTICLE
Congratulations?
>> ARTICLE
oh god please no
>> ARTICLE
Congratulations!
>> ARTICLE
The difference being the last two episodes actually worked really well with the rest of evangelion and the themes presented and were deep but not 2deep4u, while in SNK Eren's constant conversations with himself are pretty much just trite filler.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, grats production crew. Congrats. 
>> ARTICLE
Beautifully animated chapter. Still don't know why the female Titan hesitate killing Armin and blown away all the others like nothing. I hope something really happen next chapter.
>> ARTICLE
She only kills those who try to detain her, which Armin never did.
>> ARTICLE
She paused mid swing at Jean when Armin shouted out his name. Annie and Jean were pretty tight in their "we're going to be military police" club.  

If it is Annie I wonder if she has always been Human Titan or if the military police did something to her. Or if she even made it to the military police and was taken by someone else.
>> ARTICLE
She paused mid-swing not at the mention of Jean's name but at the reference of "the one that was eager to die". Eren became known during training camp as "the one that was eager to die" because of his speech on how he wanted to exterminate all the titans. ;D
>> ARTICLE
Actually she paused mid swing when Armin shouted out that Eren had been killed. He started yelling that she had crushed him under her foot and she paused, processing this. Armin and Reiner yell Jean's name earlier than that.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much. I actually had no idea what he was talking about there, makes so much more sense now.
>> ARTICLE
With all the theories that it's a titan like Eren, then she's most likely someone he knows. The eyes are pointing me towards Annie..
>> ARTICLE
Dude it *has* to be Annie.

1. She's the only one that didn't join the recon squad or whatever and has been missing for a few episodes.

2. Blonde

3. Hook nose.  NO ONE ELSE BUT ANNIE HAS THAT DISTINCTIVE NOSE.

I'm just wondering what Annie's goal is at this point.  She probably isn't trying to kill Eren because she could have done that long ago with 3D gear.  She's also obviously hostile because she's killing everyone.  Is she trying to take Eren hostage, if so why?  How has she been living behind the walls for so long without anyone knowing she was a Titan?  She probably killed those test subjects too but why?  It just doesn't make sense.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this, also as for the other human titans: I think Reiner is the Armor Titan because of hair and Reiner is a big guy, even Jean comments on his size this episode and Pixis is the Colossal Titan since he is the only bald character and is real mysterious. As for Annie's objective, I think she is just trying to test to see how strong Eren is so he could join the human-titan club.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know Reiner is always with berthold and I think armored and colossus titans are a team 
>> ARTICLE
I was leaning towards Commander Erwin as Colossal titan, the face shape seems to match more than Pixis.
>> ARTICLE
Could it be Eren's dad? No real phyiscal similarity but I can't see anyone having physical similarity to the colossal titan (Could be an age deal) and he disappeared after the first episode. It also seems like the kind of thing that would make for a ~plot twist~.
>> ARTICLE
Yea you're right and it would make more sense. I don't really see Pixis as a powerhouse, but Erwin would make a good fit.
>> ARTICLE
Bertholt has to be the Colossal. He's always with Reiner and looks annoyed whenever Reiner acts suspiciously.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 16: Reiner and the black haired guy are shown in the crowd when Erwin mentions Eren's basement.

Intro: When all the important characters are shown in the beginning, the transition between Reiner and the same black haired guy is different.

Episode 17: Reiner takes off his hood when charging towards female Titan, gets caught by her, *winks and cocks his head in the same direction*, somehow doesn't die when getting squished, smoke is coming from his head when he's carrying Armin, the female titan suddenly changes directions and knows exactly where to find Eren.

I'm gonna say he's *a* Titan here. Probably Armored because of the hair.
>> ARTICLE
Lol "the black haired guy". His name is Berthold (Bernard), and everyone on this forum has convinced be that he is the colossal titan as he is always with Reiner. They really should give him more screen time being that he is in the top 5 of the class.
>> ARTICLE
Probably to prevent them to study them further.  As for not knowing she's a titan, Eren can control it, why can't they? Thinking back to the big armored titan, I'm starting to see a resemblance between him and Reiner. It would make sense as well, because after he gets crushed by Annie, he breaks out with no injuries, and she heads in the direction of Eren.
>> ARTICLE
In that case, she's a perfect test of Eren's Titan power, seeing as how Annie trained him in mma.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. Plus, did you see the way she moved when she jumped and took out all of the guys attacking? She's probably one of the only people with the skills to have pulled that maneuver off.
>> ARTICLE
Armin and Reiner are blonde like her and so they are spared. Darkies get no mercy.
>> ARTICLE
It's solved then, the Female titan is Hitler.

So Ive finally caught up on this show, and Ive actually been really enjoying it lately. I think this second season has been much faster-paced and more full of interesting developments than the first half, and has been basically doing everything I could have hoped for - broadening the character focus, introducing multiple concurrent conflicts (the traitor, the original squads troubles, Erens own issues), and consistently adding new ideas. And I've got the goddamn words to prove it - if youre interested, you can see writeups on 16 and 17 [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/08/10/attack-on-titan-episode-16/) and [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/08/10/attack-on-titan-episode-17/). But screw that, Im up to date. Lets watch some Titan.

**Episode 18**

2:47 - That shot of Mikasa acting all stoic and badass always makes me wonder what she would have done if Eren had decided to be a banker or something. Would she just be running the surviving human economy at this point? I guess maybe she could do her own thing if Eren werent so goddamn intent on getting himself killed

2:56 - [Titan is Serious Business](http://i.imgur.com/lAlbHcL.jpg) Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

4:07 - I really think the show needs a balance between Titans as immediate obstacles and Titans as [source of constant, invisible threat](http://i.imgur.com/rfFeHYs.jpg). I think this setup provides for a much more even horror/action mix than Trost did

4:16 - Man, Jean can get down on himself about [anything](http://i.imgur.com/5fLrtIO.jpg), huh?

4:53 - [Another war story staple.](http://i.imgur.com/IY0IpP2.jpg) We survived the battle, what justice is there in cold/starvation/lack of medical treatment killing us? Im not knocking it - knowing what sources to draw on is a key part of storytelling, and this is a good call for this kind of story

6:56 - Though this war has taken all else, [moe *must not die*](http://i.imgur.com/tULMEBd.jpg)

7:17 - Moe was saved. [The sun shines upon this day](http://i.imgur.com/K78wGdA.jpg)

7:26 - [This show really is pretty funny](http://i.imgur.com/q5ailFv.jpg). I think I actually love stupid jokes as long as theyre incredibly inappropriate to the tone and *really* stupid

9:31 - [I like this.](http://i.imgur.com/XCeYTeF.jpg) After all the chaos of the last episode, just letting us see it from Erens incredibly limited, claustrophobic perspective

10:09 - A nice demonstration of [how much better](http://i.imgur.com/ecopZuj.jpg) the recon team is than the rookies weve seen so far. That gear is quite the superpower

12:33 - Recon team: [not the best at naming things](http://i.imgur.com/iDVwoLX.jpg)

14:09 - [One of these days, Armin is gonna figure these things out](http://i.imgur.com/gWJyzpf.jpg)

17:03 - [Half-off sale at Macys you guys](http://i.imgur.com/2Jhk8x9.jpg)

17:27 - [Awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/8EFy2eS.jpg) Not only is this much more practical intelligence than most allegedly intelligent characters, its also my first rule of worthwhile criticism - assume the people making decisions arent complete idiots, and make deductions from there

18:24 - *Lol 2deep4u shit... wait... [oh my god](http://i.imgur.com/s4boVwp.jpg)*

Man, Im being a *dick* tonight, huh? Apologies, I hit the bottle a little early

18:50 - And then the show [provides its own counter-meme](http://i.imgur.com/wRmx1BF.jpg)

19:44 - [These titans](http://i.imgur.com/wtIqOsi.jpg). Reiner is not amused

I do like this strategy, though. They can use the trees to basically create a fence of titan-bait with the outlying soldiers, and reduce the fight to the best soldiers versus the female titan in the most fortuitous possible environment. I approve

**And Done**

Oh man, those fuckers. They dragged out that last moment there, but the female titans reentry was top-notch action drama. I think this episode was a bit of a step down from the previous one, but it was still exciting and propulsive - no true standout moments like the female titans introduction, but a lot of fun action and back-and-forth between the members of the various squads. Theyve probably got another couple episodes of sweet drama to draw from this female titan, as long as they keep shifting up the variables (like this episodes wider squad focus and introduction of the forest, as compared to last episodes more personal focus and introduction of the female titan). Im still having a lot of fun with this second half. Heres hoping they keep it up

I would say one big stand out moment was everything slowing down and the music getting slowly louder right before the female titan bursts from the treeline and swats the soldier out of the air. 

That scenes sense of creeping horror was intense.

I'm no scientest, or even a smart man. But I believe too many Gs, probably lose consciousness before any real pain.  

That is unless you know, the 3d gear was just slowly eating into him with all the force while being thrown around over and over. To top it off, imagine surviving till she let go, you'd just be in the air, looking at the ground before that sweet embrace of death.

He was definitely a corpse during this scene. There was so much of his blood flying through the air and the way his body was stretched... Yeah.

I was beginning to think that Levi was allied with the Titan. Considering how it seems that he is leading every one into the forest and giving no orders on what to do with the female titan. But now, I just don't know. I'm close to just reading the manga because I really want to know what happens next. 

At any rate, good episode didn't even feel like 22 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is the a remote denoting mines placed in the forest and once the signal is given they denote them to slow the titan down. This would explain why Levi led them so far into the forest before making a move. I don't think it's a sound weapon because they would've used it already on other titans.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who made the leap and read the manga last week, its really worth it in my opinion. I thought it would ruin all the mystery and surprise but it really doesn't. I don't want to say too much in case of spoilers, but it was really worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I understand. I read the Railgun manga after its first season but still this season has been just as enjoyable. (I also kind of like seeing the anime only people's speculations XD)

I will not read the manga. I will not read the manga.

Willpower HOOOOOOOOOOO~

It is inevitable that you will read the manga soon enough.   Your willpower toward the Dark Side of Manga Reading is weak.  >:)

I'll tell you this: The ending of the anime will make you read the manga, no matter what you say.

Oh god, things will only get better from now onward. if you made it this far without reading the manga, please, just don't do it. Wait for the next episode and let yourself be blown away with awesomeness.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea what's Levi's plan was? Was the cargo carrying a cannon + supplies? Is that why he was going to fire a signal flare after telling his group to cover their ears, so that the group ahead of them can be signalled to fire the cannon at the aberrant? So many questions.


>> ARTICLE
im thinking some canons... Lots of canons... Or explosives. 

Or some kind of Ewok swinging log attack perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
The first party planted some kind of explosives in the canopy and the flare he fired hits them. That's all I got.
>> ARTICLE
A few guesses are that he's firing some kind of sound grenade; I'm thinking it's something like that too.

If there were cannons they'd have to be pretty close to Levi's group, otherwise they'd probably end up hitting some trees instead, especially with the signal lag.
>> ARTICLE
For all we know he might not even know what's the plan LOL
>> ARTICLE
His plan is to go Spin2Win on that bitch.

That end was coitus interruptus...

No Titans killed this episode.


Suicide count: **1**    

Horse Death Count: **11**  

For the scene at roughly 12:06 (The overhead of what the female titan did) I counted four Bodies, it might be more but they don't resemble bodies - the colouring is wrong.

>> ARTICLE
Side note for the person who replied to me saying Mikasa killed 13 Titans during trost:  


What was your per episode count so i can check to make sure?

Mine was:

recount of trost


ep 5   -     0

ep 6   -     4  

ep 7   -     2  

ep 8   -     2 5m     + 1 15m  

ep 9   -     0
  
ep 10  -     0
  
ep 11  -     0
  
ep 12  -     2 for this episode there's a scene where she could have an additional titan kill, but we don't see the kill. similar to the ambiguous scene with Annie.
  
ep 13  -     1  

Which episode was it wrong on, note that this episodes flashback kill was a titan that was counted on ep 13.

I suggest the female titan gets atleast a few Pixis points. 

Human horse punt.

Not sure if this is the right place to post but I'm not a manga reader and I'm wondering why is the manga being released at a slow pace?
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of following monthly manga
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan is now consistently back to giving me that sense of excitement that it lacked in the 2nd half of Defense on Trost.

I TOTALLY CALLED SOMETHING SORTA... meaning in the last episode I was hoping Christa would finally get some screentime and she did :3

SHES MINE THO, I called her perfect before reiner, Armin, or Jean said anything. Dat shinning light of a Goddess scene sold her as one of my favorite characters in this anime. 

Besides Christa being goddess-mode, my 2nd favorite part was watching female smart titan whoop-ass. Its pretty scary what shes doing to people, but honestly the way she kills the Recon soldiers is what is keeping her at this danger level of HOLY SHIT IF SHE CATCHES ME I"M FUCKED.

I will never be able to spin the keys on my lanyard the same way without thinking of that scene of super badass female titan spinning the recon dude and then going for a field goal on the other guy.

From the preview it looks like they plan on setting fire to the forest, but thats just because I thought one of the scenes included cinder.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so intense. holy shit
>> ARTICLE
As always the animation for the combat was superb. I love the impact the female titans blows make and the cool ease in which she kills people which is very different to the drunken brutality of the normal titans.
>> ARTICLE
I advise everyone to watch these previous episodes once they get through the big reveals / story  arcs, its so funny how many subtle clues are in 1 episode .
>> ARTICLE
Not entirely sure, but there are a lot of things that are sticking out to me way more than they should. Have my own ideas about what they could mean later and holy fuck do I want to just read the manga, but I am enjoying the anime far too much.

I've been waiting for this part of the Manga to come up. I was excited over the animation and intensity they built up to the cliff hanger. I am satisfied.  I've been anxious to explain little details what had happened between episode 16 and 18 but I shall not spoil it.  I still don't understand the reason for the rolling walnut in the ending theme song. lol

Man the last couple minutes was fucking intense wasn't it. Also the way blonde Annie lookalike titan killed that dude by swinging him around like a  Yo-Yo is probably the worst possible way to die.

it made sense in my head that what ever experiment was done to Eren, could have also been done on Mikasa
>> ARTICLE
U wot m9.
>> ARTICLE
The female titan was likely someone who is very skilled. There's a high possibility that she's a person-gone-titan like Eren, so even as a person she's likely highly skilled in combat and very good at thinking on the spot/under life/death situations.

It's clearly Annie, look at the eyes and nose.

Anime only thread? what happened to the regular thread? well since it is nowhere to be found i'll just make my comment a bit vague and spoiler it to be safe

what does it matter what others think about it? just because its something is being overhyped doesnt entitle you to excessively bash it in order to sate your twisted sense of balance. if you dont like it be gone. you comment on almost every snk thread so im sure most of us get the jist of what you think. stinking up the waters with your drama mongering is just as bad as overhyping the show. just let it be. its no masterpiece but its enternaining enough.

She was easily one of the best characters in this show. [Spoilers](/s "Whatever Annie's motivation may turn out to be, I can't forgive her for killing Petra.")
>> ARTICLE
What made her so great?
>> ARTICLE
Upbeat and loyal no matter what? 
>> ARTICLE
Her constant talk of trust made me wish there'd be some kind of dramatic confrontation/argument with her that would shut her up about it for a bit. Though, I'm usually like that when there's an upbeat character in a crap situation like that. Also... Your name just made me lose my train of thought for a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I think how she kept talking about trust is what made it worse when she died, like she had so much faith in her squad and then in like three seconds everyone died. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Like, her personality is why I disliked her, but it's why you wouldn't want her to die. Then seeing her corpse in that condition just kills you a little. Her father didn't help much with the feels, either.

Yeah that scene was brutal. All Levi could do was just stand there with the same expression as when her body was dumped from the wagon.

[What makes it worse is that ](/s "it's implied that Petra and Levi loved each other.") 
>> ARTICLE
No it isn't. Though there's a similar scene in the upcoming season, next year. If they go that far in the plot, that is.
>> ARTICLE
Any source on that? I don't remember that they were though. Maybe in the manga? But certainly not the anime, as far as I can recall.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga. In the anime I think it was implied from the scene between [](/s "Levi & Petra's father.") 

Forgive me if this isn't completely accurate. [It's a mainly one sided conversation but](/s "upon returning to the town, Petra's father talks about how his daughter wanted to marry Levi, etc. and by the hurt look & emotions shown by Levi, I believe he shared those feelings.") 
>> ARTICLE
The anime and manga scenes were a bit different, via the wiki (Warning: wiki is full of spoilers):

[Manga spoilers](/s "she wrote to her father about her wish to live up to Levi's expectations and dedicate herself to her career. Her father expressed his worry over her safety to Levi, as well as his disappointment that she did not seem to want to marry, despite acknowledging that she was still too young.")

[Anime spoilers](/s "In the anime however, she declared her intention to devote her life to Levi in her letters.")

EDIT: [Personal speculation based on spoilers](/s "In both I don't think she was professing her love to Levi, just that she was devoting herself to her career and Levi as a subordinate.")

I can imagine Mikasa as this old-school delinquent *banchou*, dual-wielding *bokens* to beat up rivals from Titan High and saving Eren who keeps getting into fights with them but can't take them down by himself.    
>> ARTICLE
So...Eren can magically become...a discipline master? I dunno lol. "Eren Jaeger is part of our top secret disguised junior discipline master project, and is our only chance of taking back School Maria from the delinquents!"
>> ARTICLE
I can imagine them spending two years making this spin-off anime while failing to continue the main show as the manga progresses, if only because of the wails of frustration it would cause in the community.

Kind of reminds me of that Ilya anime coming out this summer that I'm probably going to grudgingly enjoy while quietly cursing ufotable for not having the rights to Fate/Stay: Night. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think DEEN have exclusive rights to make an anime adaption. I think they were just a contract animator. The real rights likely lie with either Notes (a.k.a Type-Moon) or Fate Project, the organization formed to fund and produce the F/SN anime.

There's still hope yet!
>> ARTICLE
I'd heard they did, but it was from another reddit post so I suppose it's just rumors. That would also explain how Lerche could make Carnival Phantasm. It's frustrating to see such a great IP languishing when Fate/Zero proved an anime could be better than the original Fate/Stay adaptation.


>> ARTICLE
I think I read somewhere that the head of ufotable told Type-Moon that they'd love to make a Fate/Stay Night anime, just say the word.

Imagine Heaven's Feel animated by ufotable.

...

I'm going to go sit in a corner now.
>> ARTICLE
Heaven's. Feel. Anime. That... as awesome as it sounds, I really have no idea how they would do it. I personally feel that Heaven's Feel has way to much content to be squeezed into a 12-24 episode series. And the amount of... explicit scenes... is ridiculous yet necessary (or do Realta Nua's version. Haven't seen those yet). There is a reason why they force readers to finish Heaven's Feel last. It's necessary to have all of the background information from both Fate and UBW to fully enjoy that arc. Personally would like a reboot of UBW as an actual series rather than that shitty movie but both arcs (and probably Fate too) would be beautiful and badass with ufotable. While they're at it, they should also redo Tsukihime and make Kagetsu Tohya+Melty Blood into animes.

And for the final kicker, F/HA and Extra would allow me to die happy but /HA has way too many problems to adapt in itself. I can see Extra working though. (PLS UFOTABLE)

It didnt quite know what to call it. What is the proper term?

Not sure...umm original? xD
>> ARTICLE
yeah thought about that, but it didnt feel like it really explained it properly. 
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough.
>> ARTICLE
Track? Voice acting?
>> ARTICLE
actually...most anime is dubbed :3.. it's called ADR, where the animation is drawn first then voiced over.

US cartoons are usually done in what's known as "Pre-lay", where the voice acting is done first and the animation is done around that script.

So even the japanese Seiyuu are dubbing...but us US VAs get the advantage of seeing/hearing the japanese dubs before doing our lines.

source: flash animator & Voice Acting hopeful who's done courses with Bang! Zoom! Studios and Edge Studio in NYC
>> ARTICLE
Actually almost no anime is "dubbed" anymore if you use the original sense of the term, in which the translated dialog is recorded on top of the original, resulting in a *double* (hence "dub") audio track.

Yeah, I'm happy to see an anime that doesn't have a high school setting for once. I've already been through high school. I don't want to relive it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think it's kind of scary. Why does everything have to be about high school? Does everything tend to go completely downhill for Japanese people after they leave school?
>> ARTICLE
The primary demographic for those shows are typically high schoolers or starting university students.  It's easier for them to relate/escape to.

I mean when they get to a certain age they just get like [this] (https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=old+japanese+woman&rlz=1C1SKPL_enGB425GB425&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&authuser=0&ei=GnPMUdXAEsbJ0QX824GQBg&biw=1366&bih=667&sei=HHPMUdKFLKHE0QX4lIHwDA) so I guess so

Well, she's a helluva tomboy so
>> ARTICLE
You see how how she has her legs when she retracts her 3d gear? That is so feminine.
>> ARTICLE
You get that impression because of the military uniform or her fighting ability? There's been nothing in the series to suggest she is a tomboy. She's just a girl doing what she needs to do to survive and protect what's left of her family. Being able to fight doesn't make her a tomboy. Wearing the unisex military uniform doesn't make her a tomboy.
>> ARTICLE
As a child she was feared fighter in her neighborhood.

Right. You saying fighting is something only boys should do and if girls do it they automatically become tomboys?

Tha's sexist, bro.

Tomboy is not a swearword, nor it is something bad for a girl to be. I like tomboys.

But slashing down an army of titans while all your colleagues are shitting their pants sure does make you less of a pussy than everyone else

Doesn't make a girl into a tomboy, though.

>> ARTICLE
What annoyed me the most was how the squad handled the situation in the flashback.It was very unprofessional to say the least.

 The point is that as paranoid as they are or whatever they still couldn't comprehend how relatively harmless an arm is and shat themselves over it. Their reactions would be justified if Eren grew legs or maybe grew two arms for some mobility, but that wasn't the case. It was an arm and half a ribcage. Being so scared that they ignore their captain over an immobile arm makes no sense considering who they are.

Rather than 'elites' they acted like unqualified civilians
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I also noticed that and this trope is more common. Similiar thing that's bothering me a little is how often have we been shown a situation in which one squadmate is being devoured and the rest is watching helplessly contemplating the despair of the situation. One might think that military would work a procedure for a case such as this, for example when a titan is busy playing with their prey you should attack. You only increase chances of survival for them and successful attack for you.

I guess I should accept the fact that SoK is partially a boyish military fantasy and not to force my "realistic expectations" on it.
>> ARTICLE
You mean when they were in their first mission and were totally scared shitless?!!
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's what happens when you enlist teenagers. 
>> ARTICLE
They didn't know if his Titan transformation was voluntary. What if he lost control at that very moment and is able to swing that Titan arm around? They have seen enough of the ruthlessness of Titans. 

Besides, they just got to know him and haven't trusted him yet. That was an incident that started tying their bonds. 
>> ARTICLE
Teaspoon.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of which, [I can't help but notice the similarity between these two events](http://imgur.com/a/cBETs) (anime-only person so could be way off)...
>> ARTICLE
The big difference here being that Eren turned into a titan and Mikasa didn't. I think we can safely write that off as being a stylistic choice.
>> ARTICLE
ah, so she didn't have the crazy electricity thing going on in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
clearly Mikasa is always in titan form
>> ARTICLE
AH! How could we have all been so foolish? Mikasa is the Kid Buu of titans. Her most powerful titan form is that of a 1.6 meter (or however tall she is, blame America for my lack of metrics) class titan.
>> ARTICLE
1.6 m = 160 cm = 5' 4"
>> ARTICLE
Teaspoon desuka?
>> ARTICLE
Look, to everybody who just wants mindless Titan-slicing action for OP to ED, this show isn't really about combat. That's just the icing on the cake. This is a show about fear and doubt and not knowing what the hell is going on. Besides, if they deviated even slightly from the manga, millions of fans would break out their homemade 3D maneuver gear and slice the creators up for real.
>> ARTICLE
That's what annoys me about a lot of complaints on this subreddit. So many people complain when things are just Dragonball Z with a new skin. Like come on guys, there's more to a show than just mindless action.

Is it just me or did they run out of time to animate this [Bridge](http://i.imgur.com/DMSVJuw.jpg). It's not that apparent in a still image, but it's like, a simple rolling texture with some rough lines drawn on, and they shift about a bit in a 3-frame loop. It's at 20:45

Does it? I'm still confused on this, maybe I missed it in an early episode, but do Titans feel pain? When they were doing the experiments on them in the last few episodes it seemed like they did, but all throughout the Trost battle it seemed like they didn't.  
>> ARTICLE
Maybe most titans were just too stupid to react 
>> ARTICLE
Sawney and bean. Bean was screaming when he was stabbed in the eye

Yeah thats what I was talking about when I said the experiments, but then the entire rest of the show they infer that the Titans don't feel any pain, thats why I'm confused.

Good episode, glad to see some development of the squad's characters. It makes sense that they would be freaked out at first, especially without warning. And seeing Hanji fangirl out on Eren's arm was funny.

However, this show is really suffering from a lack of Mikasa. I want to see her and Levi kick some ass. 

As for the next episode, I can see things going bad really quickly, especially since Levi had an 'oh shit' face. And we'll see more blonde commander, whose name I should really know by now.

I just remember that Tongue Biter has the most solo kills out of all of them by far (not counting Levi).

Na you shouldn't make an effort to learn character names.  If the characters are any good you will remember the names naturally.  That's actually a good test for any show.
>> ARTICLE
You can definitely make a good show without such a focus on character's names. Some shows do a really good job of just intermittedly throwing and removing characters in to get a more realistic representation of life.

Remembering the names is more about repetition and screen time than it is quality. Quality influences how much you pay attention.
>> ARTICLE
That's not really 100% applicable because the characters in this case would be more recognizable if Eren responded to them or talked to them in name. But because they're his superiors, he's forced to say 'Yes, Captain!", "No, Squad Commander!"

That's also why it's easier to remember his fellow cadets, because he refers to them by name more often.

I'm surprised they managed to [SnK Ep. 19](/s "catch her.") The way she rolled over everyone that tried to attack her made it seem like it was impossible. I'm placing my bet that it's Annie, considering she didn't join the survey corps and the titan looks just like her.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Eren-titan looked similar to Eren, through. 
>> ARTICLE
True, lots of people expected it to be Eren back then although it wasn't even revealed that something like that was possible. However they might use that knowledge now to make us think it is her, only to reveal it's not her.

But I'd say there are several hints that it is in fact Annie
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Eren-Titan looked anything like Eren. Hair too long, face too angly, abs too JACKED. I feel like a lot of people thought the Titan was Eren because of a combination of (a) denial of an anime killing the protagonist five episodes in and (b) a Titan killing other Titans that just happened to have basic human combat training. I thought that way, at least.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget it just happened to be *Mikasa* that he saved. 
>> ARTICLE
The eye color was the same though, that's what convinced me
>> ARTICLE
idk im probably dumb for thinking this but could it be Armin's mom.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's pretty obviously Annie at this point, and since the human/titan things take on physical characteristics i'm gonna say the armored titan from the early episodes is Reiner (same hair). I could be incredibly off though.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, since I haven't yet read the Manga and won't touch it til the series is finished I've always found that OP's and ED's always give a hint of things to come, with [Reiner, some other dude, and Annie all turning around and facing the soldiers we've grown to love,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=SxOpp_00t5k&t=22) well I think that's fairly subtle and awesome way of stating the sides they really stand on and that the more inward into the kingdom you get, the more coruption is present, can't wait til the show reaches the heart of the city/country, just a theory and could be over analyzing, but either way I LOVE THIS FUCKING SHOW
>> ARTICLE
Now that you mention it...ED2 shows Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Sasha, Jean and Connie on one side of the wall. The other side is Annie, Reiner, Bertholdt(?), Krista, and some other black haired girl whose name I'm not sure of.

There is also a painted image, shown twice in ED2, that depicts what looks like two opposing human forces facing each other as if they are preparing for a battle.  
>> ARTICLE
That adds alot more importance to when the boys called her a goddess then since the titans effectively are gods striking wrath into the humans, so many subtle things in that series, when i first started paying attention to reiner possibly being the armored titan was when he and annie helped retake the gas supply room and he made a point of saying he was happy she wasn't killed, and annie just walked off with an annoyed attitude, reading into it her actions seemed to say "shut up, you're gonna blow our cover" 
>> ARTICLE
That was 5 years ago though. He'd have to have been in on it for such a long time.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point. If they were doing something this long it would have to be pretty huge. I don't doubt there could be some huge twist once they reach Erin's basement.
>> ARTICLE
Also Reiner would have been a child then.
>> ARTICLE
maybe he's some kind of immortal, or being a titan shifter stops aging
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think it's Armin's mom. Remember his parents left him and went outside the wall, and the titan refused/failed to kill him twice, plus they both have blond hair and blue eyes(although a lot of characters do), and Idk i feel like when he realized she was a human titan like Eren, he kind of had an oh shit she looks familiar look on his face.
>> ARTICLE
Also the female titan has been going on a killing rampage with any Recons that come in her way the but conveniently spares Armin from the same fate.  She had quite a motherly look to her face when she removed Armin's hood.
>> ARTICLE
this was my instinct on it too. But mention of Annie does hold water too.
>> ARTICLE
That was my exact thought as soon as she let Armin go. I'm not so sure anymore because of everyone thinking it's Annie, but there is definitely the possibility. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a bunch of rockets at first. Though that scene in the intro now makes a lot of sense. 

Yeah, that close up at the end pretty much sealed it for me.

Looking forward to the next episode where they take 22 minutes just to cut open the titan.
>> ARTICLE
The show goes at the *exact* pacing the manga does. Now keep in mind that each episode is two chapters, and the manga is released *monthly*.

Look, if every episode was 22 minutes of straight Titan fighting that would be boring as hell. The director is trying to tell a story, pay attention and you'll enjoy it more.
>> ARTICLE
People complaining about pacing aren't necessarily wanting all action all the time. I think the show is doing fine lately, but it used to have serious issues with just taking disproportionate amounts of repetitive yelling to get an idea across, or having characters like Armin *repeat their development*, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people keep calling the anime out on 'wasting time' when it literally follows the exact same pacing as the manga at the moment. Scene for scene its the same, so blame the authors of the manga not the anime production crew.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's because I already disliked the pacing of the manga. But the anime thread is not the place to explain why.
>> ARTICLE
I think the pacing is fine is really adds to the suspense. It really makes you wait impatiently for another week for the next episode. At least anime watchers don't have to wait a month like those who read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. The pacing in this show is fine. It's not just about Mikasa running around cutting off Titan heads. The show is more about the fear everyone feels, how they deal with what is going on, watching their friends die, being locked up, etc. Every episode doesn't need to be jam packed with action. 
>> ARTICLE
It would not be as bad if we had all the episodes to watch right now.
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree with you on that. Also personally, I could understand complaints of slow pacing if there was a lot of filler and tons of boring parts, but that whole episode was exciting. This might just be me, but I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was never bored and waiting for shit to start to speed up.

Can't understand why a lot of people are bitching about the pacing. The pacing of the plot is more than ok and the adaption of the manga is nearly 1 to 1 the exact same as the manga. Thats one of the best adpated series imo. What more can you ask for?
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the pacing is uneven, so it is both depending on which part of the show you are watching.
>> ARTICLE
what annoys me is that people seem to complain it is too fast and others complain it is too slow... Make up your goddamn mind!
>> ARTICLE
because it was MUCH more full on up til about ep 15.. now it's gone all dragonball, 10 eps of powering up style.
>> ARTICLE
The story is moving slowly, I don't care why, it's just moving very slowly.
A lot more should happen given the allotted time, compared to other shows. Attack on Titan has shit pacing.

With that being said, I'm asking for better fucking pacing.
>> ARTICLE
The story moving ahead slowly doesn't mean that it has shit pacing. It would be horrible if all that happened this episode was them being chased and the titan being captured, however, they used much of the time on what was, in my opinion, some very meaningful flashbacks that were very relevant to the situation at hand.

EDIT: Also, said flashbacks helped to begin to develop the members of Eren's squad, which is also quite important.
>> ARTICLE
No. It's not important to develop unimportant characters.
Those characters are not there to immerse you in a world of Titans, they're there to fill blank space for the author.
Not only do they usually not contribute anything of value to the story, but those characters are only developed enough so it shocks you when some of them die.

Granted, with this show they've done things right with the Jean character and whatnot.  The thing is they have introduced way too many characters, in 24 episodes there is no way they are going to be fleshed out properly.


Since you mentioned flashbacks, let's get something clear.
Flashbacks themselves are not bad, the fault lies in the execution.
They don't have to be that drawn out, and we wouldn't need so many of them if the story were told better.


**tl:dr**
Attack on Titan has VERY poor pacing, I'm not being harsh on the show just because.
>> ARTICLE
> It's not important to develop unimportant characters

Kind of an odd line there, considering characters generally become more important as they get more screen time and as they develop. Who's to say  Eren's squad members won't become very important characters? (as I've only read the manga up to vol 5, which is behind where the anime is atm, I don't know whether or not this will end up being the case, so I would request you to not spoil anything)

Meh I just got finished watching oreimo which hit my feels hard, and its 5am here or else I would reply more, maybe tomorrow though.
>> ARTICLE
The Z Warriors are everpresent in Dragonball and get their share of screen time. Are they important to the plot? No, they are cannon fodder, used to be killed and build cheap drama before the Super Saiyans appear and kick ass. 

Same thing applies to AoT. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the show itself is one the best I've seen, and people definitely got spoiled by the amazing first few episodes (Episodes 1-5 covers a SHITLOAD of plot points when you think about it), and when things slowed down to a more regular pace, the overall perception is that the pacing sucks.

The manga itself is pretty weak when it comes to pacing (even for a monthly publication where it has 40-50 pages to do things), but it's still highly regarded because of the quality of where to story leads to.
>> ARTICLE
That's because the pacing does suck, not keeping up with your own pacing is bad pacing.


The story will lead to nowhere because we're 19 episodes in and there's already no time to properly end it all, and there's no fucking way I am sitting through another season of this.
>> ARTICLE
Shows do tend to pick up near the end of a defined season, I'm also using the next episode as judgement as to how they're keeping the pace.
>> ARTICLE
> the quality of where to story leads to

Doesn't lead anywhere in the past few episodes. In fact, it keeps adding more questions than answering them.
>> ARTICLE
You should be somewhat satisfied as the season nears its finale, because that's when shows usually pick up a lot.
>> ARTICLE
The arc conclusions will do what this show has always done, manipulate the viewer into thinking the next 5 minutes of actual episode will move the plot forward.

Until this show gets an OVA (or something that cuts all the bullshit), it will be unwatchable for me.
>> ARTICLE
If you rewatch the past few episodes, A LOT has been covered, and as a manga reader, there are so many little details that the studio has done an absolute genius job of portraying regarding the plot.

Basically, if you feel the series is unwatchable as it is now and don't come back to it until it's officially 'done' (as in FMA Brotherhood done), you'll see that this could be one of the best manga adaptions ever done in terms of themes and foreshadowing.
>> ARTICLE
>Can't understand why a lot of people are bitching about the pacing. The pacing of the plot is more than ok and the adaption of the manga is nearly 1 to 1 the exact same as the manga.

It's really not that hard to comprehend: the manga has poor pacing.

It's an awesome story, and I'm hooked, but it's not being told efficiently.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this argument holds much water. Just because the manga is being adapted almost verbatim doesn't mean the anime can't be poorly-paced, or without flaws. And in any case, manga doesn't translate directly to anime - you have to convey more visually and less via dialogue if you want to keep it interesting to watch. If anything, adapting the source material essentially 1:1, without making any adjustments, is a mistake.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, the show actually has quite a bunch of characters appearing for something only 19 episodes long. The manga doesn't even give much of these characters time to develop and be recognizable, whereas I've noticed the anime actually take its time while still advancing the plot. 

It's not a 1:1 adaptation because it does indeed slow down for the characters while being far from filler (which usually does nothing to improve the characters or plot). I can see why it's frustrating when you wait an entire week for two plot points to advance slightly (finding out what Eren needs to trigger Titan mode, capturing the Female Titan), but in the context of the greater picture it actually helps.
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with you, I don't think an anime is required to adapt a manga in a 1:1 ratio, especially because if this is the second go-around, they can make adjustments and improvements this time to make things go smoother. One of the problems with the AoT manga is that Isayama tends to shove in flashbacks in ways that are sometimes confusing, sometimes out of place, and in a way I would have liked to see that rectified (they actually did do a better job of presenting events in a chronological order in earlier episodes). 
>> ARTICLE
Wait, what? The pacing's fine now. Are people still whining about last season? Concrete stuff happened - a flashback, and a big event. If this were the latter half of season one, we'd have at least three full episodes of riding through the fucking forest.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, sure the pacing sucked a few episodes back, but right now it's pretty damn good!
>> ARTICLE
I think people just want it to be 100% action all the time when it's a series about a lot more than that.  It's about trying to figure out what's going on and how to survive.
>> ARTICLE
Can't speak for anyone else but I would prefer flashback/dialogue scenes like that to not be in the middle of high-paced action scenes. Though I can certainly understand why they would wanna use it to build even more suspense.
>> ARTICLE
It's a set-up for the finish. The episode is as much about Eren learning to trust the squad as it is the squad learning to trust Eren. That's why they had the flashback. So that in the next episode when things most likely go sour, the elite squad will be more cool with Eren shifting.

I'd even go as far as to say they'll have a still with the screen partitioned into all the member's of the Levi squad grabbing their weapons but not drawing them, then Levi's hands staying still after.
>> ARTICLE
While I see where your coming from and kind of agree, I do have to admit the way they transitioned from the flashback back into the titan chasing them was pretty epic.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but to be fair that flashback/dialogue scene is crucial for understanding why Eren is doing what he is doing.
>> ARTICLE
It's crucial because it's a first contact for the Levi squad. Everyone's going to be much more calm the next time Eren shifts.

The riding dialogue is all about Eren trusting their decisions and them trusting Eren as a soldier.

They distrusted both Eren's shifting abilities, and his vengeful nature. You don't want a soldier like Eren first was in your squad. He was too impetuous. But this shows them he has trust, and in return, they trust him.
>> ARTICLE
To me it's just dividing up stuff for better pacing.  If they had held off on some of this stuff, that means that the actual action would have been held off longer than what it was, and people would be complaining about the pacing because of that.

I've honestly come to the conclusion that since Attack on Titan is so hugely popular, they're pretty much damned if they do, damned if they don't.  If they try to skip stuff in the manga to be more action focused, people will complain that it's not adhering to the manga.  If they do stuff like this and keep slowing things down with discussion episodes and flashbacks, people complain because they want it to return to the action.  
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree, and imo they chose right to adhere to the manga very closely.
>> ARTICLE
Ya you're probably right.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want it to be 100% action, but I want the plot to move forward. I didn't mind the episode where Eren stood trial for being a titan because that moved the plot forward. This episode hardly moved the plot forward at all and instead focused on what was to me, really meaningless character development.
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't see how it's meaningless.  It was showing Eren, who has primarily done whatever he has wanted throughout most of the series, finally buckling down and restraining himself to believe in others.  Not only is this a big shift in himself, it's a pretty big shift from most shounen protagonists who just go around doing whatever they want all the time, somehow turning on top in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but that's not what happened during the flashback. During the flashback, we saw Eren getting to know the other members of squad Levi, which was unnecessary because even though it contributed to Eren's decision to listen to the squadmembers and do as told, I already assumed from prior character development that he respected these people enough to listen to them when push came to shove, so this character development, specifically from the flashback, was unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
It's a little early to call anything unnecessary. Unless your bringing manga information in here, in which cause you can politely turn around and leave.

It's to show their first up and close contact with his ability. It's something to brace everyone. The next time he transforms, they'll probably make a big deal of everyone tensing up/grabbing swords, but still remaining calm and trusting Eren.

This episode wasn't just about Eren accepting the squadmate's as his superiors, it was about the squad accepting Eren as one of them.

Man that look Female Titan gives there at the beginning is kinda creepy.

I figured Eren could only turn into a titan under stress or in danger. It's too easy to make him able to do it so willy nilly.

Wow wasn't able to make much that time. Makes sense though since it was an accident.

Jesus Zoe is so weird.

All in all a very enjoyable episode. The sheer number of spears used to keep Female Titan in place was impressive.
>> ARTICLE
So perhaps Eren finds it more difficult to control the Titan when he has a more complex goal to fulfill? "Move the boulder to plug the wall" is a more complex thing to accomplish then "Kill all the Titans" which is what I assume was going through his head the first time he transformed. Maybe that explains why he lost control that time. 
>> ARTICLE
I heard someone say he was mad at mikasa before he transformed so. TITAN SMASH
>> ARTICLE
Some other people were suggesting that he had transformed too much in a short amount of time to gain control right away, or that he was distracted with the argument he had with Mikasa right before they set out.
>> ARTICLE
That was my theory. I mean, imagine the kind of energy it would take to generate that much flesh from your own body. You might be on to something with the second part though, maybe *anything* he is thinking about can leak through.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think the second idea is the correct one. He was upset with Mikasa right before he transformed, so it was on his mind
>> ARTICLE
Another epic episode that I'm pleased with. I love how they set the scenes to better understand Eren's titan transformation and Hanji was quite entertaining. Each of the 4 guys around Eren grew past meaningless meat shields doomed to die some way through the minor scenes and I'm really happy that we got to see them bite their own hands to show the importance of the characters and that they're not all overreactive scared people ready to end Eren at first notice. Trust exists in this group and it shows the value when the plan came to fruition. 

I don't really know why Levi couldn't just tell ERen what was going on, if it was to just test how much Eren would actually believe in the group, but it worked out in the end. I'm excited to see what happens next, and it really sounded like the Survey corpse have the knowledge that a human is controlling the female superbadass titan (who still killed people in scary brutal ways). It might be they already knew, or suspect that she is similar to Eren so someone must be inside. I can't expect the investigation to go without error though so I'm once again acting patient for next week's shows
>> ARTICLE
> I don't really know why Levi couldn't just tell ERen what was going on

This really confused me.  There were also other inconsistencies, like how the various squad members were freaking out and screaming for Levi's orders in Ep18, but at the end of this one were chiding Eren for doing the same thing and telling him just to "have faith".

> Note: I haven't given the female titan any Pixis points, simply because being a titan and stomping stuff that are essentially flies to you doesn't feel awesome.

I think they're doing a good job of showing how skillful she is.  That's not saying much when compared to an average titan but her tactical moves seem pretty impressive.  A normal titan is scary but a titan that knows what they are doing is scary as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
True, and I can see what you mean, but in the end she enters the battle against anyone else except Eren as a heavy favourite (and perhaps Mikasa / Levi with backup too) simply due to her being many times the size, speed, strength, tenacity and toughness.  

It's definitely skillful, between her grabbing the wires and slinging them into trees and hitting them mid flight. But it feels like more of a reality of fighting that which is smart, knows what the opponent has to do and expecting the tactics that will be used and how to deal with it, all the while being severely outmatched for them in overall power.
>> ARTICLE
This is more of a horror show the way you put it >:O
>> ARTICLE
Dat jump from the last episode (or one before it?), too. One of the guys fighting her looked as if he'd never seen a Titan jump. Which we really haven't seen a lot of.

Is it just me or did the opening have more shots of the female titan?
>> ARTICLE
Yea the OP was a little different towards the start, including adding the female titan.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, always there. Manga viewers were specifically looking out for it when the new OP came. I for one was super fucking excited to see her actual face in the OP, rather than just the body shots

I noticed that they show her face for a split second right at the start of the op

That was always there though....

As someone who has read the manga, even I'm a little annoyed at the cliffhanger. Well not so much annoyed as desperate to see some spoilery stuff that I won't mention animated.     
But hey, it can't be all action all the time.

I am glad they included the flashback, it gives a lot of insight into how Eren Titan works

>> ARTICLE
Yep, fell behind again. What can I say, Im pretty lukewarm on this show, and it comes out right in the middle of the Gatchaman->Monogatari->Uchouten Kazoku time frame where my anime-watching time is actually monopolized by serious business shows. Plus, like most shounens, the show just works better when you build up a few episodes anyway.

Anyway. Big female titan in the trees. What do?

0:52 - Man, this show really [sucks for the extras](http://i.imgur.com/cRk6ynS.jpg)

1:38 - [Why is this guy always the best.](http://i.imgur.com/dcrVCZa.jpg) This show *really* needed someone who drew attention to the inherent grimdark silliness of the proceedings, and this guy is serving that role with grace and distinction

3:30 - [With the titan momentarily stunned, Levi takes this moment to dryly chastise his troops](http://i.imgur.com/6bwzd6x.jpg). Tut tut, terrified soldiers

4:07 - [This is why Eren should have died.](http://i.imgur.com/3qEXYxh.jpg) His hot-blooded shounen-protagonistness is basically incompatible with a world with actual consequences. Hes like the guy in zombie movies who opens the door to save one last person and gets everybody killed

4:36 - [Someone hit him please](http://i.imgur.com/xTobSzj.jpg). Youd think after Trost hed understand the weight of responsibility his power implies

Maybe thats actually gonna be an arc. Hes certainly the most static of the main characters so far, so Id actually be quite happy to see a this is a war, people will die, we are fighting for greater things than single soldiers turn

4:44 - [Oh my god get off your high horse you entitled piece of shit](http://i.imgur.com/fEJOamd.jpg)

4:56 - [Did they not teach this on day one of cadet training?](http://i.imgur.com/R8lzEGz.jpg) Imperfect orders followed unanimously sure beat hes in trouble, we have to save him!

5:20 - [Eren so help me god I will end you](http://i.imgur.com/6NSE24S.jpg)

6:04 - [Are we are we supposed to *like* this quality?](http://i.imgur.com/f6dZQwt.jpg) *He joined the fucking army.* Hes not a badass, hes just a nearsighted gloryhound shithead

6:40 - [Goddamnit.](http://i.imgur.com/qM6GvOB.jpg) This show dabbles in an actually interesting idea here, and then resolves it with believe in your friends! A gritty haircut and some blood doesnt fix the shounen issues

8:05 - [Okay, another chance here.](http://i.imgur.com/SozsfcK.jpg) This show keeps poking at the fact that Eren really has no comprehension of the true nature of total war, so hopefully it lays out some hard truths soon

8:33 - [When is her spinoff coming out?](http://i.imgur.com/TKDZiPT.jpg)

9:38 - [No disappointment. Merely readjusting his plans.](http://i.imgur.com/L16HJ57.jpg) Nice that at least the actual soldiers act like, well, actual soldiers

10:45 - [Featured: the people Eren thinks hes better at making in-field decisions than](http://i.imgur.com/xB3LIDL.jpg)

12:48 - [Wait what now everyones being super stupid again.](http://i.imgur.com/eyZHcva.jpg) Gah, this show

13:17 - [Eren really does tend to clam up in these situations.](http://i.imgur.com/obnA9yx.jpg) Its not as bad as the Eren tries to remember hes not a monster for ten minutes from Trost (nothing really could be), but its still reaaally bad pacing

13:45 - [Seriously, just call me when they announce the spinoff](http://i.imgur.com/CuPePgx.jpg)

15:33 - [Good.](http://i.imgur.com/zGmsWz4.jpg) Its not about courage, its about a healthy respect for danger

17:01 - [Also good](http://i.imgur.com/dlw0iJk.jpg). Dragging out key constraints like this would be bad, both in a tedious dramatic irony sense (since this was pretty much audience-known information ever since the boulder) and in the sense that the soldiers fighting with full knowledge of his abilities will probably lead to more interesting conflicts

18:25 - [*I* certainly am.](http://i.imgur.com/JWGRSyD.jpg) But I also appreciate that they can treat him like both a threat that might need disposal at any time as well as a human being deserving of respect or empathy

19:51 - [In this episode, Eren decides not to turn into a titan, largely for sentimental reasons](http://i.imgur.com/XQKsfaY.jpg). This show has problems

20:36 - [Sweet](http://i.imgur.com/7CcljTl.jpg)

22:05 - [You mean Eren *isnt* the only human titan?](http://i.imgur.com/nE6Iu99.jpg) Mind = blown. Next youll tell me its the one secondary character whos both absent this arc and looks exactly like that titan

**And Done**

Ending on I hope they havent pissed themselves? TITAN.

Well, that episode was pretty crap. Outside of the cast learning titanification needs a goal trigger, basically the entire episode was given over to an emotional turn that both shouldnt have been necessary and didnt amount to much. Eren *still* isnt really any more of a soldier - he just has faith in this particular group of people. And thats I guess fine, and pretty much how characterization goes in this kind of show, but they certainly took their time getting there.

This is the second time I though that Erwin is evil but get proven wrong. Never would have thought they were waiting in the forest waiting for the titan
>> ARTICLE
Really? It was telegraphed the moment they decided to enter the woods &#3232;_&#3232;
>> ARTICLE
I personally just didn't predicted/think that Erwins squad would be camping in the woods waiting for them to attack. Stupid thinking on my behalf
or during when Erwin sent word out to the other groups about entering the forest I just didn't read the subs right 
>> ARTICLE
Am i the only one that noticed that the animation budget seemed to be lacking again? When Eren and Levi have their talk they make them almost static and then pump the budget into the 5 seconds of rocket ropes in the end...

Sure it is nice to have good action scenes but not if a majority of the show will suffer from it.
>> ARTICLE
They outsourced most of the episode to Studio Daume to save money for the next 5 or so episodes that are going to be expensive.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the real action scenes have always looked pretty good, at the expense of having the other "normal" moments look pretty poor in comparison...there was a stretch of episodes that was kinda bad-looking (9-11, ish) but they more than made up for it with 13, then 17/18 looking pretty phenomenal, so I'm pretty sure that the scenes that are really action heavy will look just fine. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that episode was well balanced in the budget. The entire time the titan was chasing them the trees where in 3d too. The stillness I think emphasized the seriousness of the moment, but I see where you are coming from.
>> ARTICLE
I saw somewhere that the manga chapters were being shuffled for this arc so I had some sort of warning that the tone would shift for one episode.

Speaking of which, it was a good character development episode. I really love how much depth goes into the show with the plot, the characters, and explaining everything on what's going on which is one of the major reasons I think why this anime has been so successful.
>> ARTICLE
ITT: People bitching about other people bitching about pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
are you... bitching about it?
>> ARTICLE
In terms of feedback, I've seen more people claiming that others want more action and that's bad, than people actually saying they do. Despite the close calibration between the pace of the manga and the anime, it's not hard to say that this show takes a while. The problem with it, is that it is very introspective, and the characters come off as irrationally stubborn because of their incessant fear. My biggest problem with it, is that their world and lives suck ass. Never do they really rejoice in living, yet they still value their lives. In that kind of setting, I'd expect to see a lot more psychopaths and insane people being a part of their force willing to throw their lives away.
>> ARTICLE
Compared to the manga the female titan's face sure gave me chills, just when she is looking at Eren and her hand is sticking out to grab him, dat smile.

This episode is getting a lot of hate and I understand that because of the flashback in the middle of the suspense but next week it'll pick up again for sure.  I don't want to spoil anything or be the guy who drops hints but trust me shit is going to hit the fan, that is all I have to say.  
>> ARTICLE
I liked the flashback to be honest it gave weight to the conversation
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda annoyed that they went into such a long flash back right in the middle of such a tense moment but it tied into the narrative rather well so I can give credit for that.

But otherwise, whilst it was nice to try and flesh out Eren a bit more, I can't say I was amazed by it. All Eren's really done is go from emotionally reckless to actually listening to other people this time. That's not so much growth as it is going from negative to zero in terms of likeability so he's pretty much right back to square one. Okay, maybe I'm being a bit harsh: Eren is actually pretty cool and to be fair, if there is a giant horrific monster chasing after you like that female titan was, you'd probably want to increase your chances of survival as well and turn into a Titan if you could. But honestly after 19 episodes, I can't say I feel much for Eren, at least not nearly as much as I do for Armin, Mikasa and Jean. For a main character he's just been a bit too passive and reactionary to events around him. He doesn't really shape the story much, despite his attempts at doing so. It's not that different for the other characters either, but they have that leeway since they're not meant to be the focus of the story. And with Armin, I at least feel he's getting somewhere and figuring things out.

Moreover, it would be nice if the story would take everything into account when it's developing Eren's character. We already know he has the ability to place faith his his friends as we saw when he trusted Armin with his life, so I don't really think Eren is as much of a lone wolf as the episode made him out to be

Anyone know the music that started to play at 19:40? Sounded awesome and really fit the mood imo

The song is called "Baukltze".
>> ARTICLE
Ever since I read all the manga, I haven't been able to enjoy the anime as much. Does this happen to anyone else? 
>> ARTICLE
That's why I haven't read the manga for this yet. Every time I read the manga on an ongoing anime I feel the same way.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I'm worried that it will ruin it for me. But as soon as the season is over I'm going to read it, because who knows how long of a wait it will be for a second season.
>> ARTICLE
True, I always pick one. I usually don't bother watching the anime when I'm reading the manga and vice versa. This is unless they really go into different directions or one of the both just stops.
>> ARTICLE
Of course, there's a reason why we try so hard to avoid spoilers. No doubt there's satisfaction in seeing your favorite scenes animated, but that doesn't hold up to finding out what happens next, especially since this show does a great job of cliff hanger-ing.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely enjoy it more now that I have read it, as Darkurai said I get to enjoy all my fav scenes in all their animated glory.
>> ARTICLE
I've started to enjoy the anime even more since reading the manga. I get excited for my favorite scenes to show up.
>> ARTICLE
>I can already tell it's gonna be 20 minutes of Eren having a mental conversation. Because fucking production crew, that's why.

Well, bra-vo, clap-clap.

But the real reason is that they're following the manga almost panel for panel. And you should love them for it.
>> ARTICLE
my god the manga must be so fucking boring to read.
>> ARTICLE
They moved the training arc and doing so made it better. There's no reason to repeat the manga's mistakes.
>> ARTICLE
Moving the training arc fucked up Marco's death scene. Sure it made the Colossal reveal ALOT better, but Marco's death reveal was alot better in the Manga. Having the last scene of the training arc a conversation between Jean and Marco, and then it goes back to present day with Marco dead... that is alot better than just a quick flashback when Jean sees him.

At the same time, moving this flashback would have ruined the best scene in this episode, the "Have faith." line. 

EDIT: Glad people are downvoting for opinions. I believe Marco's death is alot better in the manga than the anime, fuck me, right?
>> ARTICLE
Slight spoiler?

You're in the discussion thread for Ep. 19 complaining about spoiler from Ep. 5/6? wut?

Marco's death was episodes ago.

Nobody gives a shit about Marco. The colossal titan is the most iconic character of the show. If they are going to screw one of them in favor of the other, there is an obvious correct choice.

I think I might start doing this. It's pretty funny. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused by the chiding Eren receives from the other squad members at the end, telling him that he needs to have more faith in Levi.  In the last episode, all of the squad members were freaking out and screaming for Levi to tell them what was going on and to give them orders.  Now they're acting like they were cool with it all along?  Am I misunderstanding something?
>> ARTICLE
1. Convincing Eren in order to convince themselves.

2. They wanted Levi to make a decision - they will follow when he makes one, but they needed him to voice it. He did, and now they follow.
>> ARTICLE
One thing I've noticed is that the female titan deals out quick, relatively painless, deaths every time. If she really were an enemy, which I don't really have any doubts she is, she wouldn't really have any regard to "humane" executions. What I'm trying to say is it seems she has compassion... no pity, for the humans. That raises the question as to why the "human titans" are attacking humanity? Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
No, not at all... She is just in a rush to catch Eren and needs to make sure they actually die, so that they don't get in her way.
>> ARTICLE
I would agree except the previous episode has her spinning a guy's dead corpse/killing him with centrifugal force. That's not painless or merciful.
>> ARTICLE
I think it is more her being efficient and intelligent about it. Contrast to the mindlessness of most titans eating. 
>> ARTICLE
The next episode will finally have them do something other than ride horsies all day. Don't get me wrong, the episode where they rolled out in formations was cool, but time for some good ol' 3D gear on trees action.
>> ARTICLE
I know the thread's a bit old, but I just caught up to the anime, anyway, my theory of the female titan is that it's Armin's mom. Didn't both his parents leave the safety of the walls before the story even began? So when she first removed Armin's hood a couple of episodes ago, she recognized her son and that's why she didn't kill him.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the insight of the Squad's characters as well as Captain Levi, it was pretty awesome to understand the fears and tension they all had with Eren when he accidentally transformed xD.

The ending where they capture the female titan was so epic!!  Also, how the hell did the female titan manage to cover her neck before getting captured?  Eh, maybe for next week.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's Eren's Mom, since we never saw her die, and she would naturally have ties to Eren's father who is the one who turned him into a Titan (we think) and also who know all the Titan's secrets. I also think that the father is the colossal titan.
>> ARTICLE
Im pretty sure her blood rained down on hannes mikasa and eren as they ran... like legit raining... id rule that out tbh... plus the fem kyojin is blonde.
>> ARTICLE
I was saying this too. . . .but why would the titan be blonde?
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting the feeling that the fanboys think that we are complaining because there isn't enough action. That's fucking bollocks.

I complain because there is way too much dragging and milking it out as of lately.  For instance, episode 19.  A third or half (at most) of the episode would have been enough for that flashback about the Eren titan episode.  But no, they stretched it out NEEDLESSLY to 90 percent of the episode and left the plot development just a blip towards the end.  

All they are caring about is the cliffhanger at the end of the episode and you idiotic fanboys are lapping it up.


and as I said in another thread, I don't give a little miniscule shit about downvotes, so downvote away, brainless fanboys.
>> ARTICLE
It was to explain how his transformation works, nothing else. The series is filled with these kind of flashbacks to introduce more info, it's nothing new. I think the first season is proof enough of that.

This is one of those shows were you always think that it's gonna get better the next week.
This show will never deliver a climatic closure, it hypes itself too much and it's incredibly disappointing week after week.


Don't get me wrong, I can forgive a show for having pacing issues, but this particular show doesn't have interesting enough characters for me to bother spending 20 minutes for 5 minutes of actual fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
Can't you say the same thing for any hyped show? They were saying the exact same stuff for Naruto and Bleach some years ago. It is wishful thinking than the show actually delivering said wishes.
>> ARTICLE
Eren: I will transform into titan and restrain her!

Levi: Nah, you will never beat her in hand to hand combat. It will be far more successful if I let all my dear soldiers die just to lure her into a trap.

>> ARTICLE
.... I wanna get the joke too...
>> ARTICLE
where do you guys download this? I usually download the ggsubs version off their site, but its not there.
>> ARTICLE
It's been three episodes so far, and still no-one's even vaguely entertained the notion that the Female Titan looks virtually identical to Annie - coincidentally, the only member of the main cast who isn't present.

I was expecting some speculation to that effect from Armin (who saw her up close), at the very least...but all he came out with was "I'm sure there's a human in there, but unfortunately there's literally no girl I can think of with blonde hair, blue eyes and a roman nose who isn't accounted for". I mean, I realise they're all in a bit of a hurry, but come *on*.

EDIT: Yes, I get that it's easy to downvote the guy expressing a problem with something you liked, but I don't think I've said anything particularly incorrect or unreasonable. Literally my first reaction on seeing the Female Titan in the episode 17 preview was "That looks like Annie", and I'm pretty sure quite a few other people thought that too. Even if ultimately Annie's *not* the one inside the Titan, that's the natural first response for anyone observing. If nothing else, having one of the characters stop and make that observation (and it doesn't have to be much - even just having Armin say something like "Didn't you think it looked like Annie?" and then cutting away to leave the question hanging would do) would help keep the anime on the same page as the viewer. As it is, though, it seems like the characters are artificially being made to ignore the obvious just so they can be surprised and shocked by the inevitable reveal.
>> ARTICLE
Im pretty sure armin suspects it... but he cant really do shit about it now regardless. He and his companions dont know where erwin or levi are so its not like any of them can tell them.

And if you read most of the comments some of the other viewers are complete blockheads
when it comes to intuition.
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason she's not present... she didn't join the survey corps.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I'm well aware of that. What I'm saying is that the fact that Annie isn't with the Survey Corps means that there's a possibility the Female Titan could be her. The similarity in appearance is the biggest clue by a long shot, but obviously that would mean nothing if the two of them were onscreen at the same time. I'm simply saying her not being present means she doesn't have an alibi.

EDIT: To clarify, I mean that it's a really suspicious coincidence for us as the viewers, not for the characters. But if the characters were to have a think about who the Female Titan could possibly be, people such as Annie who aren't present should be more likely candidates to them than people who are.
>> ARTICLE
Right, right I see now. That's fair enough, I agree I noticed that distinctive Annie nose the first time I saw the female titan. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it's fine. Perfectly understandable. I did word it a bit ambiguously, and my somewhat snarky tone probably didn't help.

Truth is, it's probably the next "Mainstream" anime. That is, the anime that people will pick up because it looks cool or they hear it's great, or something they have to watch. 

This doesn't mean that it's actually good. But it's probably going to be culturally significant to some degree. 

See: Death Note, NGE, Cowboy Bebop, FMA

Note: I think that SnK is actually really good.

>> ARTICLE
Why would you do that to a computer?
>> ARTICLE
People talked a lot about SAO too. 

Not saying Attack on Titan is bad, but it's hard to convince someone with that logic.
>> ARTICLE
All that trash talking about SAO, it was a good anime. It was just hyped way too much.
>> ARTICLE
I think it tried to be something it wasn't. Granted, it did follow the novel (at least when it wasn't skipping around like mad). I also heard the second half was abysmal. 
>> ARTICLE
What second half?
>> ARTICLE
Le master ruseman.
>> ARTICLE
But Attack on Titan has actually been pretty good so far and has a respectable source material. SAO had neither of these and only a rabid fan base.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm..

I read both source materials (SAO up to the 11th novel, 12th ongoing. Attack on Titan up to 10th comic) and I think SAO is actually more thought out, less silly out of the blue plot twists and characters are more developped, even the ones that started as template moe cliches.

 The anime didn't do justice to everything in SAO, but I think Attack on Titan won't fseem better after we reach the middle of this season.
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I don't agree with you are the twists. 
And SAO and well developed characters are very far away from each other. 
>> ARTICLE
I think his opinion is heavily biased. I read half of SAO novels and Titan to the last chapter, you can't even compare them, even more so on those two points.

Plot Twist: There's a lot of foreshadowing work in SnK, and the reveals are made in a very matter-of-factly way. It's like the author already knows that you know. The anime has already given out enough clues for people to speculate.

Characters: Hahahahha...

Omg. I am seriously pumped up about the plot twists.
I haven't seen the manga because I don't want it to spoil my anime. But I know they are going to be awesome.

If you think Sword Art Online was received badly on any forum after its first five episodes, then you either weren't there when it happened or didn't pay attention to the noise.

SOA was the best!!
>> ARTICLE
No I don't think that at all to any extent, its obvious from all the discussion at the time it was popular. I was simply giving my opinion on the source matirial for both series in my comment which is less than positive for Kawaharas writing in comparision to the SnK manga.

But wouldn't you say the majority talking about SAO would of also said it was worth watching?

They are region-free, [according to cdjapan](http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=BCXA-751). Also, the first BD set will contain the first *four* episodes, plus an OVA ep. 14. This makes it about $32 per episode. (Or $1.31 per minute. Still a little costly.)

Too bland, to be honest they could have done better.

Yes, just yes

so eren is alive?

absolutely no way storywriters would kill main character off in 6th episode. 
actually, main characters rarely die before the end of any anime series.

>> ARTICLE
There are shows from over a decade ago that are still trememdously popular around this subreddit and when this subreddit is made up of a variety of anime viewers its basic common courtesey to spoiler something for people who have yet to see these shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen Evangelion yet people are free to spoil it for me. Why? Because it's been 15 years. It's my own fault for not having seen it yet and I don't think people should have to go out of their way to prevent spoiling it for me. Likewise, I don't think people are entitled to a spoiler free environment for titles over a certain age.
>> ARTICLE
>I've never (...). It's my own fault (...). I don't think (...).

Your opinion may not be what everyone wants for themselves, that's why people is asked to be considerate to others through a very simple rule.

Also, while it's very easy to tag spoilers. It's extremely hard to decide what should be considered a spoiler and what not. If it weren't for this simple rule, the subreddit could take a turn for the worse and end up like /a/, where spoiling series has become memetic.
>> ARTICLE
So? People is still watching Evangelion for the first time to this day and forever as long as more people is born, yet no one is randomly spoiling it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and some people haven't seen SW Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, yet we see no problem spoiling that. Why should it be different for anime?

As someone who hasn't read the manga and watches the gg sub, it's basically a given that he's still alive. He has the key for his father's basement, he's been injected by something (probably Titan stuff, so he regenerates limbs like they do) and gg's sub saying something like "I couldn't die today, even if I tried" (can't remember the exact quote). He will probably bust out of a Titan in the next 1 or 2 episodes, I'm guessing.
>> ARTICLE
[Assumption](/s "And if you assume that its Titan stuff is pretty obvious (imo) what will happen to his lost limb")
>> ARTICLE
When was Eren injected with something?
>> ARTICLE
There was a flashback in episode 2 or something.
>> ARTICLE
There was a short dream sequence in one of the episodes after the fall of his hometown I believe where he was [](/s "being held down by his father and injected with something in the woods.")

Fuck, I don't remember. 

That's one reason I hate waiting a week for an episode. I forget slight details.

but he didn't get his foot back when he saved armin

Probably takes a while to regenerate.

I haven't read the manga, but I presume that it takes longer than five seconds to regenerate a limb.

Why won't you anime folk accept that Eren is dead :(. Learn to let go, maaan.
>> ARTICLE
The injection could just be a poison that kills titan.  All they have to do now is sacrifice people to the titans to get rid of them.

The "I couldn't die today, even if I tried" was a trollsub meme reference.

You are correct.

Dat nose, lolwut.

Even in the anime it's got that bone that appears it would prevent its jaw from opening.  Then later the bone disappears and it opens its jaw.

Was I not paying close enough attention in school and is my jaw defective or is that bone just really weird and out of place?

i think in the show its supposed to be tendons? I'm not sure. It's not like the titan is all that anatomically correct anyway.

He seems to be a traveling doctor or at least a doctor that makes house calls. He might still be doing that so he isn't around much.

I think one guy said something about him having disappeared? And there were the flashbacks(?) in Ep3 with the injections and stuff, I feel like that's kind of important. Eren also had the key on him to the basement, I'm not sure what that's all about if he's been eaten. Do titans poop? Or is Eren alive?

For people who don't get the CPR scene, here it is in the Anime:

http://i.imgur.com/IQQNGHr.jpg

and here it is in the manga

http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/5/24

(no spoilers, just clarifies the scene)
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda surprised they toned down some of the scenes from the manga. For instance Eren slicing scum #1 throat.
>> ARTICLE
I just hope the BDs aren't as censored.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they've toned down things a bit occasionally since the beginning. Like the scene with the titan chomping down on Eren's mother. It's way more brutal, IMO, in the manga than the anime. But obviously it's not like they tone down everything. I wonder how they decide what to keep and what to change.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair a lot of it is probably censoring for broadcast.  The blu-rays will likely be more graphic.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, holy fuck I wish they had actually done it how it was in the manga, that would have been so brutal.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually surprised they didn't, seeing as how gruesome the previous episode was. Now I'm a bit disappointed...
>> ARTICLE
It's even worse with the previous page.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that how the anime did it gave it more impact. The absence of gore allows the mind to imagine it and sometimes our minds exaggerate. Reminds me of scenes from WWII movies of medics frantically giving CPR to a guy in a similar state.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I was a little confused watching the anime because I couldn't figure out why Armin wanted him to give up. I didn't even notice that his legs were off (forgot about that part of the manga). So there was nothing left to my imagination, I just kind of assumed that he fell and broke his neck or something.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really get it for a bit (not having read the manga), but once I realized it... I was like... OH O.O

The way it was done, where you come to realize what's happened, had a bigger effect on me than if they had shown it off the bat.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I thought people wouldn't get that he didn't have his lower body because it was... Weirdly done.


The manga version IMO was better executed.

"Oh FUCK. Yeah I am with Armin on this one."
>> ARTICLE
Tbh, I guess they overdid the hiding/censoring of that scene. If not for me being familiar with those kind of scenes I would be confused too.
>> ARTICLE
The scene didn't change, it was just more subtle.
>> ARTICLE
You kind of have to look for his legs to get it though. It sort of spoilt the impact of the scene in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
But it gives the scene more of a fade-out, before moving on.
>> ARTICLE
I know, I don't mind it but I just think it would have a much more in your face impact, Attack on Titan is a very in your face series, seeing as how we have limbs being bitten off and people being bitten in half.
>> ARTICLE
In the anime they never showed it as brutal as the manga though.  All the deaths are bother line brutal but you either see the titans swallow them whole, or the move the scene away from when they get snapped in halves.
>> ARTICLE
"As long as Eren is with me, I can do anything!
Umm, about that...
>> ARTICLE
This is one of the instances in storytelling where flashbacks work really well. The scene where Eren kills those thugs was brutal as all hell.

Edit - A (sincere) thank you to the mods, who are trying to keep spoiler trolls under control. Having assholes spoiling the show for kicks just ruins the experience for everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting the flashback within a flashback though. I thought when they skipped over the death of Mikasa's parents, that was it. But no, they went and showed us the brutality of that too. Almost as though we weren't meeting the quota.
>> ARTICLE
It happened in the manga as well, in the exact same order.  We didn't see the murder of her parents until after we saw she was kidnapped and on the floor and had her "flashback within a flashback"
>> ARTICLE
The scene where Mikasa watches her parents die is pretty brutal as well.
>> ARTICLE
This whole anime has been pretty brutal whenever death is involved. Eren's mom, mikasa's parents, the squad getting wiped.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.  I've read the start of the manga, and the anime seems to be doing a much better job of representing the brutality.  
>> ARTICLE
I have to wonder why the head merchant of the city's shopping district would be stupid enough to build a cart that's just a LITTLE too wide to fit through the gates. He can't have done much business if he can't get his cart out of the city.

Most likely not his main trading cart. Got his largest inner city cart thinking it would fit.

Is it weird that I don't really believe that Eren's dead? I keep thinking that he'll carve his way out of the Titan and find the others somehow, blood-soaked and missing half his limbs. He's too stubborn to die.
>> ARTICLE
Part of me wants him to wake up and have it to have been all just a dream. Just to realize that he fell asleep in the Titan's stomach.
Edit: spelling
>> ARTICLE
I have one rule with all shows, and that's if a character is shown or mentioned dying and it's questionable, doubt it until it's confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
I have a similar rule, that unless there's a body, the character isn't dead. In this case, Eren got eaten. If he's really dead, there shouldn't *be* a body. I feel like even if the characters on the show 'confirm' his death and grieve for him, I wouldn't accept it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, in this case it will be hard to tell, but I have a feeling that Eren will be back somehow. Just my two cents though.
>> ARTICLE
Throughout this ep I kept waiting for Armin, since he's supposedly the brains, to turn Eren into a crazy awesome steampunk cyborg or something.
>> ARTICLE
I was remembering in that episode how they talked about how titan's can regenerate even their head if it is cut off. I was like why would they talk about that. Then I remembered how they showed a random flashback in a previous episode of Eren getting injected something by his father. So my current guess is related to that basically.

>> ARTICLE
You're fine. They're "a notorious trollsub group" only if you consider them that. They inject references and go over the top, and their quality is really not *that* great, but it's not full-out trollsub. At least for Shingeki.
>> ARTICLE
Right.
>> ARTICLE
Stop watching gg please 
>> ARTICLE
Two months late to the party.

GG is awful in everything they do.
>> ARTICLE
For anyone who is confused, he did *not* say anything about not dying if he's killed. GG injected a reference. He literally said...

>


... Which means "I can't let myself die in this place".
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way, but at the same time I almost feel like I could be in denial as well, with characters dropping like flies. I think Eren being dead is a real possibility. Still, it's a shounen manga, and because of that I have a pretty strong feeling it's not quite over yet.
>> ARTICLE
Considering the fact that he 'died' on Episode 5 and he is the main protagonist of the anime, it would be safe to assume that he survived somehow
>> ARTICLE
Kamina from GL and Madoka would like to talk to you about that theory.
>> ARTICLE
Carving wouldn't really work when titans can just regenerate. Plus, dude's missing limbs...bleeding....drowning in acid.
>> ARTICLE
Titans internal body temperature is hot enough to boil water.
>> ARTICLE
But as previous episodes established, titans do not need nutrition (at least from eating), they do not digest their prey. There is no digestive acid or digestive system. 
>> ARTICLE
They feed on people without even chewing from the looks of it, but even so they die, or at leats never come back, when they are eaten, so the titan body gotta deal with it somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Suspense is killing me! A whole week of waiting!
>> ARTICLE
I think he has too many unanswered points to die so easily, like the injection his father gave him. If anyone can survive being eaten, it's him. We'll get an answer in the next episode or two, once they clear out the rest of the titans.
>> ARTICLE
It would be so troll by the writer to make eren seem like the main character when the real main character is mikasa. It'd be similar to [Madoka spoilers](/s "madoka where homura is the one the story is really revolving around")

But then again, if it was something that big, there's NO way that a spoiler wouldn't of gotten through from the previous thread.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno, Mikasa carrying the show doesnt seem smart to me.  She has no motivation without Eren.  Not saying she is a 1 dimensional character but this episode showed her motivation for staying alive as repaying Eren's debt/being with him for saving her from slavers.  She has no vendetta against the Titans and only entered the Corps because Eren went so she wouldnt be separated.  Now if she realizes that Eren is in fact dead from being eaten then we have a possible revenge or new reason to exist plot point but Mikasa is fine as a supporting character.
>> ARTICLE
Also the basement at the house the dad wanted him to see. He has to come back some how, otherwise there will be much wtf moments.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, someone needs to have the key on the necklace to open the basement. Otherwise, they would have to wait for the titan to make excrement and dig it out from there. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, his dad knows too much, we need Erin to see that.
>> ARTICLE
Mikasa will just go find all the dragon balls and everything will be fine.
>> ARTICLE
eren's going to pull a FMA and get automail / 3d gear arms and legs.  

just kidding
>> ARTICLE
I'd watch that.
>> ARTICLE
Eren wouldn't die... even if a Titan killed him.
>> ARTICLE
So you're saying.. in this anime... people DONT die if they are killed? o.O
>> ARTICLE
He did say that he won't die even if he gets killed. He basically spoiled the ending himself..
>> ARTICLE
I think unlike some anime, people do generally die when they are killed in this one. Which is what makes the cliffhanger so great.

Was I the only one who thought one of the kidnappers was Hannes? lol

http://i.imgur.com/o168M5Y.jpg

I thought to myself "HOLY SHIT!" cause I really thought he was.
>> ARTICLE
It looks like they have been reusing the art of characters like that. Thats not the first time time they had a character that is disposable or not all that important look almost exactly like Hannes. They probably put so much of of their budget into the cool action they didn't have enough money left over to make many generic characters and the art style is really unique so they can't reuse generic characters from other anime.

[Crazy fan theory](/s "Or maybe we find out Hannes is really a clone. The government has been experimenting with cloning so they could have an endless army to throw at the Titans. I haven't read the manga so I have no reason to think this other than its a crazy fan theory that popped into my head.")
>> ARTICLE
Seeing as they don't have electricity, guns, or cars; I find that to be beyond crazy fan theory, and more in the realm of pulling ideas out of one's ass.
>> ARTICLE
Yep thats basically where it came from. I don't think its very likely (but not impossible). Like I said first it probably is that they didn't have enough money to make enough generic characters. I just thought it was kind of a funny idea so I shared it.

Seriously, he just like squashed a dude underfoot. Though the tunnel vision animation was not too good at giving a consistent sense of distance.

I was literally begging for someone to beat some sense into the rich man. But the titan would've been too indiscriminate.

I thought he was ***FABULOOOUUS~***

Watching them run in the anime gives you a feel for how terrifying their speed is. In my mind I always thought they'd be running slowish.
>> ARTICLE
Most of them are slow, but that one was abnormal.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It looks hilarious on screen, but if I was any of those civilans, I definitely would have screamed bloody murder.
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought the way it was running was hilarious, and then when they showed its head wobbling, I found myself slowly cringing away from the screen.
>> ARTICLE
And Mikasa continues to display her badass-ness in the show.

For this episode, I didn't mind the still shots as much 'cause it was used effectively and in places where it was appropriate. Hopefully, the animation team doesn't lose their quality control like episode 4.

By the way, those floor-splintering steps Mikasa took...

Edit: I meant episode 4, not 3. Curse you, terrible memory.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. That was among the most epic 'awakenings' I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean episode 3?! The animations have been consistent so far. They don't nee to do all scenes in ones unless there's a fight or any other action scene going on.
>> ARTICLE
Whoops, I meant episode 4. 

The quality went down drastically, and if you see the comparisons between episode 3 and 4, you'll see the difference in line quality, eyes being askew, and lack of basic detail. For further inspection, watch the segment where Eren and his friends watch the Recon Corps.
>> ARTICLE
That's still nothing compared to many other shounen shows out there. Hell, even Shinsekai Yori had a much bigger quality drop in its 5th episode (cringe worthy, let's be honest), and it was still one of the best anime I've seen in years. The plot will make up for it all.
>> ARTICLE
The point he was trying to make though was that it was simply that the quality of the animation had dropped, that point is completely irrelevant to the story of the show. And in comparison to Shinsekai Yori this show is animated by Production I.G which is pretty damn well known for their quality, so to see the drop in quality in one of the most popular shows of the season was pretty disappointing. Shinsekai Yori on the other hand was a risky niche show done by A-1 so it wasn't really too surprising. A show shouldn't be free from criticism simply because it has a great story, either way though they seem to of got their shit together the last couple of eps and I'm looking forward to the next one.

It wasn't a quality drop in SSY episode 5, just another director for the episode, with another artistic direction.

I actualy liked the visual style of SSY e05.

Psycho Pass, however, had the biggest quality drop I've ever witnessed on episode 18 iirc.

Theyve pretty much publically apologized for the bad quality havent they?

They did, and as I've said in my previous comments, hopefully the animation team manages to maintain quality control.

and the handle of the blade, someone is eating her Wheaties.

edit:i had to go back and see which was episode 3, for anyone else when they introduce "potato girl", it was a slow episode so prob not a lot of action stuff to work with. i did skip to the ending of 3 and enjoyed he was defiantly proclaiming he no longer needed mikasa's protection, this followed directly after watching this episode where eren as a child stabs to death 2 adults to save her and wow how much has changed up to the titan's attack.

I've been tempted to read the manga to find out what happens but at the same time I don't want to ruin the story. I don't know what to do!
>> ARTICLE
I was in your boat so I've read only so far as to figure out what happened. I have regrets and at the same time I'm happy I did it.

Mostly I just wanted to say that I don't read manga because I like physical copies and it's far harder to obtain them on my limited funds, but this is the one time an anime has sent me running to the manga. It's awesome is all I'll say.

Good Episode, it's great to have these mini-stories in-putted for character development and backstories are a solid way to begin that.

This makes me even more excited for Mikasa's reaction to Eren's **MISHAP**, especially because of the last quote she says ("Eren, as long as you're with me, I can do anything!"). She is one of the strongest characters but will be hit hard by the news and I'm sure they'll do well to portray her resolve as this will strengthen her motive to fight against the titans.

I sense a Deus ex machina coming, unless I missed some kind of subliminal message or minor detail.

I can't think of anything that won't count as deus ex machina. Including whatever the key-father-cabin-hallucination-forced-injection-or-whatever scene was back from episode 1 (or 2).

Man this show just keeps getting better. Amazing character development in this episode, the extension and heightening of the cliffhanger from last week, incredible use of tension.

All the knives around Mikasa in the ED animation really stand out to me now we've seen their significance. That part was well played, as I barely even noticed it as a theme until now.

I don't think I've been this excited following a show as it aired since Code Geass (disclaimer: I wasn't really watching anime during the airing of Steins;Gate).

Really enjoyed this weeks episode because it exposes what kind of world they come from. They try to reinforce the idea that only the fit survive and even kids have to realize this from a young age. That scene where Eren went apeshit displays his sense of justice and what right in this world, although I dont get why Mikasa had the incessant need to protect Eren when she was the one who got saved in the first place. Overall there wasnt much action but it gave lots of characterization, backstory, and setting descriptions.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Eren's righteousness gets him into shit all the time (i.e. getting choked to death by the third goon), from which Mikasa had to save him from and from then on feels like she has to protect him from.  

TLDR; Eren gets into shit wayyy over his head nonstop, Mikasa recognizes the need to save his butt when this happens since it's a cruel world
>> ARTICLE
So that's why Mikasa is always wearing that scarf...
>> ARTICLE
This was a very poignant episode. Not only do we get to see why Mikasa is so devoted to Eren, and how she wasn't always a cool, calm, collected individual, but we also get to see that Eren truly is an abnormality.

It takes a lot to recognize the concepts of justice, morality, or "what is correct and right" at a young age (then again, that is only in the context of our world. Perhaps in SnK's world, such a thing would be more normal). But even then, it takes a shit ton more to be able to act upon those concepts and WAY more to kill someone because of them. We've already seen Eren's unwavering zealousness towards wiping out the Titans, which is abnormal even with the fact that a Titan killed his mother. It turns out, he's truly abnormal in more ways than one.
>> ARTICLE
>which is abnormal even with the fact that a Titan killed his mother

Really?!LOL I know it's a situation none of us would ever experience (since there are no titans :P), but I've seen people want to kill others for less.

And Mikasa is still far from being a calm, collected individual, at least when it comes to Eren... but that's what Armin is there for.
>> ARTICLE
After this flashback, I considered Eren to be more fucked up than Mikasa or any other character as well. It really makes you wonder just what kind of upbringing that boy had.
>> ARTICLE
Right. His dad just didn't seem quite upset enough that his son killed two people. Granted he did it for a good enough reason and his dad saw that, I still got a "You killed two guys! Grounded for a month!" kind of vibe.
>> ARTICLE
I think he was more the worried parent sort of route. I mean, what do you REALLY say to a kid after that? 

You can't say "You shouldn't have done that"

You also can't really say "Good Job Kiddo"

Its a really weird grey area.
>> ARTICLE
You would really think that his mother's death is the cause for his determination and recklessness but no, this kid was killing two adult grown men without batting an eyelid before shit started going down.
>> ARTICLE
he just really wanted to save her!  actually kinda creepy after considering [this news story](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/12/18201371-boy-12-arrested-in-killing-of-8-year-old-sister-that-he-blamed-on-intruder?lite)
>> ARTICLE
EREN WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT IS NOT HOW YOU PROTAGONIST.

Well, now that Eren has failed in understanding even the most basic requirements of Main Characterdom (don't get eaten by fucking titans), it looks like Mikasa's gonna have to save everybody. You might even say she has to do it... [singlehandedly](http://i.imgur.com/QCGhwAT.jpg ). EHHH? [Armin?](http://i.imgur.com/zMClvsa.jpg ) [Anybody?!?](http://i.imgur.com/kpQQvq5.jpg ) Goddamnit, that was... well, [thank you](http://i.imgur.com/zAI3Rzq.jpg ), Potato. At least one person has a sense of humor around here.

Anyway. Here's hoping for some Mikasa in berserker mode. Let's roll.

**Episode 6**

3:17  I really like the tone of this scene. Each of them dealing with the stress of their first battle in a different way, trying to maintain their usual personalities even though the world is going to hell around them, with shell-shocked Armin sitting there as an example of what will soon hit all of them. Chilling stuff!

5:48  Another effective scene. No soundtrack cues, no melodramatic camera angles  in fact, the camera does its best to obscure the situation. Hannah's hopeless attempts to ignore a situation too terrible for her to comprehend, a tidy little parallel for Armin's lesson of the day

9:02  Mikasa: kills titans, saves townsfolk, good with kids

Also, I wonder what other abnormals we'll be dealing with  so far they've had this derp-run one, the leaping one, and the armored one (along with the megatitan), but I'm sure this writer has more evil tricks up his sleeve

10:02 - Ackerman, what the *fuck* made you *such a badass?* ...never mind.

11:07  Oh god, lighthearted family time flashback. The darkest omen

12:10  Subtlety, again! The violence of the situation shown through half-glimped splatters across the door and window, letting the viewer's imagination do the rest. Damn, Titan!

12:20  Even as a kid, Eren apparently already had those crazy-ass gotta kill em all eyes

16:00  DEAR GOD EREN. YOU CRAZY

16:28  [Our Hero](http://i.imgur.com/CINd8Ya.jpg )

19:07  Okay, dunno if we needed the electric realization powerup pan

20:15 - I needed to act - look how late the guards arrived. I'm criticizing you for not considering your own safety. It's nice how both Eren's strength and Eren's downfall are encapsulated in this little exchange here

21:44  Very nice tidy flashback. Basically her whole personality, as well as her connection with Eren, are completely and believably established

**And Done**

Well *that's* an awkward closing line.

I liked that episode a lot! I think the tragic and dramatic stuff was handled *really* well here, with a lot of tact for an action show, which lent it more solemn emotional weight. I liked the stuff early on, with the recruits basically acting tough or happy or mad to keep the panic away. I liked Mikasa being a huge badass, and I liked the very efficient flashback.

I *also* like that next episode promises to be totally crazy, what with Eren's death now pretty much guaranteed to be revealed to Mikasa, and Mikasa assisting our beloved squads in their retreat. Exciting times in our favorite blood-soaked hellscape!

What I like about Mikasa is that she is not like your typical sidekick that is always perfect in everything and always has this cold stare on her face, and stands besides the hard working MC. She has promise as a scout, she was even the best as a trainee, but she still has a lot to learn. Armin can see things on a wider perspective, while she still acts out of her feelings at that moment, making for reckless decisions.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. One of the things I like about this series is the frank approach it seems to be taking towards the strengths and weaknesses of its characters - Mikasa is incredibly good at killing titans, but lousy at interacting with people or thinking about a larger strategy. Eren (before becoming titan food) handled the former with his inspiring Kamina speeches, and Armin is clearly best suited to handling the latter. I really, really hope this show uses that strategic assessment stuff it started episode 4 with to important effect down the road.

The scene with Hannah giving him CPR was really upsetting. They may have been minor characters but we were given little shots of their growing romance throughout, then we watch her desperately trying to save her love who is clearly... clearly not coming back. Heavy stuff...

Mikasa is honestly character of the year.  Just from what I've seen, I've decided that there is no character that can compare to her.  She's a really nice break from all the slutty main characters you usually find in anime.

poor Mikasa, Eren only has boners for murder.

The music was AMAZING this episode. It was probably amazing in the other episodes, but for some reason I really noticed it this time. This anime is coming out really well, I love it. 

I have also read the manga, and I really wish I didn't right now, because I love the suspense you feel when you have no clue what is going to happen or how. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably the only anime out there that makes me love flashbacks.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga but I am almost certain Erin is actually alive from some "anime" type nonsense. He's gotta have special powers or something. They don't make you the MC of the show, and of the intro, and give you back-story with Mikasa without you being alive. 

The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how..I'm guessing it relates to whatever his dad injected him with/what was in the basement with that key during the flash back a couple episodes ago. 

Either way great episode, Mikasa is a boss. 
>> ARTICLE
Same reasoning that I have for thinking that Eren is alive. That injection has to have some kind of significance.
>> ARTICLE
That's my reasoning. It's entirely possible for a writer to kill off a character, even a protagonist. However, it's nearly impossible for a writer to write off a plotline or plot element (in good conscience, at least).

the main story didn't advance much, but seeing what eren is capable of and how mikasa is how she is. plus her getting the scarf, it's all character development but the kidnapping had a good bit of action. 

side note, besides what i said, seeing how she handled the trade boss was awesome.

It also showed how prevalent muskets are (somewhat, such as policing and hunting), when humans are involved. Sometimes I forget they're in the middle ages, what with the spider-manning and the clothing.

I really love the bond between Eren and Mikasa. I just hope that they develop a romantic relationship rather than a sibling relationship.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. Their current relationship is far more unique and special than mere love. I'd be happy if they kept what they have, while traditional romance is reserved for side-characters....where the tension would be a hundred times greater due to this manga's character mortality. Because we know damn well that neither Eren nor Mikasa will ever really die, romance for either of them would be less suspenseful.

/here's hoping for Eren...
>> ARTICLE
Wich they aren't so it could happen... This show is more serious about what happens but i kinda think they will try to put something like this in too.

The other thing is... she said he counts as family... well i dont know what happens... as long as the episodes are amazing as the last 6 i'm happy

Anyone else laughed their asses off at the giant that ran like a fool towards the citizens and merchants trying to get to shelters?

This episode is dark and all, but I just can't help but think about it constantly.

The best parts of this episode for me, is where Mikasa achieves self-realization (gets her strength as I call it) and the scene where Eren wraps his scarf around Mikasa (holy shit that was cute, and the way her eyes were peeking out staring at him in disbelief) and the moment she is accepted into the family.

The whole "the strong survive, and the weak die" mantra underlying this episode reminded me of Seta Soujiro from Rurouni Kenshin. Just glad Mikasa didn't go crazy repressed memories like Soujiro did... though that may have been equally cool.

I'm gonna be REALLY ANNOYED if they Deus ex machina Eren after all this.



 **REALLY ANNOYED**


 but yeah, I liked this episode. 
 
 Saw Mikasa be a badass, then saw how she became that way. I quite enjoyed it.

 also, that titans run is the funniest thing I've seen this week. It was even funnier because you heard 3 thumps like it was walking slow, and then out comes this running titan. 
>> ARTICLE
Dr. Jaeger smells fishy...The injection, hopefully that might save Eren, but also after that Flashback/vision he had the Key to Dr. Jaeger's cabin around his neck, did he see his father? or have he not since he first left before the first attack, also why didn't Mikasa notice the key, aparantly the key was hyped up in their house, so must have ben a big deal

I still don't want to accept the fact that Eren was killed. I think he'll just come out of the titan still alive.

Well that made me tear up. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty dark storyline for this episode, but still manages to fit in a couple of humorous parts.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, like the part where Armin loses his squad and comes face to face with a woman giving CPR to a dead man. Or the part where a man is failing to fit his cart full of his wealth through the gate while everyone else is content to wait around for a titan to show up. Or the part where Mikasa's parents are murdered in front of her, Eren pretends to be a lost child and murders someone and goes beserk, then Mikasa turns into a killing machine. Or the part where Mikasa says that she can do anything as long as Eren is with her, while on her way to find out Eren is dead.

Pretty dark sense of humour.

Either that, or I missed all the humour in this episode.

I really liked the flashback aspect of this  episodes especially the brutal aspects. But i have to say i feel sorry for Misaka. It's like the author wanted her to have the most tragic backstory by having most of her parents killed off violently   
>> ARTICLE
That feeling when you decided to read the manga because the wait was terrible and now you know everything.

Feels bad.
>> ARTICLE
This show is starting to cause me some alarm. In the fact that every new episode out does the other that Im afraid its going to peak early.  However the general emotional setting of it is amazing, it being boiled down to "ok here is some heroic or light hearted material, now Im going to Frakensteiner your happy times into a pit of broken glass and throw one instance of crapsack at you after another."  This was most prevalent learning Mikasa's backstory "Whats that?  You want some nice way to introduce how her and Eren met?  Fuck that shit, lets get child slavery and parental murder in on the game, also lets make the 'protaganist' fucking ruthless from the outgoing."  Have I mentioned I like this show a lot?
>> ARTICLE
In another reddit thread someone quoted Pratchett's "Hogfather" and the speech about grinding the universe into a fine powder and not even finding one atom of justice or mercy--Pretty much sums up Mikasa's worldview right now. However, I think there is plenty of time left for finding some vengeance and wrath.
>> ARTICLE
I had yet to decide about this anime.  It's been the sole new series that I've chosen to watch this season, but until now I wasn't sure what I thought about it.  The concept is dangerously unique, with the titans, the walled existence of humanity, and the peculiar combative style.

This episode sold it to me for sure. *BEST EPISODE SO FAR!*

If they can keep building like this, it may very well turn out to be the best thing I've watched in a while.
>> ARTICLE
This is an observation. I have not read the manga but this is what I think the titans are. [Spoiler] (/s "The titans are giant war machines. The whole foreshadowing of not dying and regeneration. They only attack humans, not animals. They are literally a war machine from another country going against this country trying to scare them into extinction.")
>> ARTICLE
Highly unlikely. The titans seem more like mere savages, than war machines - much like a personification of the most basic, primal, instinct-based, ravaging human imo. Also the survival / existence of another country would just be contradicting one of the first statements by the show: "Last surviving humans grouped up and made walls and shit."

The fact that the only die by the neck makes me believe the pilot sits there.

Speechless is my reaction to this episode

Two kids forced to commit terrible acts due to the fucked up world they live in where only the strong survive. Honestly I'm deeply disturbed by Erin's initial reaction to the we'll refer to them as "bandits," but I'm getting ahead of myself.

I did not enjoy the first part of the show, I already saw Armin distraught from Erin's death and watching him still being useless and shellshocked just seemed like time wasted, this is just my opinion and nothing to take THAT seriously, I just dislike whinny people sry.

Mikasa steals the show, I think her kills have been the only Eotena deaths we've seen thus far in the anime, and then FLASHBACK

I have to admit, young Mikasa with long hair is just so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeee. I wished we could've seen her with her parents more, but the usual scene of "where do babies come from?" was quite cute and fun to watch. Too bad bandits come by and ruin the flipping crap. God, apart from that it seems Asians are a rare breed in this world (yes I know they referred to them as orientals but i'm not a fan of that term) so Mikasa is special, but her parents had to die.

Shit getting real time. Erin KILLS 2 people in cold blood. I don't know how I felt about my hero committing murder. I know they were both scum, but there are just lines that have a hard time being crossed. I know its a different world, but a hero actually committing said act is something that deserves deep discussion, especially when hes just a kid with what I"m guessing no previous experience doing that. It feels like Erins a total sociopath =/

Moving from that whats even worse is this messed up idea of power caused Mikasa to lose any of her happy youthfulness to become the emotion-less (yet still awesome) character we know when she too commits said killings. I'm torn by these events and it was really something to watch since this show knows we all love da gore. 

My favorite scene was the end (I found it weird there was no punishment or form of counseling for the kids) but Erin giving Mikasa his scarf (very weirdly wrapping it around her face lol), and saying their home is hers still put a smile on my face after witnessing the events thus far.

I feel really bad for what happened to Mikasa, but a true hero in action anime at least usually needs to suffer from some major event of their past and this one was pretty strong. Keep it strong titan anime, you are still top dog!

> I don't know how I felt about my hero committing murder.

Yea, I can't totally label Eren as a psychopath or a murderer.  You're forgetting that he stumbles into the aftermath of what happened to her parents.  The slave traders/bandits have already killed two people and kidnapped Mikasa.  Eren decides to act quickly, but he isn't in the wrong for pre-emptively killing two of them.

Mikasa's kill can't be considered murder either.  Eren's close to death at that point and we don't know what he would've done to Mikasa afterwards.  At that point it's self-defense.

I mean that what happened there was completely weird, detached from one would think as "normal". That's why it is hard to talk about morals in a situation where 2 kids killed 3 murderers.

I'm not sure I can even partially label him as such. He's had a lot of fucked up shit happen to him and he lives in a fucked up world, but he's clearly capable of empathy.
>> ARTICLE
>I just dislike whiny people

It needed to be shown, so I don't see anything wrong with that. You can't have everybody be superheroes in a show that aims to follow reality.

>it seems Asians are a rare breed in this world (yes I know they referred to them as orientals but i'm not a fan of that term)

There's quite a bit of difference between both terms, I wouldn't be so quick in exchanging them so easily.

>Erin KILLS 2 people in cold blood.

He was pretty much seeing red, note how shocked he was when they discovered the parents.

>I don't know how I felt about my hero committing murder.

Murder is *unlawful* killing. There's nothing unlawful about killing two murderers (because he can't take them out 'peacefully', all he can hope for is surprise attacks). Any law they have in that world would deem them deserving of death anyway (even his father didn't argue that); so far out in the wilderness, in this situation, there is no law anyway, only the 'law' of "the stronger one wins".

(And 'hero'? Good grief...)

>It feels like Erins a total psychopath =/

A psychopath doesn't feel much about killing (or helping) others; I'd say Eren is on the very opposite end of the spectrum here. In a more peaceful world he might've even had nightmares about it.

>when she too commits said murder

*Self-defense.*

>(I found it weird there was no punishment or form of counseling for the kids)

Punishment? Counseling?? This isn't some twisted idealistic world far removed from reality.
>> ARTICLE
Hiya, I would like to apologize to you if my post made you annoyed in someway. I would like the chance to explain my side without causing any conflict.

First for the whiny people thing, I just wanted to mention that in my post I said that it was just my opinion on the matter and it shouldn't be taken seriously at all, I was posting my reaction to the episode and I felt like in my opinion they covered Armin's reaction to feeling useless well enough in the last episode. I also thought the scene where Armin met the girl and her dead lover was lacking. I learned from another person that this was due to censor issues where in the manga, the dead guy actually had his legs torn off which would've provided a much more dramatic scene I would've been fine watching.

Asians and orientals, for this I'm sure there are differences, but I prefer not to use the term "oriental" when I can for the sake of one of its uses being as a racist term. I more just wanted to focus on that part that we learn Mikasa has Asian heritage which seems to be rare in the Titan anime society.

Next is Erin killing. I will admit that I made the original post quickly so for some things I just typed what came to mind. The point I wanted to get across though is even though he may have been mad and whatnot, he still killed two people for the sake of them having killed Mikasa's parents, not only that but he prepared himself with a plan to first surprise the first man and have a spear weapon made to kill the second. It was a premeditated act.

Is it bad to call Erin the main character the hero, I'm sorry if thats childish to you, but I usually refer to the main characters in stories as heroes.

And yes what Erin did was unlawful killing of two people. We can of course suspect that if captured the bandits would probably be executed, but there is still an organization (the military) that acts as the law. Unlawful basically means contrary to the accepted morality. Killing another human will always be against the accepted morality in any form of society. It is important that a higher power such as a government handle these situations because if anyone did what Erin did in any society, it would only cause problems. There may not be any law out where the events happened (which is why they got away with killing the people), but Erin still committed murder.

I did talk to another guy about the psychopath thing which I admit is the wrong term, but as I mentioned before I was rushing through this post and psychopath was first thing that came to mind. We agreed to use the term sociopath and honestly I cannot agree with you in terms of Erin being the opposite of the spectrum because we'll be honest, when we kill animals for the sake of food or hunting we do not feel empathy for them. I would compare that with Erin's view that the bandits were "animals" and say he really felt no problem with killing those two. The other thing I wanted to mention is the world Erin is living in is still peaceful when he was that young. Sure he can't go outside, but he doesn't experience or understand the true danger the Eotenas until they break the walls during the first episode.

Last 2 things, the Mikasa one I will admit was my mistake that she did kill in self-defense which doesn't make it "murder," but my main point about that post was her actions desensitized her and left her with the cold facade she posses now.

And the last thing. I don't really understand your argument about twisted and idealistic world. What Erin and Mikasa experienced will have repercussions, it may not be punishable due to them being kids and killing two murderers, but you can't argue that after experiencing what they did as kids they would need someone to talk about it and better understand what happened. I think you are overestimating the level of crazy the world they're living in since it was still during the 100 years of peace, and even if it was, it should be obvious they still have Erin's father who should've said something for the kids to better understand the situation and act as the counselor. 

Anyways, I hope you find my side to be understandable, I will apologize again if what I said in my original post annoyed you in any way since that was not my intention. I just wanted to express my thoughts about the episode. I truly wish you a good day and would love to hear your further thoughts about this if you have any to share.

OK, I just thought of the most awful theory that I really hope isn't true but I have to post it just in case it turns out to be. Documentation and all that shit.

[Seriously, this is a terrible crackpot theory and I will be really angry if it's true](/s "Titans have no visible reproductive organs because they reproduce by consuming humans. Humans who are eaten by titans (possibly some small subset thereof whose bodies are sufficiently unmangled by the process) become new titans. They lose their memories and knowledge from when they are humans, but retain any special skills or abilities they had in an enhanced form (possibly accounts for unique colossal/armored/jumping/etc. titans). Eren is swallowed more or less whole and intact (missing limbs, but titans are able to regenerate such), and becomes a new titan. However, the injections his father gave him contained anti-titan viruses/bacteria/enzymes/stuff that fights against the transformation enough that he is able to retain his memories and self. His exceptional skill in hand-to-hand combat makes him the most dangerous titan of all, and he fights with the humans against the other titans. Eren becomes Shingeki no Kyojin, The Charging Titan.")

My complaints for this episode probably stem to the source more than the adaptation itself. Can't quite say that I loved the direction with the past -- it was successful in establishing Mikasa's fervor to Eren, and her typical personality; but the actions taken were still a little extreme. 

Shingeki no Kyojin adheres to physics [most of the time]; kids managing to overpower three adults [who were geared with the intent to kill] was a little too serendipitous for me [as the Father said, they were ridiculously lucky]. I don't like that they had to integrate a semblance of sexual abuse [as in the threat of] to further accentuate the point [it's dark enough from the setting and events already, it doesn't need to be further bolded]. It's typical to the genre/setting [e.g. Berserk], but it's not very enjoyable [o hay, subjectivity]; its recurrent nature becomes less developing, and more monotonously irritating [it's the easy, go-to card for catalyzing sympathy + a dark mood]. 

I don't like that Eren already had the phlegmatic mindset of being able to kill from the get-go [was this not supposed to be established *after* he saw his mother being killed?] Mikasa's follow-up was logical [to a greater degree], but the derivative action was still dumb. Eren managed to locate the abductors, as well as craft a plan to take them all down [while being adroit with his weapon of choice]. 

Just personal nitpicking I suppose. The adaptation probably did an excellent job of remaining faithful, and extending its intentions. 
>> ARTICLE
People, just a reminder that downvotes aren't for disagreeing. They're for posts that are trash or add nothing to the discussion.

This is a well reasoned critique with justifications that sparks good discussion.

One should be happy that someone respects a show enough to not just say "It's pretty good for a shounen", and instead demands more from it.
>> ARTICLE
This complaint as a generality definitely stems from the source rather than the adaptation. The actual story elements - although rearranged slightly chronologically - are all 100% in line with the manga source. If anything a lot of minor details were noticeably softened in this episode, particularly in the visuals. The most glaring one was the girl giving CPR to the dead guy. They didn't quite show it, I'm not sure whether the viewing angles they did give made it clear, but in the manga he was quite clearly and graphically missing everything from the bellybutton down. Not really a spoiler, just a graphic detail omission.

Child main character turning into killers by putting down murderers was quite fresh to me. Mostly thanks to the the horrible way that they depicted the whole event. 

Very few are celebrating what happened.
>> ARTICLE
Them turning into murderers isn't necessarily a bad development if it's done with a reason. Eren wasn't given development prior to that, we're under the assumption that he had the adeptness to handle a weapon and the mentality to use it [in similar series where this occurs, the subject of action typically underwent some sort of traumatic past prior to a point of unleashing] from the get-go. 

It didn't seem that fresh though, it seemed extreme and predictable. Mikasa's ardent passion for Eren would probably have to stem from some significant event; the most basic would be an event in which she is saved from an awful calamity [as shown]. I didn't like the predictability of it. 
>> ARTICLE
How do you think she'll take the news of his death then?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I realize that the flashback was integral in objectively setting up his past [had to justify Mikasa's fervor for Eren somehow]. My complaint was that the past was shown in such extremes; it wasn't done very gracefully [strange phrasing; I didn't like how it was so extreme in screaming "this is why she's like this"; it seemed a little trite]. 

We don't have titans in the real world, so it's difficult to ascertain how they manage to move. What we do have are children, and grown men -- for the most part, Shingeki no Kyojin is relatively logical when it comes to its physics [with some exceptions, like the enigmas of the titans]. Inept children managing to handle presumably adept men [who just recently killed instinctively] for the sole reason of setting up a relative point of comparison doesn't seem practical [possible, but as the father noted, entirely reliant on serendipity, which isn't quite the most coveted element in storytelling].

It seemed that the insinuated sex trafficking was to accentuate just how much Eren saved Mikasa [from a life that would've been wholly worse]. If not, there could have been a multitude of alternate routes; they could have been thieves, rather than kidnappers -- the kidnappers could have had a penchant to torture their victims [would have accentuated the 'awful world' that much more], there could have been a bunch of other alternate, developments [that would have been more efficient and optimal].  
>> ARTICLE

Like I said, it's not impossible, simply impractical. It's a personal preference, and general rule to not make ridiculous events occur for the sole reason of establishing x or y. It's similar to winning the lottery; it's possible, but not very likely.

It's inane to state that because it's an anime, that practicality shouldn't apply to it. You assume a work's mechanics are law, but you judge it via human conventions. I'm not complaining that autonomous, self-sustaining titans are present within the work, I'm complaining that extreme, asinine developments are being established for the sole reason of advancing the plot.

Shingeki no Kyojin is certainly much more 'deeper and thoughtful' than most works. If it takes itself seriously, then it's subject to critique on how well it attempts to carry itself. Extremes aren't entertaining when it comes to storytelling, it's the cheapest, simplest method of objective development. When you accentuate an aspect to the point of it being dominantly in your face, it becomes less graceful, and more brute. A brute adaptation is a bad one. But this adaptation wasn't brute; the events were.

**No spoilers in this post at all. I hate them as well.**

I think that it is kinda official that the anime is much better than the manga. The manga was nowhere near as polished as this.

I found that reading the manga at first was like reading one of 'those' manga where you are thinking to yourself. What is going on!? Who is doing what, what action was just performed, and who and what is really just happening!?

That happened everywhere from 'before' sequences, current time and the battle sequences. I got used to it on chapter 3, but it still wasn't really fluid or polished.

But this anime, oh gosh is it good. You can easily see the characters developing and their relationships with each other. The manga was very 2D and shallow with its presentation to me personally. 

This series was made for an anime.

The kidnapping scene in this episode. I don't/barely remember it in the manga. Hell, I don't even really even remember if I even remember this scene which kinda shows how forgettable many things in the anime were. 

Biggest surprise in Kyojin from the manga? ...DEM lips on Misaka in ep 1's ending. DAYUMMMM is what all us manga readers thought.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mieXVkSGb4

1:04-1:26

sound totally changes, it looks like he's picking everything but you can hear that there's no pick sound, and it doesn't even sound like a guitar. it's significantly louder and smoother than the tone he has just before the section starts. at 1:26 it suddenly sounds like a guitar again and you can hear the pick attack in every note. he plays normally until

2:35-2:41

which confuses me because it's not even fast, it's like quarter notes but it's a synth again

3:32-3:34

is a synth again, except for that last note he lands on sounds legit

pretty much all the other shreddy stuff sounds/looks legit, but if he's willing to fake parts of his playing like that i'm kinda doubtful about other stuff he does

the only time i've ever heard a guitar player do something similar to his tone on the parts i think are bullshit is when holdsworth plays a synthaxe; since it sends a midi signal to a synth it won't pick up on string noise or pick attack or anything, but this guy is very obviously not playing a synthaxe. the other times i hear something similar is a keyboard player like jens johannson 

oh and that one time that shawn lane cut and pasted a bunch of notes to make the song conlon nancarrow on tri-tone fascination, that actually sounds the most like what he did
>> ARTICLE
I think he has it all prerecorded and just plays along for the youtube people to see. He doesn't play one track from beginning to the end but switches between them to have a good flow throughout the whole song. 

The other possibility is that he has a pedal board on the ground and we just can't see it and he is connected to the computer. When the sound changes then he can be just hitting the pedal board and there comes a different sound.   

Though, I am sticking with my first thought because the drums are made in studio, there are multiple guitar tracks and why would he only record one track on video?
>> ARTICLE
I've seen pictures of all the pedals and software he uses. Pretty expensive.
>> ARTICLE
There's no pick sound because he's not using a mic to pick up the sound. He's plugged into a computer. At least that's the most likely scenario. Even if he's using an amp and mic he would have to have the amp turned down pretty low for you to hear pick sounds. Also we have no idea what kind of equipment he's using. There are LOADS of ways he can be altering the sound, both as he plays and afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
you hear the pick **attack** in literally every other part of the song, that's why alternate picking sounds different from legato, unless you're suggesting picking and legato sound the same unless you mic it up

yes, there are many ways he could be altering the sounds after he plays. the most likely method is that he muted his guitar and stuck a sequenced synth part on top of it

Did they do something to their faces?
>> ARTICLE
Contouring was my first thought when I saw this set - and there's some serious contouring going on in those photos.  For those who don't know, contouring of the face can be done with makeup to change the appearance of the bone structure underneath or to bring out certain areas.  For instance, a too-wide nose can be slimmed by putting darker makeup along the length and sides of the nose.  Some lighter powder or colour can be applied to the top of the nose to make the appearance more accentuated.  Light and shimmery colours are used to imitate light, while darker colours are used to simulate shadow.  Done correctly, contouring can be relatively subtle even in the presence of a lot of cosmetics.

One of the most common examples you might see of contouring is blush /bronzing powder or color swept along the side of the cheeks rather than on the apples (right on top).  This can make the face look more gaunt and /or accentuate cheekbones.  You can really change how a face looks with well done contouring.  With enough blending and proper use and understanding of colour, you can achieve some very extreme effects that are relatively subtle.  That is to say, you might notice that there's makeup, but not exactly how much makeup the person is wearing.

In the first three photos, you can clearly see this type of technique applied to each of their noses.  In the first photo, there is a dark swipe on top of the nose, used to suggest a nose shape that the person doesn't naturally have.  It's hard to tell, but it looks as though her nose from bridge to tip is pretty straight.  In the second photo, a darker colour was most likely applied to the sides while the top of the nose has some lighter powder to help make it stand out.  This makes the nose look much thinner than it really is.  And in the third photo, there is darker makeup applied along the sides and ridges of the nose to help create a more defined shape.  Hope this helps.

(Please excuse me if this post was kinda confusing or repetitive.  It's been a long day.)

I noticed the same thing. They look very heavily photoshopped. Some just have smudged the skin to make it look smooth, but others have new superimposed faces altogether. 

**EDIT:** Can't exclude makeup! It might very well be makeup.

**EDIT2:** So I did some quick and dirty reverse image searching and found [this page](http://worldcosplay.net/member/128551_mari/photos), which I assume is the source of some of the pictures. I'm not really sure if it refutes or confirms anything, but since the photos in the imgur album aren't all from the same source I guess it could mean some use makeup, some are natural, and some are shopped. tl;dr: I have no clue.

Nice find!

I actually found the ones (hand picked for only Shingeki no Kyojin ones) from a facebook page dedicated for realistic cosplay

Theres actually a couple I've seen before but never found again on that page, I'll add those thanks!

Edit: good lord that connie cosplay and that person above him... LOL WTF
>> ARTICLE
You can really see the love put into Conny's hair! Or "hair", rather.
>> ARTICLE
Yes its makeup 

Edit: lots of Japanese cosplayers use makeup to try to be more similar to the character they are portraying, also they use contact lenses as well

And I'm tempted to say that at least the Christa one, and probably most of the others, are using artificial eyelid openers too.

Why do all the cosplays have them eating a bun instead of a potato?
>> ARTICLE
She's actually more often seen eating bread in the manga. It's a common provision for soldiers, plus it's a lot more convenient for a cosplayer to keep on then and eat for photoshoots than a potato, which will be much less appetizing and generally not look as good. While Sasha always keeps the nickname of "potato girl", it's because of that first incident, not because she has a specific fixation on potatoes - she's just always hungry and prioritizes food over most other things. Total yokel ditz, but also a competent soldier and adorable as heck.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else disappointed that there were no Titan cosplays?

I'm planning one.  Gonna buy a flesh colored zentai suit and grin.  Maybe some ketchup blood.    

I really want to get one of my tall jacked friends and bodypaint the HUGE titan's muscles and bones onto him. 
>> ARTICLE
At Fanime (just ended today) in San Jose there were like 15 Scouts and 5 Titans, I swear all their costumes looked so damn good I would almost say that they were sponsored.
>> ARTICLE
Link, especially the titans part :)
>> ARTICLE
Pictures please
>> ARTICLE
A fairly well known fanartist that I follow took pictures/video with them, her and her friend were cosplaying Eren and Mikasa at Fanime.  
Short video of them running from the "Titans": http://rockets.tumblr.com/post/51446038613  

>> ARTICLE
Don't worry I'm getting together an album from me and my friends showing all the event, the Titans were wearing those skin-tight/colored pants were wearing no tops and had a variety of hair styles, one guy TRIED to look like the giant titan, he was... moderately successful
>> ARTICLE
Colossal Titan with stilts please!
>> ARTICLE
I'm naturally tall person! I finally have a cosplay that will work for me!!!
>> ARTICLE
MIkasa one is spot on <3333
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the Mikasa ones are my favorites
>> ARTICLE
So I'm guessing the guy with the black hair that is in nearly every picture is going to be some kind of fan favourite when he appears in the anime?
>> ARTICLE
He did appear in the anime, right before the wall breaks after the time skip. He was one of the Recon members coming back from a trip.
>> ARTICLE
He appeared in EP4 and in EP9's preview.

He's by far the most popular character in the manga, almost doubling both Eren and Mikasa scores (2nd and 3rd place).

Aw man, poor Armin gets no love.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, ahead by more than 1000 votes? I like him too, but I didn't know Rivaille was *that* popular.
>> ARTICLE
Probably from people that read the manga, if you read on in the story you find out more about him.

And he truly is an awesome bad-ass, whenever he's on screen you know shit is going to go down. (Although, shit is always going down in this story.) 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair r/anime's eternal love for Potato Girl doesn't seem to be expressed in that poll.
>> ARTICLE
Im sure he'll be a personal favorite to some that like his style and characteristics, as does everyone that picks out a personal favorite
>> ARTICLE
Potato anyone?

This is awesome! But I disappoint that Sasha isn't eating a potato

Where the fuck does a man get a cheap pair of knee highs for tho shit

Cheapest I could find was like 130$

Make some! Just wear normal shoes, but make *boot covers* out of a vinyl-ish material.

Or buy some [already made](http://www.shopping.com/Brands-On-Sale-Men-s-Black-Pirate-Costume-Boot-Covers-Med-Large/info).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I had seen some at a party store but they were nowhere near the size i wanted them haha
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, that's a lot of cakefaces.
>> ARTICLE
I love the detail that goes into eastern cosplays, but the amount of make-up and excessive photoshop goes into the uncanny valley.
>> ARTICLE
I love the Rivaille one.
>> ARTICLE
Is picture 5 supposed to be Annie..? I honestly don't know. But that one scares me.
>> ARTICLE
The first Sasha in the album is cute.
>> ARTICLE
Sad theres not titan cosplays. :( 
Still very good!! :D 
>> ARTICLE
Damn you Hanji, why does your gender have to be so ambiguous.  
>> ARTICLE
They're good costumes... but the faces are just... no.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm always impressed that people put together a good cosplay for an anime that's only been out for a few months.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the manga to go off of, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Which has been around for years, might I add.

Levi's backstory? 
Really? At long last?
We get to see how Levi turned from a dirty street rat to the majestic midget we all know him to be?

[hype intensifies]
>> ARTICLE
DAT CAMERA WORK!
>> ARTICLE
Animation and art looks really good as well.
>> ARTICLE
Lets hope it's not ruined with the over use of still frames.
>> ARTICLE
well, after how successful the manga and anime is, they can't blame budget anymore. They're rolling in cash. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more of a scheduling issue
>> ARTICLE
Might just be down to laziness. The 3 OVAs looked kind of dodgy too.

Holy shit, the cinematography looks amazing! I can't wait

Oh my.. I've always wanted to see Levi vs. Erwin and HERE IT IS
>> ARTICLE
This is adapted off of one of the spinoff manga for AOT and it's a good manga spinoff 
>> ARTICLE
WOW

Oh my gosh. Ohh my gosh.
3DMG scenes are animated so beautifully.

Related manga: [Birth of Levi: Kuinaki Sentaku](http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/shingeki-no-kyojin-birth-of-levi-kuinaki-sentaku-r10114)

AKA original material
>> ARTICLE
Well looks like I need to catch up on them OVAs so I can watch this when it comes out.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you enjoy the second one. Niku niku
>> ARTICLE
Looks sick 
>> ARTICLE
My god, this looks absolutely gorgeous. IG Production never cease to amaze...
>> ARTICLE
[Yup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JetluD1E5aw)
>> ARTICLE
Just a note, this looks like it's adapted from the manga spinoff, Birth of Levi. Yes, it's quite good. Short, but explains where Levi comes from very well. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
well there is levi so it must be relevant to the main series
>> ARTICLE
It's just his backstory with Erwin. Fanship material, if you're into that.
>> ARTICLE
Not if he's riding a space rocket to Mars to see if there are any midgets on the surface.
>> ARTICLE
well I guess there would be as soon as he lands
>> ARTICLE
i actually liked the ova's more than the main series.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't we already had 3 OVAs? I remember the one about that girl's diary and how she found a titan, the cooking contest, and the training one, right?
>> ARTICLE
I think this might be a different OVA series.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Those were the extra bonus material at the end of each volume
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
That was a short .5 chapter
>> ARTICLE
Ah! I misunderstood you then. My apologies!
>> ARTICLE
The first OVA may seem irrelevant, but it actually was a story in the manga that they cut out. It has plot significance later on in the story.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, ive only watched the anime and that first OVA left so many interesting questions to what the titans actually are.
>> ARTICLE
No ragretz
>> ARTICLE
This looks fucking badass.
>> ARTICLE
I came. This looks amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm swooning so hard core right now 
>> ARTICLE
Y'all got any more of them subtitles?
>> ARTICLE
Underground city? Wuuuuuuuuuuuuut
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there's an underground city built under the Capital as an emergency if Titans ever got in or if the population got too large, but it was abandoned and is now home to the poor and criminals.
>> ARTICLE
Is this canon?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Is... Is that the basement?

Are we there yet? Will we ever be?
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga but i get the feeling once we meet the king, shit'll get real
>> ARTICLE
It's covering Levi's backstory.
>> ARTICLE
Lord of the Rings doesn't get to Mount Doom until the end of the last movie, so I doubt this show will get to the basement until the end of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
The giant monkeys will lead the way.

Shhh, there are non manga readers here.

There's probably a disclaimer somewhere on the site that says Cospa is not responsible for any slit necks
>> ARTICLE
I *really* don't want to walk around with a "Slice here" on my back
>> ARTICLE
Available [directly from Cospa](http://www.cospa.com/detail/id/00000052424), and probably from other outlets as well.

(Links to other sizes are toward the bottom of the page.)
>> ARTICLE
Find me a english site , and i'll throw money at it.
>> ARTICLE
After browsing for a while, I can't find any legit way to buy it when outside Japan. Only way to obtain it would be getting someone to buy it then ship it too you.

Looks like AmiAmi has it:

I love you. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Yes its cool but regardless of being a Titan or not I like my neck the way it is
>> ARTICLE
I'd buy the shirt sans "slice here"
>> ARTICLE
I managed to convert it to text.

*   
*  "" **** !
* ********!
* !

Edit: 's -> 's
>> ARTICLE
when you wear it inside you become a colossal titan

on the inside theres a colossal titans face printed by -  by wearing the shirt inside out turn into a colossal titan

when you look closely at the front you can see jean.

wear this and "shingeki" word from title , advance/charge

meh close enough. oh and you messed up your  and  

>> ARTICLE
Google translate says: 

* To super-sized giant and wear the skirt inside out.

* That you wear inside out Purisoto hem to the face of the "super-giant large" on the inside in, the super-sized giant!

* If you take a closer look at the staff outside appearance of the mouth Jaso is!

* Let's march wearing this!
>> ARTICLE
We can probably agree that Super Giant large means 'Colossal Titan' because of '' Jin 'person'.
>> ARTICLE
Sorta reminds me of that "Have you seen my zombie" tshirt.
>> ARTICLE
9.9/10 would buy three times. 
>> ARTICLE
Would import/wear in real life with no fucks given.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah because screw people who identify themselves by displaying their interests
>> ARTICLE
"Lol you watch anime? you like that perverted naked cartoon shit?" wat
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but...

Although this t-shirt is creative/funny to view over the internet, would you realistically wear this outside? I mean it says "SLICE Here!" on the back. What would people think of that? Oh, and thats not all, if people are not impressed by that, you can always lift the shirt and put over your freakin head, revealing a creepy monster to show everyone how much of a fan you are!

Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing things that show your interests, but a normal t-shirt with an "Attack on Titan" logo would suffice.  

 
>> ARTICLE
It's really for the people who know the show. I'm sure if someone asked you could just say it's a show I like or something like that.

note: I am glad you at least explained yourself first. I always find it really douchey for someone to just to drop comments like that guy earlier.
