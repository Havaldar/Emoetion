Welcome, everyone, to the rewatch of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann!

This is one of my favorite shows of all time, as well as it is to many others in this community, and with good reason. I'm not gonna list those reasons because I'm too lazy. But one thing to mention was that it was the first anime that made me realize that it wasn't a cartoon, but I still wasn't at the level that I thought as this was an actual anime, because it didn't know it was anime at the time I was watching this show.

Anyways, we kick things off with one of my favorite openings of all time. You know, when I first watched this, I had a bunch of feelings. I thought that it was an okay song, didn't really add much of a feel to the show, but later on, it grows on you more and more until the point in which it becomes addicting to listen and to watch.

As a person who watched the dub first and has never seen the sub, this is a lot better than what I expected. I mean, sure, the Japanese VA convey more emotional than the English VA, but this is still impressive in my books.

Oh man, the music. It's so nostalgic that it gives me goosebumps every time I hear a memorable tune. The shot where Kamina and Simon drill the Gunman up to the surface, my god, so many feels...

I especially love this [scene](http://i.imgur.com/U9fXCMC.png) in particular, because of beautiful it is as well as how the music sways into the scene.

I think that's all the thoughts I can bring up atm, so be sure to tune in tomorrow for more of my thoughts.

Also, we added a daily fanart link that relates to the episode at hand. It's a nice way for people to check out the cool artwork some people have done for the show. Anyways...

#***DISCUSS AWAY!!!***
>> ARTICLE
That scene you linked, oh god so good.

That was the moment that I went from "this show is pretty good" to "holy shit this I love this shit". The music, the atmosphere, the landscape, so gooood
>> ARTICLE
The dub is really good for this show. Two of the main characters are voiced by Lowenthal and Bosch, who did Suzaku and Lelouch in Code Geass. Kamina is voiced by Kyle Hebert, who many know as adult Gohan. 
>> ARTICLE
I've watched the series in both sub and dub, and while both have their strong points I'd have to give the sub the edge on this one, if just for Konishi Katsuyuki's portrayal of Kamina.
>> ARTICLE
Who does Bosch voice, was he in this episode or is he latter on?
>> ARTICLE
Trying to figure out how to word this in the least spoilery version possible.

You'll meet him later, but he won't be voiced by JYB at the time. 

Edit: DISREGARD THIS he will indeed be JYB
>> ARTICLE
Who is it? I'm rewatching the show, but I've only seen the sub, and I'll probably stick with that.
>> ARTICLE
[Second half spoilers](/s "adult Rossiu. Lowenthal is adult Simon. Edit: Come to think of it, maybe they're voicing the kid versions too.")
>> ARTICLE
They voice the kids too.
>> ARTICLE
Well I stand corrected then. I listened to some more of the dub and yep, Simon's definitely Yuri. He sounds like a younger Suzaku. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a decent dub, but the sub is way, way better. I'm sorry, there are some scenes that just require a level of intensity that the English actors simply aren't capable of bringing to the table. 

[MAJOR SPOILER TTGL EP 25](/s "Kittan's last stand is one of the best scenes in all of anime history with his original seiyuu. The dub actor simply can't compare.")
>> ARTICLE
You are discounting Steven Blum's Leeron which is incredible
>> ARTICLE
He's great. But I can't recommend a dub on the strength of one actor.
>> ARTICLE
Say what you will about dub vs sub, but the Japanese VAs are so goddamn good at screaming.
>> ARTICLE
This is truth, and one of the reasons why I watched Evangelion with the sub.
>> ARTICLE
Hey OP, just so you know, the dubbed version of the show is on Netflix. Might want to update the main post.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I can't link the show on Netflix, but I can say that there is a legal way of watching it. Thanks for reminding me!

First timer here. Nice to meet you all.
Despite the overwhelming love for this anime on the sub, I dont really have any expectations. Anyway, I dont know how far Ill go with write ups or anything, but I figured Id give it a shot.

* Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/GaGGzvC.png) it? Is this the drill that pierces everything or something?
* Wait, is [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ztWJXPi.png) the drill? Is it the same drill from the OP?
* [Mecha drill](http://i.imgur.com/oVSG9Nk.png)!
* So many drills. WHY IS THIS THE ONLY THING I KNOW ABOUT THIS ANIME??
* [Drill necklace](http://i.imgur.com/D5ndhG3.png)! Sweet.
* [Wow.](http://i.imgur.com/butIBu6.png) What a bunch of assholes. He has ears and feeling, ya know? Poor dirty, smelly digger
* [THE GUY!](http://i.imgur.com/f4KxCD0.png) ITS THE TTGL DUDE. Those glasses are something else I know from this anime I guess
* Im about 5 minutes in and I am already sick of seeing and hearing about and thinking about [drills](http://i.imgur.com/U6GOkWM.png)
* Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/IDFIrNM.png) that quote, guys? I thought it was pierce. 
* Okay, so theyre mole people? OHHHHH, so thats whats up with the drills
* [And well be damned if we let curiosity and the prospect of a better functioning society let us decide otherwise!!](http://i.imgur.com/ybuiay7.png)
* Also, [no shirt, no shoes](http://i.imgur.com/XhM9Mao.png). I just realised hes shirtless. Is it gonna be like this for the rest of the anime? Cause Im okay with that.
* [Yeah!](http://i.imgur.com/JGMgMQD.png) You tell them, Kamina! Fuck you guys for wanting to eat!! [Oh shit.](http://i.imgur.com/Z6urajW.png) Are they out of the Gurren gang or whatever it was called?
* [Hes so cool.](http://i.imgur.com/3k2Elsp.png) I mean, hes kind of stupid. But at least hes cool.
* I forgot what happened to you. Tragic backstory? So Simons the MC?
* Alright. [Im just not gonna say anything.](http://i.imgur.com/LNrGls4.png) Nothing. [Just gonna keep my mouth shut.](http://i.imgur.com/caCah9Z.png)
* No wait. These people have only been living in darkness, right? As in, no natural light? Wouldnt [this sudden burst of sunlight](http://i.imgur.com/eBCoowm.png) completely obliterate their eyes?
* [Ah!](http://i.imgur.com/rfZJdE7.png) The sunglasses make sense now.
* Youre telling them to [look up](http://i.imgur.com/da7nU4j.png), but Im pretty sure they cant see anymore
* Dont worry, boys. Your fan service has arrived. Shes got a pretty awesome design
* He went from [trying to pick her up](http://i.imgur.com/UbZiOoD.png), to [insulting her](http://i.imgur.com/PUYDtqM.png) in less than a minute.
* [Noooooo.](http://i.imgur.com/fVt2mG1.png) As a girl, lemme say that this would not be okay. Oh man. Nuh-uh. No thank you. And she just doesnt even flinch. 
* [GET IN THE FUCKING ROBOT SIMON!!!](http://i.imgur.com/v1rDOWI.png) 
* OH! [I know this quote too](http://i.imgur.com/MVevjrR.png) Here it comes. [BAM!](http://i.imgur.com/vcPyk7z.png) There it is. Okay, so Im done, right? I can stop now? We got the drills, the glasses, the believe in me who believes in you. Thats all there is, yeah?
* Oh. It was [a key](http://i.imgur.com/cc98jeG.png) all along. Fair play
* Thats a mecha right? Its not very mecha-esque It kind of looks like a souped-up bumper car. Ahahahaha the way it moves!!! T is thing is adorable!
* [Liar!!](http://i.imgur.com/qjJa6tC.png) Dont pretend like you can see! I know the sun blinded you
* [Is Simon on](http://i.imgur.com/FUMqdKV.png)..? [Is he](http://i.imgur.com/0rry9vm.png)? [Yea.](http://i.imgur.com/NyRbE40.png) Ahaha, [shes cool with it, though.](http://i.imgur.com/HNJGws7.png) So it seems like boobs are to anime, what doonas/duvets are to the real world: the [ultimate protection](http://i.imgur.com/wLR5ew6.png) from monsters and all things bad.

So that was a fun first episode. I have no clue whats coming, but I am amused. The characters are interesting and I really like the animation style. So yeah, sorry if this was long. Also, sorry if all the links were a pain.
>> ARTICLE
Love the analysis coming from a first timer! I've re watched Gurren Lagann about 8 or more times now, and I've never gotten sick of it. I'd almost forgotten how I reacted to seeing some of these things the first time, and your write up brought me right back to that. 

I hope you enjoy the rest of the series as much as I did!

Edit: Also my favorite anime soundtrack of all time too. Still listen to it quite often. 
>> ARTICLE
8 TIMES??? *EIGHT* TIMES?????? Far, that is so impressive.

Also thank you for reading my write up!! I'm glad it gave you, like, nostalgic feels from the first time you watched it.

I really hope I continue to enjoy it, too. And I will definitely pay close attention to the soundtrack!!
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the few anime I can just pick up and re watch without worrying about getting bored with it. Every time I watch it I tend to notice something new too. It's the only series I've ever re watched that many times :P
>> ARTICLE
> Alright. Im just not gonna say anything. Nothing. Just gonna keep my mouth shut.

Along with the boob jokes, expect dick jokes too. Gurren Lagann is all about gender equality.
>> ARTICLE
> Is this that quote, guys? I thought it was pierce.

Same here. It's also the same version of the quote used in the dub, so maybe you're going by the dub's dialogue? Or maybe the famous version of it comes later?
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps. Idk. Hoping it'll come later.
>> ARTICLE
It does come later. They say it multiple times in the show, and I believe the famous version is said the most.
>> ARTICLE
Cool.
>> ARTICLE
This little analysis is adorable. And I don't mean that in the "Oh you have no idea what's coming", it's just great to see a first time watcher really enjoying the show, especially since it's a favorite of mine. Honestly if you keep this up I'll probably be visiting these discussions just to read your opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Aw shucks. Thank you so much for reading it!!! I was genuinely worried no one would..
>> ARTICLE
You better believe I'll read it. Nothing makes me happier than watching someone's (positive) reactions to something I already love.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man. I'll do my best not to disappoint! (Or hate)
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry about it. I know it's not a show for everyone (although I think you're going to love it based on your thoughts for this episode).
>> ARTICLE
> He went from trying to pick her up, to insulting her in less than a minute.

Kamina is the ultimate tsundere.
>> ARTICLE
>Kamina is the ultimate deretsun

FTFY


>> ARTICLE
Given how you've reacted so far I think k you'll like this anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope so. I really do.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm about 5 minutes in and I am already sick of seeing and hearing about and thinking about drills

I'm sure you have lots of "just you wait" type responses but I found this part to be particularly funny.
>> ARTICLE
> Hes so cool. I mean, hes kind of stupid. But at least hes cool.

Pretty much
>> ARTICLE
Kamina is a dumbass. A mostly likable, fun dumbass, but a grade A dumbass all the same. 
>> ARTICLE
He's excellent. I completely get the love for him
>> ARTICLE
My feelings on Kamina are a little complicated, but we'll get to that for you newbies in due time. :P

He's certainly fun. 
>> ARTICLE
Uh-oh.
>> ARTICLE
Let me put it this way: Kamina comes across as dumb, vain, idealistic, stubborn, and a whole host of other obnoxious characteristics. "He's a walking tragedy waiting to happen," the audience is supposed to think. "That's not how the world works," we're supposed to say. 

The glorious thing about this show, however, without giving away too much, is that Kamina is actually right. If you don't have hope, you have nowhere to start. If you don't believe that you can pierce the heavens, then you will never give what is needed. Every challenge is an opportunity to rise higher and stronger and your greatest tool is your will to persevere.
>> ARTICLE
Idealism can get very annoying, very quickly, but I get what you're saying. I'm seriously starting to look forward to seeing more of what he'll do.
>> ARTICLE
No need for uho-ohing! I may have made it sound overly dramatic. YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN I PROMISE




i mean he's just such an idiot lets be real
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Too late. You've got me scared. Why man? Is this revenge for some of the Code Geass rewatch comments, where people kind of gave things away without giving things away?
>> ARTICLE
Hm. Okay, to basically sum it up without being spoilery: a lot of people love Kamina because he's this big dumb idiot who does a lot of awesome things. 

When I first watched TTGL, despite the awesome things, I couldn't get over the dumb idiocy part and thought he was kinda annoying. HOWEVER, later episodes made me appreciate him for his character beyond the big dumb idiocy! 

I hope that helps without being spoilery-at all! Kamina is really fun and I see why so many people like him.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhhhhh okay. Gotcha.

Also, no, you weren't spoilery. We cool
>> ARTICLE
Kamina isn't a dumb idiot though. He knows the odds, he knows the situations, he just doesn't give a shit. No matter how bad or hopeless something is, when he says they're gonna do something, they're gonna do it.
>> ARTICLE
I would

certainly qualify that as being kind of dumb
>> ARTICLE
> Ahaha, she's cool with it, though.

Yoko immediately became my favorite female lead when I saw that. "Yeah, it was an accident, no problem."


>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna lie. At first I commented that she seemed "a little too happy about the incident", but I eased up. Your comment makes way more sense than me thinking she enjoyed it...
>> ARTICLE
> Yoko immediately became my favorite female lead

[Gurren Lagann](/s "At least until Nia arrives")
>> ARTICLE
I actually never really liked that character too much. Thought she was a little boring. Too perfect, you know? But everyone has different opinions.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I feel like the only notable thing about Yoko is boobs
>> ARTICLE
She's the badass rational character as opposed to [](/s "Nia who is the silly innocent girl")
>> ARTICLE
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree then.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid I'm going to have to revoke your opinion license. 
>> ARTICLE
Yoko has no time for embarrassment. Yoko has robots to kill.
>> ARTICLE
> He went from trying to pick her up, to insulting her in less than a minute.

I actually liked this in his character, it was like a weird way to be shallow but he wasn't desperate haha and you can tell it bothered her, cute :p




>> ARTICLE
Kamina is super sexist, but it only contributes to how *manly* he is.
>> ARTICLE
This is a very weird way of complimenting(?) someone
>> ARTICLE
Not sure how I feel about that
>> ARTICLE
^^(Studio) TRIGGERED
>> ARTICLE
It actually made me laugh so much. I really like him. He gives no shits, does and says whatever he wants
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no. Not again.

Episode 1

* You have to wonder how much effort the subbers went through to get the words stylized [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Vy47Dzt.png)

* Why is it Japanese songs can kick-ass and sound lyrical even when the words dont rhyme whatsoever? Show-offs

* [And then God said, Let there be bad-ass explosions.](http://webm.land/media/92jX.webm)

* I have no idea what he just said, but it sounds really cool.

* [OH! HE SAID IT! HE SAID IT!](http://webm.land/media/tCgr.webm)

* [For some reason](http://i.imgur.com/8YEP4Qr.jpg) that song from [Lion King 1 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBGTuxOEa98) popped into my head.

* Who *wouldnt* just dig for steaks?

* [Ew! Its Simon the Digger!](http://i.imgur.com/qAjSM63.jpg) Hes got nothing on us, the Toxic Gas ~~Pigeons~~ Testers.

* I think hed rather plug a certain hole in you three. (Take that as you will.)

* [Kamina confirmed Fight Club president?](http://i.imgur.com/Lhj2I0v.jpg)

* [Im sorry, its Its just not the same.](http://webm.land/media/Z0It.webm) (And I havent even seen this show before. You guys just quote it way too much.)

* [Remember that movie, City of Ember?](http://i.imgur.com/dCHBuU5.jpg) The one that got hyped up like hell then everyone forgot about it the second it was released? Neither do I.

* [Screw gravity!](http://webm.land/media/rzgz.webm)

* How have these guys not run out of air if theyve been underground for so long that they dont even think the surface exists anymore?

* No dinner is a high price to pay? Try being in an expensive private school with no means of personal income for over ten years, and then talk to me about hunger.

* [Kamina has purple eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/OByikVG.png) [Lelouch has purple eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/XC2iSKr.jpg) They were the two finalists in the Best Guy contest. [Coincidence?](http://i.imgur.com/8bE3Chi.gifv)

* Up on the surface, there aint no ceiling! Gus did say hes always wanted to feel what its like to go through an earthquake.

* [Anyone else feel like playing Dig Dug?](http://i.imgur.com/jFFzvJN.png)

* [Okay, no question now.](http://i.imgur.com/rTwRNWz.jpg)

* [Kaminas like a buff version of Aang.](http://webm.land/media/Yc3p.webm)

* [Sorry, guys. I was trying to find a place to park, and didnt realize you had excavated so much.](http://webm.land/media/UWXD.webm)

* I wont stand for any more of your shenanigans! Never have I heard that word be used so seriously.

* [Dont mind me, guys. Im just here to be the obligatory bad-ass girl on the team.](http://webm.land/media/Vxkc.webm) (Before you castrate me, I never said that obligatory was bad.)

* Kaminas Philosophy: Girls loves honestly, so always tell them how sexy as fuck they are, no matter the circumstance.

* Kaminas Second Philosophy: If a chicks from a pit, shes the pits.

* Kaminas Third Philosophy: I like a girl who can kick my ass; you may think that I stole that line from the Cowboy Bebop Movie, and you would be right.

* Lol. She just thought this giant robot wolf thing was alive on its own? This is a gundam series, girl, not a futuristic crime-drama.

* Kick logic out and do the impossible! Again, Ive seen you guys quote the original line so many times that even something with the exact same meaning sounds wrong. Fuck you guys.

* Believe in the Kamina who believes in you! I wish I had a person who believed in me to believe in.

* [Since when do car keys turn to the left to turn on?](http://webm.land/media/c8oC.webm)

* Yoko: Whats a Lagann?

* Kamina: Its this big things name. The shows title needed to make some sort of sense.

* [Make the impossible possible!](http://webm.land/media/NsJO.webm) (Im pretty sure there was an Ed, Edd n Eddy episode about this.)

* [HA!](http://webm.land/media/zyvb.webm) The shows fucking aware how fanservicy it comes off as. These guys *did* make Kill la Kill.

* Why didnt he just turn the key all the way in the first place?

* Aww, man. [Were the Royal Sisters kidnapped again?](http://i.imgur.com/QosRgyY.jpg)

* Yoko: Its Yoko. Yoko is my name. I never introduced myself, did I?

* Kamina: Ah, fuck, Yoko Ono? Bitch, youre going back in the ground.

* Kamina: [Thats just Fanservice. You get used to him after a while.](http://webm.land/media/xOh1.webm)

* [Simon:](http://i.imgur.com/xSB8XKy.jpg) Are you sure your name is Yoko? Cause you really look more like a Kallen to me.

Wow, I managed to make one of these things less than a thousand words. Im sure thatll change as the show goes on.
>> ARTICLE
idk if you're a dub-only guy or what, but I'd seriously recommend you watch the original w/ subs. From what I've seen/heard of the dub, the whole thing feels like...

...you remember how Nunnally's dub actress in the last CGR2 ep just couldn't handle the weight of the emotions she needed to play? The entire TTGL dub is like that, except with intensity and awesomeness. 
>> ARTICLE
I listened to both versions for episode one. I honestly just prefer the dub better, at least for now. Maybe because I can focus on the visuals without needing to look at the bottom of the screen.
>> ARTICLE
Nice post! I'm thrilled to see so many first-time watchers posting their reactions, it should make for a great read.
>> ARTICLE
I loved you on the Code Geass rewatch!! So glad I get to read your posts again. And as a fellow first timer :D

I like to think that the mole people would sing this while they're digging.

Tunnelling.

Yay, somebody else noticed how similar the art and animation was to Kill la Kill.  I think that was one of the things that really sold going in on this rewatch, as I'd never actually seen it before.  I kicked around five minutes of the first episode the night before and finished it today.  I gotta say, I'm looking forward to more.

/u/LazyPyromaniac here, and when you feel down because the Code Geass rewatch ended and you think there aren't anymore rewatches, but wait, there's more!

Hey guys this is my first time watching Guren Lagan so I'm going to be posting my thoughts and reactions to the series!

Nice intro I like it

Everything is exploding, IN SPACE!

Very similar to Kill la Kill in the art style, I like it

"Ew it's Simon" that's right Kamina, they are fugly, put them in their place

Right, that's where the drill that will pierce the heavens comes from


Going to the surface? Why has no one else done that?

Of course, the old pig-mole tornado move

Never unseal the canopy, why not? A lot of questions,few answers

Never run from anything! Bro is a badass

Aaaaand Simon is a pessimist 


Gotta admire their sneaking skills

In comes the girl who's cosplays are always on the front page

the VIEW is amazing on those stairs

Enter giant robot face


You tell him Kamina, get in the damn robot Shinj-Simon

Of course only someone like Kamina could face Best Guy in the finals

U just gotta beliveeee!


U go Kamina

Perk up and do something Simon

Now we're getting somewhere
Always double tap
[Everyone wants more power](http://imgur.com/qugpWGD) ,  cough cough Code Geass R2 E1 anybody? cough cough
Still waiting for Kamina to say WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM? And ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
Why isn't Kamina the main character, he's so much more likable and badass than Simon. Yoko best girl confirmed? She's so chill about Boota in her cleavage. Oh and Simon "accidentally" falls out of a robot falling from the sky and lands on Yokos boobs. Every anime always has to end the first episode on a cliffhanger.

Post Episode thoughts
I'm looking forward to watching this series as I've heard a lot of good things but I've never watched an episode or written my reactions so I'll see how it goes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Of course only someone like Kamina could face Best Guy in the finals

How can Kamina face himself in the finals? Hehehe. Terrible joke. I didn't even follow that contest anyway.

I'm sure those who think Lelouch is Best Guy and *haven't* seen Gurren Lagann will not have their minds changed, but I hope you'll all come to love Kamina just the same.

> Still waiting for Kamina to say WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM? And ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER Why isn't Kamina the main character, he's so much more likable and badass than Simon.

We're only one episode in. Give it some time, and just enjoy the ride.

TTGL is one of my favorite series of all time. I wouldn't have put Lelouch or Kamina anywhere near the final 8. :P

Hell, he's not even the best guy in his own series.

**Episode 1** 

**Disclaimer/introduction**  


So I'm coming out of literally months of hardcore lurking for this rewatch just because TTGL is my favorite anime series ever. I tend to revisit parts of it all the time, but rarely do a full rewatch of the entire series from the start, so I thought this was a great opportunity to do just that. As such, a lot of what i post will be more just reflections, a few reactions, and maybe some retrospective on the series/individual episodes. I'm gonna avoid spoilers as much as possible, and I'm also really new to posting on reddit so my formatting will probably be pretty weird early on. That being said, I'm ready to dive into this fantastic series with all of you.


**ALRIGHT LETS GO**


Sorairo days.... just the opening notes gives me chills even after so many rewatches. I love this op so much.


Ohhhhh I always forget about this opening scene lol. Its really out of place in the context of the very first episode...and a large part of the show as well TBH


"DARE DA TO OMOTTE I YAGARU" counter: 1


Kamina, such an imposing character from the very start.


PIG TOWEEEEEER!


gainax does such a good job on [conveying raw emotion through eyes/facial expression](http://i.imgur.com/zhJCzuz.jpg) in this series. Kamina's will of steel and dedication to his ideals really caught me off guard the first time I watched TTGL. Probably the first time I'd seen such a character in anime before (looking back, I watched this show really early in my anime viewing history).


KAMINA DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR SILLY EARTHQUAKES OK


Oh right Simon has a big fear of them though. [good guy aniki ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/vN7Zsq1.jpg) The brotherly relationship between these two is so awesome :D


holy crap, because of how rarely i rewatch the early episodes I always forget how many scenes of utter badassery Kamina gets in the first episode. If i knew how to make GIFs I would gif-ify (is that a word?) almost all of his monologues in this episode. 


[THAT GRIN! THOSE EYES! THE OOZING CONFIDENCE! ANIKIIIIII] (http://i.imgur.com/AIDTAeB.jpg)


[*wink*] (http://i.imgur.com/J4ICrqF.jpg)


This kinda [sums up the whole show honestly](http://i.imgur.com/Ec1FNTV.jpg) .I like the original translation: "kick logic to the curb and do the impossible," a lot more lol.


Then we get this awesome quote as well [1](http://i.imgur.com/Q9amyL5.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/AxuDbfU.jpg) Really demonstrates early on just how much total trust simon and kamina have in each other.


The animation for these early fights are really well done...who am I kidding the animation is pretty on point for the whole the series. Everything in the first half is really well-done, and then it gets cranked up to 11 in the second part IMO.


CUE HEAVEN-PIERCING MUSIC. GET HYPE!


One of the [best shots](http://i.imgur.com/59cGT5z.jpg) in the whole show. Really gives the audience a chance to kinda see the current state of the planet presently though. Desert for daaaaaaays.


Finish up with some comedy and inter-character introductions as well as a tense cliffhanger, then roll credits. EPISODE 1 END!


**Post Episode Stuff**


One down, 26 to go! I'm really gonna enjoy these early episodes seeing as I rarely go back to them. Probably gonna be doing shorter posts at least for some of the episodes after 8 (when the double episode days start) but I'll do my best to keep up. Really excited to see the first-timers' thoughts on the show and to discuss with everyone. ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH.

>Really gives the audience a chance to kinda see the current state of the planet

When I first watched this show, I didn't realize it took place on Earth until halfway through the series.
>> ARTICLE
"Reject common sense to make the impossible possible!" Wow, not even the dub altered the original line *that* much.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was a little bummed when that came up, but for the most part the subs I'm watching are pretty well done. The dub is great, but I'll always prefer the original language version due to some of the lines just having much better delivery IMO
>> ARTICLE
Hello everyone! Yet another first time viewer. I've heard great things about this show, and my standards are super low, so don't be too surprised if I can't control my Caps Lock. Really excited to be here with you all, and hopefully we can have as good as a time as we did with the Code Geass Rewatch. Now without further ado, let's get into this!

**Episode 1**

* Oh sweet, starting off with the OP

* Hey, I remember this song! Didn't /r/anime sing this?

* The creepy dude with sharp teeth is the antangonist I'm assuming?

* Oh, ok. The Universe is blowing up

* Hit in Block 3865? Must be a big ship/plane/etc. 

* "I'll take the fabric of spacetime itself and wring them out of existence!" Huh? I wonder if that's literal or just a typical exaggerated threat.

* Great Dimensional Waterfall? Wait, what?

* Ahhh! He said it! Gurren Lagann!

* Holy shit, that was a huge mech!

* He...digs?

* Ahh, Mole Men

* Glowing drill?

* "If we're not careful, he might drill a hole in us too" (   )

* If this show keeps up with the drill metaphors, my teenage mind might just lose control

* [Sploosh](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100512004533/gurennlagann/images/2/2e/Kamina.jpg)

* Kamina huh?

* Oh hey, the guy who thought he could beat Lelouch!

* More drill metaphors

* Ahh the angsty rebellious teens

* Kamina gives no fucks

* I....what? How did those pigs fly like that?\

* I guess this anime isn't one that cares for physics

* Kamina won't stand down for anyone

* Oh shit, I think not being able to be called bro by that hunk would be a worse punishment than the stockades

* Aww, tragic past for the little guy...who's name I've already forgotten

* What the shit is that?

* Haha, I can tell I'm already gonna like Kamina

* Mystical Glowing Object?

* Careful little one, you almost drilled through Kamina's drill

* Haha, omfg. The way he just rips the ropes

* Busted

* Simon, I'll have to remember that

* How is he not fazed by the chief's beatings!?

* umm, the ceiling kinda broke

* Woah, big robot....cat?

* Ok, that's not how physics works Kamina

* It talks!?!

* Not sure if Kamina's boldness comes from his bravery, or ignorance....or both

* Ohh, a sniper chick, like Sinon

* Is now really the time to be flirting Kamina

* Nevermind, now I see why. Carry on

* Looks like we've already been introduced to this show's Kallen. You know, with the ass shots and whatnot

* Dammit Kamina

* I still love you though <3

* Oh...it's a face

* Well, at least....dammit I forgot his name again

* Simon! Mental note made

* "Reject common sense to make the impossible possible" 

* Well, you've done your fair share of that Kamina 

* "Get in the fuckin Robot Simon"

* Why is this so familiar....

* "Don't believe in yourself! Believe in the me who believes in you!"

* I'm starting to see why Kamina rivaled Lelouch in the Best Guy contest. Not even done with the first episode and I already freaking love him!

* Why did the mainframe turn into a galaxy

* I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride

* Kamina, that type of thought process can get you killed

* Whack-a-mole!

* I'm so funny! hehe

* Oh...how are they all fitting in there?

* "Don't moan over a little thing like this" (   )

* It's a pretty unicorn

* Well, this is certainly a nice OST

* RIP Catbot

* F

* Your typical David and Goliath story

* Well...that IS certainly a nice view

* Yoko huh, I can already tell what kind of character you're going to be

* Well, I guess you can call that a landing

* Lucky Simon...

* She liked it!

* Wow, really lucky Simon

* Not so lucky gang

* *To be Continued*

**Post-Episode thoughts**

Well, I for one enjoyed that, and am already looking forward to this Rewatch. Good characters, nice fanservice, and Kamina can all guarantee that I'm going to see this Rewatch to the end. Hope to catch you all tomorrow!

P.s. I suck at formatting, so forgive me if something looks...off

> Ohh, a sniper chick, like Sinon

Same English VA too.
>> ARTICLE
>Hit in Block 3865? Must be a big ship/plane/etc.

Yeah, this show likes to put things on a ridiculous scale. Part of its charm and appeal. Just like the disregard for physics.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess this anime isn't one that cares for physics

Gurren Lagann is an anime that not only does not care for the laws of physics, it kicks the laws of physics in the nuts, rifles through its pockets for loose change, and then tells the laws of physics it's using its loose change to take the bus over to its mom's house so it can fuck her.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here. The amount of time I've been told to watch this is probably in the top 3. Always figured it to be a total guy anime so I've avoided it haha. Hopefully it will appeal to me too! Would love to get another girls opinion on the show! Let's do this!

Well that opening was a pretty great start, heard that song before but from another show and this version was even better

So it's like a village of like mole people? 

Getting picked on by the girls already :( I find him cute though!

Simon? The pronunciation is very French haha

Kamina is like definition of cool, like how are those shades staying on?? :p

Awe cute little mole buddy :3

Oh wow so they've never seen the surface, wonder what it's like? Wastelands?

Would 100% be scared of earthquakes if I were living in underground caves 

Casually breaking out of jail lol

And episode 1 and their home is already caved in D:

These mid cards are pretty

Not sure Kamina is super brave or super dumb haha either way he's cool :p

Guessing it's really hot on the surface since she wearing barely anything...

Okay Kamina is pretty cool giving it Simon...even if he doesn't want it.

"Don't believe in yourself" haha he's great

Mini face robot mech?  If its facial expresisons change this will be so much fun

Overall pretty fun and very exciting first episode.

As a primarily romance watcher I'm scared of the 2 guy 1 girl dynamic...

Looking forward to ep 2!

>> ARTICLE
Good write-up, I'm looking forward to reading all these episode posts! What makes you worried about the 2 guys 1 girl situation? The risk of love triangles?
>> ARTICLE
YEAH! Hate love triangles...always want everyone to be happy even if I do have preferential side!
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, that's admirable! It is nice when no-one's left out.

As for the romantic prospects in the series, I'm just going to keep my mouth shut for now. There are way too many big events still to come to talk about it yet!
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason my favourite anime is what it is :p

Yeah I'll be happy for any romance as I'm not expecting much from it!
>> ARTICLE
> Kamina is like definition of cool, like how are those shades staying on?? :p

I didn't even notice. Blew my mind. How *do* they stay on???
>> ARTICLE
By his sheer coolness :p
>> ARTICLE
>Awe cute little mole buddy :3

Boonta is the heart and soul of team Dia Gurren!
>> ARTICLE
Happy to hear we'll be getting to see more of him :)
>> ARTICLE
> Always figured it to be a total guy anime so I've avoided it

If I had a quarter for every time I've heard that, I'd have like... $1.75. But seriously, Gurren Lagann is an odd beast in this respect. It appears on the surface level like an almost comically stereotypical "manly-man" action show. And to an extent, it is. But it's also self-aware, and it plays off of that manly-man appearance to craft a much more intricate story as it goes on. And by the time you've reached the end, you're so involved with the rest of the story, the whole masculinity-as-a-social-construct aspect kind of gets left in the dust. It's no longer about the explosions and who's the toughest, strongest, manliest character, it's about those characters, and their flaws and aspirations and the struggles they go through. It actually directly addresses the whole manliness-as-a-facade issue, as well, which I found really refreshing.

As a man, and because of my upbringing, I've never placed a lot of value in "masculinity via force" - that is, being the toughest, or the strongest, or getting the most girls, etc. It's always been more about "masculinity via actions and ideals" - just being a good person and letting the "manliness" follow like it should. And it was a concern of mine going into this show because I had the same ideas about it, but I was surprised to find that it lay much more in line with my thinking than with the traditional stereotypes of masculinity, which I really enjoy a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's reassuring to hear and I'll probably end up enjoying it then! I just figured it was an over the top lets get stronger and beat the bad guys with cool fights and explosions anime :p
>> ARTICLE
And you're not wrong about that. But it does it in a more emotionally engaging and awesome way than anything else I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'll be on the lookout for more scenes like that! :)
>> ARTICLE
> If its facial expresisons change this will be so much fun

It does. Gurren's face is more expressive than the average character. 
>> ARTICLE
Sweet!

That'll give something to pay attention to during the action scenes :)
>> ARTICLE
Lagann* D:
>> ARTICLE
I'm a girl and I really enjoyed the show. Yes it's a ton of action and there is a lot of fanservice surrounding Yoko, but it's also super fun. It's a really inspirational show, too. I think you'll really like it!
>> ARTICLE
Sucks about the fanservice but as long as it's a fun ride it should be fun, thanks :)

I tend to zone out for action scenes tbh but these were pretty interesting so far!
>> ARTICLE
The fanservice is sort of alright because Yoko is still a great character, not just tits and ass. Also Kamina is always shirtless so there is a little fanservice for girls too. Or at least that's how I viewed it.

There will be plenty more action scenes so if you really don't like them it might not be your show but it's got plenty to offer.
>> ARTICLE
It'll depend on how the other female characters are portrayed (if there are more? lol) but Yoko so far seems like a cool character and if rely on that more then her body I'll be fine with that!
>> ARTICLE
There's several other female characters and all are depicted as generally badass in their own rights. The fanservice drops off noticeably after a few episodes. Yoko does retain her outfit, but the focus on it is minor.

That said, there is a bath house episode that I know has turned some people off. It's equal opportunity, though, and none of the girls are depicted nude, actually. Besides, it gave us this glorious moment: **[Non-spoiler Spoiler Warning, tagging because it's from episode 5 or something]** http://i.imgur.com/LWANreV.gif
>> ARTICLE
>  The fanservice drops off noticeably after a few episodes

Really good to know! :D
>> ARTICLE
Also writing up more in response to your original comment, give me a couple minutes. Something you said caught my attention.
>> ARTICLE
Ouu interesting, looking forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I watched the show, but if I remember correctly most of the other female characters introduced aren't so badly sexualized, but they are also aren't as cool as Yoko. The show is, unfortunately I guess, mostly dudes. But it's good. I hope you like it.
>> ARTICLE
We'll see, I don't plan on dropping it so I'll be here for the long haul so I hope I enjoy it!
>> ARTICLE
The sunglasses thing is actually pretty interesting. If he looks down, if he doesn't keep his head high, they will fall off.

You know it's a play with the expression of "keeping one's head high" = confidence. If you keep an eye out for it, I'm sure you will notice that Kamina only acts boisterous/confident when he has his sunglasses on, when he is "keeping his head high".
>> ARTICLE
That is a lot deeper then I thought about it...that's actually so cool
>> ARTICLE
Yep! When people talk about TTGL "Deep" isn't among the first things they say but this show has lots of depth to it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
He's definitely a fun character and plays the opposite/constrast of Simon so well, looking forward to more of him and his rad red shades :)
>> ARTICLE
[OK first time watchers are you ready for the best bro/aniki who ever existed?](http://i.imgur.com/08MIoyQ.png)

He may not be the smartest, best written or deepest character but damn he is still one of my favorite characters and [simply one of the most entertaining](http://gfycat.com/IgnorantFelineClownanemonefish) 
It just gets never boring with him.  
Sorry I needed a bit of fanboying because it's been so long  since I have seen Kamina.


But on to the episode:

[spoiler second half of the anime](/s "everytime I rewatch this anime I don't get why they started the show with a scene referencing the second half of the anime, I mean I always forget this beginning because it isn't really relevant until the story reaches adult Simon")

First introduction to Simon, he is really good digger and he likes to find treasures, also he is not the bravest of the Team Gurren, atleast when he is without Kamina.

Yoko from Littner Village, has a huge gun, and likes to wear revealing clothings, and she doesn't like to get chatted up,atleast by Kamina.This at the moment everything we know about her.  
[She is also the reason I became aware of this anime in the first place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TldJXA_JOZA) (sorry can't find the original it is maybe blocked in my country)  



We also learn that (probably) all humanity is living underground without knowing about the surface, why that? Maybe because they were afraid of the Gunman?

I just hope all first timer have a great time and that you are ready for a wild ride, it gets only better from here. 





>> ARTICLE
IIRC that opening was made almost as a demo for the show. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yup, exactly. I remember watching it shortly after it first aired, and [MAJOR SPOILERS TTGL EPISODE 8](/s "I was convinced Kamina couldn't have died because he was obviously in that opening flash-forward. And I was wondering how/when he'd come back. When the whole point of the series is Simon surpassing him.")
>> ARTICLE
First episode and Kamina is already 2nd best guy
>> ARTICLE
wait wait, only 2nd? Do you mean in this anime or in your personal list?

>> ARTICLE
2nd in my personal list, no one can beat [True Best Guy](http://imgur.com/ggo1smG)
>> ARTICLE
Well, Kamina and Lelouch *were* the finalists of the best guy popularity contest, with Lelouch winning out by only 18 votes.
>> ARTICLE
Ok I thought in the anime, in your personal list 2nd is a solid place.
>> ARTICLE
ALL HAIL LELOUCH!
>> ARTICLE
ALL HAIL BRITANIA! ALL HAIL LELOUCH!
>> ARTICLE
>  it gets only better from here

With such an exciting first episode that's good to hear!
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite aspects of this show is how the scale of everything grows so rapidly.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing from the comments it'll get pretty out of control at one point haha should be fun
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching Gurren Lagann, so I'm looking forward to see what all the talk is about! I'm not usually one to watch these high-octane action anime, but I've heard that this is THE high-octane action anime, so why not give it a shot?

I will say, however, that so far I'm not extremely impressed. Things went by extremely quickly, so of course I wasn't too excited with the whole idea of them finally seeing the surface, and nothing that really happened really got much from me because I don't know much about this world at all. Plus, for me at least, nothing really interesting happened as there was a large focus on the action and not so much on building the wonderment or excitement on everything that was going on. Of course, I get that it's a first episode and they wanted to get all the boring stuff out of the way, but it's a small gripe I have, and I hope that things are given a bit more time in the future so we can get invested in whatever is happening.

I will say though that so far I'm liking the cast. Simon seems like he has a lot of potential to grow, and at the same time isn't a huge baby like many other MC's (I'm looking at you, Yuki and Shu!), Yoko seems like a strong female lead who is more than just fan service, and of course there's Kamina, who from what I heard suspected to be a big ol' Gary Stu, but seems to have a decent number of flaws to him to make him charming.

First impressions are meh, but first episodes aren't always the best indicator of a series success. Plus, I've always been more for the characters than the story, and from that perspective things look promising. Overall, I'm looking forward to the next episode, though I hope things improve from here. 

Episode 1 score: 6.5/10
>> ARTICLE
I watched it for the first time through shortly after it'd finished airing, when OMG HYPEEEEE levels were probably at their peak. I felt much the same way as you. I now consider it one of my favorite shows ever.

3, 11, 17. Just keep repeating that to yourself. 3, 11, 17. :)
>> ARTICLE
> Yoko seems like a string female lead who is more than just fan service

Her fan service is high so far so I really hope she is a strong character!

I agree with you on the world building but I figure they'll explain stuff better when things get a little less hectic. I mean Yoko knows the most about the world and she only got around to giving her name by the end of the episode haha
>> ARTICLE
I have high hopes from what I've seen so far for Yoko. My absolute favourite part of this episode was when Simon fell in between her breasts and she just smiled and didn't make a huge deal out of it unlike many other shows. Of course it's too early on to tell based on one episode, and all i hope is that they don't force the fan service too heavily and let it be the focus of her whole character.
>> ARTICLE
It's weird how the girl with one of most unnatural boobs show the most nature reactions.
>> ARTICLE
> i hope is that they don't force the fan service too heavily and let it be the focus of her whole character.

Yeah really don't want that to happen...that's how you ruin good characters!

> she just smiled and didn't make a huge deal out of it unlike many other shows. 

I feel like if it was Kamina though it would be a different story haha so I'm curious to see everyone's future reactions!
>> ARTICLE
Actually I pulled it off of my hard drive a few days ago with plans to rewatch, then saw the discussion thread announcement so decided to save them and join in yay!

My favorite anime of all time. Was "the straw that broke the camels back" in a massive lifestyle change spanning years that turned me from a skinny alcoholic shut-in gamer to a badass and confident MMA athlete alpha-male!

My secret is that it's all thanks to KAMINA baby!

Ore wa dare da to omotte yagaru!??

Enjoy the show friends. Kick logic out and do the impossible.
>> ARTICLE
Many people may tell you that this show is a satire/parody of how ridiculous some mech shows can be, but I say screw that. This show is an amazing inspirational work about the power of human spirit! With the right attitude, we can go beyond the impossible and do anything! Humanity has no limits! It's much more enjoyable in my opinion if you look at it like that, you get more attached to the characters and the story. Plus many of the catchphrases of the show are fun to toss around in real life.

Additionally, Sorairo days is my favorite musical opening ever. It's seriously amazing. 

>> ARTICLE
Its totally both! Its like the anti-Eva; it subverts heaps of mecha tropes but remains insanely inspiring. 
>> ARTICLE
My third time watching this, and I always love how right from the get go they even put it out in the first episode. "Kick logic out and do the impossible!"  Pretty much this shows entire premise.  Looking forward to watching the rest, came pretty close to just binge watching it again.
>> ARTICLE
First time watchers, you might be thinking "wow, this doesn't make sense" or "how do these mechas work?". But I just want to tell you to stop. Don't think. Just take in the amazing roller coaster of a ride that is this show. 
>> ARTICLE
> stop. Don't think

Yeah I'll probably be applying this mindset for the series going forward haha
>> ARTICLE
ok my first time watching, am gonna give it a try, but on Netflix and dub so there's that..... 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The dub is pretty good but god damn there's something magical about the japanese voice acting for this show. 
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here, this is one of the best first episodes I've seen. I'm hooked, let's just hope I can keep up with the rewatch (I probably won't but we'll see~)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah first time watcher here to and this my third rewatch currently going on haha so I might fall a bit behind too!
>> ARTICLE
Alright, time for the first rewatch thread where I actually participate, rather than just lurk.

Overall, I did not like this first episode when I watched the series for the first time. I stuck it out, because I had heard.... interesting things about the finale. I didn't really like it until episode 7-ish, but now it's one of my favorite shows of all time.

One of the main issues with this show for me was Kamina. Most of the time he's very likable and cool, but I just can't get over how unbelievably stupid he is. Yelling about their surprise attack, and just generally supporting terrible battle strategies always made me dislike the guy a bit. I understand his purpose in the story, and he does that very well, he just doesn't seem like someone I would enjoy being around IRL. He did definitely grow on me as the series went on, though.

All in all, I look forward to seeing what I think of this thing the second time around. This is the show that cemented my love of Mecha, so it should be fun.

In conclusion, **ROW ROW, FIGHT THE POWAH**
>> ARTICLE
no, I'm with you. I actually don't like Kamina nearly as much as some people do, and on my first rewatch I couldn't STAND him. He gets some important development later on that makes his early idiocy more likable in retrospect, but... yeah, dude's a moron. 
>> ARTICLE
GOD DAMN it's so refreshing to see a female lead that doesn't go bat shit crazy when someone "accidentally" touches their oppai!
>> ARTICLE
Heh, I'd be quite proud of my boobs if they saved someone from potentially getting a skull injury. :p

Netflix has both the dubbed and sub version

And it begins, this rewatch will be the one to pierce the heavens!

* Starting out with the op right away, i can dig it.

* I already know this song from a long ass time ago but it is nice to see the animation go along with it.

* Are these stars exploding?

* The shit is happening they are not even trying to start this off slow

* "Burst through the heaves with your drill" the fuck am i getting myself into.

* Why cant they dig like him? Because clearly he is not a human but a mole. They on the other hand are humans normal people. They do not dive out of holes in the walls they made themselves.

* Know what i take that back you are all clearly mole people you live underground in holes. Clearly he is just far better at being a mole person than the rest of you.

* Who the fuck is this i'm too cool for a shirt but i'll wear glasses underground lookin sum bitch. 

* Know what i take that back he is talking about being soul brothers with our little mole protagonist. And he called the bitches from earlier fugly he is alright in my book.

*  Your invincible team Gurren does not seam so sure of themselves. This leads me to believe all of them but our mole protagonist and you will die.

* [What the fuck is happening right now](http://i.imgur.com/MrUGG2q.jpg). 

* Telling someone something does not exist never goes well.

* Our poor mole protagonist who from now on i shall be referring to as M.P for short. is being punished for something he did not even want to be involved in.

* These punk asses just apologized right away like it was nothing.

* Your damn right loyalty does not run deep.

* Awww shit whats that rumbling that can't be good.

* Well that flashback was not foreboding in the least.

* Clearly Kamina knows some shit no one else does.

* Well that's not the least bit depressing M.P.

* Okay i am starting to this that somehow the planet got buried under a metric shit ton of rock/dirt. Forcing people to live underground to survive. And him finding this robot means he is closer to the old world that people from kaminas planet use to hide their shit.

* [The face of pure terror.](http://i.imgur.com/Mo8jV7T.jpg)

* Well this is not gonna end well for a lot of background characters.

* What in the fuck is happening right now.

* Kaminas got a lot of balls this cant end well for him.

* His punk ass sidekicks got it right though he is in fact an idiot.

* Who the fuck is this chick.

* No way in hell that shitty little sniper rifle is hurting that big ass thing.

* Even in the face of death Kamina has to get himself some tail, i can respect that.

* Kamina clearly stooped her from stopping it for a reason.

* What a ugly looking face for a mech.

* Nigga he just joined your team that day and he did not even really join he was forced into it. "That's the way team gurren rolls" my ass.

* And there it is the overused line since it was created.

* It's so tiny.

* NO M.P don't you get sucked into his bs craziness reject his crazy.

* They were just sucked into that tiny little robot.

* Did this stupid thing really just club itself to death.

* nvm now it is eating them.

* OH FUCK worst dentist visit ever,

* where did the niggas shirt go.

* [Yoko and Boota huh.](http://i.imgur.com/jn5y9dI.jpg)

* The fuck are those things.

* Ending is alright.

Well my first impression from episode 1 is what in the fuck am i getting myself into but aside from that was fairly entertaining.

Woo-hoo! Coming off being a newbie during the Code Geass rewatch, I'm excited to get to be a veteran watching the newbs this time around! TTGL is one of my very favorite series of all time.

I also expect to be at odds with several rewatchers yet AGAIN for my character choices, namely for not liking certain ones as much as everyone else does, and liking fandom's most hated targets way more than most people do. But we'll get to that later.

Since I'm not a newbie I'm not gonna do the big episode reactions I did to Code Geass, alas.

Episode 1! It's a fun intro episode, though ultimately TTGL doesn't really kick in for a few more episodes. We're introduced to Kamina, the bro-est village idiot you'll ever meet, and poor meek Simon. Also, Boota. A giant robot with a face falls into the village, they meet a girl with a huge rack and an even bigger gun, and find a tiny robot to destroy it. And then they're on the surface!

Wacky hijinx ensue!!! 

Also, after this you all need to read Double K, aka the best mecha-anime-turned-80s-buddy-cop-comic ever. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy having you around. We definitely didn't agree on Lelouch being a good/bad guy, and I'm sure our thoughts on Kamina might end up differing too. However, it's good to have people who view characters differently than most. I'm looking forward to seeing your thoughts throughout this rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
You too! Neither of us are newbies to this series, it seems, so we could probably also have that discussion right now, but. Let's wait on it, shall we? :P 
>> ARTICLE
Looks like im a bit late but this is like my 5th time watching. But This is actually one of the strongest first episodes in any series I've ever seen.

From the very opening scene, the audience is treated to a glimpse of just how large and awesome the series is going to become. The bond between Kamina and Simon is made clear from the very start.

One of my favourite scenes of the episode has got to be when Kamina looks out for Simon when the earthquake happens. The hug and protective stance that Kamina takes really shows his seriousness in regards to their "brotherhood". Also in the scene before, when he tells Simon that he doesnt mind if he leaves, because he doesnt want to get into trouble.

This episode, also tells another story, this episode is very similar to Plato's Analogy of the cave. The analogy states that a few men are tied down in a cave and can only see the shadows of things that pass in front of the fire behind them that they cannot see. The men believe that the shadows are the real things themselves and cannot fathom it being false. One of these men is freed and sees the surface and discovers the truth, but when he returns none of the other men believe him and think he is delusional, and may turn violent about it. This is obviously reflected in Kamina and his father, who have seen the surface, and the chief is the key representation of the men trapped in the cave who become violent.

I can talk for hours about what I love about the first episode and rave about the music, voice acting, and all that jazz, but Hopefully I'll save that for the rest of the episodes.

What new time watchers should know is that almost every episode contributes to the over all story in either a minor or major way.

Yeart! Time to rewatch this bad ass anime. 

For a very fast paced episode, its remarked well done, we get introduced to the world, the situation, our hero's statues & dreams only to have the rug pulled from beneath us by a invasion of a Giant Robot with a huge face.  

The animation style is pretty unique, allowing the scene to be either dramatic or comical without it breaking the flow & immersion.  

[Kamina's](http://i.imgur.com/TGNk1P3.png) intro is so great, you know he is going to be major factor on the characters.

In the very first episode we have Simon develop from submissive to [Badass.](http://i.imgur.com/FGJMGRv.png)

> Yeart!

I think I know where that phrase came from.

Can't wait to see some great and very entertaining comments from everybody who took part in the Code Geass rewatch!

Oh come on, I just watched the whole thing this week. If I rewatch an episode, I might do it again in 2 days...
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this series for the first time 2 months ago and it was pretty amazing. It's a great anime on it's own, but if you know the other Gainax/Trigger works and see the references in this series. It surely goes to 11. 
That said one has be ready for this show and it is not flawless, but it made it nearly in my top 10, so have fun with it. I'll be looking into these threads from time to time.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't think anything tops the GIANT PIG TOWER for sheer weird in this show. 

And yes, I've seen the whole show and both movies. Everything else is just normal (As normal as you can get with TTGL, at least). GIANT PIG TOWER? Lolwot.
>> ARTICLE
It's still good, but not as good as I remembered. I think TTGL came at the right time and the right place for me as a viewer, and I wonder if it just came at the right time and the right place for the genre as a whole too. I still recommend it, and if anyone in this thread is going through it for the first time, you're in for a treat. But I don't recommend it quite as much as I used too.

Iv'e heard a lot of praise with this anime. I guess I'll watch it since there is a discussion post now! :D

To my peeps from the Spice and Wolf and Code Geass rewatches... hi!

First-timing another series in which I know a few things already.  Watching random episodes on Toonami proved to difficult for me to swallow; hopefully, starting from the start will be more successful.

Welcome to the world of ridiculousness and freaking one-liners! You are in for a great ride people!

Oops I watched the first 2 episodes by accident thinking it was 2 a day.

I love the start to this show, it's great. I'm excited to watch the rest of it.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhhhh this is my first time rewatching the series, and I'm already so excited to watch it all unfold again!

I seriously envy the people that are on the ride for the first time! Fasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen - it's gonna be a wild ride.
>> ARTICLE
Great action, I like the characters and the girl is hot.
>> ARTICLE
As this is my favorite anything of all time, this is a really good first episode. It sets the tone well and gets all the need to know basic information of the characters out without feeling hamfisted. For anyone that this is their first time watching this show welcome, it's an amazing and truly uplifting ride. If the first episode left you with any doubts to whether you should keep watching, believe in the me who believes in Gurren Lagann.

Inspiration: The Anime

Sadly I won't be watching this with you all, I just finished my 2nd rewatch (3 total) last week. And i'm too obsessed with K-On! and Durarara!

I can personally say that I enjoy the dub much more than the sub. It may have some obnoxious voices, but they fit better imo.

I binge watched this anime several years ago so it seems like a nice choice for my first rewatch thread, I'm looking forward to it. 

The first episode is mostly as i remembered it but Yoko "Thunder thighs" VA surprised me for some reason.

First timer here, I put off watching this show for way too long, many of my friends really recommended it to me.

Glad I finally started watching, first episode was really good, can't wait for the next one.

Do you have to post this just after I finished watching the whole series  and the second movies for the first time?, are freaking serious?

Fuck. A healthy dose of Gurren Lagann might be what I need to boost myself up, but I just can't afford to do this!

To start things, off, I would like to share one of, IMO, the greatest AMVs of all time.

**WARNING. IF YOU ARE A FIRST-TIMER, DO NOT WATCH THIS. IT WILL SPOIL PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.**

[Gurren Lagann: Welcome to the Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xNnPmnkNzg)

I figure we can come back to this in 27 episodes and you guys can appreciate it then :)
>> ARTICLE
Dude, holy shit. That was fantastic.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a huge AMV guy by any means, but I can not overstate how great this one is. Really fitting song choice, and the way it adds in the voices during the later parts is just fantastic. After I first watched TTGL ~5 years ago, I found myself watching this AMV many times over.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the best-edited TTGL AMV ever, I'd say that honor goes to the fucking brilliant [Written in the Spirals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aws4P_sQk10) **WHICH ALSO HAS MAJOR SPOILERS, STILL DON'T CLICK IT FIRST-TIMERS** but it just tells the *story* so well. 
>> ARTICLE
That was incredible. You should absolutely post this again in the thread for the final episode.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn right I will. 
>> ARTICLE
It is heartwarming to see the reaction of the first timers, this is my favourite anime and I always watch a bit of it when I feel a bit down to cheer me up.

SF-Debris recently did a review, his main focus is being really snarky about bad Star Trek episodes, he does Anime because the viewers kept nagging him. Since he is pretty alien on anime tropes it is a pretty interesting watch.

http://blip.tv/sf-debris-opinionated-reviews/gurren-lagann-episode-1-review-7180244
>> ARTICLE
A good first Episode should set the tone of the anime, and this one does that easily.

It establishes the main cast, and shows us what we can expect from this series: Over-the-Top excitement, and plenty of laughs.

We see that Simon is a unsure of himself; Almost afraid of what is to come, but with Kamina's encouragement, is eventually able to face it. [Later Spoilers] (/s "This comes into play when he has to go it alone later on")

Kamina is not so much arrogant, but confident. He is willing to face any challenge head on, no matter the danger. He wants to be an inspiration to others, especially Simon, who he sees plenty of potential with. He is also is not one to do everything himself, when he let's Simon pilot Lagaan, even when Simon isn't sure he can

We don't know much about Yoko yet, but we can tell she's experienced with dealing with the Robots. She's a bit tough, but with a kind heart. She also gives us little to the Imagination, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

All in all, this is a good start, and it's the reason I learned to Love this series later on.

I know right? I mean I didn't cry. I just didn't look it up at all because that's not something I could do. Whenever I watch a show with female characters that aren't sexualized there's no way I can fap to that. Same phenomenon with Kurisu from Steins;Gate, among others.

From /u/jbert145
***
It seems like a lot of people dismiss that scene at the beginning of the anime (which confused everyone on their first watch-through of this series) as nothing but a hype-builder, but I think there's something deeper going on there. I believe that this scene is meant to be the "bad ending" that the Anti-Spirals feared. I believe that this scene depicts Simon becoming the Spiral Nemesis, and ultimately destroying the universe.
[Watch the scene again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlQONGWq9KQ) You'll notice that team Dai-Gurren seems to be at war with everybody. There's two quotes in there that grab my attention. The first is "I'll use the fabric of space-time to wring them out of existence"; that absolutely sounds like universe-ending warfare to me. Secondly, there's the use of the phrase "all the lights in the sky are our enemies". 
Compare that to the very last scene of the series (sorry, no video), where Simon says "The lights in the sky are stars. Yeah, they're stars. Stars where our spiral cousins are waiting for us." This is proof that in the show's timeline, team Dai-Gurren averted the Anti-Spirals fears. Rather than consuming the universe in a cataclysmic war, they've made peace with all the life-forms they rescued.
IMO, it's the perfect ending to an amazing series. It's been a fun ride, everyone. I'm glad I got to relive this with you guys.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I **love** this theory but it's way too slick. Doubt this is what Gainax had this in mind. Seems to me they were going for those figures being Simon and Co.'s ancestors but inadvertently left the scene vague enough to where it becomes open to interpretation  (which is fucking awesome but didn't change the creator's actual intent with the scene).
>> ARTICLE
I presumed that it was the ancestors of the gang.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the theory that it was actually Kamina's father in the beginning, centuries earlier. Returned to Earth along with Lord Genome, he went into hiding underground along with his trusty Lagann, sustained into a long life by his mastery of spiral energy, telling his son stories of the great team Dai Gurren that permeated the young boy's subconscious. Thinking Lord Genome had died of old age, he returned to the surface only to discover that things had become more dangerous, and so he died on his way back to try and recover Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
This is a theory that I can imagine the guys at Gainax hearing and going, "Oh, yeah! That's it! That's what we meant all along! Very clever, figuring it out."
>> ARTICLE
Even if it's not what the intended, it's fun to think about
>> ARTICLE
"Yeah, it's not like we had a completely different story in mind in the beginning or anything.  We're just super smart, you know."
>> ARTICLE
Based Gainax/Trigger always knows what they're doing. Just look at Ninja Slayer.

* Love this [look of defiance](http://i.imgur.com/CboI9ij.png)

* [<3](http://i.imgur.com/U8aqIyZ.png)

* I would love an explanation for [this](http://i.imgur.com/n3von4v.png) but its so awesome, I dont even care

* I loved this [entire scene.](http://i.imgur.com/wb1Hn6C.png)

* [THERE IT IS!!](http://i.imgur.com/JuSZjLJ.png) Wooooooo!!

* Look at how pretty [this is](http://i.imgur.com/Wp9mwy7.png). Seeing this and hearing them say that is so great.

* [--is super ripped.](http://i.imgur.com/dNORYnm.png)

* So is there an actual rule to [this](http://i.imgur.com/TrziPME.png)? Like, thoughts can only be given a form if its tangible. Which would mean that thinking about beating him wouldnt work?

* Thats [a galaxy](http://i.imgur.com/WWw932z.png). He was smacked into a galaxy and tipped it over. And then he just jumps onto other galaxies, like theyre platforms

* These are [also galaxies](http://i.imgur.com/44n81cm.png). And the dude just tossed them like Frisbees. So many [destroyed galaxies](http://i.imgur.com/3XnNMKD.png) So many dead creatures

* [NOPE!](http://i.imgur.com/g5e73Y7.png) Never seen it before! We should just ignore it. Really, dont pay any attention to it. I can assure you, it is of no importance

* [This is awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/Vqz5XA0.png)

* There have been some decent contenders, but [this attack name](http://i.imgur.com/AmEiVyy.png) takes the cake

* [These people](http://i.imgur.com/s2hDcPy.png) should definitely be freaking out. But I probably wouldnt even be mad if I could watch something this big with in such a high resolution

* Does he even have [anything else going for him](http://i.imgur.com/TYnP7Pu.png)? Like, this is the extent of his character development?

* [This is really incredible](http://i.imgur.com/DzMOmvV.png). Some of you mentioned that all the characters gave up those other dimensions, and even if they werent reality, some would have been much more comfortable than what theyre dealing with right now. But they gave it up and chose to suffer

* Bitch, [you dont even know.](http://i.imgur.com/6oI5bUt.png)

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/wF9Az9F.png) is exactly how the Beastmen used to think, right?

* He [combined two galaxies](http://i.imgur.com/GartkFq.png). I love that he [gives it a name](http://i.imgur.com/bgmioRw.png). How human of him.

* [There ya go](http://i.imgur.com/jb4fO4T.png). Theres that faith.

* Aaaaaand theres the extended version of the OP. I think its common in anime such as this, but it never fails to get me psyched for whats about to happen and, at the same time, gives me that sense of melancholy knowing that its ending.

* [DRILLS!](http://i.imgur.com/qylRMJP.png)

* The [exact moment](http://i.imgur.com/ViDXUmm.png) I realised theres gonna be a bitter-sweet ending. The [exact moment](http://i.imgur.com/jSB9PNU.png) that Simon realised the same thing. And the [exact moment](http://i.imgur.com/qV9OgPq.png) he accepts it and quickly refocuses, while Im still here like, come on, you dont need to do this!!! Let them be happy!!!!

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/ZhHO4Y1.png) reminds me of The Care Bears Movie. First thing that came to mind. Im sorry its so stupid.

* I lost my shit [here](http://i.imgur.com/xBAM3WZ.png) yesterday. Its so colourful and crazy!!!!

* [Come now](http://i.imgur.com/clAq8rG.png)

* I really like [this quote](http://i.imgur.com/kIJn8au.png). Hes actually [become incredible](http://i.imgur.com/e8ctzPd.png)

* [So cool.](http://i.imgur.com/UzVODyn.png)

* [Oh shit.](http://i.imgur.com/A4qqhhN.png) How pissed are they?? Tell them that they cant prove that our government and the other parties involved are liable for any damages. [Oh](http://i.imgur.com/MAY5Zft.png). Thats good then. Tell them the liabilty thing was a joke

* Despite that awesome fight, were quickly dragged back to thinking about how [these two arent gonna get their happy ending](http://i.imgur.com/8XG53c4.png)

* [This guy!](http://i.imgur.com/QfOGsMx.png)

* [No](http://i.imgur.com/pysjyRc.png). I dont wanna go through this a second time [Nah](http://i.imgur.com/g34z19U.png), come on man. [Dont do this](http://i.imgur.com/boRiWje.png). Guys, [no](http://i.imgur.com/mo9kKp2.png). [Fuck me.](http://i.imgur.com/RZHHv7v.png)

* [UGH](http://i.imgur.com/LcBHWg3.png)

* [:(](http://i.imgur.com/ip9QbGI.png)

* Yeah, Im a lot better today, but [all of this](http://i.imgur.com/PBZYwWV.png) killed me when I watched it yesterday. And you know hes hurting, but he seems to already [be resigned](http://i.imgur.com/nk7jFao.png) to all of this and it honestly just makes it harder to watch

* I think one of my favourite things about this anime is how the characters seem to be constantly [speaking for us](http://i.imgur.com/PAXqLE5.png). Its so self-aware and it doesnt try to brush off any of these questions. And then it gives us answers that I find hard to argue against. Either because its incredibly stupid and nonsensical, or because theres a definitive [truth](http://i.imgur.com/hVYmAmP.png) behind it. Idk. That might just be me

* I dont have anything to say, but I had [this](http://i.imgur.com/dO3CW37.png) paused for a while.

* [Ahhh](http://i.imgur.com/FOLwiru.png), seriously, so damn cool

* [Yup.](http://i.imgur.com/botJpVF.png)

* [Way too awesome](http://i.imgur.com/t4aGW7b.png)

* Im really glad he ended up in [this position](http://i.imgur.com/8BE23Hb.png). And the world doesnt seem to have gone to shit, so a good job overall. Also, Leeron really took care of himself. I bet he moisturised everyday

* [So grown up](http://i.imgur.com/o3NqUPF.png)!! Good for you, pal

* [These two](http://i.imgur.com/q5I4X4r.png) and [Viral](http://i.imgur.com/k2nuF9f.png) became pretty important, huh? (I love Virals hair like that, also)

* [Just](http://i.imgur.com/05dhxPi.png)

* [This kid](http://i.imgur.com/5ZsUJCl.png) has no time to waste listening to you, Simon.

* I have a question about [this](http://i.imgur.com/qk5acce.png). Kittan had it and so did Lordgenome (I think). Is the spiral eye sort of just an indicator that they have a huge amount of Spiral Power? Or is it like theyve reached their peak?? Its something along those lines, yeah?

* [Okay.](http://i.imgur.com/f0aRcWa.png)


Thank you so much guys for reading my write-ups and for all your awesome comments and advice and answers to my dumbass questions. I really appreciated it.

I said in my first write-up that I didnt have any expectations but I kinda thought that I knew what Id be getting at least. It ended up being WAYYYYYY more than anything I couldve come up with. I knew it would be over-the-top, but wow. And I sure as hell wasnt expecting character deaths and I seriously didnt consider that thered be a bitter-sweet ending. 

Speaking of which, when I finished it the day before, it didnt sit right with me, but I feel a lot better now that Ive watched it again and had time to digest it all. Im sometimes not a fan of bitter-sweet endings, but with everything thats happened, I dont mind it here. So yeah, I really, really enjoyed it.

Anyway, thank you all for sticking with these threads and for being so nice and helpful and tolerating my incessant fangirling, and to /u/angel10701 for organising this. Not sure what Ill do with the movies, but Im excited to watch them
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't know, there's also a bunch of little official animations lying around. [You should check them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0uSnAn7o84). Some are awesome. Some are weird. Some are hilarious. It's all pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is quite literally a masterpiece. In terms of everything I give it a solid infinity/10. Also Lordgenome became one of my favourites in this final 5 episodes. Also the story and hidden messages in this anime are enough for one person to write a 10 000 page thesis. 

For anyone interested , Lord Genomes past is depicted in the Parallel Works Episode 8, it's very interesting to see. Even though Simon's future would also be interesting.

>> ARTICLE
Now go watch the 2 movies. The end fight scene is much longer and different.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad you enjoyed this anime and thank you for all your write ups.. It's just allowed me to enjoy this anime in a different way than ever before. Still a best anime for me and glad you loved it too. Also I've never watched the movies so I'll watch those with you.

Yeah, I honestly did enjoy it. And I'm glad that you could, like, relive it again (or something) differently

> Love this look of defiance

That's the one thing that's missing for me from this episode. At the end of 26, it's not just a look of defiance...she musters all her will, strains against the bonds and aims the ring right down the mouth of the Anti-Spiral. 

At the beginning of 27, she just kinda stands there and GL pops out of the ring. Kinda cheapens the moment. 
>> ARTICLE
"There's someone better suited to go through the tunnels I dug" has been ringing around in my head since this first aired some 8 years ago. Well, I think the first sub I saw had something along the lines of "I just dig the tunnels. It's somebody else's job to go through them." but yeah.

It's just so good.
>> ARTICLE
The first sub I watched had every instance of "*who the hell do you think I am?*" replaced with "*who the fuck do you think I am?*"

It made Simon's transition into manhood *way* more bad-assed.

The spiral eyes is when someone just has a crazy amount of spiral power. It could be in a burst (Kittan and Simon during the final fight) or just continual (Lordgenome and Simon at the end). 
>> ARTICLE
>  Is the spiral eye sort of just an indicator that they have a huge amount of Spiral Power? Or is it like theyve reached their peak?? Its something along those lines, yeah?

as i mentioned [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/38fc1c/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_25_26/crurplz), the spiral iris indicates fully realized spiral power.  one of simon's eyes remains normal because he became a spiral sage... keeping his spiral power restrained in order to live his life as a "normal" human *and not bring about the spiral nemesis*, he straddles both worlds.

Maybe I'll feel better by tomorrow then. Hopefully because right now I'm just upset with the ending haha didn't really hit me as bittersweet as some others and is currently just leaving a bad taste in my mouth haha

Yeah, I think that's fair. But I really do hope you'll look back on it without any bitterness or whatever later on

I think right now all I taste is salt haha

Thanks for doing all the write-ups, they were really great to read! I haven't managed to keep up with commenting on the threads, but I've still been reading all the first-time reactions and the posts were really appreciated.

I know what you mean about the exact moment of realisation that the bitter-sweet ending is coming - that burst of static just makes the heart drop when you see it for the first time and catch on to what it may mean.

Glad you enjoyed the show so much!

Generally if OP starts playing during episode it means something big is happening. In any anime.

That's actually a valid reaction.

Not explained, probably caused by using Spiral Power a lot.

"There's someone better suited to go through the tunnels I dug." Great line. I guess he's talking about Rossiu or Gimmy or anyone really. The next generation.

I don't know if it even matters that much, but I wonder why he chose to give the core drill to Gimmy instead of Darry.

Yup! Spiral eyes manifest during a tremendous release of spiral power. Look at your screenshot [here](http://i.imgur.com/kIJn8au.png). Having them persevere/stick around, though, seems to be much rarer. Lordgenome has them in both eyes, but Simon only has one.

Even if Simon's spiral power had "surpassed" Lordgenome (Ep 15), you have to keep in mind that Lordgenome's been spiraling it up for about 1000 years now.

When I watched TTGL some 7 years ago I was super pissed at Nia's ending. It was really hard to digest.

Fast forward to today and that might just be linked with why TTGL ranks so high for me.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think that character deaths equate to a good story, but sometimes I reckon it *is* necessary, and this is one of those times
>> ARTICLE
If it did then all series had to do was kill off characters! :P

In order for it to be positive two things are needed, first that viewers have developed enough empathy with said character and second that they feel like the death made sense. 

Nia's case checks both boxes for me. One can wonder whether an ending with happier emotions would have been better, but considering just how much of it - raw emotion - it got out of me, it's not even on my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it made more sense. Of course though, I would've loved a happy ending
>> ARTICLE
Curious of what you mean by made more sense?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much what Simon and Viral said after she disappeared. She was created by the Anti-Spiral. She wasn't actually human, I think. So I thought that it made sense that the Anti-Spiral being defeated would cause her to disappear. I honestly would have accepted if she lived, but a part of me would've definitely thought that it's odd
>> ARTICLE
K got it. Yeah it made sense to me that way too
>> ARTICLE
> She was created by the Anti-Spiral. She wasn't actually human, I think.

I might be wrong on this, but I think that Nia *was* originally human, at least until the Humanity Annihilation System was activated. At that point her body was transformed from human to Anti-Spiral (as indicated by the glowing, digital lines across her skin).
>> ARTICLE
She might've been. I can't remember if it was ever stated
>> ARTICLE
The "Anti-Spiral Messenger" data was encoded on her DNA from the moment she was born. It only activated once the HAS did.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen any of the big posters mention this anywhere but it's worth noting that Simon was the narrator the whole time, retelling his life story to whoever was listening.

Post-Watch Insert: Why?

Episode 27  Past the Infinite Darkness

* No OP this time. As to be expected.

* What do the Anti-Spirals expect will happen once they exterminate all Spiral lifeforms? Will they just pack it up, devolve into primordial goo? Doesnt seem like much better of a fate than the Spiral Nemesis. At least then you go out with a bang.

* Nia: No matter how deeply you probe my body, you will never understand!

* Anti-Spiral: Your fanservice tactics will have no effect on me. Lack of Spiral Power means lack of sex-drive.

* [Simon:](http://i.imgur.com/QrropMI.jpg) Then you really do live a meaningless existence!

* [Okay, thats a cool fucking shot.](http://i.imgur.com/2OIhb2v.jpg)

* [Damn, Simon is fucking ripped.](http://i.imgur.com/JPhYj2W.jpg)

* [ITS ALMOST AS BIG AS A FUCKING GALAXY!](https://d.maxfile.ro/mydbychosh.mp4)

* [Couldnt get through this series without doing the Complete-The-Sentence thing, could we?](https://d.maxfile.ro/autpprepzv.mp4) Also, full-title namedrop.

* [Ive already made the BioShock Infinite joke, so Moving on.](http://i.imgur.com/gjr87jd.png)

* [Still love the animation on this guy.](http://i.imgur.com/ZVUeVg2.jpg) He looks like hes from an entirely different show.

* I just realized. Even if the rest of them get crushed, Viral will still live on to be the Anti-Spirals witness. Unless, of course, being in this universe gives him back a mortal body.

* [For some reason I dont think a galaxy would behave as a solid object, but I dont know enough about being bigger than a Marvel supervillain to dispute it.](https://d.maxfile.ro/cmjjwlfyau.mp4 )

* [First of all, thats a gigantic fucking homeworld to take up that gunmans entire forehead.](https://d.maxfile.ro/wjdrgqhdwq.mp4) Second, thats a gigantic fucking gun to make such a big hole in the planet's shell. Third, his explanation makes me wonder what the Anti-Spirals used to look like before they let themselves devolve to such a point. Fourth, he just threw two galaxies like they were fucking spinning discs.

* [Oh](https://d.maxfile.ro/zrfbxohtqr.mp4) Well, I guess that answers that question.

* They still havent really explained what power the Anti-Spirals are harnessing if not Spiral Power. If Spiral Power grows from fighting spirit, maybe Anti-Spiral power grows from the spirit to bring despair?

* [For being all locked in a state of suspended animation, the Anti-Spirals sure are emotional.](https://d.maxfile.ro/aktwdlufxz.mp4) On a sidenote, I wonder how many possible lifeforms the Anti-Spiral just crushed to dust with that move.

* [THIS SHIT *DID* INSPIRE INTERSTELLAR!](http://i.imgur.com/ItjgMmG.jpg)

* [Im noticing a distinct lack of ROW, ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH! in this interlude.](https://d.maxfile.ro/bhgscfzrie.mp4)

* [Shes so fucking adorable.](https://d.maxfile.ro/calzvwllxq.mp4)

* For some reason it took me this long to realize that the Black sisters have to learn that their bro died Shit.

* [Channeling Kamina with that battlecry, eh?](https://d.maxfile.ro/chsalvecjo.mp4)

* Simon: Well stop the Spiral Nemesis, too!

* Anti-Spiral: You cant accomplish all that!

* Simon: Motherfucker, do you see where we are?! Were the size of a galaxy yet still managing to fight in clear view of all the Earth! Were the second coming of Jesus up in this bitch!

* [This *is* a Marvel comic book.](https://d.maxfile.ro/xkyprxbjwd.mp4) When does the One-Above-All show up? Hell, Ill settle for the Grand Tribunal.

* [Hey!](https://d.maxfile.ro/dlkjtnscni.mp4) Theres the OP!

* [Wait.](https://d.maxfile.ro/tpxivfjsxh.mp4) No. No. No. No. Nonononononononononononononononononononononono. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Not again. Not another Kamina. No. Not now. Please. No.

* [Im really fucking pumped!](https://d.maxfile.ro/eunmddfvao.mp4) But at the same time Nia, please.

* [He went all Lordgenomey!](http://i.imgur.com/tmZ06gk.jpg) (Yeah, his speech is epic, but if I made WebMs out of everything I might as well just tell you to rewatch the episode. Which you should.)

* [Upon defeat, the Anti-Spiral suddenly gained a fair amount grace.](https://d.maxfile.ro/ahnucfioat.mp4) Oh, yeah, and HOLY MOTHERFUCKING PIECE OF FUCKING DOG SHIT FUCK MY ASS WITH A DRILL AND CALL ME DOSH KING WHAT THE FUCK!!!

* [Great Gatsby reference. Again.](http://i.imgur.com/eBvc2EX.png)

* Lets go home. And please try not to die. Please. Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease. Please.

* [Hey, he can talk.](https://d.maxfile.ro/zkdhrmgumt.mp4)

* [Yoko in a fucking suit and tie.](http://i.imgur.com/U8pwiJC.jpg) Its like Simon asked her to dress modestly for the wedding, so she wore the most inappropriately modest thing she could find.

* I never knew Rossiu was a licensed minister.

* [No.](https://d.maxfile.ro/hzcctidxoe.mp4) No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please no, please no, please no. Why? Why? Just Just fucking why? I thought this series was all about the human spirit conquering everything, so WHY?!!!

* WHY IS SIMON SO OKAY WITH THIS?!!! AT LEAST DO THE ONE-TEAR-DOWN-THE-FACE THING!

* Gimmy: Why not just use the Power of the Spiral?

* Yoko: Sorry, but Simon isnt God, Gimmy.

* Gimmy: And if Ive learned anything Mirai Nikki, its that God cant do shit when it comes to the dead, either.

* At least Yokos still around, but still I dont think anyone wants to get close to Miss Kiss-Of-Death anymore.

* And for as much controversy as this will cause, Kill la Kill is still my favorite anime after all this. Im not saying KlK is a *better* anime, (the ending was nowhere near as fucking over-the-top epic) but at least that show didnt rip my heart out and stomp on it while telling me I should just move on. (Before anyone says anything, Im talking about with the OVA.) Like, I cant even do the thing that I did for Kaminas death with all the funny clips. This is just sad. I know I sound petty; I am, I just Fuck, is it too much to ask for a totally happy ending from Gainax? Yeah, I get. Tragic endings are more meaningful or some bullshit, but I dont care. They worked hard for a happy ending and deserve one. Same reason I dont understand people who think Steins;Gate should have ended at episode 22.

* [Guy doesnt even turn around.](https://d.maxfile.ro/yoiqkrnkzf.mp4) So class.

* Fuck, man. I hate this show for doing this, but I love it for it making sense and showing that you cant always win, but I hate it, but I love it, but I hate it, but I love it, but I hate it, but I

* Post-credits scene. This time with a twenty-year time gap. Of course.

* [I wonder how often that cape needs to be replaced. I hope not as often as those flowers.](http://i.imgur.com/mcggWN2.jpg)

* Aw I was hoping old Simon would be voiced by Kaminas VA.

* [You little bastard, not letting him finish his catchphrase.](https://d.maxfile.ro/gqdfqnswdo.mp4)

* [The most bittersweet end Ive ever seen.](https://d.maxfile.ro/ruemakccdh.mp4) I say that because Angel Beats ending was ham-fisted as all fucking hell.

Well, its over, and I really liked it. Probably not as much as some of you (Im sure my reaction to Nias death is gonna really split people), but it was really, really good. This show is now in my top three.
>> ARTICLE
> They still havent really explained what power the Anti-Spirals are harnessing if not Spiral Power.

Not sure if there's an actual answer, but I always though that since the Anti-Spirals have been around for so long they would have developed an alternative power source that's incredibly powerful.

> And for as much controversy as this will cause, Kill la Kill is still my favorite anime after all this.

Fair enough. We all have our own opinions. Likes and dislikes. At least you still enjoyed TTGL. Top three is pretty good!

Fantastic work as always, /u/The-Sublimer-One. Loved reading your write-ups again.

IIRC, one of the fan theories is that the Anti-Spirals are actually harnessing spiral power by this point, because they couldn't break Simon's spirit. The Anti-Spiral leader goes from a cold, emotional being to one almost as hot-blooded as Simon ("INFINITY BIGBANG STOOOOOOOOOORM"), because no other spiral race had made it that far and they'd practically run out of options to stop Team Gurren.
>> ARTICLE
Your webm's appear to be broke. 
>> ARTICLE
They're working for me.
>> ARTICLE
Well hell. They weren't before but I refreshed and now they do. 

Carry on. 
>> ARTICLE
As for what the Anti-Spiral people are using, I believe it's Spiral Energy.

They advanced so far into Spiral Energy that they were able to make their own Spiral Universe. Shows how much Spiral Energy they have left over.

Kind of like if TTGL takes 10 billion spiral energy to use. The Anti-Spirals have 10 billion to the power of 10 billion spiral energy due to the exponential growth of Spiral power.

The Spiral Energy they use to maintain themselves is a pittance of what they have.

The Death Spiral Machine might also provide Spiral Energy to the Anti-Spiral through stealing Spiral Warrior energy.
>> ARTICLE
Don't sweat it. When I watched this for the first time way back I had the exact same reaction. Everything about the last episode was going absolutely perfect until that moment. I was so mad about it at the time, so "Why, what's the point?!" that although I had loved the series I couldn't think positively about it. It felt like they were asking us to digest way more than we were supposed to.

I'm not saying it necessarily changed this second time around, but I definitely managed to see it in a much better light. Still cried bucktes all the same.
>> ARTICLE
>For being all locked in a state of suspended animation, the Anti-Spirals sure are emotional.   

There is a theory that they are boasting and behaving that way because as Lordgenome said, they are fighting on the same level. Considering Team Dai Gurren gets their power from how badass they are, and their epic speeches, it makes sense in a way that the Anti-Spiral would use that in a truly even fight. 
>> ARTICLE
> Well, its over, and I really liked it. Probably not as much as some of you (Im sure my reaction to Nias death is gonna really split people), but it was really, really good. This show is now in my top three.

I'm sure it's been convered in previous rewatch threads (which I missed all of), but this is one of the earliest shows I can remember really benefiting from the week-to-week hype. Like, it doesn't need it and it stands on it's own as just wonderful, but things like the ending hit both harder, but also are sort of cathartic in a way. All that up and up and the coaster is stopped at the top after the big battle--and then comes the fall. Not to dismiss your views or anything, just responding after reading the thread and watching the finale.

I remember being devastated by it, but also happy because they both knew it all along and yet still thought for and obtained their happiness.

This show. Glad it looks like everybody liked it.

I'm just gonna attach [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg) here. Gainax released a bunch of music videos called Parallel Works, most of which just contain alternate stories. But the one above details Lord Genome's backstory before the start of the series.

Episode 22 is where? I don't mind a side discussion about Steins;Gate.

>Yeah, I get. Tragic endings are more meaningful or some bullshit, but I dont care.

It's not really that. I think this ending was, fitting, I guess? At least it made sense (since she was creation of the Anti Spiral and all that) and wasn't pulled out of a hat. Also I find it funny you are comparing it to KlK, where we lost Senketsu in last episode (though Senketsu probably had much less emotional attachment for most people), and Ryuko took it much worse than Simon at first.
>> ARTICLE
> Episode 22 is where? I don't mind a side discussion about Steins;Gate.

>> ARTICLE
Ah, there. What's interesting is that's basically one of the game endings, which had one ending for each girl (like, you could go with Suzuha when she went into past to search for the IBN, and that would be one of the endings), plus this one, plus the 'true' one. (I'm quite sure at least from what I read. I haven't finished the game myself yet).

As much as this is a 'valid' ending, I also can't understand how someone could say that it would be better if it ended there. The true ending isn't forced, makes sense, and more importantly ties up with the first episode, which I think is brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. I think some people just want to pretend that happy endings are things that can never happen because they aren't "realistic." As if anything in that show was realistic.

You have no idea how hard I cried when that happened.

Yeah , Clannad AS , has its way of making Manly Men , tearing up like small children. It's beautiful isn't it. Gurren Lagann did not make me cry because I actually don't consider this ending to be the worst in terms of sadness. I mean they literally just made the impossible possible the chance they had was like 10^-100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

Absolutely, incredibly enjoyable being on the other end of a rewatch thread. So much fun reading first timer reactions as well as reading/participating in discussion with those who have seen the show before.

We had some awesome first-timers like /u/The-Sublimer-One, ^whom ^I ^have ^to ^mention ^first ^since ^were ^essentially ^best ^bros ^at ^this ^point ^and ^I ^dont ^want ^to ^upset ^him /u/franklyn26,  /u/AmethystItalian, /u/Saikimo, /u/cibino, and anyone else who did write-ups that I didnt mention. Great work! So much fun reading your stuff! Truly.

A round of applause for /u/FiestaJose for providing us with a whole slew of **Heaven Piercing Music and Facts.** Learned a bunch of new stuff, and obviously the TTGL soundtrack is fantastic.

Also thanks to /u/EditorialComplex for being an all around joy during another rewatch. Keeping people from posting spoilers/teasing first timers, suggesting holding off on the pics/gifs during the first watch of the last few episodes, among other things. Nice work.

And of course, our glorious host, /u/angel10701. Youre magnificent for putting two rewatches together, back to back. They were both a blast.

I feel so weird praising everyone like Im starting off some grand speech.

And now, to the reason weve all gathered here today to discuss the manliest and most awesome of anime TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN!

Whatever. You all deserve it. Wonderful job.

Boy do I want to do another first time rewatch again. Soon. Soon.

And I had another thing I wanted to post, but Ill save it for after the movie rewatches since I believe it will contain spoilers for them. Until then!

**edit**

Here is a [permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/38y4zl/spoilers_gurren_lagann_the_movie_the_lights_in/crzobv6) to my comment in the second movie thread. **Beware of movie spoilers.** This is the other thing I wanted to post that I talked about above. Figure it'd get more exposure here.

It's nice to be recognized, back when I first had this idea I wasn't expecting it to be this fun for me and others.

Think of it like this too... anyone in the future who comes to /r/anime looking for episode discussions of TTGL will get a bunch of facts and music thanks to you.

That makes me really happy c:

It's not likely but then again I don't dictate what people do on the internet.

Eh, it's pretty likely people will search for it. Maybe not a lot, but a good bunch.

When I finish a series I like to go read discussion threads to see what others thought, but sometimes older shows (pre-Reddit being popular) don't have threads. These rewatch threads create them. So now TTGL has them, and it's popular enough of a show that some people will be coming here in the future to see what we all had to say.

The first, not so much. The second I highly recommend for extended ending.

i don't personally recommend the first movie.  it cuts out a lot in order to get to where it needs to end up and it ends up being mostly a mess.

Is it just more fighting? Or like anything important?

It's more fighting, and generally the 'fanservice' type fighting, as in 'everyone contributes' and such. I think they overdid it, the normal final battle was over-the-top just enough, the movie, well..

There is some extra dialogue and altered scenes, but you really don't want to miss the big finale, which is extended by quite a bit. There's enough added/changed in the second movie to make it definitely worth a watch IMO. It can't replace the actual series, but its a great add-on for fans.

[I'M LITERALLY DESCRIBING THE FINAL BATTLE OF THE SECOND MOVIE SO DON'T LOOK AT THIS FOR A SECOND UNLESS YOU WANNA BE SPOILED](/s "Only Kittan dies in the 2nd movie instead of the other members of Team Dai-Gurren so in the final battle they're present. After nearly being defeated by the Anti-Spirals, everyone gets their own Tengen Toppa Gunmen. Then they all combine to form Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a giant mech roughly 52.8 BILLION light years tall and dwarfs Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Then the Anti-Spiral gets its own mech the size of STTGL. Then you see Simon, Yoko, and Nia naked for their lines right before their ultimate, finishing attack; the Super Tengen Toppa Giga Drill Break. The amount of sheer hype this 15+ minute addition to the battle is indescribable. If you want to see just STTGL's appearance then go to YouTube and search "Lagann hen final battle" and it should be the 7-8 minute video.") That's not the only thing they changed in the movies but it's definitely the biggest thing they changed.

I would say this is the end but we've still got movies to watch! The movies are the reason this is my favorite anime, everything is just done so well. Look forward to seeing those!. That final battle, this is where you've probably heard people talking about "giant mechs tossing galaxies" and such. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!

- Just one episode today, today's **"Song of the Episode"** is ["BafBaf! Do You Like... Burning with Such Passion"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72VFBnkKaM8). One of my personal favorites I adore this song for it's great build up then awesome second half.

- Because we've reached the end of the anime, here is the full OP, [Sorairo Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRUKalbx3s).

- I didn't cover the full OST during this rewatch but you should definitely check it out right [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCED253BDA371CF5D).

I've got another AMV to showcase!

- Something extra I wanted to show you guys is this kick ass AMV,["Welcome to the Black Parade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xNnPmnkNzg). This AMV is **AMAZING** and I hope you guys watch and enjoy it as much as I did.

- You should also check out [Yoko S.t.a.r.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O0okV1mu4Y). Fun little AMV made by Gainax starring our Buxom Sniper.

First, I've got some quick facts about the final battle and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann itself.

- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 10 million light years tall.

- Theoretically, the battle between Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and the Granzeboma lasted several *billion* years.

- One theory against the final battle being really slow in perspective is that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was teleporting parts of its body around to block and attack. This is backed up by the fact that instant teleportation is possible according to the story.

- When you think about it, all the pilots of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann are *light years* apart from each other, just let that sink in.

- The pocket dimension they fought in was empty of life so no worries about Team Dai-Gurren slaughtering billions.

- Theoretically, the people observing the battle on Earth would have been permanently blinded from the amount of visible light released.

- Gurren Lagann likes to defy the law of conservation of energy, but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann should theoretically have a ginormous gravitational pull.

That's enough of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, how about an unrelated fact?

- **"GaoGaiGar is really littered throughout this anime"**: The [necklace Gimmy was wearing](http://i.imgur.com/gZYbD4j.jpg) at the end, before the credits, is one of the [keys to the Goldion Crusher that Koutarou Taiga wears](http://i.imgur.com/JlbUJpA.jpg) in GaoGaiGar FINAL.

Fun little extra I wanted to show off.

- This is a funny animated comic that the cast of Gurren Lagann actually voice acted live, called [Viral's Sweet Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Myq0y9Fl2A), it's hilarious and I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** you watch it, it's only 5 minutes so it's not a waste of time.

Something you should watch if you wanna get hyped for the movie are the Gurren Lagann Parallel Works. They're like official AMVs made by Gainax to promote the movie. They're like videos of alternate universes of Gurren Lagann set to songs from the OST. [Here's the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0uSnAn7o84) set to "Rap is a Man's Soul" if you want to get a small taste. Some of them aren't on YouTube if you wanna watch all of them. Though I think if you look you can find them easily.

It's been really fun, I'm a heartless bastard so I don't cry often but I shed tears here every time. **MOVIE HYPE**, if you guys liked the anime then you'll love the movie. Fair warning, the movies are compilations of the anime with small bits changed, redone, and added. Some people don't bother with the movies because "I've already seen the anime", it's my opinion that you **MUST** watch the movie, it's legendary. I'll see you all in 2 days for the first movie, Childhood's End! See you guys then for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!

[Stitches](http://imgur.com/a/Pc9AW)!

I really can't even put into words what I loved so much about this series. This was the series that got me into anime. Because I watched this, I ended up watching Kill la Kill as the first anime I've ever watched as it aired, and everything just went from there. It may be cliched by now, but it just came at a time in my life when I was incredibly depressed, and just really kicked my ass into gear and not give up. For those of you doing your first time watch, cheers, i hope it was impactful for you as it was for me.

**Episode 27: In which we get the best Theme Music Power-Up of all time**

And here's the end of our magnificent road, folks. Hey, remember when certain people joked that Lagann would eventually combine with a mech the size of Hawaii? Yeah, I'd think TTGL ends up doing that one better. 

"Where does the final battle of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann take place?" "The universe." "Can you be more specific?" "...no, not really."

Everything about this episode is just magnificent, I actually don't have too much to say about it. Hey /u/franklyn26, remember back in the [Episode 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/36jh82/_/) thread where I promised you that Kamina's "'Who The Hell Do You Think I Am' Kick" wasn't the most absurd attack name in the series? That honor clearly goes to Dayakka's "'My Wife Is The Best In The Universe' Swing," and yet it's awesome. It's so awesome. (Also, notice that what triggered it was Anne crying - don't mess with a guy's baby girl even across the universe.)

So, remember a [few episodes back](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/389xmn/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_23_24/crtibgt), when I talked about how Rossiu's biggest character flaw was his lack of faith when he couldn't measure something himself? One of my favorite moments in all of TTGL, and it's such a tiny throwaway line, is when the Anti-Spiral is using the Infinity Big Bang Storm. Team Gurren is facing the energy of creation, something more powerful than they can imagine. They've never faced a foe like this. And Rossiu, logical Rossiu, data-driven Rossiu, realist Rossiu, reacts thusly:

"It's bad, but they won't lose to something like this!"

The Doubting Thomas has faith again. Cue "Sorairo Days."

Of course, the other thing of note is the odd note of melancholy that the series ends on. Even after ripping the heavens apart to save Nia, she fades from existence (word of god says she desperately held on until the wedding with all of her willpower). They've lost so much. And Simon leaves. Tonally, it feels totally at odds with whatever's come before it.

But remember Simon's line in his fight against the Anti-Spiral. Every second, the drill of humanity turns further, digging deeper than it had been a moment before. We evolve, but part of that will always be passing the torch. Kamina inspired a rebellion, but Simon had to see it through. And Simon too must move on someday. Generation by generation, humanity exceeds itself.

Go back to the very beginning of Episode 1, to the future that could've been. "So, all the lights in the heavens are our enemy, eh?"

No. 

All the lights in the sky are stars.

Thanks for making this journey with us, everyone. I hope you've liked the ride.

I completely agree with you there. Easily the best one

> "It's bad, but they won't lose to something like this!"

This line made me smile so much

> Thanks for making this journey with us, everyone. I hope you've liked the ride.

It was definitely fun :)

#PSA: NEW VIEWERS

No, just joking, there's nothing you need to be aware of since we're done with the series! 

But now that you've finished, you can now properly appreciate something [I linked back in Episode 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/36eujs/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_1/crdco5i), one of the greatest AMVs ever made:

[Gurren Lagann: Welcome to the Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xNnPmnkNzg)

It does a magnificent job of summing up the entire TTGL adventure, along with a stellar song choice. Another truly stellar Gurren Lagann AMV is the award-winning [Written in the Spirals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aws4P_sQk10) which *does use footage from the movies* so be aware! It's not like they change the story much, but if you want to be completely unspoiled by the movie's take on things, hold off on this for a few more days. 
>> ARTICLE
>sometimes I feel he's watching over me

>Your memory will carry on

Holy crap that was literally perfect.  TTGL's a show about moving on, not changing the past, and finding yourself.  I always knew that, but that AMV made it that much realer for me.

As TTGL is my favorite show, God bless you.

Edit: and I've already seen "Written in the Spirals." "We were all that kid no one cared about, just keep screaming 'till they hear you out." Perfect, too.

That AMV was brilliant, really captured the spirit of the series and even made me tear up a bit.

So Ive tossed around in my mind how I wanted to do this writeup - namely, what I wanted to focus on, or what point I wanted to prove, or any number of different factors. But what its boiled down to is that theres really no point I can argue about the show that hasnt already been covered ad-nauseum. I mean, the show is coming up rapidly on 10 years old, and its popular enough that its been discussed that entire time, time and time again, and I honestly think any sort of truly critical opinion I could come up with in regards to the show would fall short, and the last thing I want to do is write up something thats a disservice to this show, because it really is my favorite series, without a doubt.

As a result, I decided to give my highly biased and completely subjective opinion of the show and what makes it as great as it is, because ultimately theres no way Ill ever be able to keep emotion out of discussions of this show. I think thats why I largely avoid discussing it unless its in a positive light, because I have too much tied up in this masterwork to avoid being personally offended when someone speaks about it negatively. I cant even listen to the soundtrack without tearing up, and that usually doesnt lend itself well to rational thought and argumentation. But Gurren Lagann isnt about rational thought, so I suppose thats okay.

---

Gurren Lagann is, without a doubt, a thing of beauty. And I think thats what struck me most about it, is that is completely exceeded my opinions but in a completely different way than I had expected. I walked into this show initially expecting an over-the-top, explosion filled manly-man type anime with a relatively meaningless plot and shallow characters. And while I did get an over-the-top, explosion filled show, thats where my expectations diverged from the reality of the show. What I got instead was a heavily character driven story that provided one amazing line after another, that never took itself too seriously, but in the process managed to produce something more heartfelt and meaningful than the majority of other stories Ive come across. And it shocked me, more than I care to admit. Not only had I not gotten what I expected, I had gotten what was more or less the polar opposite, and the cognitive dissonance it created was more than enough to make me sit back at a point or two and just think about the show, which I had never really done before. Another first was just *how much* I cried watching this show. Before Gurren Lagann came along, I wasnt much of a crier when it came to stories. Movies, books, television, anime, you name it, I could appreciate the sadness, and even feel saddened - but I never cried. Maybe I just happened to mature a little bit as I started watching TTGL and it wasnt more than a coincidence, but Id like to believe otherwise. I had even thought that I wouldnt cry going into the show. I had been spoiled on Kaminas death, and even the fact that it happened in episode 8, and damned if I didnt try to distance myself emotionally from the character. But it didnt do me any good. I still cried. And I cried when the show ended - at Kittans goodbye to Yoko, at his death, at the deaths of the crews and Nias disappearance. In fact, the last four episodes for me werent much more than two hours of crying and yelling, and they still hold that weight. But maybe its because Gurren Lagann isnt truly *sad* that it affected me so much. Ill admit, Im a sucker for happy endings, and all things considered, thats what I got. Melancholy, yes, but not outright tragic.

The characters are another standout element of what makes this show so downright beautiful, too. Every single moment of this show is designed to get you more invested in the characters, and it works. But it never feels cheap. Not once did I ever feel like I was being manipulated into feeling for the characters - I always *chose* to care for them, to be invested in them. And the result is a much more human story than anything that relies on emotional manipulation to generate weight. It leaves a lasting impression too - like I mentioned above, I find myself getting emotional about the show to this day. Even Kamina, the shows flagship loudmouth, has a shocking amount of depth to him. I think he surprised me the most, really.

And its this small-scale beauty that really makes Gurren Lagann stand out. This is a show that has mechs 10 million light years tall throwing galaxies at each other, yet it never forgets to focus on the little things. It always places emphasis on the interactions of the characters and their relationships, and it results in a lot of incredibly charming moments. I dont think anything exemplifies this better than the Extradimensional Labyrinth sequence and the final episode. In the Extradimensional Labyrinth sequence, theres so much that could have been left out and it wouldnt have really affected the storyline at all. But instead we get Simon and Kaminas heartfelt exchange, Yokos quiet and melancholy moment with Kamina, and Virals dream. All things that further serve to reinforce the characters and how we feel about them, right before the final battle. Sure, they could have rushed into the final fight but instead they took the time to slow down and focus on the characters, and its a beautiful thing. Or in the final episode, with Simon and Nias wedding, and his quiet acceptance of her disappearance. All of these moments could have been excluded or significantly reduced in their impact, but the show takes the time to let them run to their fullest potential. It creates an atmosphere of caring - that the creators cared about the show and the characters, that the characters care about each other, and it reinforces how you care about the characters. Its spectacular.

As a final little note, Id like to add that the music, specifically the BGM, is absolutely stellar. The OP and EDs, and the insert songs are all great, but the emotional impact that [With Your xxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfPKwxflDeg) carries is ridiculous. Ive never come across any show that I can hear nearly any OST piece from and immediately recognize it (maybe with the exception of Mushishi, but thats an odd beast better left for another day).

Gurren Lagann is beautiful. Yes, its action-packed and ridiculous, and those elements are nearly perfectly executed, and they lend so much to the show. But the little things, the character interactions and small moments, the writing and how heartfelt the whole thing is - thats what really makes it beautiful. Its inspiring, and melancholic, and it makes you want to sit and think and jump up and down at the same time. Theres nothing else like it, and I wouldnt want it any other way. It is with no small amount of weight that I say that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is my favorite anime series. And I honestly dont expect that to change any time soon.

Dont be held back by someone elses bullshit in fake memories. The one path youve chosen for yourself - thats the truth of your universe.

Looking back at the relationship between Simon and Kamina, I realised what they were doing. And you're right, it works and it's incredibly fitting

This was one of the most heart-breaking things in the anime, but the entire sequence was also probably my favourite part

so for all of you who aren't quite ready to be done and finished with the glory that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, here are some links that i have collected during my long fanination of the show.

[this blogger](http://wtf.animeblogger.net/?p=140) has a fairly detailed analysis of the show, touching on its major themes as well as the individual arcs as homages to the various eras of mecha anime.

if you're a fan of AMVs, [Written in the Spirals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQRiwKlMy4U) by Shin is pretty much the quintessential TTGL amv.  [animemusicvideos.org](http://www.animemusicvideos.org/search/supersearch.php?anime_criteria=gurren+lagann&artist_criteria=&song_criteria=&member_criteria=&studio_criteria=&spread=less&title=&comments=&download=&con=&year=&format_id=&o=7&d=1&recent=on&go=go#results) has close to a thousand AMVs of varying quality that feature it in part or exclusively.

as well, there is a great fan-remake of the trailer for "[mass effect](https://youtu.be/NzD2oIsdT18)"; as well as a great fan-remake of the trailer for "[300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V2XK3o3Tmc)".

I'm always sad when a TTGL rewatch ends, and this one even more so as I'll really miss all the reactions and discussion from you awesome people. The only thing better than watching a great show is discussing it with other people who enjoy it. I may not have been able to write a post for every episode, but I definitely tried to read as much of your guys' stuff every day for the last couple of weeks.Keep on being amazing people, I love all of you.


So this episode we get the big final battle on a crazy big scale, and then follow up with one of the most heartbreaking ending scenes in anime :(. I always tell myself that Simon was right not to abuse spiral power to save Nia, but damn it doesn't really hurt any less. Overall, I think its a really great ending though, as Simon makes the decision to put himself in a sort-of self imposed exile in order for the upcoming generation and "those better suited" to lead humanity into the future. His fight is over, and he knows this. Still, it wasn't exactly the happy ending I had in mind the first time I watched TTGL.


Alright, now its time for me to try to sum up this goddamn masterpiece of a show. TTGL is a show that really caught me off guard at first. I originally came into it for the hot-blooded action and over-the-top mecha battles, and the show does a really good job in that aspect. However, I wasn't ready for it to have some of the most well-written and well-developed characters I've ever seen, nor was I ready for the emotional rollercoasters I would go on throughout the show. With each rewatch I find myself appreciating the characters more and more, and tend to catch some subtle things I never really noticed before. 


TTGL is a show about fighting spirit and belief in yourself, love and loss, sacrifice, family, trust, friendship, leadership, and self-identity. I could go on and on about all of these things and more, but at the end of the day it all boils down to TTGL being one of the most amazing and diverse experiences in anime (definitely my personal favorite show of all time) that I find myself coming back to again and again. I really hope all the new viewers really enjoyed it, and that you continue to rewatch it in the future. I guarantee you'll apreciate it even more with each rewatch.


Finally, I'm gonna leave you guys with my favorite TTGL amv, by one of my favorite editors. THERE ARE BIG MOVIE SPOILERS in this video though, so if you're a first-timer whos going to watch the movies, I reccomend staying away for now. I'll post the video again in the second movie discussion. [Written in the Spirals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQRiwKlMy4U) by ShinAMV

I'll say it, this episode sealed the deal on Gurren Lagann being a 10/10 for me. 

From what I heard of it being an over-the-top mecha action porn anime, this ended up being a fucking profound show. The bold steps they took with the plot, the staggering climax to that bittersweet ending the show really made me think about how far along the main cast has come since episode 1.

Since no one is going to see this anyways, the end of this episode brings me to manly tears EVERY GOD DAMN TIME. Nia dying breaks my heart. Poor Nia. Poor Simon. God damn I'm tearing up at the thought.

I havent posted any top-level comments in these rewatch threads until this point, since I wanted to let the first-time watchers do that. However, after finishing this rewatch (my second time through the series) there are a few things I want to say about this show, and why is occupies a very unique place in my heart. 

My first watch-through of TTGL was only about 2 months ago, towards the end of my last semester of college. I watched the first 8 episodes over the course of 2 or 3 days, then binge watched the rest of the show in a single sitting. The moment I finished the final episode, I knew TTGL was one of my favorite shows of all time. I remember getting up off the couch and remarking to my roommate something along the lines of thats the first time I a show has made me feel the need to reevaluate my life. I was a little worried that this rewatch was a little soon after my first watch, and that Id get burned out or bored with the show, but my fears were completely unjustified.

TTGL is definitely a flawed show. It has a few pacing issues, some attempts at humor at inappropriate times, and occasional animation issues (I'm looking at you, episode 4). That being said, for the most part it is a technically very good show. The animation mostly ranges between solid and amazing (especially in the last few episodes), the fights are fun to watch, and the music is FANTASTIC, but none of these things are why I love the show. Gurren Lagann is, to me at least, much more than the sum of these parts. To me, TTGL manages to really, truly capture the human soul. Not so much the flaws and struggles that other highly praised pieces of media tend to focus on, but the very base human instinct to achieve, to shoot as high as possible and pierce the heavens. It's a monumentally optimistic show; the characters quite literally will their way into saving the universe, and mistakes as well as moments of weakness (see: Rossiu's coup) are redeemed by fighting spirit and the power of friendship.

Gurren Lagann stands out as unique in my mind because of this simplistic but incredibly genuine message. Even writing about these themes seems kind of cheesy, but this show pulls it off without even a hint of this. The huge, emotion-powered mechs, the dramatic speeches, the absolutely impossible physics, all are presented with a feeling of sincerity, as if the creators never questioned it and neither should you. I think that it's because of this that TTGL can say "fuck the universe, will your way to success" and it's inspiring rather than eye roll-inducing. 

Anyways, there's my thoughts on the show. I hope all the first time watchers enjoyed this as much as I did.

Forgot that the finale skipped the op, recapped the last episode's ending and then launched into *Libera Me From Hell* immediately.

Chills.



So, this was the rewatch, then. Had fun again.

Viral best anime char ever.

> Forgot that the finale skipped the op

I was waiting for it since I really enjoyed listening to it each time so far and was sad when it didn't play...until they played it and then it was full on gooseumps :p

Ugh, that moment after Rossiu's line when the guitars kick in and you realize what you're about to hear and you're just like

YES

FUCK YES

THIS IS AWESOME
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so I started watching TTGL with this rewatch, got stuck after episode 7 and then proceeded to watch episodes 8 through 27 in one sitting last tuesday, so I can't really say I really participated in this rewatch.

That being said, this show was one of the most enjoyable things I have watched thus far, and that after the credits scene in this episode was literally all I wanted from this show. Easy as fuck 10/10 for me, really happy that this rewatch gave me an incentive to start watching the show because otherwise I might have never gotten around to starting it.

I'll say it again, the after the credits scene was the best way to wrap up the series for me, I'm extremely happy that it was put in.
>> ARTICLE
And thus it ends. Anyone who hasn't seen the movies, I would very much recommend watching them, especially Lagann-hen.

Also, here is an awesome work done by /u/Zashuiba which puts Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann surronded by the twisted helices of the dreams of the fallen and the hopes of those who'll follow. http://imgur.com/WYIvoxF

Finally, I can post [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee-JiCedC_4)

Also this fight was the final stage in the game Super Robot Taisen Z3 Jigoku-hen. Spiral power made every unit the size of a universe (even Bonta-kun) and the true final boss was the Anti-Spiral's final form from Lagann-hen.

**Finale**

Now that's an entrance! 

27 episodes to get to the title haha nicely done

Lordgenome is actually pretty cool haha didn't think I'd end up liking him!

Throwing galaxies lol 

Best attack ever, got a bit teary when he said it. Best wife haha too cute :3

Hearing that OP...27 episodes and I never skipped it once, fantastic blend! Was hoping they would do that

As soon as I go and like you Lordgenome :( who's going to give Nia away now (Yep that's the first thing that popped in my head :p) Coco can do it!!

Not usually a fan of fight scenes but that one was a pretty memorable one

Yes they're getting married! :3

What...no...no...no...what is this...

Not fair...

No need for that at all

**Gahhhhh**

Didn't even get to tear up cause it just happened *poof*

This post credits scene better be something amazing...

Nope...still argh

I love time skip endings but that didn't really do too much for me

**Final Thoughts**

Well that was one crazy ride, it is what I thought a total guy anime but that doesn't mean it's bad. I enjoyed my time for most of it even though so many characters died :/

The pacing was phenomenal, the way they're always moving forward but never feels rushed is great. Never felt slow at all.

Was going to give it an 7.5 and bump it up to an 8 but after that ending I want to knock it down to a 7. It's better then that so it'll stay an **8/10**. 

Leaving a bad taste in my mouth though, happy the Hyouka rewatch ends today also, going to watch that to feel better haha

Thanks for the rewatch thread and the discussions everyone. Spoilers were around but no avoiding that I suppose.

Would not have watched this without this thread so thanks :)^^^^STILLMADABOUTTHEENDING


> One of the best endings. Period.

No.

> Lordgenome is actually pretty cool haha didn't think I'd end up liking him!

I loved Lordgenome this ep. He was finally back in his element. He had to play the bad guy in order to save humanity, but screw that. Team Dai-Gurren came this far, might as well go all out and fight like he used to. Lordgenome's a pretty cool badass.

> Best attack ever, got a bit teary when he said it. Best wife haha too cute :3

All other wives on Earth were insanely jealous in that moment.

When you say you didn't like the ending, were you talking about pre or post time skip? Or both scenes? I'm just curious as to what exactly you didn't like. I didn't think it was the greatest ending ever, but still thought it was good.

And again, nice work on the write-ups! Fun to read.
>> ARTICLE
> When you say you didn't like the ending, were you talking about pre or post time skip? Or both scenes? 

The pre time skip ending was so bad for me it pretty much ruined the fun of the post time skip. I **LOVE** post time skip epilogues, I think every anime should get one but I was just still upset about how they ended things before that. Characters died in this series and I was sad to see them go, even Lordgenome haha, but Nia's death just felt so out of nowhere and not needed. Kamina's death had purpose, so did those who died sacrificing themselves but Nia's? Geh. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth then a sad one would have.


>> ARTICLE
I agree with you about Nia's death. It was hinted at, just barely, but it did feel out of nowhere. I guess technically there was no way she could've lived though.

I would've loved to have both her and Simon traveling the world together post time skip. Just going wherever they want and helping people out along the way.
>> ARTICLE
> . It was hinted at, just barely, but it did feel out of nowhere. I guess technically there was no way she could've lived though.

No way?! This show had so many no way situations where it looked like they couldn't do anything and they found a way. "Oh Nia has to die I guess there's nothing we can do about it" urrgh it's frustrating 

> I would've loved to have both her and Simon traveling the world together post time skip. Just going wherever they want and helping people out along the way.

> No way?! This show had so many no way situations where it looked like they couldn't do anything and they found a way. "Oh Nia has to die I guess there's nothing we can do about it" urrgh it's frustrating

One of the main themes of this show is to never look back and never regret, don't fall prey to idolizing the past and instead move forward one step at a time to create the future. They acknowledge that with the Anti-Spiral gone, they might even have the power to bring back the dead. However they prefer to focus on pushing forward and working to avoid the spiral nemesis instead. That's why they didn't fall prey to the alternate dimension in ep 26 and that's why they won't bring back the dead. 

It's not necessarily the best explanation, and surely an exception could have been made in this case. But the ending does fit in with the overall theme. 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to say i enjoy reading everyone else's thoughts on the show as well as the show itself.



Episode 27:

	Just getting right into the final ep not even an opening.

	Well I am glad Nia is back but I dont know how she will function in that body.

	Nvm.

	Simon to the rescue.

	 [Does anyone wanna try and explain why having drills for a lower half would help anything?]( http://i.imgur.com/YHCBe5d.jpg)

	Also on a side note where is this wind that is blowing all of their hair in this crystal like room.

	[Oh okay no that looks pretty cool.]( http://i.imgur.com/HJFGgHK.jpg)

	[At this point Ive just stopped asking. At one point I thought I knew but clearly I was wrong.]( http://i.imgur.com/iz0iKud.jpg)

	[No really? I had no idea.]( http://i.imgur.com/HfD3RJn.png)

	[I am happy you are alive again because I always liked you. But I am also sad Kamina is not also with you.]( http://i.imgur.com/K9s7oLv.jpg)

	[It makes slicing noises when it walks I cant not love it.]( http://i.imgur.com/8OI1cpl.jpg)

	I dont know who this anti god is but I like him.

	  [Yoko must be just so happy to have a giant one of these.]( http://i.imgur.com/wvIuxNk.jpg)

	[WHY MUST YOU RUIN EVERYTHING?]( http://i.imgur.com/psyEmR9.jpg)

	Nigga you cant talk about how they will destroy the universe and then go and throw fucking galaxys at them like throwing stars.

	This fight scene is pretty fun to watch.

	Oh hey look earth.

	KEEP YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF EARTH.

	[Just a thing of nightmares.]( http://i.imgur.com/akqi2JO.jpg)

	[How to score some brownie points when you are not sure your wife can hear you but you think she can.]( http://i.imgur.com/06OrUqP.jpg)

	[No they are going to start making balloon animals for you. OF FUCKING COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO HIT YOU WITH IT!]( http://i.imgur.com/7gD7sRf.jpg)

	Aw shit the music started shits about to go down.

	Lordgnome as always such a badass.

	[What is her body dying or something?]( http://i.imgur.com/LY2IrHL.jpg) 

	Welp looks like Simon will die without having children with Nia.

	Nigga just turned himself into a drill to be eaten, respect.

	There is gonna be some pretty shitty meteorites coming at these galaxys/earth pretty soon.

	Honestly I dont think even Kamina would have gone this far.

	Ill be honest its a nice speech Simon is giving right now I really enjoy the animation thats going with it.

	Why they keep thinking they can pin him down is beyond me the nigga has got like 6 mechs inside of just 1.

	[We are pretty stupid id be rather afraid if we had control of the whole universe. While it would solve a lot of problems I think it just create more.]( http://i.imgur.com/KyVan3N.jpg)

	[OH SHIT HE SPOKE!]( http://i.imgur.com/8GK7nLN.jpg)

	And shes gone.

	 [No, no I am pretty sure he is]( http://i.imgur.com/f8Ygc6N.jpg)

	I am with Gimmy on this one you could easily do it.

	Everyone is all grown up now.

	Old man Simon with a drill staff.

	Aww ya Master is still with him.



It was a good ending but really it just left me with a lot more questions mainly about the spiral race. Since Lordgnome lived for so long does this not mean so could the rest of them? And what about the other spiral races how did they get in contact after the anti were killed?

>> ARTICLE
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg) should answer some of your questions about Lord Genome. It's a music video released by Gainax that details some of his backstory. 

[Spoilers](/s "He was initially human. Nia wasn't.")
>> ARTICLE
I know a lot of the new viewers are unhappy with the bitter sweet ending but I loved it and thought it fit thematically. A lot of people might think that the show is simply saying you can do anything with enough motivation or effort but I think another major point it makes is that everything worth having requires sacrifice. Almost every major development, every victory, every step that Team Gurren makes towards its goal is fueled by a heroic sacrifice. The ending is bitter sweet but it shouldn't come as a surprise. It's a very fitting end to a great show. 

As a side note the way the theme kicks in right as Rossiu says something along the lines of "it'll take more than that to beat them" is probably my favorite use of music in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Here is the song played during the wedding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CAhROR6JLM
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to take this moment to reflect on what a solid theme TTGL had. It's probably the strongest I've seen out of literally any medium.

The entire spiral motif expressed through drills, from spiral galaxies all the way down to double helix DNA, the cyclical nature of the spiral warriors struggle, the prevailing concept of exponential growth. It's shows up in wardrobes, hairstyles, effects, repeated throughout the entire show in practically every single scene.

I seriously challenge anyone to find any piece of work with a more unifying theme.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember right, Lordgenome only used his arms to

1) Fist fight Lagann

2) Hold back an attack with power equivalent to the Big Bang


>> ARTICLE
I joined this rewatch because TTGL is one of my three 10s, but having watched it a long time ago I wanted to make sure that opinion was up to date.

Nevermind that. If it was a 10 before it's an 11 now. Absolutely stunning, the last 3 episodes are the best any-three-episodes I've ever seen, and sometimes it was just hard to see what was going on since my eyes got so blurry.

Today TTGL was cemented as my favourite anime of all time. Incredible sountrack, animation, pacing, story and most of all characters. Kamina is so well delivered, he really *is* TTGL. And to top it off, although the show focused on the epic side of things above everything else, it still pulled more emotion from me than anything else.

Thanks a bunch to /u/angel10701 for putting this together, and to everyone else for sharing their thoughts every day. Forever a bittersweet ending.

(It was probably mentioned by someone somewhere but)

Fun fact: Virals VA also is the voice of Link from The Legend of Zelda Ocarine of Time

Compare [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0qMNe34ZaM&t=2m20s) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLtLbiQBe8s&t=1m23s)

[This is the guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuyuki_Hiyama)

I remember, when I first saw this short scream in the dream scene I knew I heared that somewhere before....although I don't remember there being a little echo
>> ARTICLE
This final episode always made me wonder: why didn't Viral become a spiral entity like Boota? He's certainly been exposed to enough spiral energy for the writing team to handwave and give him a pass. I'm curious what Viral would have done with his life if he'd become a spiral entity in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Depending on how you look at things, its quite possible he did.

In the labryinth, his dream was a family, aka passing on of genes, a weird wish for a member of a race that uses cloning to procreate, but something that would fit perfectly if spiral power had awakened in him.

Combined with the fact that he also generates a Core Drill when he escapes the labrynith makes it likely too.
>> ARTICLE
Who knows, maybe he eventually does? It's possible.
>> ARTICLE
I'm ridiculously glad we didn't get a gainax ending here, even if the one we  got was bitter sweet.
>> ARTICLE
So anyone tell me pointers to further watching material? The main show is over and two movies are mostly recap but some new rephrased scenes (I'm a rewatcher and love the movies more than the original episodes) But there are Parallel Works things I've heard that is recycling only the character design and non-canon shorts?
>> ARTICLE
wtf you guys are way to fast! I am still on ep 11 :D

Hmmm, from what I remember from a long time ago, the ending was pretty intense. The whole change of the world. Simon becoming a hermit. I would've preferred that Simon remained a significant figure but this ending is one of the best I've ever seen.

Hey guys I just watched the last episode! I'm always late to everything...

soooo, now that we're all emotionally dead inside, how about a Clannad/ Clannad After story rewatch?
>> ARTICLE
Someone already did a Key Collection rewatch for that. It wasn't very successful.

I mean, I could do it, but that'll be covering 2 seasons with some people thinking there isn't much to write about, so It'll slowly turn into a rewatch that no one is interested.

I mean, after the Baccano! rewatch happening next month, I *could* ask people what they want to watch next. I was thinking more in line with Death Note, Steins;Gate, Garden of Sinners or OreImo.

Maybe you can do it yourself, but you have to figure out if you are capable enough to do this task.

>> ARTICLE
> Loved the ending personally, i'd have disliked it if Nia didn't disappear, so the ending was perfect imo.

Curious why?
>> ARTICLE
It comes down to personal preference really. It would've felt like, at least in my opinion that it would've lacked sacrifice after a battle like that. I also love sad/tragic endings.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind characters dying when they have to or to serve a purpose but I felt like Nia's at the end was just there to make it sad/dramatic :/
>> ARTICLE
But they explained in the episode why she had to disappear, it's not like it was random. And Simon perfectly knows it during the marriage scene.
>> ARTICLE
They also explain why humans should be destroyed and how they should be forced underground yet that never stopped them.

I'm just upset that they changed so much but weren't able to change that. 
>> ARTICLE
**New viewers: Yes, the thing that you just can't believe actually happened, actually happened. No, we couldn't believe it at the time either. There's a support group here for you.**

I remember when I first watched this episode. I was so confused by the ending. They couldn't have done that, right? He'll be back to normal next episode, won't he? 

But no, Kamina follows in the noble footsteps of "awesome mentor who is much cooler than the protagonist of the mecha series and so he clearly has to get out of the picture so the hero can become the hero" to join the likes of Ryu Jose, Roy Fokker, Mwu la Flaga* and Mikhail Blanc before him in Mecha Valhalla.

The next few episodes, as you can imagine, are going to be a little depressing. But I beg you, new viewers. Stay with it. It's one of the most rewarding anime rides you'll ever experience.

Back in episode 2, /u/franklyn26 remarked that she couldn't tell who the protagonist was, Kamina or Simon. This episode should answer that question: This is Simon's show, and he's going to have to grow into it instead of following in his bro's shadow the whole time. Let's hope he's up to the task.

I've heard of people who actually dropped the show after this episode because they liked Kamina so much. If you're one of these people: Don't do it! Have you ever heard of the classic model of telling a story in three acts? In act 2 the characters are at their lowest point, everything seems lost (a good example for this is Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back). That's where we are in this story right now (and for the next few episodes)! There will be much kicking reason to the curb, doing the impossible and fighting the power later on, everything will be awesome again, just wait.

Oh God, I just binged this series on Thursday and trust me, it stays just as interesting, if not moreso, after the death of Kamina. TBH, Kamina's death pales in comparison to the PSD I've suffered from finishing this series. It still hasn't subsided, at all, after these past several days because I know that there will never be another show I enjoy to the same level that I did Gurren Lagann. And thanks to that I've lost most of my drive to watch any and all anime...

You guys have no idea how fragile I am. You all promised a silly, over-the-top anime about robots and drills, and I *trusted you all*. What part of this is fun and enjoyable? For 8 episodes I loved the relationship between Simon and Kamina more than anything in this anime and I gushed over it in probably every write-up, and you assholes knew this was coming. Now I have to sit through a broken Simon. Do you even know how much thats gonna kill me?


I didnt want any of this. I didnt sign up for tears and pain.


Im gonna go watch the new episode of Kekkai Sensen and drown myself in its glorious ED to forget any of this happened until tomorrows episodes.

I'm so sorry I wanted desperately to warn you somehow last episode, but I promise it's worth it all in the end. It broke me too. But I couldn't spoil the emotional mess of the moment for you. You had to experience it just like I did. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, we need you to trust us when we say that we didn't lie, there's a lot more of TTGL left. It will be worth it, I promise.

If its any consolation Word of God according to several places + the guy who did the Satire/Abridged series says the following about Kamina in this [episode.](/s "Kamina actually died after the second attack on him. He then came back to life, gave Simon motivation, avenged his own death, and then died again.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm conflicted. On one hand I'm laughing at your misery and at the other I'm sad about Kamina dying all over again.
>> ARTICLE
But these dam delicious tears though!

It's so we can learn to pick ourselves back up.

>> ARTICLE
Ah yeah. So, long story short, I'm not actually watching the show, just following the discussions. And I started crying halfway through your post. This is the unexpected part of TTGL, the part that you never seen coming. I got spoiled on this episode and I still cried when it happened.

So here's the gist of it: you *have* to keep watching. The rest of the show is too good to abandon now. Believe it or not, it's the rest of the show that makes it as good as it is. And I promise if you stick around I'll have a writeup about Kamina for everyone to share at the end.

Don't worry, I'm committed.

As it killed us all :( 

But I can only promise it's worth it. It's so very worth it. There will be tears, but not all of them will be shed in sorrow. It's no good if 'happily ever after' comes without any struggle, right? 
>> ARTICLE
Sad Simon was one of my favorite parts of the show. I remember watching with my friends and laughing at how melodramatic these next few episodes are.
>> ARTICLE
It already started. That last shot of the "crying" robot was a bit ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
The Gunmen have mimicked their pilots' expressions through the whole show and symbolic rain tears are the sticking point? Gurren literally stuck its  tongue out at Viral in this very episode. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more that the whole melodramatic thing is a bit over the top. The Gunmen isn't crying because its pilot is crying, it's crying because the scene is supposed to be so sad that even the robot looks like it's crying. It's the classic [Tears from a Stone trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsFromAStone).

This is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

Surely you are not complaining about things being over the top?

>You can't pull shit out of nowhere

Which anime is this, again?
>> ARTICLE
Well, we made it. Episode 8 is definitely one to never *ever* forget. Mad props to OP for planning this accordingly so that episode 8 was on Memorial Day. Welcome to "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

Today's "Song of the Episode" wasn't actually in the episode but to truly honor Kamina we must remember the theme of the great leader of Team Dai-Gurren.

- I actually chose two different versions of the same song; it's the same lyrics but the music is different. Ladies and Gentlemen, ["Rap wa Kan no Tamashii da!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kujOTKIaBKY) and ["Rap is a Man's Soul"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjUH9VVlhks&ROW%20ROW%20FIGHT%20THE%20POWER), or more commonly known as, "ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH".

The fact for today is something that I hope will make all of you feel better.

- "A true man never dies": Remember when Kamina was supposedly dead and then he wakes back up to perform the Giga Drill Break? Kamina actually died the first time, HE CAME BACK TO LIFE TO AVENGE HIS OWN DEATH AND MAKE SURE HIS COMRADES WERE SAFE. If that's not manly I don't know what is.

Episode 8 is a doozy and some people even drop the series at this point. Definitely keep watching no matter what and remember the tears that were shed. Rest In Peace, you magnificent bastard. See you tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".
>> ARTICLE
Feel like you could've gone with [](/s "Break through the Dream") here as well. Probably the perfect timing for it, although I can see why it wouldn't fit in the big picture as it never actually plays in the show :(
>> ARTICLE
Still no Libera Me From Hell? Or will that have to wait til like ep 24?
>> ARTICLE
Not /u/FiestaJose, but I'd imagine it's because

1.) LMFH doesn't even show up until the last few episodes

2.) Its existence itself is kinda spoiler-y

3.) If you listen to it on Youtube you will almost certainly get HUGE SPOILERS in the comments.

[TTGL last few episodes](/s "It's going to be the song of the episode on Episode 25. Count on it.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't fault any of that. 

But man, all those first-timers who thought KLK had good music... 
>> ARTICLE
Kill La Kill has excellent music, Satsuki Kiryuin's theme is the hypest shit. The TTGL soundtrack has higher highpoints and is more iconic throughout.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I probably want very clear. KLK has an awesome soundtrack, and *Til my body is dry* is one of my favourite anime soundtracks. TTGL though is just on another level. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea what you say is correct. I choose songs that show up in the episode, with the exception of today's episode. LMFH hasn't shown up yet. [Once I do choose it](/s "I'll explain the significance behind the song itself")

If I can make some predictions... [referencing specific episode numbers so spoilers i guess?](/s "11: 'Happily Ever After' 25: 'LMFH' 26: 'Is a Mole just a Mole?' 27: 'Sorairo Days'")

Yea you're predictions are pretty much correct. [not really spoilers but just in case](/s "'Libera Me From Hell' and 'Happily Ever After' aren't gonna change. 'Sorairo Days' maybe, I wanted to showcase 'BafBaf! Do You Like... Burning with Such Passion' at some point and it's seems best to do it at the final fight. But if you have a suggestion for which episode for that song then I'm totally open to suggestions. I don't plan these way ahead in advance, I do them the day before.")

EDIT: [I think I know what I wanna do](/s "I'll have 'BafBaf! Do You Like... Burning with Such Passion' for the last episode and what I was thinking on doing was having 2-3 songs for each movie. I can showcase the Tengen Toppa edition of Sorairo Days for the second movie.")
>> ARTICLE
[Later episodes music spoilers](/s "I'm positive 'Bafbaf' plays at some point in the next few episodes, doesn't it? I think you HAVE to do Sorairo Days for 27 just because we get the whole goddamn thing as an intro song and it's awesome. Or maybe you can just do two SOTD's :P")
>> ARTICLE
[Final episode spoilers](/s "I could do that, but I'm still gonna do the Tengen Toppa edition of Sorairo Days for the second movie. BafBaf has already been played many times; it was even in the first episode. I just always think of the final battle, before Lordgenome's sacrifice, when it plays.")

Ah, I don't like the movie version of the song/scene as much as I do the TV version. Oh well!

I mean, it's your thing, so you do what you want to do :P 
>> ARTICLE
To add to your facts: [Kamina's death pose](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzuZuW7CEAAbTmL.png) is actually a common anime trope. It originated from the classic 1970s boxing anime [Ashita no Joe](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2402/Ashita_no_Joe), where one of the characters died [looking exactly like this](http://www.animenation.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/joe22.jpg) (Major spoiler for Ashita no Joe). You see that pose quite a lot in anime, usually in a humorous context though, like in [Kotoura-san](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/10/1362571245-kotoura-san-ashita-no-joe-50.jpg) or [Gintama](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/cameos/images/5/58/Gintoki_1.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
They did it in Shokugeki no Soma too :) That pose..
>> ARTICLE
Joe didn't necessarily die... It's ambiguous. In the manga (which obviously is the real original origin) it is very possible that he's just finished with boxing.

They referenced it [in Arakawa Under the Bridge as well](http://i.imgur.com/Yx3GJ0K.jpg)

**Post-watch insert:** This is gonna be one of those things where you all just skip down to the good part, isnt it?

Actually, Simon and Yoko are both 14.

Given that Kamina is 18, him and Yoko is actually creepier than Simon and Yoko.

Yoko is 14 in regards to her tribe. In terms of actual age, she's a lot closer to Kamina than Simon.

If you mean the age cap between Yoko and Simon, Yoko and Simon are 14 btw

No, Littner and Giha used different calendars since, you know, how do you tell the passage of time without the sun? Yoko is closer to Kamina in age than she is Simon. 

That is to say, Yoko is Littner 14 which is objectively older than Simon's Giha 14.

um ok didn't know this, I just checked the wiki for their age just to be sure, and it sayed that Simon, Rossiu, Yoko [and](/s "Nia") are 14. But it would explain Yokos let me say *mature* body for her age.

Yeah you're right. Sorry if I sounded rude, probably that's why their age is never said in the show, because it really doesn't matter.

I remember in the original airing in TV this episode's title was hidden completely until the ending of the episode. The preview at the last episode is only added at the time of DVD release etc, and hidden from newspaper's TV program list (there is such thing in japan)

So the episode title is a little spoiler-ish. I wish they used different episode title for maximum surprise.

Ah this is what my sadistic ass came in here for. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Ok guys this episode I won't make a screenshot wall because this episode is the turning point of this series for me, when I first watched Gurren Lagann this episode caught me offguard, nearly every anime I had watched before had plot armored main characters and even when it looked like they died next story arc they back stronger than before, so deathflags like the kiss scene at the beginning of this episode were an unknown concept for me. Now because of the cheerful spirit of this anime I would have never expected to see Kamina die. Even now while the opening is playing I just want to stop and not watch this episode because I don't want to see Kamina die again because he is one of my favourite characters.

But in my opinion Kaminas death is important for the progression of Simons character because this story is Simons and we have learned without Kamina, Simon has hardly the bravery and self-esteem to do anything because they always relied on each other. But Kamina is now gone and so the person he looked up to and had leaned on maybe his whole life has vanished. [Spoiler](/s "But the feat of overcoming Kaminas death is what makes Simon a great person and what makes him a better character than Kamina later in the series, also it leads to my most favourite scene in this anime, the "I'M ME" speech, because in this scene Simon finally steps out of Kaminas shadow and even becomes a character on his own who doesn't need his bro anymore to do anything")

So first time watchers who maybe want to quit because they only watched for Kamina (a friend of mine had nearly stopped watching because of this) please stick with this show because from now on it becomes **the** anime for me because of everything that comes after this episode makes this one of my favourite anime.

Kamina our time with you may have been short but this doesn't make it less valuable thank you for 8 great Episodes.

Oh, yeah, [](/s "Kittan's scene"); I wasn't as emotionally involved with him, so I can't agree with you there, haha, although it was a great scene too.
>> ARTICLE
Having already watched it before, I dreaded this day. 

I didn't even cry when I watched it the first time because I had this episode spoiled for me. I saw it coming then and I saw it coming as I rewatched it. I specifically told myself that "I already know what's going to happen, I'm probably not going to cry at all."

Never have I been so wrong before in my entire life
>> ARTICLE
It's always the rewatch that hits you harder, it was the same for me with PMMM. When I first watched this episode, I half expected him to be fine the next ep, so it didn't hit nearly as hard. 
>> ARTICLE
Was Simon going to confess?? :(

Aweeeee cute :3 

"when we get back" ugh

Awe Simon :( that's gotta sting

The mech sticking out the toungue...nice touch haha

Getitng punched by the guy who kissed the girl you like...didn't expect that to snap him out of it

Kamina :(

I had gotten his death spoiled for me but it still stings to watch :(

Curious to se how the show/characters progress without him...

Kiss of death from Yoko...gotta be hurting

Ugh hate when main characters die!!^^^StupidShow 

Would have liked to gotten more eps with Kamina since I was just starting to like him!!
>> ARTICLE
What a real shame, since you shipped them so hard I was expecting your reaction to.. *this*.

There's a thing in your comment that will be relevant later.
>> ARTICLE
It still hurt but I knew about his death going...I didn't think they would kiss though...it was hard to watch that and knowing he was going to die that episode :(

Well that has me curious...point it out to me when we get there! But I think I might have figured it out :(

What the hell was that! I don't think I could drop this show even if I wanted to at this point, it's just too god damn good!

>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really like TTGL. I'm not rewatching it and I only stumbled into this thread late at night.

But I will support the claim that episode 8 of Gurren Lagann is one of the most perfect self-contained episodes in all of anime. 

How well they tie the emotional state of Simon into the physical robot battles cannot be overstated. Its setting up that the only limit is yourself. And what a way to have Simon limit himself. They use the realistic, natural relationship between Yoko and Kamina to do just that, and then dont give him time to work out his feelings over their relationship, so it has to be resolved in battle.

It's so apt to a young teenage boy, it's so well-paced and well-placed as a pliable yet legitimate obstacle.

Kamina punching Simon in the face is just so perfect on so many levels. Of course thats what needed to happen, and of course that's what the character would do.

And it's wrapped up in this larger thematic context that is the through-line for the show. When Simon shouts, "Who the hell do you think we are?" it shows that he understands Kamina's philosophy, and then Kamina is free to die, having accomplished his objective.

There are _very_ few works of fiction with enough awareness to remove a character from the story after his purpose within the narrative has been served. And even fewer make it as emotional and logical as TTGL.

Pacing, the music, the conflict, the characters, the art. Everything about episode eight of TTGL is perfect. I cried.
>> ARTICLE
I havent really participated in these either because I come so late, or because I've went so far ahead that I forget what episode you guys are talking about, but this episode really is unforgettable. This is my first run through TTGL; and seriously why have I not ever tried watching this before?! Losing Kamina had such an emotional toll on me that whenever they mention him in following episodes I start tearing up or even crying. Seriously, I shouldve been Simon during those episodes; I was as much in a state of emotional shock as he was. Even watching the clip of the "Who the hell do you think you are" scene that /u/The-Sublimer-One's posted made me tear up. Seriously though, I both love and hate this show all because of this episode and I thank this discussion for giving me an incentive to start watching it :)
>> ARTICLE
Have you finished the series yet? If not, hold off if you can! It's really fun to do it with everyone else.

It's such a struggle to put it on hold, but I've hit the pause button to wait and watch it with every one :)

good man and/or lady. Keep it up and it'll be rewarding :)

Fuck...I thought i would be strong enough to endure it the second time around...but no...no one can go through this without shedding at least a single manly tear. Kamina's final words to Simon and his final words to everyone...and it only gets better from here on.  
Restraining myself to 2 eps a day will be hard in the remaining 2 thirds!
>> ARTICLE
Believe me, the third time for me and it was the most painful, I even wanted to skip this episode. But this would have been heresy to skip Kaminas last moment of badassery.
>> ARTICLE
Today we mourn, but tomorrow...well...we will still be mourning, and maybe one episode after that, but then we will get up and carve a path for ourselves to the heavens!

After the spike of this episode, I honestly believe every single episode from 9-27 is better than the one that comes before it. The ride will not end.

**Episode 8**

Well, we've made it to the infamous, game-changing episode 8...


Not a lot to say here that hasn't already been said by the first-timers. 


This episode still hits me pretty hard on every rewatch, although [](/s "seeing broken, depressed Simon in the next couple episodes is even more brutal for me.")


I'll try to get more stuff in for the discussion in the next couple episodes as they're some of my favorites, but for now: 


"Farewell, comrades"...RIP Kamina, we'll miss you :(
>> ARTICLE
I totally forgot they introduced [] (/s "Nia") so early in the series. 

Now comes my least favorite part which is everybody being depressed over Kamina.

Well yeah. It has to happen before [Spoilers](/s "the timeskip.")

Never forget.

It's a sad day for rain

To anyone who saw my advice and has been keeping their eye on the opening card and the next-episode narration, your vigilance is about to be rewarded.
>> ARTICLE
So far the show has been moving along, being good but nothing stellar. This was the turning point for me. This is where I (over the next few episodes) get on board the  hype/love train for this show.

Also, for some reason, this anime death was one that hit me the least. I suspect since I knew it was coming beforehand.  
>> ARTICLE
Yay for firsttimers who fall in love with the show from this point on. 
>> ARTICLE
Dem death flags doe.
>> ARTICLE
More, that it was impossible to avoid the spoiler!

I'll never forgive my friend for spoiling Kamina's death for me when I first started watching. It still hit me pretty hard even when I knew it was coming.

Been looking forward to this episode discussion thread since the rewatch started. Can't say I'm disappointed by peoples reactions, absolutely priceless. Do not fear though, more awesomeness is on the way, trust me. This is where Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann truly begins.

Welp there is the episode everyone will forever have a love-hate relationship with. It was just as hard this time as the first one around.

Having said that, the top comments on this thread sound really spoilish to me... hopefully no one else minds.

I had to stop my ep 1-8 binge of this as a first time watcher around 2 years ago. I continued to see how Simon was going to grow and become his own man. I just can't imagine what it was like for those watching it live/when it was airing. 
>> ARTICLE
I suppose this is a good point to ask; does it get better? I don't like this show very much so far. I have nothing against crazy logic-defying action, but I don't find any of the characters remotely interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I think that it does, but I'm also a mecha fan.
>> ARTICLE
If you're still not interested in the show after watching the next eps (9+10), then you can drop it. 
>> ARTICLE
You sound like me. I really wasn't into the Kamina arc. But yes, it does get better, especially after the halfway point where character relationships beyond Kamina & Simon & Yoko become more important. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'll give it a few more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
ready for the backlash but honestly, as someone who finished the series 2 days ago, this show only really started to shine for me after Kamina's death. 

Simon's growth and Nia's introduction was what made this show great for me and kamina never really clicked with me with his attitude...

Not taking part but just wanted to say RIP KAMINA :(((((((

This stage in Super Robot Taisen Z2.1 was amazing. Just saying.

Thank you so much for all the comments on the last thread! This rewatch is posted at 7am where I live, so I have to get up early to put this up (and then go straight back to sleep cause Im a lazy-ass uni student with nothing better to do).

So, Simon and Kaminas brotherly relationship is easily my favourite thing about TTGL so far. Also, the comedic moments and dialogue are on point. This was also a fun episode (for the most part), but I am intrigued to see wherever the plot is going. Dont know if its gonna be crazy good, but it might be better if I just didnt overthink things, going from comments on yesterdays thread.

>> ARTICLE
> No, no, no, no! If your dads dead, and Simons parents are dead, THEN WHOS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS ANIME??!

Both of them, clearly.

Really the thing that sets Kamina apart from a typical cocky jerk is how much he respects, cares for and supports his friends, particularly Simon.

I thought they put it in there, but by the end of the show they weren't sure how it fit in anymore and scrapped their original idea.

[BIG GIGANTIC SPOILERS](/s "I always interpreted that scene as the ending that the Anti-Spirals feared. Simon and team Dai-Gurren became the 'Spiral Nemesis', and destroyed the universe piece by piece. The phrase 'all the lights in the sky are our enemies' is in direct contrast to one of the last lines of the series 'all the lights in the sky are our friends'.

>  Male spirit is a much more elegant way of putting it than what I was thinking

I've also seen it translated as "fighting spirit" which is a little bit more accurate in the context of the show. Lagann reacted to Simon's awareness of Yoko's attention, which in this case result in a sudden surge of confidence (and probably no small desire to impress her). But later in the show it's more accurate to call it willpower or fighting spirit.

> "I have no idea where his confidence is coming from."

Kamina actually addresses that later in the show, but you'll have to wait. Mainly because I can't remember what he actually says.

> Is this commentary on what just happened, or is it about the anime in general?

Yes

> Oh no. I dont know if his dads actually dead but I feel sad now.

That is indeed his father's body.

> Dont know if its gonna be crazy good, but it might be better if I just didnt overthink things

I honestly think the story and characters are the best part of TTGL, and the over the top action is secondary.
>> ARTICLE
> Lagann reacted to Simon's awareness of Yoko's attention, which in this case result in a sudden surge of confidence

i always read this little bit as being simon getting an eyeful of boobies and being "fuck yeah, boobies", which gives *something* a surge of *something*, maly spirit etc.  your way is a bit more roundabout.

>later in the show it's more accurate  

i think later in the show they had a better idea where they were going with things, too.  these formative episodes have a lot of rough edges that point to not really knowing what story they're telling yet.
>> ARTICLE
"Fighting spirit" is also good. Actually, it makes more sense.

>but you'll have to wait.

Tease.

>Yes.

No, come on, don't do that. Come on.

So that *is* his dad? Well, now I'm sad again. And you're probably the first person I've heard complimenting the story. Not that others have put it down, but everyone just talks about the action and the silliness.
>> ARTICLE
The story is just less in-your-face than the super action fights but I really like it.  Mostly I think the characters are all handled really well and well written with consistent ideals.

I really like your write-ups but I'm not a fan of the subs you're using. A lot of people dislike the "male spirit" part, and I agree, but the dub uses "will power" and "determination" instead which I think work way better with the theme of the series.  Also the dub is pretty great if you're a fan.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if it would have made a difference, but I did want to watch it on the official stream sites, but they're not available in Australia. And nah, I'm not a fan of dubs
>> ARTICLE
Your posts are the main reason to check the rewatch thread. Seriously. It's just a rewatch for me, after all, but I still remember the mix of confusion and - heck, let's just call it "grinning like an idiot" - I had when I first watched TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
I am definitely experiencing the "grinning like an idiot" phenomenon at some parts. Also thanks for reading my posts!!
>> ARTICLE
So much of this. I can't even participate in the rewatch atm, but its so much fun to relive the TTGL magic through all these first-timers. I just love all the comments ending in 'I hope I like this show'. You will love it more than anything else, trust me.

> If you cant think of a good name for an attack, just say nothing.

I can promise you that it's not the most ridiculous name for an attack in the series.

Hell, it's not even the most ridiculous name Kamina comes up with alone. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh gosh. It was so bad though... No more. Please.

Is it done on purpose to mock other anime for attack names?
>> ARTICLE
TTGL is more about pushing tropes to eleventeen than mocking them. If they're gonna shout attack names, they have to do it bigger and better than anyone else
>> ARTICLE
yes
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure that TTGL is really interested in mocking other anime as much as celebrating them. That particular style of kick shows up as a special attack in every Gainax anime. It's a superfluous move with a superfluous name, made awesome by the great shows they've been able to put out over the years. 

"Who the hell do you think I am" kick!
>> ARTICLE
Please don't repeat the name to me.

But yeah, celebrating sounds good
>> ARTICLE
Sort of! 

I mean, we'll get more into this as the show goes on, but as much as Evangelion was a Deconstruction of the mecha genre (aka, "hey, asking teenagers to pilot giant war machines would REALLY SUCK for them"), Gurren Lagann is a proud Reconstruction (aka "remember all the stuff we love about giant robots? FUCK YEAH GIANT ROBOTS"). 

So it's definitely a reference, but consider it more an homage than mocking. If anything, it's gentle ribbing. TTGL is fundamentally about celebrating what we love about giant robot anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Today we get Roy, Gurren, fathers, oh my!

I also just realized this, but the show takes place in *supposedly* in the future, which makes sense later on in the show.

My god, I love Yoko's voice in the subs.
>> ARTICLE
I also love her voice, don't even know why.
>> ARTICLE
> My god, I love Yoko's voice in the subs.

I am probably the only person ever to go oh that's Sakura from Kyoukai no Rinne's voice haha

Just googled the voice actor, she did Yumiko Miura from **OreGairu** and Armin from **Attack on Titan**. I knew I heard her somewhere before.
>> ARTICLE
Wow didn't know about Yumiko!
>> ARTICLE
This opening is just too good, I've just been listening to Yamada's OP and Arslan Senki's ED this week I'll have to add this into the rotation now

Kamina trying to beat them with a sword...this will end well lol

Oh backup? Didn't expect this many surface people

Guessing this machine runs on *manliness and confindence* haha

Lmao it does respond to "male spirit" oh wow haha

Scared that Simon likes Yoko who likes Kamina more :/

Flashback? Man's world? Pfft 

Casual good morning during explosions :p

This one's stronger since it's in red obviously, getting used to this guy logic

Guns do not seem to do much...

They explained how he knew how to pilot it? Actually surprised.

Figured he didn't know how to use a gun haha that part was great!

They have a no Kamina sign cute :)

Will they explain how he got past the security?

Those attack names...pretty great

Oh no that's his Dad ;.;

Episode 2 and you pull that! Too soon indeed...

The excitement is still high and pacing is fast, curious to see how the rest of the series plays out and wow it's hard not to binge ahead...

>> ARTICLE
> Guessing this machine runs on manliness and confindence haha

i think tvtropes put it best:  "On the Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is soft enough to be spread on a bagel."  i think you're on board now.

> This opening is just too good, I've just been listening to Yamada's OP and Arslan Senki's ED this week I'll have to add this into the rotation now

Yup, it's a really great and memorable OP, which is why it was quite cool to have it suddenly show up in Saekano with the cover band. (You can vote for it in the best OP comp, too!)

> Oh no that's his Dad ;.;

While it's true a fair bit of the show is about overcoming all obstacles with confidence and determination, it can also get very emotional at times. It'll be quite a trip.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't expect that many emotions by episode 2!
>> ARTICLE
Well, this show doesn't really *do* slow-paced :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah clearly! Scared I might run out of steam before it does haha
>> ARTICLE
> Will they explain how he got past the security?

So, this relates to the whole "male spirit" thing, and isn't really based on sexuality at all. It's a little more accurate to call it "fighting spirit" or just plain willpower. Basically, if you have a reason to fight, and you really want something to happen, it'll happen - like the Gunmen unlocking and allowing Kamina to pilot it, or Simon's sudden surge in confidence when Yoko encouraged him.
>> ARTICLE
Alright so more towards my *manliness and confidence*  line? I'm okay with that should be fun if they figure it out or it works at opportune times like this ep.
>> ARTICLE
This is a universe where "Not with that attitude" and "It'll happen if you believe hard enough" are amplified by infinite.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm starting to get it haha makes it more fun!
>> ARTICLE
It does play a role in pretty much the rest of the show. It's explained more in depth later, too.
>> ARTICLE
I thought one of your comments yesterday was pretty funny...

> Kamina is like definition of cool, like how are those shades staying on?? :p

... so I drew a silly fanart comic thing to go with it. It's not that great, but hopefully I'll get better if I keep drawing more.

[Hope its good for even a small chuckle.](http://i.imgur.com/3XvmT8I.jpg)

Thanks! Just thought I'd try some quick, fun sketches during the rewatch. Glad you liked it.

Even without logic and reason, everything makes sense in the world of Gurren Lagann, hahaha.

Read that in Leeron's voice.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost easier to say what Steve Blum is *not* in if it is a video game or anime
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice at first. It's such a contrast from most of the characters he voices.
>> ARTICLE
I think he's done the voice a couple of times, but it really is a lot different from his usual voices, like Spike, or the MC from Bulletstorm/his Wolverine voice, which are his main ones. You'll probably be like me and then notice another show or game and he'll be doping the Leeron voice and you'll be like "Oh shit, that's him too?"

Crazy prolific
>> ARTICLE
Also his Grunt and Amon voices.
>> ARTICLE
Also true. He's got a great voice, and despite how many things he's in, I never get tired of him
>> ARTICLE
Man, have I been looking forward to this. I think this is possibly the first time I've watched something only 1 episode a day; looks like I'm going to have to practice some self control, anyway, let's get into this!

Previously: *Our main character Kamina was introduced as a tough, no nonsense, physics defying demigod, who still maintained the humility to help a child who was being bullied, and had a sensitive enough heart to stay by his side and be his role-model. Then there's some chick with a sniper and bewbs.  
When we last left our heroes, they were staring down two mech creatures that were significantly larger than themselves.*

**Episode 2: *"I Said I'm Going to Pilot that Thing*"**

* Have I mentioned that I really like this OP?

* I can't wait to understand all these visuals!

* Yeah Yoko, maybe this would've been a good thing to give a heads up about

* C'mon Simon, try to at least be a *little* like Kamina

* I love how Kamina thinks his katana would even affect that thing

* RIP Kamina?

* Nope, seems like Simon had a use. To protect our MC

* Jeez, how powerful is that rifle?

* Out of ammo? Does it run on batteries or use actual bullets?

* Ahh, the resistance movement, about time you showed up

* So, are those black things the enemies?

* Uh-huh, the black guys are called "The Beastmen", take that as you will

* God damn you're beautiful Kamina

* So is Kamina living out his dad's wishes, or was it a shared dream?

* So I'm guessing this is a post-modernm possibly post-apocalyptic setting, guessing we're gonna see some pretty advanced tech in the future

* Leeron, got it

* Ron coming on to Kamina like that was pretty funny. Glad to see he at least has good taste

* So will the key only activate when it glows? Maybe it is powered by the user?

* "Our journey ends when we pierce the heavens"  
Easy for you to say Kamina, you're basically a god already

* Aww, Look at [This!](http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww262/CapZiggy/simonandhisaniki.jpg) Look at it! Kamina has that caring side, 10/10, new husbando

* That's right Yoko, take it in

* I like the urban beat at the halfway mark thingy

* Aww, little Kamina, how adorable

* So his dad left him? .... His loss

* Is a back to back raid really uncommon? Didn't they say that every day starts with gunmen?

* Sweet, let's see what Lagann is capable of

* Aaaand, it doesn't work

* Oh shit, the Gunmen were responsible for Simon's tragic event

* Figured, it was his parents that died

* And now it works?

* I think I was right about the mechs being powered by the user

* Haha, that sounds like Kamina alright, "Don't mind me, just gonna go steal that guys mech...while he's in it"

* Burning passion and a cool head. Kamina is basically the master of that

* Well...maybe not the cool head bit :P

* Oh c'mon Yoko, don't act like you don't like it

* Haha, he almost shot himself

* That's right, he probably doesn't know what a gun is

* He...he actually did it

* He fucking stole a mech with the user still inside. Are you guys seeing this?

* Psychedelic visuals, I'm diggin it

* "'Who the Hell do You Think I Am' kick"

* Well if this whole mecha thing doesn't pan out, Kamina would make a killing in wrestling

* "'Hands of my Beloved Brother' Punch"

* Adorable, and intimidating, only Kamina

* I agree Simon, that was a little messed up, albeit funny as shit

* Double Kill!

* Yoko saying what we're all thinking

* So now one robot is Gurren, and the other is Lagann

* Possible mech merge in the future?

* No way

* These feels....that was his dad wasn't it :'(

* Don't cry Kamina....pls

* Well...that was pretty sad. Guess his dad never made it to the heavens after all

* *To be continued*  

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Well, that was a really fun episode. We got to see a lot more of Kamina, which is good, and they all showed a little bit of Simon's backstory. Kind of a sad moment there at the end, but the overall tone of this episode was more of a fun uppity one. I'm definitely looking forward to some more Kamina and Simon co-op battles., and hopefully they'll flesh out Yoko a bit more, as I can see plenty of room for exposition on her end of things.  
So far, I'm enjoying this series, but I don't quite feel the level of hype that this anime got before I watched it. And truth be told, if it wasn't for the glorious Kamina, I might've lost interest, but alas, we'll see where things go from here.  
Catch you all tomorrow!
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really really lame at first during my initial watch, right after it finished aired during all of the OMG BEST EVER hype. I didn't even like Kamina.

It's now one of my favorite all-time shows. Just stick with it, I promise. :)
>> ARTICLE
>I didn't even like Kamina

Well, there goes any respect I had for your opinion /s

Seriously though, I'm super excited for this show. I can't wait for the next episode, and I'm sure this will continue until we see it through to the end!

Absolutely. I love participating in these threads, and dropping an anime after 2 episodes seems a bit silly. I can't imagine how many shows that I love would've remained unfinished if I did that (see Steins;Gate)

I was new too. Didn't think everyone would enjoy them as much as they did. Gurren Lagann probably won't have as much crazy speculation and whatnot as Code Geass did, but the reactions will be just as fun, if not more. It's great to be on the other side of things now. Looking forward to reading your reactions as well as everyone else's!
>> ARTICLE
God, trying to keep up with this is going to be a pain (I might or might not *accidentally* watch the entire show in one go at some point). 

These 2 episodes have seemed very good so far, I hope the rest is just as good/better (judging from the show's popularity, it probably will) and the dub sounds pretty good so far as well.

If you're already hooked on these 2 episodes, then you need to buckle yourself in for what's coming! This is one of the few rewatches where I'm forcing myself to not skip ahead.

**Episode 2**


Yup...never get tired of this op


Kamina's monologues will NEVER get old, no matter how many times I rewatch this


I'm still unsure as to how seemingly normal human guns are able to take down the  gunmen. Yoko's huge-ass rifle has obviously been modified in some way to make it effective, but the small arms everyone else uses just come off as really weak in comparison...until you go back to this episode and see them completely take out a gunmen just by focus firing it.


Leeron...being leeron. Honestly one of the most interesting characters in the show though. 


ugh, the music and art during the [starry night](http://i.imgur.com/zVYcskr.jpg) scene is so good. Really makes me feel a bit of the wonder that Kamina and Simon are feeling upon seeing stars for the first time in their lives.


Given how crazy this show gets when it really starts to kick into high gear later, I never really realized how much I miss these [laid back, peaceful scenes](http://i.imgur.com/SSCQQpZ.jpg) with our main characters. Really helps to establish relationships between them early and build on their personalities.


LEERON BEING LEERON AGAIN! RUN KAMINA! Foreals tho, the VAs absolutely nail some of these lines


Of course the guns don't work on Gurren because WE NEED THAT MECH FOR THE PLOT 


[Yoko, stop!](http://i.imgur.com/MWLsyPz.jpg) Thats the fourth wall you're talking to, WE NEED  THAT TOO


[Yeah Kamina...does not know how 2 gun.](http://i.imgur.com/trMeASK.jpg) And [again -_-](http://i.imgur.com/pXUgaJ5.jpg)


The whole sequence with Kamina trying to control the robot after facing the skull is so great. One of the very few times we see him truly (but briefly) afraid. However, being the REAL best guy (YEAH I JUST SAID THAT), he takes all his fear, uncertainty, and self-doubt and turns it into the mental drive he needs to break through whatever barriers were keeping him from controlling Gurren. Any doubts one has about kamina's will to live and fight all but vanish at this point.


WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM KIIIIIIIICK


[OYAJIIIIIII TT_TT](http://i.imgur.com/iKnaMQf.jpg)


**Post-Episode Stuff**

I feel like the whole episode is dedicated to building on Kamina, which is just fine as we're still establishing the personalities of all the main characters. Simon's meekness and unwillingness to fight for most of the episode is sharply contrasted with Kamina casting aside all his fears to gain new power. In other news REALLY HYPE THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN NEXT EPISODE! until then...ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!

Yeah I honestly don't know how Kamina lost the best guy contest to *fucking Lelouch*. Lelouch isn't even close to best guy. And Kamina is everything a best guy should be! People were just wrong.

Episode 2

Im gonna keep using dub clips for my WebMs. Your tears give me power.

* Kamina: Simon, stop being a bitch and get in the fucking robot!

* Simon: But Im already in the robot!

* Kamina: Then let me out of the fucking robot!

* We couldnt exactly just leave his bones lying there which, judging from the state of decomposition, we actually did for quite a while.

* Kamina: Thank God you guys have a war going on. If I got up here and it was nothing but a tropical oasis, populated by scantily clad women, willing to serve my every whim, I would have just gone right back home. Well, we got one out of three, but I can manage.

* Kamina: Who do you take me for? Of course I know who to use a canteen! Just put the hole-part into your mouth, and click the button to make the water come out.

* Alright, you ugly, human filth! Hey, dont lump everyone else in there with me!

* The truth is, all earthquakes have been caused by gundams crashing into the Earths surface. The government just covers it up using the mind-control chem-trails that come from those rescue planes.

* [Lol. Its so one-sided.](http://webm.land/media/2VuO.webm)

* I think Kamina might be a closet-masochist.

* [Hey, dont ask me, Miss Pie.](http://webm.land/media/ub35.webm)

* Kamina: Who cares if its super-advanced, most likely alien technology? I watched Code Geass! Theres nothing about handling mechas that surprises me anymore!

* Why am I always stuck with the job of giving that moron back-up? Well, this is only the second time youve fought together, so

* Smart of them to install anti-human locks in those things. Not so smart to make it impossible for them to look down.

* [Is Kamina in a Stanley Kubrick movie?](http://webm.land/media/9sLj.webm)

* Also, those guys really should have just made these things DNA-locked instead of intense willpower-locked.

* WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM-KICK! HANDS OFF MY BELOVED LITTLE BROTHER-PUNCH! Beats just shouting random animal names.

[Spoilers for KLK](/s "That was a legit theory about belonging to the same universe for the first few episodes.

Hey do you know if it's confirmed that FLCL and Diebuster take place in the same Universe? I've been wondering for the longest time and never see anyone talking about it. (I'm of course referencing both series ability to use "libido" to summon robots from their foreheads.)

I'm pretty sure there are a bunch of cool TTGL x KlK theories like yours that make pretty good sense. Don't go looking for any until you finish TTGL though for fear of spoilers.

-I usually wouldn't do this but because Gurren Lagann is my favorite anime I wanted to do something special. So for these rewatches, excluding the first episode because I was a little late, I wanna do a "Song of the Episode" where I choose a song from the OST that was featured in the episode; mostly because the OST is great and I wanna share it with people.
 
-I might do a fun/random/interesting fact that pertains to the episode as well. 
So to start things off, this episode's "Song of the Episode" is [Gattai Nante Kuso Kurae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vX3U2F2kj4&list). 

-I missed yesterday but I would have chosen [No Helping It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgU6z1_W8So).
 
-For this episode's interesting fact: some people theorize that the [man](http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.roosterteeth.com/images/Jakato48dae1297d40d.jpg) at the beginning of the first episode was [Kamina's father](http://s9.postimg.org/4p0t7vbnz/boota_11.png), I can't confirm or deny the theory so it's up to you what you think. 

I apologize in advance if I miss some days or am late. Also, let me know if there is something I can do better or fix :D. Gurren Lagann is my favorite and I wanted to show my appreciation and dedication with something special.

Edit: Fixed a link and some typos

Episode 2! We meet more Gunmen, and fight more Gunmen! 

We're also introduced to the supporting cast, aka Leeron the most brilliant badass super-gay dude ever (and Steve Blum's Leeron is one of the shining stars in an otherwise eh-its-okay dub) and Dayakka, the Team Dadiest Team Dad to ever Team Dad. Kamina gets a giant robot! 

Kamina does not know how to use guns!

Nothing much to say about this episode, except that it's hinted how mechas are powered by spirit.

Wasn't "Nikopol" used for Kamina in this episode? 

Edit: I just listened and I guess not. WTF song is that that plays for Kamina and the Gurren? I always associate it with the character we meet tomorrow. 

Edit x2: Oops! I was totally wrong, it's "To Hell with Gattai!" from the soundtrack. Tomorrow-character has a different theme. And I'm not sure why I associate this one with him.

Welp first time viewer, heard plenty of good things about this anime. Loved the first episode so i figured time to comment. 
**Episode 2**

* Oh boy a recount of the last episode.

* Simon Simon Simon, you have a drill? why use hands?

* You tell 'em Kamina. 

* Kamina basically has the "deal with it" glasses on his face forever huh?

* What does that gun even shoot? Should i even care?

* Well Yoko i mean, he's trying his best. And you see what moving around gets him.

* Is she going to forever think the two are blood bros?

* So she can run out of ammo.

* Again, these guns look less than effective.


* There are sasquatches in there?

* Oh, Beastmen, are they allergic to moonlight?

* Hello creepy man, is that eyeliner? looks nice.

* Starry nights

* Past people? Ok, so this takes place on earth in the future by a couple centuries at least?

* Hello again Eye Guy, is that a pocket mirror turned PDA?

* Eye Guy, burning Yoko at the speed of light

* It doesn't count when there a pictures next to it Yoko...

* I like this Ron fellow, he has exposition and charms.

* Ron knows a quality man when (he/she?) sees one.


* Yoko, you were there when he used the key. You know what is is. And are you saying in however many years your team has been on the surface you've never captured a functional Gunman?

* JEEBUS Ron is tall. and Lagann is really short ~Simon sized~.

* So, is Ron a woman. He said "Ladies" and seemed to include himself in that group, but that contradicts is earlier statement about being neither. 

* Why did they stop for the skull? Is it normal sized or super large (darn camera angles)? If normal then seems unlikely they would have seen it. Maybe just an exposition queue?

* Kamina takes nothing from nobody Yoko. Besides, if he died i think the internet would have already imploded with rage.

* Ron i don't know what you're shining but it looks cool so keep doing it.

* Oh i get it.

* Confirmed Kamina for best bro in spirit or otherwise. 

* Is this Kamina's father? is sounds/feels like it. The child's voice is so prepubescent it could be Kamina or Yoko

* Kamina it is

* Wow dad left and didn't even pay child support

* Yoko I'm no gun expert but bullets sound like dangerous things to eat.

* Yeah im liking Ron.

* Kamina x Katana

* Wait so do the Gunmen know where their base is? Cant they just constantly attack with their superior technology and firepower until the humans are dead?

* Traumatic flashback

* Oh boy level up time go Simon go

* So is it linked with the pilots emotions?

* Hush Yoko, his confidence is omnipresent. Apparently you sold your confidence for chest pillows.

* "Why do i have to keep providing backup?" uhhh Because you're a sniper???

* oh Kamina, you tried.

* Killed? whoa whoa hold up, he fell out and did a little anime spin. He's fine.

* The afterlife is apparently skywards.

* Man the rest of you guys sure love just sitting back at watching, especially you Ms. Sniper aka support role.

* oh boy free drug trip

* yep Kamina best guy

* that dodge though

* lol jk

* You never considered hijacking one of the most powerful weapons ever created despite being desperate for survival? ok then.

* Do the rest of you have nothing better to do than watch Kamina bury somebody?

* oh boy

Well that was a wild ride. Teary eyed Kamina made me sad. Ron made me smile. Yoko made me shake my head. Simon made me give a thumbs up. Watching only 1 episode a day is killing me right now. Oh, well. Till tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
Haha! Good write-up. Made me laugh, had some good thoughts on how things work within the world, and you're struggling to watch just one episode a day. Always tough. Stay strong, and good work!
>> ARTICLE
> So, is Ron a woman. He said "Ladies" and seemed to include himself in that group, but that contradicts is earlier statement about being neither.

Nope, she's a guy.
>> ARTICLE
Ok. Btw is it Ron or Leeron? Or does it not matter because it is only as i type this comment do i see the similarities. 
>> ARTICLE
Either way for his name. I call him Ron because it's faster to type than Leeron.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't convinced by episode 1 and I was unsure if I should continue to watch. But episode 2 was so much better for me and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!
>> ARTICLE
Glad you kept going with us! Hope you enjoy the rest of it. ;)
>> ARTICLE
While the last episode wasn't exactly the best for me and left me a bit worried, it seems that I was correct that it was just a first episode thing. Though I still have a few problems with this episode, I found this one much more enjoyable.

After the beginning battle subsided we got some expanding on the world and how the people who have been outside of the pits behave, if only a little. So far, whenever this show has its quite and calm moments seem to be my favourites. I'm really liking the big brother little brother dynamic between Kamina and Simon. You can tell that Kamina knows how much Simon looks up to him and tries to push him to be better than he currently is. It's a great dynamic, and I hope that it continues like this throughout the show. It also appears there is a bit of a sister brother relationship between Simon and Yoko as well, though where that goes from here is still unknown to me. 

I felt the contrast between the Litners actions of burying the bones and Kaminas opinion of it showed just how different being up on the surface was as far as mindsets go. While Kamina is probably going to be his usual self, I'm assuming that we'll see a good amount of change from him as he adapts to his new environment. Simon as well, but that's kind of a given. 

My problems come in a similar form as yesterday, specifically how more time was spent on the action than was needed, which could've been used to focus on the Litners and show how they lived. I will say, however, that the fight was pretty entertaining and didn't drag on. The revelation at the end of the episode with Kamina's father being dead (unless it actually isn't him in which case, ya got me Gurren Lagann!) came a little too soon. I'd had already guessed he was dead, but this just seems like a way to force quick development onto Kamina, and even if it turns out his dad isn't dead they could've at least waited a few episodes. 

Overall, things once again felt rushed, but the charm is definitely showing itself and everything is slowly beginning to move along. The characters are also starting to grow on me, which is a must for any show if I'm going to enjoy it.

Episode 2 score: 7/10
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2

Why isn't Kamina MC? He's so much more badass. Bro doesn't need to know how to read when you kick ass! [Simon you sly dog!](http://imgur.com/tlw1reo) Stereotypical perverted MC? Do they ever explain the controls for the machine? Or do you just push a handle forward and the Lagan does a Spinzaku kick? PIERCE THE HEAVENS Aniki! Is he just going to have his shirt off the entire time? Because I am entirely ok with that. Kaminas Dad being leader of the resistance or bad guy leader, calling it right now. Kaminas manliness has been passed down his family for generations! [Kamina finally said it!](http://imgur.com/BQ0d56p) Now he just has to say ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER. Backstory on Simon? Nope, just enough to enrage him. Parentless? Damn, Simon is definitely the MC. Kamina said he's gonna pilot that, so he's gonna do it, don't doubt him Yoko. Will Power is how the gunmen work? I'm foreseeing a lot of super-sayin/powering up yells. [Holy shit](http://imgur.com/e0vA4X1)Kamina is tripping major balls, I'll have what he's having. "WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM" Kick! An older and well know move, but effective nonetheless. Oh, thats his dad's bracelet. And there goes my theory out the window.

Post episode thoughts

Much better episode than the last one, more Kamina=better episode, Simon actually does something, and Aniki gets even more badass and his own robot! I've seen pictures of just one robot with Kamina and Simon in it, so I'm sensing some Power Rangers robot-joining latter in the series.

Good day everyone.

It's been around 4 months since I started TTGL. Back then the humour and over-the-top style of the anime combined with animation/art-style put me off realtively quickly in Episode 3.

BUT NOW I'M HERE, and I'm currently enjoying this ride way more than before. Seems Kill La Kill got me used to Trigger.

Also:

*Why* Does Yoko Littler sound so much like Lilith from Trinity Seven to me? It's ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
They look the same too, both have red hair, big boobs and use guns
>> ARTICLE
*And they sound freakin' equal to me!* ^(We'll ignore Lilith and her Lust-thema for now)

It's driving me so crazy.

Oh my Buddha, Leeron is voiced by the same guy that does Vash the Stampede in Trigun. 

Kamina why do you turn down such a [beautiful queen?](http://i.imgur.com/tFsFgAs.png)

Talk about [ballsy](http://i.imgur.com/LY6616W.png), taking on 3 Mecha's with a sub machine gun.

Again, thanks for all the comments! I really dont get why you guys find my write-ups to be interesting, but I will keep it up until you all tell me that Ive overstayed my welcome and that I need to piss off immediately. 

Also, to those of you who seemed to have been having some kind of spoiler tag war in my last post, you have no idea how much willpower it took to not hover over those tags.  You kept saying not to read it, so I honestly thought you were just messing with us and they werent actually spoilers, but I couldnt take the chance. I guess you win this one

* [Hell yeah](http://i.imgur.com/R8Qy4DS.png), its a lame name. Kamina just says stuff that is so accurate. Also, those things at the start of the episode *were* sunglasses!!!
* [Rude.](http://i.imgur.com/zAN97ct.png) Youre not being much help either, so you wanna not criticise them?
* Simon being all [down](http://i.imgur.com/0h78Hyy.png) and [stuff](http://i.imgur.com/S2sw76N.png) bums me out pretty hard. I dont hate these kinds of characters, but I feel like this sub shows no mercy for chewing them out. Although, I dont know if Ive ever seen a bad thing said about Simon. So either, hes an exception or he starts to muster up some courage and resolve. I like him though, as he is. Hes a good contrast to Kamina. Im not against him changing a little, though
* The amount of faith [he has in Simon](http://i.imgur.com/ctq5nG3.png) is incredible
* The background music is pretty damn epic
* Does Kamina [talk vaguely](http://i.imgur.com/Ec6fo4Z.png) to sound cool? Hes trying so hard to be a cool protagonist. A+ for effort
* Gosh, I want so badly for Kamina to have just [broken his mecha.](http://i.imgur.com/4THrOHY.png) Nooooo!!! I said I want the mecha broken, not [I want him to be brutally drilled to death.](http://i.imgur.com/wHBwLqb.png)

[Keepsake!](http://i.imgur.com/Pvcp6UD.png) And Simon catching the piece that flew off and wrapping it around his arm is really sweet. On the surface it could be pretty shitty symbolism (hes always getting Kaminas scraps), but I wanna think of it as taking a *piece of Kamina* and keeping it, you know? Similar to how he sees Kaminas strength and courage, and uses it for inspiration and makes it his own. Does this make sense? Am I overanalysing?
* [Ahahah](http://i.imgur.com/1DumCur.png), their reactions are always so in sync
* Leeron doesnt technically count as a female, so I mean, at this point [you have no choice but to go](http://i.imgur.com/pRF07T7.png). So go and fulfil your roll as the token girl!!!
* Woo. [HYPE](http://i.imgur.com/NBbQb1J.png)

Another solid episode. Nothing really to add, but I am excited for the adventure portion of this anime. Should be good

> I really dont get why you guys find my write-ups to be interesting

Because all of us who have seen this show before and enjoyed it can see a lot of ourselves in your excitement and energy. It's like reliving how we felt watching it the first time, because no matter how good TTGL is, nothing beats watching it for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
I like your comments of these because your funny,as well as seeing someone's reaction is nice. :)
>> ARTICLE
Ok, yes the odds of Kamina's combining plan working does take suspension of disbelief, but it will be explained during the series why it worked down to the helmet merging with Gurren Lagann
>> ARTICLE
I also really enjoy your posts and other similar posts in this thread, they make this whole thing so much more fun.
Also don't worry about your suspension of disbelief, everything will be explained with time, there are already some hints about.

Such as if you look at Lagann's 'main' drill, it looks more like a screw than a drill, like it's meant to screw into something and hold on to it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes, the grape-hippo. At the moment this episode aired, I assume someone over at Gamefreak scrapped one of their Pokemon designs.
>> ARTICLE
I like them because it's good to know someone else is reacting the same as me but wording it better.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact regarding any seeming romantic interest between characters: Simon is 14, and so is Yoko. IIRC Kamina is around 18-21ish.

Then again, it's a bit hard to judge the passage of years underground.
>> ARTICLE
I always heard that Yoko and Kamina were late teens, while Simon was early teens
>> ARTICLE
I can say with certainty that Simon's 14, I could believe that Kamina's around the 17-19 mark, Yoko... some other replies to me suggested different calendars being the cause of different ages, and she looks about Kamina's age... I guess so?
>> ARTICLE
I thought Littner and Jiha had different calendars? 
>> ARTICLE
possibly, I haven't heard that before. It would make sense, though.
>> ARTICLE
I'd also heard something about Littner and Jiha having different calendars. Can't find the source (on mobile), but I'm pretty sure that since both villages were underground, they developed their own sense of "days" and "years," so Yoko is really more like 18ish? (Which makes more sense given her... maturity.)
>> ARTICLE
It's been confirmed that Littner had a different calendar system than Giha. Despite her numerical age being the same as Simon's, Yoko is much closer to Kamina's age
>> ARTICLE
Kamina's sword was so long because it needed to coincide with his speech. Because that is badass, and Kamina knows how to be badass. 

Also, this episode introduced a tangible villain in Viral, what did you think of him?
>> ARTICLE
So what you're saying is, he forced his sword to be longer through sheer willpower?

In regards to Viral, I'm mostly curious about what he is. I think he's one of the beastmen, but I'm not sure. As in, I'm guessing there are humans and beastmen, but there have been a few non-human creatures that differ from each other. If it's as simple as human and beastmen, then I'm guessing that the beastmen have some level of hierarchy, which can be identified by how human they look. Like, the adorable fuzzy creature from last episode is a low ranked one, and then the monkey-looking dude is higher up, and Viral is probably pretty high up, which would explain his movements and strength. I'm also really intrigued about the racism, or specism(?), towards humans. I'm hoping I get to learn more about it.

In terms of him being a villain, I can't help but think he may not be very powerful, due to how early he's been shown in the anime. But I'm guessing he's important or, at the very least, will be a recurring character that maybe becomes stronger throughout the show (probably in parallel with Kamina). I also liked his cockiness (it's great for when we get to see his ass handed to him and you get the "What?! Impossible!!" moments). I'm not very fussy about villains, but he did seem pretty cool and I'm looking forward to seeing him show up more and learning a bit about him

Sorry, this ended up being a bit long. Thank you for the comment though! It actually made me think properly about him and some other things! I'm not very good with details, so I appreciate the help!!
>> ARTICLE
Viral is a beastman. At this point, if anyone has a Gunmen, you can assume they're beastmen.
>> ARTICLE
I now completely understand how the people who had already seen Code Geass felt watching my first-timer reactions. I want to say *so many things* about this but I. I can't. I must be strong.

I'm loving your writeups :) 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for reading! And thanks for not saying anything AND for the PSA. I'm not sure if there's as much to spoil in TTGL as there was in Code Geass, but clearly things are gonna happen and the suspense is killing me. But I'm looking forward to whatever comes (or I'm dreading it, if it's a bad thing)

Yeah, they were pretty heavy spoilers, sorry about that. We will try to do less of that later on.

Yes, apologies from me as well. Never again. Don't worry.

To be honest, the reason I love your write ups is because it conveys almost exactly what my thoughts/feelings were when watching Gurren Lagann the first time through. The excitement/confusion/analysis is great. It's great seeing you come up with theories on different things as well, considering I know what's going to happen later on. When you've watched it as many times as I have, you just start to roll with it rather than question/theorize certain things.

Another great write up though!
>> ARTICLE
>He's trying so hard to be a cool protagonist 

Implying he isn't already an awesome protagonist

I messed up.
>> ARTICLE
> I really dont get why you guys find my write-ups to be interesting

Because seeing someone react to something you love for the first time let's you relive watching it for the first time all over again. Like me, during the Code Geass rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
#PSA for viewers who've already seen it:

Let's be careful with what we say about upcoming episodes, please! I remember when I was a newbie watching Code Geass, and there would be comments along the lines of "I can't wait to see the reaction thread to tomorrow's episode," I'd know something was gonna go down with what I was about to watch. 

Those among you who've seen it before know EXACTLY which episodes I'm referring to, too. I'm not going to say them here because that'd defeat the purpose, but... you know which ones I mean :P

It's okay to hint and tease, but let's be careful how we do it. Keep things vague, probably don't hint at specific episodes (which I've been guilty of myself already, oops) and let's make sure the newbies get as awesome a TTGL experience as we had unspoiled our first time :)

#***EVERYONE, LISTEN TO HIM!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!***
>> ARTICLE
I love Viral. He's a cool guy.
>> ARTICLE
Viral is the best! My second favorite character in the show, only beaten by Kamina (of course).
>> ARTICLE
I'd rate him fourth behind [character existence spoilers](/s "Nia. Also, post-timeskip Simon makes it in there too.")

Viral is seriously so cool, and I wish I could talk more about why.
>> ARTICLE
> Viral is seriously so cool, and I wish I could talk more about why.

Its really killing me too lol.

>I'd rate him fourth

I actually really like how different everyone's favorite character rankings are for TTGL. Really shows how awesome the cast is.

[character existence spoiler](/s "BTW, Nia is easily 3rd or 4th for me I think :D")

I think if I had to do my top 10, it'd be [character existence + development spoilers](/s "Kittan, Simon, Viral, Yoko, Lordgenome, Rossiu, Kamina, Nia, Leeron, Dayakka, Leyte.")

[don't do it, I'm begging you.](/s "SHE ISN'T ABLE TO HAVE SPIRAL POWER, BUT SHE DOES SO ANYWAY JUST TO FUCK HER MAKERS. She denies her own origin, and even has the power to KEEP EXISTING ONCE THE ANTI-SPIRAL IS DEAD. That's like shutting down your computer, but one of the programs still running.")

[Nope, don't even try to do it](/s "She is easily one of best girls on my list.")

[Nope](/s "Haven't seen the sub, so I wouldn't know.")

It *is* a pretty good dub, after all.

Yeah, the dub is really good.

WHY ARE THESE CHARACTERS SO GOOD DAMMIT. [Don't even think about it](/s "I'm really trying to resist the urge to skip ahead to watch all the anti-spiral nia scenes now D:")
>> ARTICLE
Bout six months ago I forewent my annual rewatch to just watch the last half-hour of Lagann-Hen. Worth.
>> ARTICLE
Kamina doesn't even break my top 5. :p

Though I feel listing it out might feel spoilerish, especially since we haven't met two of them yet.
>> ARTICLE
- Hey, I'm back. So today we got to meet Viral so I'll start off with the fun fact: Viral is actually a shark with feline genetics; his teeth will grow back if they are pulled out.

- The "Song of the Episode" of course is [Nikopol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqVVTYJ7dMw&index), Viral's theme.

- BONUS FACT: I wanted to mention this fact because now that we've seen them combine it's worth mentioning. Kamina's name comes from the Japanese word meaning "above" and Simon's name comes from the Japanese word for "under". This is actually a pun in the fact that Simon is on top and Kamina is on bottom when they combine to form Gurren Lagann.

- Some of my personal thoughts on the episode. I like the part when Yoko was really excited that they were gonna "combine", idk what Yoko was thinking but it wasn't the kind of combining we got. One of my first exposures to Gurren Lagann was an image of Kamina and Simon's ['combination'](http://i46.tinypic.com/ml3zbp.jpg).

EDIT: Something I actually forgot but wanted to mention was [this](http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af108/ihatenothing/grapehippo.jpg) is a grape hippo if you guys didn't know; yea it's creative.
>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, what are the Japanese words their names are based off of? I by no means have a large Japanese vocabulary, but the only word I know for above is  (ue), below is  (shita), which I guess sort works for Simon.
>> ARTICLE
According to the wiki it's 'Kami' for 'Above' and 'Shimo' for 'Under'
>> ARTICLE
Those are the correct kanji, but you forget that they have multiple readings in Japanese.  can be read as (kami), and  can be read as (shimo). 
>> ARTICLE
Ah cool, I didn't know that. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Nikopol is my JAM!
>> ARTICLE
Viral's theme is easily my favourite piece of music from TTGL, with Sorario Days being a close second and Libera Me From Hell coming third (are we supposed to spoiler as-yet-unheard music? Don't look it up, first-timers.)
>> ARTICLE
Idk about spoilering it, but looking up Libera Me is seriously risking spoilers by nature.
>> ARTICLE
fair point, edited.
>> ARTICLE
[who would have thought that Kamina is a bottom](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpeJM3te5x0/Uc9OIN9o2-I/AAAAAAAABMs/v1LE6iXtuBc/s1280/Yahari%20Ore%20no%20Seishun%20Rabukome%20wa%20Machigatteiru%20-%2013%20-%20Large%2016.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: The name Kamina is supposed to be derived from "above" and Simon from "below". 
>> ARTICLE
The exact same thing is written in the comment I replied to, my comment was just referencing the last part of the BONUS FACT:

> This is actually a pun in the fact that Simon is on top and Kamina is on bottom when they combine to form Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
Oh.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I've seen a lot of art with him and the primary character introduced tomorrow where that's the case. 
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "Kittan? He's tomorrow is he? I wouldn't be surprised if there's lots of SimonxRossiu too, even though the Canon couple for Simon is OTP.")
>> ARTICLE
[Minor character existence spoilers](/s "Yup. I've also seen a lot of Kamina and genderswapped Kittanko. By far the most common slash pairing is Kamina/Simon, but the aforementioned is pretty popular, as is Simon/Rossiu and Viral/Kamina or sometimes Simon.")
>> ARTICLE
> Simon is on top and Kamina is on bottom

And now we know what Yoko was fantasizing about when Kamina said they were going to combine.
>> ARTICLE
Yoko confirmed fujoshi?
>> ARTICLE
So, I'm not exactly participating in this rewatch due to the fact that I've recently rewatched the show with a friend who hadn't seen it yet a couple of months ago, but, I really can't resist talking about Gurren Lagann with people who have and haven't seen it yet so I'm gonna pop in here every now and then to ramble. I will always attempt to avoid spoilers, whether they be direct or vague, and will tag when necessary.

I really, really value entertainment in all forms. Somewhere in all the games, movies, books, and TV shows I've consumed over the years, there exists an ineffable 'list' of my favorite things that I truly care for and value as things that I have enjoyed on a different level than your average something or other. TTGL is definitely on that list. Now that you new people have seen the first three episodes, I'd like to talk a bit about some things.

First off, the general reactions I've seen to Kamina, Yoko, and Simon seem to be following my own and those of the people I've seen the show to. I like that, it shows that the show at succeeding in making you feel and think what it wants you to feel and think. I would say that if you are at all having a good time with this show so far, you are going to really, really like the rest of it. While I understand the point of the schedule with any given rewatch, I always recommend to people starting out to watch at least the first three episodes in a single sitting for a couple of reasons:

* Episode 1 *feels* slow, even though I don't think it is. Like most good first episodes, it's an appetizer for the rest of the show. There's a lot of really great information in it, be it spoken or otherwse, it establishes the general personalities and attitudes of our main trio, and most importantly it sets the **tone**. The best part of the episode is absolutely when Simon turns the key and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otO2hbfE2zM) piece starts playing. Didn't you like what you felt something when you saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/eMEq2bf.png)? Of course you did.
* Episode 2 takes care of a large part of the world building: It's the distant future, the Earth is nothing but dirt and gunmen, and humans are kind of in the shitter right now. On top of that, we get more backstory of our MCs: Yoko's village was destroyed so they came to the surface and fight Gunmen. Kamina's father showed him the surface and told him to come for it when he could. Simon's parents were killed in an earthquake cause by the Gunmen. This is also the episode where it is made known that Gunmen are powered by willpower, which I think is brilliant. I'm sure I don't need to explain, but in so many stories be they anime or otherwise, as long as the hero is dedicated enough, he can survive, persevere, and overcome any challenge through sheer force of will regardless of when in-universe laws would have you think otherwise. In TTGL, though, that the point. The in-universe law is as you heard, Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible.
* Episode 3 introduces Viral, and finally gets us our namesake for the show: the combined force of Kamina and Simon's Gunmen, Gurren Lagann. [This](http://i.imgur.com/0fKWAZq.png) is where I realized, I think I'm going to really like this show. Not only was it funny, but I felt like this was the payoff for Kamina's bravado throughout the first three episodes. Kamina and Simon are flying by the seat of their pants until this moment, when their combined strength and will actually shows them a solution: They can do this. They can fight, and even better, [they can win](http://i.imgur.com/vNCCcsg.png). We start to see Simon take a little initiative, and start showing more of his [value](http://i.imgur.com/IR12Q5U.png), which Yoko acknowledges. Leeron finds out where they could potentially find the enemy HQ, and our adventure truly begins.

I could talk all day about this show. I hope you new people can understand where many people, including myself, are coming from when they talk about how much they love this show. I don't really like how people tend to say that this show is best enjoyed if you 'turn your brain off' and just enjoy the ride. I also think sometimes that the over-the-top super robots give people the wrong impression. **If you let yourself get invested in this show, it will pay you back in *spades*.** Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann really is a superbly told story. The characters feel real, there are legitimate stakes at hand during every confrontation, and the plot unfolds in an organic way. I mean, it feels weird to describe this dumb, ridiculous show as genuine, but it is. It's genuine, it comes from the heart. It has its flaws, of course, everything does, but for me it's a show that surpasses its flaws to become something special.

I'm gonna wrap this up, but I'd also like to take time to mention something about Episode 4: The art and animation is different (and in my opinion, worse) from the rest of the series thanks to a guest director. Every other episode is consistent with the first 3 episodes.

OK this picture and webm making takes quite some time I am sitting here over an hour to write all that up but it is worth it for this show.

Ah Viral one of my favourite characters in this anime if you haven't guessed already...
And the show now started moving forward, time to ~~kill~~ beat some beastmen and claim back the surface. The great adventure has just begun. 
Like the narrator nearly every episode says:

> This is the tale of a man who has yet to realize what his destiny is

For all first time watchers, a quick note about episode 4: You'll notice that the artstyle is a bit different. That's because episode 4 was done by a guest director who brought his typical and distinctive artstyle with him (I don't remember his name; he directed Sket Dance for example). This is only temporary though (it caused a big uproar; the director said afterwards that reading the reactions on the web was "like putting your face next to an anus and inhaling deeply"), episode 5 will look normal again.
>> ARTICLE
So Yoko does actually like Kamina :)

These animals are gross...not cute at all

Yoko's face when she thought they were dead...

Seeing the "wimpy" side of Simon is annoying since we know he's going to end up fighting anyway lol but it's necessary 

Dig towards the heavens? Lol ok

"There's no real logic to it" fits perfectly with the theme of the show I'm guessing haha

LMAO just stabbed himself in the head haha but no worries it'll probably work because of *manly spirit*

Okay putting on the helmet was pretty cool :p

Yoko screaming out only Kamina's name this time..

Cool guy get a cape...gets even cooler lol

 Nice episode all in all, happy the fight was 1 episode long!

Alright, it's that time of the day again! So glad to be here, and hopefully I can provide even a modicum of the juicy reactions you rewatchers came for!


**Episode 3: You Two-Faced Son of a Bitch**

* I don't think I'll ever tire of this OP

* Well, glad to see Kamina being his old self again

* He got over the discovery of his father's death pretty quickly

* Don't be so hard on yourself Simon. Compared to Kamina, nobody is really that heroic ;)

* Ahh, it appears Yoko has not been able to keep herself from our glorious MC

* Looks like she wanted some, *one-on-one* time with aniki

* The rifle shoots arrows?

* Alright, there is no need to try to explain that with science. None of us are buying it

* Kamina already got the hang of it, no surprise

* Enemy?

* Oh hey! It's the creepy guy from the OP!

* The show's antagonist I'm assuming?

* So, what. Are you *not* human?

* Commander Viral huh? This clown things he can take on Kamima, hah!

* Haha, it's still alive

* Damn that's a long-ass [sword](http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo137/Darkwashu/1228877922930.png)

* "That bravado will get you killed" Well, yeah, if he was anyone else. This is the great and powerful Kamina we're talking about!

* Wow, that was some smooth swordplay there

* How does the mech's mouth synchronize with Simon's?

* Wow, that guy has good reaction time

* Woah, that mech is *way* bigger than the others

* Oh hey, Gurren is just as big, never noticed

* Yay, cannonball attack again!

* Aww, it failed :(

* Damn, that was a powerful laser attack

* He leaves at sunset? Perhaps something to do with his race

* No Yoko, Lagann belongs to Shinj- err, Simon

* [Look at this glorious bastard!](http://imgur.com/zanvXk6)

* Nice ass shot Yoko

* Well...that was impressive Viral

* Sweet, our first big mech fight!

* I swear, this guy is just a new age Shinji

* Aaaand, it works

* So, his anger controls Lagann? Maybe willpower

* Last resort? Even Simon doesn't know

* Yes! I knew it! They're gonna combine and make Gurren Lagann!

* I uhh....

* That's not how that works Kamina

* So Viral? Who needs brains when you have manliness!

* Oh sweet! Now they actually did combine!

* Gurren Lagann has been formed!

* Haha, "My helmet now bitch!"

* He said it!

* Obligatory "I underestimated you" scene

* Of course Leeron. That was the first thing that came to my mid as well.

* So...they won?

* Oh nice, some closure with his father

* Damn, he looks manly as hell with that cape

* And now they're leaving? Aww

* Oh good Leeron is coming with them!

* No, don't let her go

* Pls, turn around

* Well, I guess it won't be terrible to have a fanservice girl around

* I guess she is one of the few named characters

* Off to adventure!

*To be continued*

**Post-Episode thoughts**

All in all, it was a nice episode. Not really plot heavy, but plenty of action to keep me engaged. We also got introduced to who I assume is the show's antagonist, Viral. I have this feeling though as if after this, things are really going to take off. Almost like the adventure hasn't quite begun just yet
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 3**


It's cool seeing just how much Simon understands Kamina. We've seen stuff like this from kamina in regards to Simon, but this is one of the first times its presented from Simon's view of Kamina.


Aw, Simon is gonna be [third wheel](http://i.imgur.com/ZDDXYDx.jpg). And [again](http://i.imgur.com/RL7o3s5.jpg)


Enter Viral, my second favorite character behind Kamina!


Didn't realize Kamina was running around with [Sephiroth's sword](http://i.imgur.com/9uY6UNy.jpg)...


This is such a cool fight between Kamina and Viral, and one of the few gunmen-less battles in the series. 


I forgot just how FUCKING RIDICULOUS [this attack](http://i.imgur.com/1L6ki5O.jpg) is.


Viral is [such](http://i.imgur.com/ezLSSjA.jpg) [a](http://i.imgur.com/WgeVvRp.jpg) [badass](http://i.imgur.com/4hVNWsr.jpg). FILTHY NAKED MONKEYS, JUST DIE!


[Dammit Yoko](http://i.imgur.com/TlxUfkR.jpg) get your mind out of the gutter!


[This shot](http://i.imgur.com/XxBrbeh.jpg) kills me every time xD


Just realized I've forgotten to count how many times a character yells [BAKANA](http://i.imgur.com/CBknSE1.jpg) in this show...it gets to a pretty ridiculous number by the end. If i had to describe the series in one word it would be a pretty strong contender.

So far this was my favorite episode but I must say each ep just keeps getting better and I hope it stays that way.

Another really fun episode, although I am sad that it looks like we won't see any more derpy head mech action anymore.

**Episode 3**

* Man i like this opening.

* is the green tinted drill bot Simon's final form?

* Kamina "Gather around and let me tell you of what could be if you believed in the me who believes in you"

* Also wasn't everyone just kinda watching last episode? Do they need a retelling?

* He seems to be enjoying this story

* Yoko i just realised, what is around your neck? it looks like just a ring of fabric not even a scarf.

* Whadya know? Yoko can care? She seemed awfully indisposed during the battle last time. 

* Yoko its so simple. He wanted to, using his ~~glasses~~ newly gained manhood, see his father to prove to himself that he could. (i think)

* I forgot, was the little fur ball even named? i feel it was but i can't remember.

* BTW how did Kamina even get tattoos? The chief didn't seem like he'd allow such a thing. Maybe Kamina simply willed them into existence with his willpower.

* Two things, 1, if this place is such a wasteland how are you guys alive? What is Yoko hunting? Sand? I haven't seen any flora so there is no wildlife either? 2, Yoko, you seem awfully sure no more Gunmen will show up considering those things drop faster than the mechs in Titanfall. 

* "Rules" Why?

* And how dod they even transport water? Yoko doesn't seem to have much in terms of carrying capacity, so how did she hunt before?

* Yoko why the disappoint? Have you already fallen for best guy?

* Wow ok thats quite oasis for the middle of the desert.

* I don't know what that rabbit/dog/alligator thing is but i want one.

* Is..is that a hippo made of grapes? Cows with nose tentacles?

* Kamina seems bored with this sniping business. YOKO! Spice things up for our MC (sorry Simon)

* HOLD UP HOLD UP RIGHT NOW. That black turkey/ball sack thing was hit with an ARROW. Not a bullet nor energy pulse. An arrow. I'm no mechanic but I've yet to see a gun which shoots arrows.

* Yoko, again, no scientist here, but that explanation sounds like BS. Those arrows have a wooden shaft like, what would the electricity even do?

* How did they find out she was the best shot? Who used it before her? Were they just told to F off because some chick is a better shot? Is every other gun just as crap as we saw earlier?

* Simon WTF are you doing?

* Went from about to blow his family jewels off in one episode to master marksmen. Is there any weakness to best guy? ~~no~~

* Dodging arrows, packing heat. How was he not best guy against anyone?

* Wow Dr. Crane you look different

* Thank you for the exposition scarecrow

* And there is the Katana compensation scene.

* Kamina=Lawnmower of the Gods

* You fool! Kamina is a match for anyone and everyone.

* Good save Simon

* There you are Ms. "Best Shot"

* Awwwww yes time for some sweet mech action

* Ron= Mechanic of the Gods

* Tactician Kamina at your service

* Also, Yoko, did you expect to fight a gunman and bring appropriate ammo? What kind of shells do you even use because those bullets you were munching on last episode seems liked they would do a crap job.

* You tried Simon. Also Yoko should be dead. 

* Gurren even has the glasses down.

* Why yes he is wiping the floor with them Yoko. If only they had someone to help them out. Someone not in the heat of battle. With a long range weapon. If only.....

* Yoko i refuse to believe you haven't seen dozens of comrades fall in battle. PTSD aside you should be fine ~~unless Kamina x Yoko was real?~~

* "like your dad" wow that was a low blow simon. I recall a few times where you almost ended up like your dad as well.

* You tell 'em Kamina. Yoko decided to sleep as well i guess. She has had a *tiring* day after all. 

* Yoko you have done nothing to deserve to jack Simon's ride.

* "Ron calibrate" Where are they in terms of distance. I assumed there were at least 50+ miles away but Ron can apparently just take a stroll over.

* "Kamina speaks" Get rekt Yoko

* ok so they were apparently like 10 feet from the base?

* ummmm While that is a rather nice stance to take Yoko, as a sniper shouldn't you find a better sniper spot first? Also let Simon stare at you for a while. Worked last time to cure his Mech-rectile dysfunction

* Ron has the look of someone who knows everything but doesn't want to be rude so just kinda waits with his eyes for things to take their course. 

* Ok really what is the point of those guns? Surely everyone knows they don't do jack so i mean, why not scrap the metal into more Yoko snipers? Those at least *look* cool.

* Can scarecrow slow down gravity?

* Now I'm not going to rewind but Yoko did NOT take the previous shot in the valley where she currently is. 

* Yoko, like, ok you're at a disadvantage in terms of coolness because you have no mech. I can sympathise. But i really feel you're not giving this speech the emotion it should. 

* Simon has reached level 3. Gained+ 2 Skill points

* Jeebus scarecrow has a long neck. like, stupidly long. 

* The robots are lip synched with the masters, cool.

* Yoko i havent gotten a total grasp of your character yet but i don't think blushing would be anyones response to a combination. Also...
WHY ARE YOU NOT SNIPING ANYTHING!? ARE YOU HONESTLY USELESS TO THE PLOT RIGHT NOW!?

* Ron, i like you, a lot, but you forgot, where there's a Kamina, there's a way.

* oh Kamina.....

* wait wait oh boy OH BOY KAMINA AND CO. HAS LEVELED UP

* hey the "we punch each other" thing from Dragon ball, Naruto, and probably others.

* Also seeing as he is the opening theme guy, will we get a new villain now?

* hey hey Ron don't judge

* See Yoko, even when he's not prepping Gurren Lagann for a fight at least Ron has something interesting to add.

* wait did he just teleport? Also now isn't the base going to be under 24/7 attack seeing as he was a general or something?

* You best know better know Yoko.

* Their headquarters? Are all the gunmen a unified force? If so how are any humans left seeing as they (humans) have no firepower to stop gunmen, (as Yoko and new Team Gurren showed) 

* Well Ron while i love the idea of more of your shenanigans and exposition, is the rest of the base ok with losing their best mechanic?

* "Ron and Yoko aside" Ron you're already 2nd best guy in this series, no need to pressure yourself. Your closest competition (Simon) is pretty far behind.

* wait wait where/why are they walking? Are the mechs just gonna walk behind on autopilot?

* Ok ignoring Yoko's TsunTsun scene, 2 things. 1. again, how is the base ok losing such a vital member of themselves. She seems to have the best weapon they possess (still crud) yet here they are parting with it like nothing. 2, seeing as she's lived there a few years, wouldn't she have more belongings than that? I know a scene of her running home, packing, and trying to find Kamina and co wouldn't be pretty but still. Just spare bikinis would take up a larger space than that bag.

* "Cellar chick" Kaminas burns are so fierce we humans can't even understand them

* Ron, once again, with excellent commentary. 

And that concludes another episode of this amazing series. Curious as to why we just wrecked the guy in the opening song in episode 3. Kamina has only gotten more badass with his new great cloak (a famous woman once said, "no capes"). Simon is turning into a mini badass which is great. Yoko is useless but I'm hoping that will change. Ron still one of the best side characters ever. Combination shows just how much Kamina can bend reality to his will. Overall, we're in the rising action right now and its doing a good job of getting me hyped. Until tomorrow where the journey of MC Kamina, God Mechanic Ron, Maturing Simon, and Fully Matured Yoko continues!

>hey the "we punch each other" thing from Dragon ball, Naruto, and probably others.

It's a [Cross Counter](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossCounter), and as you can see from the screenshot in the article, the scene is a reference to Ashita no Joe.
>> ARTICLE

Viral said that they eradicate humans who come up to the surface. That implies that they leave the humans who stay in the underground vaults alive, as to why, you'll just have to keep watching.

Simon's pig-mole buddy? His name's Boota.

Episode 3

* I wonder how the OP will change when we finally move up the present time we saw in the first episode.

* Kaminas Stages of Grief: Shock, Acceptance, Story Time

* Kamina aint got the time nor the crayons to deal with this emotional baggage shit.

* [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/CxzqTE6.jpg) really makes me wonder. Why is she wearing a bikini? I mean, this isnt Kill la Kill, where theres a reason why shes so underdressed, so what gives? Maybe its global warming.

* [Why do anime characters always wave like their hands are marionettes?](http://webm.land/media/VQhx.webm)

* [Who am I? IM ~~BATMAN~~ HARVEY DENT!](http://i.imgur.com/Q6t8aWC.png) (Though Batman would actually work here.)

* [Kaminas about as dense as a harem MC.](http://webm.land/media/pQTW.webm) That, or he just doesnt care. (The T-Rex doesnt wanna be fed; he wants to hunt.)

* [Thats not really a rabbit, is it?](http://i.imgur.com/Y8itPAi.jpg)

* [Yep, were in the Avatar universe. Sucks all the Earthbenders apparently died.](http://i.imgur.com/v4gVdqa.jpg)

* [Well](http://webm.land/media/Fr5F.webm), I wouldnt call it ironic [so much as](https://youtu.be/DPjxN9O5zIM?t=10m35s)

* [Every time you hunt for food an animal suffers.](http://webm.land/media/8WXE.webm)

* Sure, give the dangerous weapon to the guy with no training, who has shown to have a reckless streak. [Im sure his natural coolness will](http://webm.land/media/S7uO.webm) Fuck

* [You know, besides your hands, you look pretty damn human yourself.](http://i.imgur.com/KqghFgh.jpg)

* [Okay.](http://webm.land/media/wCJU.webm) These [comparisons](http://webm.land/media/M7Fv.webm) are just getting ridiculous.

* Hahahahaha. [It just keeps getting longer.](http://webm.land/media/2AKn.webm) (Shut up.)

* Kamina: You dont need to think! You just need to believe in yourself! No, seriously, thats the philosophy were going with here.

* At least they acknowledge how adorably small Simons gundam is. (I know theyre technically called Gunmen. Ive just been brainwashed.)

* Since gundams are powered by confidence, does that mean Will Smiths character in After Earth could pilot all of them once? And did I just cite After Earth non-ironically?

* You ever wonder what inspires these guys to build ridiculously complicated and apparently easy-to-destroy mechas in all these shows? I mean, tactical nukes can do a fair amount of damage, too.

* Kamina: Simon, lets do the you-know-what!

* Simon: Wait, Leeron said something like that to me last night, and I didnt like it.

* The drill in Simons gundam seems to violate the laws of physics. Does he have some kind of portable wormhole for that thing to retract into?

* I see theyve mastered the art of running away. Yeah, the Trigger guys (I know this is technically Gainax) sure do like to have their heroes play the villainous-retreat card a lot.

* [See,](http://i.imgur.com/80QgBoJ.jpg) Code Geass? Now, [*thats*](http://i.imgur.com/woqRVJW.jpg) how you do a mid-episode card.

* [Did you see what Kamina just did to that meat?](http://webm.land/media/8ZlA.webm)

* Still looking forward to that famous version of the quote.

* Kamina: Pfffft! Girls cant pilot gundams. Theyre powered by manliness. Try losing that lower-right line on your second X-chromosome, and then well talk.

* [Kaminas eyes](http://i.imgur.com/ayinrfO.jpg) look more orange-red than purple in this lighting. ^Team ^Periwinkle ^4ever

* Yeah, I dont think I get it, but wed be honored. Congratulations on joining the Church of Scientology. Please hand over all your possessions to begin your ascension.

* Fucking Steve Blum as Leeron is like the best casting choice ever.

* Kamina: you sort of-human, sort of-animal freak!

* Viral: Look, man, my bear-mother was confused and lonely at the time, and shed had a few drinks

* On your feet! Well, technically hes always sitting. As are you.

* Simon: Come on, bro, lets give up!

* Yoko: Damn, son, even Ive got more balls than you.

* I believe I believe [I BELIEVE!](https://youtu.be/GVJgmp2Tc2s?t=1m40s)

* Would their [combining](http://webm.land/media/ozCR.webm) be in any way a precursor to a [TEAM DEATH MATCH?!](https://youtu.be/3KsATmF77BY?t=1m6s)

* Kamina was like [half a foot](http://i.imgur.com/nQ5HNVW.jpg) from running himself through the skull.

* [Lol. Literally all you have to do to combine is slam your gundams together and wish for them to fuse.](http://webm.land/media/ExqR.webm) The mechanics of this show are so ridiculously awesome.

* Alright, so the gundams operate under Kirby logic. Once you get ahold of the thing, you control its power. Sweet.

* [THIRD TIMES THE CHARM, BITCH!](http://webm.land/media/kz9j.webm)

* You know, that level head of yours is the only thing that keeps me alive. Bro, why you gotta say it like that?

* End it with Kamina showing he didnt just totally forget about his father, and lets call it a wrap.

* And Leerons going. Noice.

* Yoko, stop pattering around and just go with them. Dont act like you arent in the opening credits.

* Heh, she actually needed someone else to get her butt moving.

It took a few episodes, but Im really starting to get into this show. Im not saying that the first episodes were bad, not at all, but after having just watched the super-fast-paced first few episodes of Kill la Kill a few days ago, I had to let myself settle back in to a somewhat normal-paced start. But its already episode three and shits starting to kick off something fierce. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Did somebody say Team Death Match?
>> ARTICLE
> Why is she wearing a bikini? I mean, this isnt Kill la Kill, where theres a reason why shes so underdressed, so what gives?

The only reason I have ever been able to decipher is 'because boobs'. It's not a proper Anime convention until a hot Yoko cosplay walks past - Just don't kiss her.
>> ARTICLE
Freedom of movement, ostensibly. Not that a tank top wouldn't do the trick just as well, but anime.
>> ARTICLE
Because freedom of movement is so important when you are sniping prone. 
>> ARTICLE
Great Episode! The fight was really awesome. Kamina didn't even notice that the combination almost killed him.
The show is testing my resolve to watch only one episode per day.

Yoko's japanese VA sounded really familiar to me so I looked her up and found out she voiced Alicia Melchiott in Valkyria Chronicles. That game is one of my alltime favourites, no surprise that I liked Yoko from the start.
>> ARTICLE
One of the first key episodes of the series! Honestly, episodes 1-2-3 are pretty much combined as the series "introduction." We've now gotten our extended intro out of the way, met the true Gurren-Lagann and one of our main antagonists, and have a plot goal! Viral's fun. Also, so strange that just sticking Lagann into Gurren would work like that. I wonder why it happened...? 

I tell first time TTGL watchers the same thing I tell first time Madoka Magica watchers: Give it three episodes. Of course, I tell them that for very different reasons. 

Also, Dayakka proves that he is still the best Team Dad to ever Team Dad. 

In the next few episodes we meet some of my favorite characters. And yes, just a forewarning, the next episode *is* supposed to look like that. It had a different art director, and the results were... odd.

Oh yay Viral is introduced! I love how easily the tables turn on him. Despite how easily Kamina and Simon beat him after combining, he is just such a good character. Probs on of my favorite.

I'll probably stop joining this rewatch, as I really like this show so far, I don't think I can handle only one episode per day.

So I think I'm just going to go ahead and watch the rest on my own.

I SLEPT IN!!

**EPISODE 17**

* SHIT EVERYONES OLDER IN THE OP!!! It looks like Nia isnt human. Or shes got a split personality. And it looks like the guy from the first episodes opening scene could be older Simon. Maybe?

* 7 years... So that would make Simon about 21?

* They named the city after Kamina!!

* My questions in [one frame](http://i.imgur.com/TFYMeBs.png). No, wait. [This one too](http://i.imgur.com/YFjiiy7.png)

* I lied. [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/GvAIsmx.png) is the only question I really want the answer to. Also, sweet Kamina statue. [Alright](http://i.imgur.com/mB4DkYR.png). I wasnt *too* far off. I mean the grandfather thing was wrong. BUT I was right about him being [there to watch over her](http://i.imgur.com/IwD5AzU.png). *Specifically* her. Surely I get points for this

* [Oh, right](http://i.imgur.com/KqjtKJ4.png). Ive gotta rewatch that scene. Brb.

* Back. So there are three main parts. [1](http://i.imgur.com/8MNlgoK.png). [2](http://i.imgur.com/yA2kmiv.png). [3](http://i.imgur.com/h4RN3iF.png). [This is all PURE speculation. I could be way off, but Ill just write up whatever I think](/s "So for 1, I guess its about how the Spiral Power is more of a burden than a blessing. Maybe hell have to make choices that he wont want to. Im hoping this isnt the case... With 2, Im probably gonna just take it literally. So, when there is a population of a million humans. But I dont have a grasp on exactly how many humans there are so I could be completely wrong. And 3, the most interesting point. I dont know why the moon is so significant in this universe, but Im kind of inclined to take this literally too  mostly cause I keep thinking back to that opening scene from episode 1. Perhaps those words are a prophecy and the planet will be destroyed. And maybe thats why they were floating in space?") Please dont laugh too hard at how dumb this/I may be. Im very sensitive

* Her fairy floss hair is [back](http://i.imgur.com/8QbNbCy.png)!

* Being an adult [sucks](http://i.imgur.com/HWV6ipu.png)

* Guys, [I still think of him as a kid](http://i.imgur.com/6oXoMtO.png). BUT. Anime boys with long, tied-back hair are my greatest weakness.

* Aww, they made a [space program.](http://i.imgur.com/RXG1699.png) Look how far theyve progressed!

* Oh, [what](http://i.imgur.com/8rRkM3c.png)?!? Like, for spying?

* [Okay, cool](http://i.imgur.com/cMhPxv3.png). That answers that.

* [I cannot believe this.](http://i.imgur.com/ja2ytUd.png)

* [Girls](http://i.imgur.com/7yvPsgR.png), she was wearing a ring in the OP. Pay attention!

* [What a loser.](http://i.imgur.com/3PUmq9C.png)

* The older she gets, the [more clothes shes gonna wear](http://i.imgur.com/iNem50g.png)

* Haha, [these two](http://i.imgur.com/6cG3VHF.png) need to leave. Also wheres the third sister??

* 7 years later, and hes still [this adorable](http://i.imgur.com/cwTtZuQ.png)

* [Poor guy](http://i.imgur.com/9K0fxnD.png). Looks like hes had it pretty tough

* [ALL GROWN UP](http://i.imgur.com/vLF6P2d.png)!!! [YAAAY](http://i.imgur.com/Q8CnEcB.png)!!!

* [Hes defenceless](http://i.imgur.com/tRM9jEl.png)!!! Take him to Simon! Hold on. They [forced the humans](http://i.imgur.com/JaI0m24.png) to live above the ground??

* I still like Rossiu, but hes been acting a bit I dont know

* Yeah, I was starting to think that [this](http://i.imgur.com/FVu5jcb.png) would come up. And its so interesting that Rossiu is the one to deal with it considering how he grew up. [A bit more speculation](/s "I wonder if maybe the planet doesnt get destroyed and instead, Simon leaves in order to keep it safe? I mean, if hes the problem, then that might be a solution hed think of ")

* Oh! [There she is.](http://i.imgur.com/gR8NIjp.png)

* Please dont tell me this is gonna [result in some sort of coup](http://i.imgur.com/GSxGqDn.png)

* [Uh-oh](http://i.imgur.com/fiK5SUg.png)

* I dont think [thats](http://i.imgur.com/E6DhzAS.png) supposed to be there

* Just realised what [this is](http://i.imgur.com/mVUaYml.png)

* [Oh boy](http://i.imgur.com/JxEtvfM.png)

* [Uhh](http://i.imgur.com/7sCrJQl.png), is the moon getting closer?

* [Oh man](http://i.imgur.com/4dPRTVf.png)

* Is this the first time they refer to a Gunman as [a mecha](http://i.imgur.com/W2dW4ck.png)?

* [Thats unfortunate](http://i.imgur.com/49ncTkC.png)

* [Anti-Spiral race](http://i.imgur.com/cJoTcvk.png)??? Are you telling me that shes something that solely exists to destroy Simon?

* [This doesnt sound like any fun](http://i.imgur.com/1rPMy0k.png)

* Please let the end of [this sentence](http://i.imgur.com/AFawgZD.png) be: buy you a milkshake.

**EPISODE 18**

* [Hes bragging](http://i.imgur.com/o4s5DrT.png)

* [Yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/dbHszmo.png) Bring back the bad guy. Yeah. Thisll go great. Im sure thisll be just perfect.

* I know we should be worried, but [this](http://i.imgur.com/gGVdVZa.png) is so fucking cute.

* The other Gunmen dont have moving mouths :(

* [That](http://i.imgur.com/AHYRWLa.png) is fucking creepy

* Is the Row! Row! Fight the Powah! thing gonna stay? Hearing this for this many episodes, its no wonder its such a popular phrase. Fuck, its so catchy

* So, the Anti-Spirals fear [evolution](http://i.imgur.com/m6pMRXg.png), or the power to evolve, and so they destroy it? And this guy was [trying to stop the Anti-Spirals](http://i.imgur.com/XaG2Ps7.png). Does that make him a good guy? Is that why he stuck everyone underground? Now that theyre on the surface, theyre all evolving and the one million was like a limiter. If they exceed one million, the Anti-Spirals will consider them to have evolved too much and would try to stop them???

* WAIT A MINUTE! Is [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/9YWr1dH.png) the guy from the first episodes first scene??? I genuinely cant remember what he looks like, but if this were the case then that scene was, like, a flashback? Im so confused. Should I just go back and watch it? I kind of feel like thatd spoil it, but I feel bad that you guys are reading my consistently shitty theories

* So its specifically the [above-ground people](http://i.imgur.com/nnR8rpM.png) that count to the population and so thats why he had the Beastmen fight the people on the surface, to try and force them back under

* [Yet you understood it](http://i.imgur.com/4OyAjqf.png)?? Do you not know what incomprehensible means, Simon?

* [So the moons gonna fall, ey?](http://i.imgur.com/eqtp2pS.png)

* [Far](http://i.imgur.com/zI9zT5S.png). Do you know how excited they were about this?? Dicks

* [That](http://i.imgur.com/gLqD9bL.png) is one worried baby

* Ahahaha I just remembered the hot springs scene when Kamina told Simon that they should go to the moon. Well, good news! Theres no need for that anymore cause the moons coming to you!!

* [Ugh](http://i.imgur.com/8To5V26.png)

* I cant believe that [Gimmy became so level-headed](http://i.imgur.com/YnQSSWp.png)

* I cant bel-- No. You know what. I CAN believe [that that worked](http://i.imgur.com/bln1Rk7.png)

* Oh, [hell no](http://i.imgur.com/5oUV9sZ.png)!!

* Ohhhhhhh no. [Coup](http://i.imgur.com/XzBnnn9.png)? Yeah. [Coup](http://i.imgur.com/jT5Ufim.png).

Shits starting to get political! How exciting. Sorry, this one's so long!!

>> ARTICLE
Oh my fucking God, I'm watching some tiny newb nerdling watch TTGL for the first time.

You are in for one hell of a ride as you get towards the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Gimmy and Darry all grown up was probably the funnest progression for me. That and Viral assuming his true form ;)
>> ARTICLE
> Oh, what?!? Like, for spying?

"Satellite" just means something that's in orbit.
>> ARTICLE
> Is this the first time they refer to a Gunman as a mecha?

No. Back when they first combined, I think Kamina said that "From now on, the name of this mecha is Gurren Lagann!" 

> WAIT A MINUTE! Is THIS the guy from the first episodes first scene???

Go back and watch it. Somebody should seem familiar.


>> ARTICLE
Glad you're enjoying this part! Not everyone does but I did!

There are people who don't like this part? The timeskip is where it goes from "this is really really good" to "FUCK YEAH THIS SHIT IS AWESOME"
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same page as you, but some people argue it shoulda just stayed mind numbing it crazy and not gotten political because they didn't do it right and it got boring.  Totally wrong imo. I loved this section and the section following it
>> ARTICLE
> This is all PURE speculation. I could be way off, but Ill just write up whatever I think

Well, as you can already see you were quite close with the moon part.

> Her fairy floss hair is back!

And fluffier than ever.

>Oh, what?!? Like, for spying?

I think they meant 'satellite' as in 'something orbiting a planet'. As in the had no idea about planets, space, etc.

>Uhh, is the moon getting closer?

Well, it wasn't *yet* in that scene..

>Thats unfortunate

I think that's an understatement

>Bring back the bad guy.

Well, as we know already, he wasn't *that* bad. Or rather, he had his reasons.

>And this guy was trying to stop the Anti-Spirals.

Worth noting that when he said "There was once a man who fought as you do (...)" during the fight, he probably meant himself.

>Should I just go back and watch it?

I don't think rewatching something you already seen but don't remember well is bad. That scene isn't really that spoilerish and it'll make it easier for you to identify it when you see it.

>Yet you understood it??

Maybe he was just pretending XD

>Sorry, this one's so long!!

Don't apologize. The longer the better.
>> ARTICLE
> Well, as we know already, he wasn't that bad. Or rather, he had his reasons.

Yeah... He still acted like a jerk, but this is true

> That scene isn't really that spoilerish and it'll make it easier for you to identify it when you see it.

Cool. I'll do that then
>> ARTICLE
>* So its specifically the [above-ground people](http://i.imgur.com/nnR8rpM.png) that count to the population and so thats why he had the Beastmen fight the people on the surface, to try and force them back under.

I think it doesn't refer only to the above-ground people, because in that case, why would the government force them to live above?
I guess the beastmen forced the humans to live underground for having them controlled and locked.
Maybe that is a mistake of the translation?
I always thought that they lived underground for that reasons.


>> ARTICLE
That's never made much sense to me either. We specifically see the counter ticking up one at a time, even when all of those people underground who Viral was protecting get forced onto the surface.

So... who the fuck knows.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought the counter knew every single human alive, both above and underground. The Kamina City government was bringing them above ground so that they could personally count every human themselves (since the counter was for the moon/Anti-Spirals to use).

Like /u/Dag195 said, they were forced to live underground so that they could be controlled and locked away. There really wasn't any room for them to expand in those tiny villages so the total population would never be able to rise.
>> ARTICLE
> Like /u/Dag195 said, they were forced to live underground so that they could be controlled and locked away. There really wasn't any room for them to expand in those tiny villages so the total population would never be able to rise.

Simon's job in his village was to dig out areas in order to expand. I think Lordgenome is right in saying it is only the people on the surface, because when people are underground, they are unable to "reach for the heavens".

See, that's what I've always thought, but some of the translations directly mention humans living on the surface. But we don't see the counter skyrocketing when the humans are forced out after Viral's defeat so... who the fuck knows 
>> ARTICLE
I think the only explanation for that is that those humans weren't able to get below the surface yet, and thus the counter didn't change.
>> ARTICLE
> Ahahaha I just remembered the hot springs scene when Kamina told Simon that they should go to the moon. Well, good news! Theres no need for that anymore cause the moons coming to you!!
> 

I told you not to underestimate them.

>I cant bel-- No. You know what. I CAN believe that that worked

Think of it this way, shoot a few and they blow up taking ones around them with them and starting a chain reaction. Do this is a few areas and they all are safely disposed of.

That is actually very sound.
>> ARTICLE
Even this show has logic sometimes, though this will probably be the last time. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, look at Rossiu. He runs *completely* on logic and reason.

[spoilers](/s "too bad the universe he lives in doesn't do the same")
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "Even if it did, I would still say he's in the wrong.")
>> ARTICLE
> Are you telling me that shes something that solely exists to destroy Simon?

Not... exactly. Although this was probably discussed in the next episode (18), Simon is only human - but humans fall into a category of organisms known as a Spiral Race - a being that naturally generates spiral power and has a double-helix structure to their DNA. This power of evolution makes humans dangerous - they can spread faster and more effectively than any other organism, and the Anti-Spiral race feared that potential and set out to permanently control their population.

> WAIT A MINUTE! Is THIS the guy from the first episodes first scene???

It would be really easy to say too much here so I'm just going to answer with: No, that's not the same person.

> Ohhhhhhh no. Coup? Yeah. Coup.

Yeah this part was actually one of my favorite parts of the show. Rossiu gets a lot of hate but much like Lordgenome he is just doing the best with what he has.  I mean, kind of a dick move but an understandable one.
>> ARTICLE
So *all* humans have the Spiral Power??

And yeah, it's a bit of a dick move, but I don't see him as a bad guy
>> ARTICLE
Yes, all humans have spiral power. No, not all of them can access it, and very few can access it to the level Simon, Lordgenome, or even Kamina can. They're anomalies on the scale. For the vast majority, it just manifests itself as potential for evolution and inventiveness.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhhh, okay. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Speaking in respect to individuals like Simon and Lordgenome - Spiral Warriors, if you will - it serves as a ridiculously powerful source of what you could call "logic-defying" energy. That's the reason Gurren Lagann repaired itself when Kamina and Simon combined.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Kamina canonically has LOW spiral power.
>> ARTICLE
Compared to the "average person", however (that being the average civilian in the second half), he still has a decent enough ability. I ranked the three top-town, roughly speaking.
>> ARTICLE
Kamina always had enough Spiral Power to naturally *just know* that mecha are supposed to combine.
>> ARTICLE
Rossiu is complicated. The next two episodes, if you pay attention to the animation / voice actor, give a loooot of insight into what he's trying to do.

That was pretty good, at least from we've seen so far.

Er.

> Now that theyre on the surface, theyre all evolving and the one million was like a limiter. If they exceed one million, the Anti-Spirals will consider them to have evolved too much and would try to stop them???

From what I gather, that's pretty much it.

> WAIT A MINUTE! Is THIS the guy from the first episodes first scene???

Interesting thing to note there. Look who's on Lordgenome's shoulder.

I'm really starting to not like Rossiu.

I don't dislike him yet, but I kind of get this. He seems to be doing things for the greater good, but it's frustrating seeing how much of a hardass he's become. I guess, he's always sort of been like that. Now he has authority
>> ARTICLE
Fasten your seatbelts people! This is not even the beginning of Gurren Lagann's wild ride! The shit that will go down in these 10 eps is going to be amazing!  
Oh, and Rossiu^did^nothing^wrong
>> ARTICLE
> Rossiu^did^nothing^wrong

Unlike Homura.

Nah, joking. Everybody knows there is no third Madoka movie.
>> ARTICLE
Blasphemy.

The third Madoka movie is the best part of the whole series.

[spoiler](/s "It's the culmination of Akemi Homura, the true main character's, single minded desire to save Madoka at all costs, even if she had to sacrifice the world, her own existence, and force the person she loved to hate her. Madoka was too naive in her desires and believed that she could be a shield for everyone. Homura realized that was wrong and pulled the wool out from in front of her eyes. Homura's actions perfectly fit her character shown in the series. She never truly accepted Madoka's choice and when given a chance to change it she did.")
>> ARTICLE
Even if we assume that Homura's actions are fitting to her character, that still doesn't solve all the other problems, like for example the ones I mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/37vw9g/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_17_18/crqbw8x).

Though honestly, I'm not really in the mood to argue about that.
>> ARTICLE
The rules of the universe changed between the series and the movies because of Madoka's wish. She completely altered how the "magical" aspect of the universe worked and as a result the power dynamics and individual characters and choices changed.

Homura's power to control time meant that she was an anomaly within both universes because she was both effected and not effected by the individual rules of each and existed simultaneously between them.

In the series it's explained at the end that each time Homura reversed time she created a new timeline that set Madoka as the center and gave her more potential power. The reverse is also true, with each time she went back her own power grew stronger.

When Madoka's wish was made it rewrote the entire universe into a version where she never existed as a person and where witches do not exist. Her non-corporeal form existed as a mechanism to cleanse and kill magical girls before they became corrupted.

Homura however was not effected by this change because of her power. She was a being of the old universe within the new universe that remembered its old form. 

At the end she forced her own corruption into a witch in the presence of the Madoka entity and used the potential power stored within her to overwrite Madoka's wish. The Madoka entity didn't have jurisdiction over Homura's soul gem because it was an existence that predated its own. Homura shattered the Madoka entity into two separate beings, Kaname Madoka and the Madoka entity, and instated herself as a witch that was more powerful than the Madoka entity. She didn't "steal" Madoka's power.

The reason why I love Rebellion so much is because it's the culmination of an amazingly written flawed character's desire and her reveal as the true main character and antagonist of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, rare opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Which one? That Homura did something wrong? I suppose I can't really argue that she did seeing as I reject that the movie exist though..

EDIT: Or did you mean that Rossiu didn't?

EDIT2: So, I noticed I contradicted myself. Typing too fast. Fixed.
>> ARTICLE
No, I meant Homura.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, I just noticed I basically contradicted myself. That's what happens when you type first, think later. I'll edit it after I finish this.

Ok, so skipping the whole 'it didn't happen' approach.

Well, for starters she did the whole absurd plan with the Incubators (which really has no right of working. I mean how the hell do you shield someone from the laws of the universe?), then she stole Madoka's powers, then she basically re-created the world, re-wrote memories and I'm sure few more things I'm forgetting since I really tired hard to forget that movie.

I'm sure this counts as 'something' wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If by "something" you mean "the creators trying to milk the franchise for every last dime," then yes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, basically. I could do quite a big rant about things that are blatant retcon for purpose of fanservice, bringing back characters, introducing pointless characters (I mean, Bebe? WTF? Where did the writers get idea to even make character out of Charlotte) throwing show logic out of the window (yeah, let's say Homura was able to shield herself from goddamn laws of the universe. Brilliant!), and general bullshit (the whole Sayaka and Kyoko 'working for Madoka' or however that works, or Homura stealing Madoka's powers), but honestly, I think I have better things to do than getting angry at a shit movie. 

I guess it wouldn't bother me that much if the original series wasn't that damn good. It's like with Rebuild..
>> ARTICLE
> throwing show logic out of the window

Are you aware of which thread you're in?  Kicking logic out is what happens.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I'm talking about Madoka, not TTGL. "Throwing logic out of the window" IS TTGL's show logic.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe season two will make up for it?
>> ARTICLE
Wait, season two of what?
>> ARTICLE
But^liked^Rebellion
>> ARTICLE
Well, there is nothing wrong in liking a movie that doesn't exist.

Well, honestly there is nothing wrong with linking Rebellion, as long as you don't claim it's a logical follow-up to the series (because it sure as hell isn't). More of a spinoff really. 
>> ARTICLE
It clearly wasn't planned from the start
>> ARTICLE
At least not that sequel-bait ending.
>> ARTICLE
Rebellion, you mean?

I think it wasn't planned at all. It consists of fanservice (in the sense of bringing back characters, etc.), retconning, absurd, lack of logic and general bullshit.

The original series was brilliant. The two movies were lazy-man version, I can appreciate that. The third one was milking the franchise, and that's all.
>> ARTICLE
I swear if they don't continue though...
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean?
>> ARTICLE
Now that they have torn the original ending to pieces and we have Rebellion's ominous ending, they HAVE TO come up with a sequel. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'd rather pretend Rebellion didn't happen than have to deal with a sequel on similar level.

But really, last time around I forgave him once he did *that* from the next(or around that) episode
>> ARTICLE
Nah, not that soon. We have a while to go before any of the first time watchers will be forgiving Rossiu.

[TTGL endgame](/s "I mean, Simon does, and even leaves him in charge of everything, so...")
>> ARTICLE
Then again, isn't that what everyone in the Code Geass threads kept saying to you about Lelouch?
>> ARTICLE
If you watch the dub of both shows, Rossiu and Lelouch share a voice actor.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I outlined it to you in the other comment. I see Rossiu ultimately as having far more benevolent intentions and not sinking *nearly* as far as Lelouch did. 

[Rossiu arc](/s "Everything he does is because he's having to make ridiculously hard choices the entire way because the Anti-Spirals are just blockading each of his plans. He needs to quell the social unrest to get people into shelters, so he needs a scapegoat (and Simon is, to some degree, responsible, just not to the degree Rossiu makes him out to be). The shelters won't be enough, so he tries to get as many people on the Arc as he can. The Mugann attack while the Arc is boarding, so he opts to cut it short so that he can save the few people he can save. At each point along the way, you see him severely hating the fact that he's having to make these choices, as in his breakdown post-trial. And ultimately, Simon understands what he's doing and recognizes that the person capable of making hard choices like that is the person who deserves to be in charge.")

[Geass spoilers](/s "If Rossiu, say, turned people into mindless slaves to obey his every whim, he'd be a lot closer to Lelouch's level. Lelouch's death fundamentally does not erase all of his crimes. Rossiu certainly doesn't sink as far as Lelouch did.")

>> ARTICLE
I get all of that. But for some reason I just can't stop myself loving Lelouch more than Rossiu. Maybe I'm Geassed. Who knows?
>> ARTICLE
Well, Lelouch is the protagonist and is very theatrical and entertaining. Whereas Simon is the protagonist and Rossiu is opposed to him. So you naturally want to root for the protagonist against the person who's getting in his way.
>> ARTICLE
Hail fellow, well mets! Welcome back to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**. Timeskip time!

- Today's first **"Song of the Episode"** is ["The Blue Monday E"r"ectrical Parade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE2Qz09leqQ). I like how well this fits the mugann, it sounds very mechanical and techno.

- The second **"Song of the Episode"** for today is ["Somebody is Cursing Somebody Else"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwVHKwPiP2w). Kind of a spooky song but it fits this episode's tone.

As a bonus with the today's 2 **"Song of the Episode"**, I included the tune for the pre time skip eye catches and post time skip eyecatches.

- ["I Will Grasp - Love (I, II, III, IV)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH-UqaoJpD8).

Two facts today, nothing special!

- **"Like a Real Princess"**: It has been stated in an interview with the creators that during the 7 year time skip, Nia travelled the world "like a real princess".

- **"He looks familiar"**: You may or may not have noticed but that [little creature on past Lordgenome's shoulder](http://i.imgur.com/9VSvMiB.jpg) is actually [Guame](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/208/3/8/Guame_the_Immoveable_by_TheGreatMatsutzu.jpg). I don't remember if it was explicitly stated but at some point Guame infers that he's been with/known Lordgenome the longest out of all the generals.

These first 2 post time skipe episodes may feel really slow and but don't worry, keep watching. I also wanted to point out that everything has a face still, all the buildinds, cars, even in a later episode you'll see that a TV has a face. I'm just saying, they're everywhere. See you all tomorrow for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.
>> ARTICLE
I find it hillarious that in the same interview, when asked about their relationship, the creators stated that in the past seven years, "Simon and Nia did what had to be done".

We also have Word of God that neither of them are virgins by the end of the time skip. Simon may have taken 7 years to work up the courage to propose, but he did manage to work up the courage to tap that.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, Word of God only said they "did what had to be done".  It can be inferred but it's not 100% for certain.

I guess that's what I get from using TVtropes as my reference... three years ago.

Still, there's not much else that that can mean, [spoilers, bitch!] ( /s "which is some consolation, considering that they didn't exactly get a chance to consummate their marriage")

Yea I'll give you that, I like to leave it for interpretation like the creators probably wanted. I can't tell you what believe, that's your own choice.

**Episode 17**

So yeah I'm not really used to timeskips since I haven't watched much anime with them bit wow are they ever interesting

I've had a few things spoiled for me this series but that wasn't one.

So many things in this opening too, feel like I shouldn't have watched it...

Naming the city after Kamina nice!

Love seeing all these couples...would have love to see those 7 years and how close they got

Gimmy and Darry wow 7 years they look all grown up!

Rossiu is getting pretty annoying but reasons I guess

Secret glasses society?

Not Nia :(

I don't like this episode anymore...

**Episode 18**

Rossiu and these secrets...WHAT?!

Nia's voicemail...she's great

Gurren posed like him :p 

It's not Nia...but it is arrggh I don't like this

Ugh the populace...

This is so frustrating!!




>> ARTICLE
I am worried about those things spoiled to you. Kamina's death was one and the others may be as bad.

About the opening, don't worry. We all knew since Kamina said it that they would reach the moon at some point, it also doesn't spoil anything major (Besides well.. the time skip).

At least long hair Nia is back!
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going into most of the series blind. There's only like 2 things left that I sadly know.

Yeah that's good to hear about the OP. I should have skipped it but that song is just so good...

And yeah Nia's hair is back but I would have loved to gotten more time with little Nia and Simon, they were so cute together and adorable...missed out on all that :(

Episode 17

* New OP imagery.

* [Fucking ANOTHER time skip.](http://i.imgur.com/OnnxyGJ.png) And a big one this time. In case you guys havent figured it out yet, Im not the biggest fan of time skips. They seem like a weak way to avoid having to write decent plot progression. Hell, a multi-year-long montage would have at least been nice.

* Im glad they kept Simons voice actor to voice the teenage version of him. I hate when they cant be bothered to get a VA who can do slightly older versions of young characters.

* Kamina City *and* a [statue?](http://i.imgur.com/Gy5g0Gt.jpg) Kick ass.

* [Well, there goes my Old Simon theory that wasnt really a theory so much as a bad running joke.](http://webm.land/media/g9RB.webm)

* [Oh, shit.](http://webm.land/media/pyLT.webm) This is gonna be a Death Note scenario, where the second half of the series is extremely pretentious and aggravating. (Seriously, fuck Mello and Near.)

* [Aww](http://i.imgur.com/ZUkAzzj.jpg) I liked short-hair Nia

* [Grown-up Simon](http://i.imgur.com/OWpsByj.jpg) reminds me of Maou from The Devil is a Part-Timer.

* Remember what I said earlier about how I dislike when they swap out character VAs for the grown-up versions? I have to say, Nia is an exception. Ill miss Starfire, but the new actress actually does a pretty damn fine job of sounding exactly how Id expect a more matured Nia to sound. Did you know that Bridget Hoffman is the woman featured on The Evil Dead theatrical poster? (Let the Sub MasterRace comments flow in.)

* Im so glad that she still has retained some of her awkward speaking patterns, what with constantly avoiding using contractions most of the time.

* Come on, Rossiu, humor the poor girl. Im sure shes made a slight improvement in these several years.

* [New type font again.](http://i.imgur.com/Q8nDMbS.png)

* Remember a few episodes ago when /u/franklyn26 asked how in the hell they would get to the moon? [This is pretty damn close.](http://webm.land/media/bUeB.webm)
* [AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH](http://webm.land/media/DbuG.webm)

* I wonder what ancient dictionary they found for satellite to be a word they use.

* Heheheh. I love how one million people is a big deal for these guys. There are more people than that living in my city. And I live in Nashville.

* Use the Organization to do it. HOLY SHIT! OKABE WASNT LYING!

* [Thats actually just a shot of a real Japanese McDonalds.](http://i.imgur.com/jMLC8kj.jpg)

* [First, how the hell did that guy become a successful restaurant owner? Two, I fucking love that waitresss look, behind him.](http://i.imgur.com/eqzOdVF.jpg) She is so over hearing his shit.

* [Apparently several of the waitresses are fed up with this prick.](http://i.imgur.com/Bs64suq.jpg)

* Even in this show, [exposition cant be avoided.](http://webm.land/media/ua8J.webm)

* [Now, for some reason, *she* looks odd with short hair.](http://i.imgur.com/gGAXUIl.jpg) Eh, Im sure Ill get used to it.

* My eyes would be your eyes Oh, so Simon just wants a taste of that sweet, sweet eye-flower action. What a busta.

* [Ooooooooooooh, shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!](http://webm.land/media/Sy0s.webm) I actually verbally said Ooooooooh! when I heard that.

* [Ah, see?](http://i.imgur.com/kUyNOzp.jpg) Ive already gotten used to her new look. Its nice.

* Lordgenome must have been hoarding a lot of fairly modern technology at the Teppelin for them to have been able to mass-produce [phones](http://i.imgur.com/5RsVH7l.jpg) in only seven years.

* [BOOOOOO!](http://i.imgur.com/BeXCTKn.jpg) LAAAAAAAAAME! New outfit leaves way too much to the imagination!!! 0/10  IGN

* I love how pretty much the only difference in Yokos voice to show that shes aged is that it doesnt crack quite as much as it used to.

* I was actually yelling, JUST SAY YES! during [this scene.](http://i.imgur.com/ZhIl1zZ.jpg) I am officially a pussy.

* [Im noticing a lot of gunmen faces on various buildings.](http://i.imgur.com/Xut5Ffa.jpg) I wonder if they have gunmen built into them that can be activated in case of emergency.

* Simon: I need to go fight!

* Rossiu: You have political responsibilities now, sir!

* Simon: Yeah, but Im hoping theyll recast me as the president in Independence Day 2 if I try this! Ill get to hang out with Jeff Goldblum and Brent Spiner!

* [Whose bright idea was it to give Gimmy a gunman?](http://i.imgur.com/C9dnRlE.jpg)

* [Its like they knew almost nobody would remember these characters names.](http://webm.land/media/sjJ1.webm)

* Bastard! Hey, watch the language! (Insert Avengers 2 joke here)

* [Well, that was kind?](http://webm.land/media/Bjhn.webm)

* Aw, man [Please dont tell me Rossiu is gonna end up becoming the political hard-ass that opposes Simon.](http://webm.land/media/VKJJ.webm) He was so cool.

* [Yep, were doing this thing.](http://webm.land/media/DLH3.webm) Shit.

* [This has just become a larger version of what was happening in Rossius old tribe.](http://webm.land/media/GnQH.webm) I though we made a point that that way of thinking is extremist and flawed?

* [Dude, whatd I just say?](http://webm.land/media/bmPF.webm)

* Wow, I pretty much just showed that entire scene in four parts. Huh.

* Yeah, you know what? When [you arrogant assholes](http://i.imgur.com/Cy3gazV.jpg) manage to tap into what-the-fuck-ever and bring about the destruction of humanity, Im not gonna feel sorry for you. Enjoy getting your asses handed to you. Congratulations on ruining episodes-worth of me liking you in just a few minutes. That takes effort.

* [Okay, so I guess this is gonna be a thing now.](http://webm.land/media/W2jL.webm)

* Sure [Thats in no way ominous.](http://i.imgur.com/kYmX5zg.jpg)

* [Seriously, Im getting some majorly uncomfortable vibes here.](http://webm.land/media/6EtL.webm)

* [Okay, what the fuck?!](http://webm.land/media/0LbT.webm)

* [SEE?!](http://webm.land/media/s1iA.webm) I told you it would be straight-up Majoras Mask on this bitch!

* [What the hell is going on?!](http://i.imgur.com/F4bfHcy.jpg)

* [Oh, I get it now.](http://webm.land/media/VKgg.webm) That counter was monitoring how many humans there were on Earth. And thats why it appeared immediately after the baby was born. Man, you guys suck at census-taking.

* Holy shit, Im posting a lot of fucking WebMs this episode.

* Theres no face! Its hilarious that they have no idea that you can build a giant machine *without* a face.

* You know, its actually kind of exhilarating to see their weapons have no effect. Especially after seeing how smug and sure-of-themselves they were a few minutes ago. I am worried about Simon and Nia, though.

* Darry: Gimmy!

* Gimmy: Im okay! Thankfully my gunman comes equipped with plot armor. Unfortunately for those other poor bastards, this isnt a Narita work.

* [You guys are dumbest fucking smart people Ive ever seen.](http://webm.land/media/nZi4.webm) And I had to put up with Nina Einstein. Its not about tech-quality. Its about willpower! Listen to your big bro, and stop being a bitch.

* Simon: Dumbass! Peace has cost you your broness. Victory has defeated you.

* [Er](http://webm.land/media/xMKF.webm) You saved more lives in the long run?

* [Ah, bro](http://i.imgur.com/3ZCrxDp.jpg) Why you gotta be a dick and possess her of all people? I know her hair makes her stand out, but you dont gotta go and do that.

* [The Anti-Spiral Races, huh?](http://webm.land/media/a5gP.webm) So, these guys oppose Spiral Energy? What, are they afraid their weak-ass fighting spirit will be revealed if they dont destroy it?

* New ED, too, and this includes a new song.

* And now Rossiu is doing the preview.

Is this why so many Redditors are pro-eugenics?

Eheheh.

Never stop. Go dubs!
>> ARTICLE
WE ARE THE ONE PERCENT!
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly the thread for this, but real quick...

I just don't prefer the subs over the English dub. I've watched some subs, and they're enjoyable, but I can't actually decide if they're good or bad. I do not speak Japanese. Because I'm not familiar with the language, I don't know if the way they're speaking is correct. A lot of the voices end up sounding the same too, especially high pitched female ones. I'm also forced to read the subtitles so I can't fully focus on the artwork.

**tl;dr** Not saying subs are bad, I personally just don't enjoy them as much because I don't speak the language.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention, watching dubbed can occasionally give you hilarious scenes [like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKpZvO0j6RI)
>> ARTICLE
This scene was ridiculous. I saw it in Japanese first or maybe as a gif, but when I first saw it with the English dub it was just too weird/funny.

Good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Watching the movie dubbed is also hilariously surreal. Because so many of the jokes rely on them not being able to speak English well, they actually had to get the English VAs to speak Japanese a few times to emphasise the point.

Wouldn't Simon be in his early 20's at this point?

I think these buildings were made from the stuff that dropped from the giant Teppelin gunmen, which I think were the buildings of the city of Teppelin.

He has voiced so many of my favorite characters in video games (Haseo, Yosuke and Luke to name a few.) that finding out he was the voice of Simon made me rewatch the whole series in English. I could not be more happy that they picked him for the job. If they had replaced him I would've been really mad.

It's especially funny watching this arc after watching Code Geass. JYB and Yuri Lowenthal at odds once again.

I haven't watched Code Geass, but... you're telling me that JYB is there as well!? Holy shit what is with these two!? Luke and Guy, Yu and Yosuke, Haseo and Kuhn, Simon and Rossiu... and now this? I was planning on whatching code geass, and now I'm tempted to watch the dub just for these two...

Yup, JYB is the protagonist Lelouch, and Yuri is Suzaku, his childhood best friend / now enemy ace pilot.

>This has just become a larger version of what was happening in Rossius old tribe. I though we made a point that that way of thinking is extremist and flawed?

In all fairness, that was a conclusion Simon himself came to. All Rossiu was trying to do was get an accurate count so that they would know *when* it was going to happen.

> Im noticing a lot of gunmen faces on various buildings. I wonder if they have gunmen built into them that can be activated in case of emergency.

I think, culturally speaking, they just put faces on everything because that's what they do.

They're called Grapearls. They're each based on Gurren Lagann. Techncially speaking, they're far superior in combat. (Take note how of easily they defeated Viral.)

Episode 18

* Narrators back.

* I will say again, the Humanity Annihilation System has been activated. Hey, you said Extermination System the first time! Make a choice a stick with it!

* [This whole monologue is hilarious.](http://webm.land/media/96JP.webm)

* [Ah, if only it was that easy.](http://webm.land/media/EBJW.webm)

* Rossiu: This time youre gonna tell me everything. Tell me the secrets of this world. And dont you dare say forty

* Lordgenome: Forty-two.

* Rossiu: Thats it; youre going back in with the electric eels.

* [I hope these two little shits get roasted alive by an Anti-Spiral beam.](http://a.pomf.se/zyiyth.mp4) OF COURSE A BIG BATTLE IS COMING, YOU DUMB CUNT! DID YOU NOT JUST HEAR WHAT THE POSSESSED LADY SAID?!

* Thats just him thinking of himself. Well, fuck you, too, asshole.

* [Well, thats a matchup I didnt expect.](http://i.imgur.com/IZ3wjb7.jpg)

* [Thats not creepy](http://i.imgur.com/sC2yKHk.jpg)

* Do you have a fever or something? Uh-huh. Talking about the Spiral Nemesis, teleporting, referring to herself as we. Im sure its just a fever. Brilliant deduction.

* Satsuki: What is a humans most primal emotion, Rossiu?

* Rossiu: Joy?

* Satsuki: Fear.

* Pretty sure I butchered that quote.

* So, from what Ive gathered, the Anti-Spirals' fear is that Spiral Power will evolve life so much that population size will explode to a point where all natural resources in the entire universe will be used up, thereby resulting in the assured death of all life in the universe. So, basically, the Anti-Spirals are Reapers.

* [I guess thats why Lordgenome kept having to toss his children once they became too self-aware.](http://webm.land/media/tBd3.webm) Their only purpose was to act as a beacon to humanity for the Anti-Spirals should he ever lose his position. Who wants to be the one to tell someone who considers them a father that theyre practically a sentient android?

* [Alright, alright, enough with the Majoras Mask crap.](http://webm.land/media/4vc7.webm)

* Oh, thank God that people know about this threat immediately. Who gives a fuck about panic? In three weeks, your asses are history; you need all the help you can get, you arrogant fuckweed.

* The defense system has been activated, I have become an Anti-Spiral, and I can never again be made human. *This* is the character you were all cheering as best girl? Like, yeah she was adorable while it lasted, but she straight-up said that she can never be changed baWhat the hell am I talking about? This is Gurren Lagann. Logic has no place here. Shell be back to normal by like episode 20.

* Mugann? Seriously? That was the best you could come up with for the things that plan on wiping out your entire civilization? It sounds like a gunman a cow-like beastman would pilot.

* What the hell are those two talking about? Dont pay them any mind. They just marathoned Star Trek and are trying to out-nonsense each other.

* Gimmy: Our normal attacks arent working! Were just making things a lot worse! What do we do?

* Darry: Just shut up and keep acting like an idiot, so you can make Simon look even cooler. (Seriously, these two get on my fucking nerves.)

* [This is like playing Galaga on Extreme Mode.](http://webm.land/media/7d8j.webm)

* [Oh, shut the fuck up and quit your bitching.](http://i.imgur.com/qk5qbM4.jpg) If it werent for him, you would all be guaranteed dead. So deal with it or get lasered to the face. Your choice.

* [Rossiu:](http://i.imgur.com/KIKYolu.jpg) Alright! Which one of you smart-asses is named David?! Come on, fess up!

* [This bitch totally wants his nuts.](http://webm.land/media/ey4S.webm)

* [Is constantly readjusting your glasses part of an anime characters job description?](http://i.imgur.com/SkjvzQP.jpg)

* Rossiu: Someones gotta be the scapegoat. Thats how government works.

* [This is gonna be another Betrayal, isnt it?](http://i.imgur.com/iG8aay3.jpg) At least this time, /u/EditorialComplex will agree with me that its unwarranted.

Oh fuck me, that would be so fucking cool. They'd ruin a large part of their city, but whatever. Having nearly every building activate at the same time and take off together. Kick ass.

It's not like they would do any worse damage than the Anti-Spiral would, anyway.

I think that has more to do with not wanting to deal with his children inevitably rising up against him thinking they are in the right, like Simon&co.

It's Jinrui Zenmetsu System both times in the original. Annihilation would be the most direct translation.

You wish it was that simple.

>So, from what Ive gathered, the Anti-Spirals' fear is that Spiral Power will evolve life so much that population size will explode to a point where all natural resources in the entire universe will be used up, thereby resulting in the assured death of all life in the universe.

I'm not sure it it's the population/resource thing, or if they fear that the spiral power can just literally 'destroy' the universe if it advances too far.

>I guess thats why Lordgenome kept having to toss his children once they became too self-aware. Their only purpose was to act as a beacon to humanity for the Anti-Spirals should he ever lose his position.

[Mhh, this might be a slight spoiler, so..](/s "I'm quite positive that Lordgenome had no idea Nia was a messenger, nor had he any contact with Anti-Spirals. I think it's mentioned somewhere that 'it was a coincidence she was born as a daughter of a spiral warrior', the warrior being Lordgenome")

>Mugann? Seriously?

This makes sense when you consider that "Mu" is reading of kanji for "nothing, not, emptiness", and in the first fight someone calls them "no-faced bastards". The second kanji is probably  ('kao'), same as second kanji in Lagann (let's skip why it's read completely different), which means face. (Bonus, 'ganmen' literally means 'face').

>Is constantly readjusting your glasses part of an anime characters job description?

Do you wear glasses? It's really not that unnatural, I do this all the time. In anime they have just great timing with those.

Pretty much. 

>Oh, thank God that people know about this threat immediately. Who gives a fuck about panic? In three weeks, your asses are history; you need all the help you can get, you arrogant fuckweed.

Though, having mass riots and needing to waste resources on keeping peace can't be helpful when you ALSO need to focus on how to keep humanity alive.

>This is gonna be another Betrayal, isnt it? At least this time, /u/EditorialComplex will agree with me that its unwarranted.

Is it? Simon's recklessness directly endangered the city (see what happened when he destroyed the first Mugann). I mean, not saying  that arresting the guy is the right thing to do, but clearly he's causing a lot of collateral damage in how he does things. 

I'm not going to say too much on Rossiu yet, but when you think about why he's doing what he's doing, he's clearly working to save as many people as he can. 
>> ARTICLE
Rossiu should know better than trying to solve problems with logic and reason, though: think about all he's seen up until now? When was following Simon's or Kamina's lack of a plan ever a bad idea? Notable exception being when they actually *did* make a plan, obviously.

But on to the Episode

**Episode 17**
---


In seven years things have changed, Simon is now "Supreme Commander" and all of the initial members of Team Dai-Gurren are now in political positions, and almost everyone except Leeron Russio and Simon are not fitting their position, especially Jorgun and Balinbow. Also tension rises between the members of Dai Gurren. 

Looks like the head of Jiha Village adapted quite well to the changes, and it looks like he is [still not very liked](http://i.imgur.com/2TdAjJX.png) by the ones who work for him, [Kittan saw right through him.](http://i.imgur.com/czRvBYf.png)

Sorry for all the Kiyoh fans [your best girl is someones else Waifu](http://i.imgur.com/s7b1ZLL.png), but atleast she is happy so be happy for her too.

[Why does everyone in this anime look so fucking badass?](http://i.imgur.com/IcCRFR7.png) And thank you to all those that made me realise that Guame is sitting on Lordgenomes shoulder in this picture I missed it the last two times I watched this.

The last episode is so fucking hard to sit through... 
I know I shouldn't hate Russio so much because he tries his best to not let the situation escalate but still I don't like the way he does it even if it's the (maybe) only method to do all this.

Rossiu forgot all the evidence he had seen of how the world he lives in works, and forsook willpower for logic.

**WELCOME CHILDREN, TO THE TIMESKIP!!**
 
Easily my favorite part of TTGL. I love the character designs from this point onward (not that I hated them before), but prepare, because now is the time for shit to go *down*. 

My boy Viral is now in his [prime state](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs39/300W/f/2008/326/1/b/viral_by_piote.jpg) and I'm hoping that everyone we'll start to see how *great* of a character he is.

I'd love to hear what people think of the characters now that 7 years have passed? *Especially Mr. Forehead*.


>> ARTICLE
I miss the old characters! They were cute and fun...now they're old and serious.

Going to take a bit of getting used to but will say it's really cool to see the characters all aged and which have come together etc.
>> ARTICLE
The only slight problem I have with the characters aging so rapidly is the lack of plot expansion showing what happened during that time. For me, just skipping forward and having someone narrate the past few years always felt lazier than actually showing them, at least bits and pieces.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, actually showing Human society adapting to surface life, building up a civilization etc. would completely wreck the atmosphere and pacing of TTGL.

It'd be interesting to watch, sure, but simply put this is the wrong show for it.

And this comes from someone who absolutely loves the whole sociological/political/economic aspects of - for example - Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
Other than the building of Kamina City, I'm not sure all that much else went on in that stretch? I suppose I don't have an argument against it being lazy, but you have to think about what a waste of energy it would have been to write out 7 years of relatively insignificant content.
>> ARTICLE
>I don't have an argument against it being lazy,

Show, don't tell. 

They built a city, formed a government, and began living comfortable lives. Simon became Supreme Commander, their manufacturing capabilities jumped exponentially, Viral became a grizzled outlaw fighting "man" in a surprising role reversal, all the senior members of team Dia-Gurren find themselves in cushy appointments they are all ill suited for (save for Roussou who's become embittered by the similarities between his past village life and current situation), Diaka's an expecting father with the eldest Black sister, and Yoko is MIA.
>> ARTICLE
All of those points have quick explanations, though? There's no point in adding in what would probably only amount to a couple episodes of content to explain all of that.
>> ARTICLE
And now we have a 50 episode series. 

One of the great things about TTGL is its breakneck pace. Would some of that (hell, a lot of it) have been interesting to see? Yeah, sure. But As it is, we only need a little bit of exposition and we're off to the races.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a big fan of the time skip. I think the transition was supposed to be jarring, and outlining a gradual progression would rob you of the "holy shit" impact of seeing what they have accomplished is such a relatively short time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah really.  It's been only *seven* years.  What they did is *impossible* in seven years.  Having to show it would be *beyond* impossible.

SO YEAH IT HAS TO HAPPEN.
>> ARTICLE
> My boy Viral is now in his prime state and I'm hoping that everyone we'll start to see how great of a character he is.

>> ARTICLE
I know they show other people working on the Kamina statue, but the creators of the show apparently said that Simon built the whole thing himself using his drill. Canon or not, I think believing that is how it was made is way more badass, and quite fitting for Simon.

First timers **DO NOT** read the linked article. There are a lot of spoilers.

[Here's the link to the article where I read about it.](http://www.japanator.com/the-secrets-of-gurren-lagann-answered--6714.phtml) Not sure how reputable the site is, but it seems they just took notes from a panel where the creators were talking about the show.

Rossiu was always a bit weird but those seven years turned him into a real twat, on the brighter side everyone else is pretty damn amazing although I'm disappointed in the lack of older Yoko.

>> ARTICLE
My god, I just realized that in the next few posts I'm going to become to the TTGL rewatch what all the Lelouch defenders were to the Code Geass one. How horrifying.

ANYWAY, we've hit the second half of Gurren Lagann! Things sure are different, now. This was the point, during my first rewatch, where I legitimately fell in love with the series. Before, it had been pretty cool and fun, but this is the arc where it focuses more on characters and their relationships and just gets awesome.

Tonally, we're totally different. TTGL can be viewed as a love letter to the history of mecha anime, and the first half was unmistakably "super robot," aka magical mecha running on hot blood fighting monsters. This half takes a sharp swerve towards the "real robot" genre, where robots are military tools, politics and character relationships drive the plot, and there aren't any more "monsters of the week." (Don't worry, though. This is still TTGL, at its heart a super robot show).

Humanity has advanced incredibly in the seven years since Teppelin's fall. Technology only gets better and better. But the members of Team Gurren aren't very suited for this new life. Rossiu, on the other hand, is well suited to the role of running a government. Perhaps TOO well-suited. 

Dayakka has ceased to be Best Team Dad and instead is now just Best Dad. He and Kittan are now brothers-in-law. Yoko has gone off on her own (I bet that's the last we'll ever see of her, right?) and Gimmy and Darry are now pilots and soldiers. Everything's different.

We meet our new enemy, the Anti-Spirals! We get explained just what the hell Spiral Power is! The earth is gonna be destroyed by the moon! Oh shit! 

And with Simon now under arrest, how will our heroes ever defeat these mysterious new enemies?

(Incidentally, look at the brief shot of past!Lordgenome during his explanation to Rossiu in episode 18. Do you see who's on his shoulder? It's an animal version of Guame. Yes, Guame was to Lordgenome what Boota is to Simon, which is why he got so much more freedom to act and talk back to the Spiral King than the others did.)

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh... I don't know. [Code Geass Spoilers](/s "Lelouch purposefully got people to hate him, so as to then unite in harmony with his death.") By putting all the blame on Simon, Rossiu is doing pretty much the opposite of that.

[Geass + TTGL spoilers](/s "Lelouch also was responsible for the deaths of millions, enslaved people to his will, went through almost the whole thing with fundamentally selfish motives (Nunnally + revenge) and only found a way to get some form of redemption at the very end. Rossiu, on the other hand, spends his entire arc trying desperately to save people no matter what, his motivations are almost completely altruistic, and regrets pretty much all of the actions he's forced to take - see the flashback in episode 23 after Simon's kangaroo court where he's breaking down in tears. In short: Lelouch does the right things for the wrong reasons, Rossiu does the wrong things for the right reasons.")

I don't know how i feel about these eps they were not bad but it was all setup really.

> Dayum Dayakka didnt know you had it in you.

Funnily enough there was a bit of potential foreshadowing for this before the timeskip, in that Kiyoh took over piloting his Dayakkaiser after he started commanding Dai-Gurren.

I'm assuming level 1 was "they are a spiral race at all".

>Why they got to ruin the characters I like.

Who do you mean? Rossiu?
>> ARTICLE
yep.
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be honest I quite like what they did with the character. At least it seems somewhat realistic and not out-of-character in my opinion (well, he didn't get much characterization before timeskip, but still), and it's good to have some 'inside' opposition to Simon.

Though I understand how can you feel if you really liked the character. I guess you should brace yourself for the upcoming episodes..
>> ARTICLE
Oh i agree it is very fitting i just don't like it.
>> ARTICLE
> Why they got to ruin the characters I like.

Tell me about it...
>> ARTICLE
Nia was the highlight of these two episodes. Shivers down my spine on her Anti-Spiral scenes.

Nia's not cute anymore. 0/10

Boota has matured a lot though.

Rossiu should look wimpier.

Viral needs a haircut.

Rossiu? More like [Fei Fong Wong](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173941/4229613-2460913701-Fei_F.jpg).

I think the few timeskip episodes were the ONLY chink in TTGL's otherwise flawless armor.
>> ARTICLE
u crazy brah

these episodes are where it starts to go from 'fuck that was good' to 'oh fuck this is *incredible*'
>> ARTICLE
Just the one-two episodes that really break the flow
>> ARTICLE
I've finally caught up!
>> ARTICLE
This is where I dropped the series the first time. The coup completely killed the show for me and I've had 0 motivation to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
But this arc is where things really get over the top and AWESOME.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to keep up with the rewatch. My original watch was over a year ago. First it was on hold for a little while, but then I just never went back to finish it
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. Yes. I freaking love Chouginga Gurren Lagann, it's my favorite. "Transcedent Super Spiral Dreadnought Gunmen Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann", what a fucking cool name for an equally cool mech. We're almost there guys, I've really enjoyed our time together and I'm sad the rewatch is almost over. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

- Today's first **"Song of the Episode"** is ["Libera Me From Hell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE). This is the song, this song is amazing. Below I'm gonna explain some things about the song itself.

- Today's second **"Song of the Episode"** is ["How's it! My Trumpet is Awesome, Right!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPdq9xHAS5c). The Anti-Spiral's theme.

- In addition to today's **"Songs of the Episodes"**, I've got a couple honorable mentions.

- ["With Your XXX, Pierce the Heavens!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_bQMJsMl0). This song is really good for motivation or if you need a pick-me-up.

- ["Chougattai (Gattai Insert Song #2)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd8bCzFfVGE). Not much to say about this one, it's really intense.

- ["Is a Mole Just a Mole"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN_XSszL7EU). I don't have any words for this either, it's nice melody. This song can make you feel how far we've come from an underground village to another universe.

I've been waiting for this, for when "Libera Me From Hell" showed up so I could talk about it.

- **"Libera Me From Hell"**: The song **Libera Me From Hell** is a combination of rap and opera. The opera portion talks about death and destruction while the rap is suppose to be uplifting. Both of these portions of the song relate to the story; the opera represents the Anti-Spirals and the rap represents Team Dai-Gurren. The song starts with the opera; the Anti-Spiral defeating Lordgenome and humanity's fall. Then as the song goes, the rap begins to pick up and by the end of the song both parts are loud and seem to be competing with each other.

- **"Gainax loves it's mech references"**: [Chouginga Gurren Lagann's design](http://i.imgur.com/tnGeEx9.jpg) is heavily inspired by [Mazinkaiser](http://i.imgur.com/XyGo0jG.jpg), [GunBuster](http://i.imgur.com/bk28j9p.gif), and [DieBuster](http://i.imgur.com/sSx0d6n.jpg). [Chouginga's pose when it comes out of the space ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8D95OJbMKw) is even a reference to [GunBuster's first appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YavONgbz5DE); rising up with arms crossed.

- **"In Memory of Kittan"**: Most people don't pick up on it, but when Simon's glasses transform it's in memory of Kittan and Kamina. First it's Kamina's glasses, in memory of his bro who pushed him to greatness. Then it's a star for Kittan, in memory of the sacrifice that allowed them to continue their journey.

- **"Subliminal Messages?"**: It's hard to see but the Anti-Spiral's body shows images of attrocities of humanity, like pollution.

If any of you haven't already, I definitely recommend you guys check out the DOUBLE K comic series; Here's the [first page](http://captainosaka.deviantart.com/art/DOUBLE-K-001-82688715) if you want to know where to start. It's set in an alternate universe and stars Kamina, Simon, and Kittan as cops. It's sadly on permanent hiatus because the artist has a job to do, but there is a lot of the comic to read to it's a fantastic thing to read. 10/10, the author nails Kamina perfectly. If [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/aGlNieN.jpg) or [this animated adaptation of the first chapter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQmhNtLBKhI) doesn't convince you at least a little bit to read DOUBLE K then I don't know what will.

Kittan's sacrifice is another one of the most memorable scenes from Gurren Lagann, Kittan was just as awesome as Kamina IMO. Kamina was the one leading at the front while Kittan was the one pushing at the back.

We've only got one more episode guys. This last episode will be imprinted into your minds for hopefully the rest of your lives. Then after that, we have the movies to look forward to! I hope to see you all tomorrow for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!
>> ARTICLE
I typically scroll through very long comments in rewatch threads, but yours was ridiculously good. 

Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the compliment. I usually would scroll through long comments too. I tried to do something different and special rather than a 'reaction post', no offense to those that do reaction posts. If you liked this one you can check out my other posts and hopefully you'll look forward to today's  **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I'm looking forward to today's thread.

I'm a rewatcher and I had absolutely no idea these last three episodes could pull the emotion they did out of me.

I'll see you there ;) 
>> ARTICLE
> Chouginga's pose when it comes out of the space ocean[10]   is even a reference to GunBuster's first appearance[11]  ; rising up with arms crossed.

Which itself is a Getter Robo manga reference,  in which the titular mecha rises out of the ocean on top of a massive mecha dragon with it's arms crossed. So it's like a double reference, or really a reference to both since Hiroyuki Imaishi is a massive fan of the Getter manga and it influenced TTGL heavily.

Faithful Getter Robo adaption by Trigger when?!
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a YouTube link to the Getter Robo one?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if there was an animated scene, maybe from the old 70s anime but [here's the panel](http://i.imgur.com/zOt9EuB.jpg) he was talking about.
>> ARTICLE
No youtube link since the manga doesn't have an actual anime adaption, [but here's the manga page.](http://i.imgur.com/49rgevZ.jpg) It's from Getter Robo G ,released in 1975 and it was the second installment in the Getter saga (and probably the weakest of the saga too in my opinion).
>> ARTICLE
Cool, thanks !
>> ARTICLE
I like that it has it's own trope/name, [Gainax Pose](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gainax-pose)

I wish we could get a faithful Getter Robo adaptation, it'd be so hype, especially from Trigger.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not even a big Trigger fan or anything (only thing I really like from them is LWA) but seeing as Imaishi is a MASSIVE fan, the editor in chief of the Getter Robo manga works at Trigger and the characters, story and events are already layed out for them I couldn't see anyway it could go wrong. They'd more than likely adapt everything down to a T, even things that probably didn't age too well but for the most part Getter is timeless and hype as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Incidentally, for any WoW players here, there's a series of quests in Felwood that reference Gurren Lagann, specifically the now-famous rap as heard in Libera Me From Hell:

[Do the Imp-Possible](http://www.wowhead.com/quest=28000/do-the-imp-possible)   
[See the Invisible](http://www.wowhead.com/quest=28049/see-the-invisible)

Just a reminder to everyone that tomorrows episode will have an after credits scene. Don't miss it.

For real though. Hey, you! The one trying to scroll past this guy. He's serious! Watch that scene!

#PSA: NEW VIEWERS

There is an epilogue after the credits to tomorrow's episode. Don't forget about it! 

Of course, you'll probably realize it, what with the credits coming when there's still a good four minutes left in the episode, but still. 
>> ARTICLE
Better to know in advance, thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so pre-watch: Im gonna sit through the next 2 episodes (maybe 3) without pausing to write notes or take screencaps. Im actually a little nervous 

Post-watch: So I wasnt going to watch the last episode because I felt so emotionally drained after episode 26, but I did anyway. I wont talk about it here, though. By the end of 26 I was an actual sobbing mess. It honestly doesnt take much to get me to cry, Im such a baby, but I very rarely go into full-blown help, this actually really sucks, make it stop mode. Not the worst Ive experienced, but still really shit.

Anyway, I have to leave for a few hours. When I get back Ill rewatch it and do my normal write-up. Umm, Ill most likely write down the thoughts I had at the time when I watched it, but some things may be written retrospectively.

Okay, Im back. Its close to midnight, so hopefully I dont burn out too quickly. Ive sort of recovered but I kind of dont want to put myself through that again


**EPISODE 25**

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/7Cmhajt.png) is adorable. But I dont really remember them ever really being like this (Also, Im already feeling like I wanna cry)

* Kittan is so [simple](http://i.imgur.com/QEiaO1i.png), in the most effective way

* My concept of how much time they spent together may be completely off, but I dont think it was too long. And yet all of them [acknowledge how great Kamina was](http://i.imgur.com/HNP6iAT.png) and how severe of a loss it was when he died

* Seriously, did [this](http://i.imgur.com/A3Ee5bW.png) come out of nowhere, or was this always subtly hinted at?

* [Fuck death flags.](http://i.imgur.com/Dd3AVwa.png)

* Cockroach-rat, [stop that](http://i.imgur.com/hzLhjjw.png)

* So, [space is getting in](http://i.imgur.com/g9X4aIN.png)??

* [Exactly](http://i.imgur.com/7JD41G2.png). You think any of these guys care about the probably of success??

* Hes connected so much to Gurren Lagann during this, that a break will [physically affect him](http://i.imgur.com/7vE175X.png)??

* [KNOCK IT OFF, COCKROACH-RAT](http://i.imgur.com/O7LEVxO.png)!! I do love how Viral just has a conversation with him, though. And [look at him](http://i.imgur.com/l43FXds.png)!! So tiny, so powerful! Rawr!!! [Good for him](http://i.imgur.com/y7B7eWY.png)! But really, its super impressive that he repaired the drill and all that

* I love the idea that Spiral Power can be [contagious](http://i.imgur.com/1XkIgWI.png). Of course, Simon seems to have so much, that it would be just rude to keep it all to himself

* [Nope](http://i.imgur.com/Pu2CR9z.png). (Theres no chance that this will go well this time around, is there?)

* [Kiss of death](http://i.imgur.com/Y0XToKy.png) (What do I have to do to make it so that this doesnt happen again??)

* [Fuck everything](http://i.imgur.com/r92ugiH.png). Just, fuck it all. The BGM makes it so much harder

* Guys, [I dont want it to happen](http://i.imgur.com/3qtuLJy.png)

* And [Im gone](http://i.imgur.com/XEG6bZu.png).

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/iF9cwnG.png) is so incredibly frustrating. Why did the writers do this to her again?

* Weve already determined [this](http://i.imgur.com/aYhLH9y.png), thank you

* [So much badass.](http://i.imgur.com/6ze8q3E.png)

**EPISODE 26**

* Is he [crying blood](http://i.imgur.com/jXckbVk.png)? Or is that from an injury??

* Its fucking [throwing planets](http://i.imgur.com/6uRd3fj.png) at them. Its moments like this, where I become painfully aware that, yeah, this show is ridiculous, but yeah, its absolutely awesome

* [Nightmare fuel.](http://i.imgur.com/EvjYfQH.png)

* [Mate](http://i.imgur.com/2FcdBwJ.png), you *fucking* started it.

* [DRILLS!](http://i.imgur.com/pcK3BwT.png)

* I would happily watch a spin-off series in this alternate dimension, where Simon and Kamina go around, [stealing and just doing no good](http://i.imgur.com/zxkUpIP.png)

* [Aww shit](http://i.imgur.com/Wv6icKx.png)

* [Bitch, please.](http://i.imgur.com/as5Cf78.png)

* [Walk up in the club, like](http://i.imgur.com/TJ4GkIA.png)

* Yeah. I think it was right about [here](http://i.imgur.com/OLmG45A.png) where I lost it. I missed [this](http://i.imgur.com/XWs4ea4.png) way more than I thought I ever would. Gosh, my vision sure is blurry I cant believe how much I missed [this](http://i.imgur.com/D3pcdDG.png), too. So much shit has happened that I actually forgot about the relationship these two had. [Guys](http://i.imgur.com/O10iLSI.png) :(

* [No](http://i.imgur.com/5mGGT3a.png) (It is way too soon to see this again. I was wrong! I still havent 
recovered!!) [UGHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/qQrml6B.png)

* My initial thought when I saw [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/9mEscCd.png) was that these two being forced apart the first time felt really unfair, and having to watch it happen a second time in this alternate dimension is worse to me. It probably has something to do with the fact that Simons older. Idk. Man, I am just [not in a good state](http://i.imgur.com/3Iuk2nx.png). Like, [at all](http://i.imgur.com/80A35A2.png). I mean it, [really](http://i.imgur.com/cONnwiH.png). [For reals](http://i.imgur.com/WOYAoQ4.png)

* Umm. May I ask, exactly what is that [centre picture](http://i.imgur.com/mTtMMJw.png) about? Those are the alternate dimensions, right? So

* I guess cause Im back to pausing for notes and screencaps, Im not as affected by this, but man I cried hard [here](http://i.imgur.com/6U1thtU.png).  And you wont believe how bad [this got me](http://i.imgur.com/UhPW4FB.png). [Yup](http://i.imgur.com/qdGl1ka.png). [Yuuuuup](http://i.imgur.com/DsygHvj.png). He didnt even say anything and I am honestly unable to discern whether that made it worse or if him saying something wouldve got to me more

* AGHHHH I FORGOT ABOUT [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/29xyS78.png) NO MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP. [Fucking hell, WHY????](http://i.imgur.com/7CG0zAO.png)



Alright, last one tomorrow. I dont know if I have anything else much to add, except thanks to all those who suggested to watch it properly, and especially /u/EditorialComplex. Man, you were not kidding about the music and, just, damn. THOSE SCENES. I feel like I had a few preconceptions of what TTGL would be like, but I never imagined that it would be so damn pretty. These two eps are seriously just gorgeous. The animation, the music, even the stills. Everything was stunning.

My one issue, and correct me if Im wrong, was that I feel like the Kittan and Yoko scenes were kind of added in to give us more of an emotional investment in Kittans death and maybe to look at Yoko as some sort of tragic heroine. Well, its not really an issue, cause it actually worked. But I think I wouldve been sad even if there wasnt any of that. I dont know. Maybe Im just pissed cause thats the second time its happened to her and I JUST WANT ALL OF THEM TO BE HAPPY!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Oh all the stars in my heavens....Viral. 

That scene gets me every time. Every damn time I watch this show again. Your screen cap alone has reduced me to tears. 

Do yourself a favour. One day, when you have a little child of your own in your arms, rewatch Viral's dream and realise once more what he had to give up to keep fighting. Remember that he has lived for centuries before the events here and will go on to live forever without this dream ever becoming possible. And then that he chose to give it all up to fight the antisprials along with the spirals. 

;_;

You're killing me. Please stop :'C

that's what i was talking about yesterday.  it's the tv from the schoolhouse that he's holding her, showing her all those different realities.

And they're standing on that little ridge near the volcano where they shared their first kiss.

So, you ended it before the bit with Nia and the Anti-Spiral. What did you think of the ring thing, and Simon's badass entrance?

Though, the scene sorta repeats in the next episode, so feel free to leave it for tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
The entrance was nothing less than I've come to expect from this anime. I also loved the bit where the ring starts flashing and she just stops everything and completely understands what's happening.

I probably should have written something on it, but I actually rewatched the part where the hatch opens and his cape just flies out, a few times. It actually looked so good

That scene is basically Interstellar, a 3.5 movie, condensed into one minute. :) it's glorious.

He was just smug about finally repaying Yoko for that kiss "ten time over".

I never thought about that. Oh man.

I have seen TTGL so many times but the entire "dream" sequence and the way Kamina appears to all of them makes me cry every single time. It's so powerful and makes me both so happy and sad, my emotions just can't take all of it.

Ah. 26 was the episode I was waiting for your reaction on. Especially given how much you seemed to enjoy Viral all series.

I just want him to be happy. The fact that that's an underlying desire of his, breaks my heart

I have something to tell you after tomorrow's rewatch, fellow Viral fan. :) 

I have never not cried watching Vidal's dream. So simple and yet....

Can you even imagine putting your child down and walking away from her forever? Knowing that she will literally cease to exist the moment you turn your back? Gahhhhhh!!!

I can't wait for tomorrow.

B-but one of the best parts of this show is when they SHOW IT TO YOU AGAIN-- AND IT ALL JUST ERUPTS OUT OF YOUR EYES- AND YOU REMEMBER IT ALL EVEN WHEN IT WAS SO LONG AGO, A-AND HOW YOU LOVED IT SO AND THEN YOUR HEART BURSTS ()
>> ARTICLE
This comment makes me simultaneously happy and sad.
>> ARTICLE
In the nicest way possible, I'm so glad you were bawling your eyes out.

This is only the second time I've watched this show, and it was pretty much just as bad as the first time, but in a different way. I just lost it again, and will likely continue to do so every time I watch that dream sequence. There is just too much happiness and awesomeness to not shed tears.

> Walk up in the club, like

Hahaha! Fantastic. Good work with that line.

> Guys, I dont want it to happen

Earlier on Kittan was saying how Kamina's death was tough, and that he respected the fact that he was one hell of man. Yoko had to reassure Kittan that they wouldn't have gone as far as they did without him as well. Now he gets to prove it one final time. Kittan's going out and being the hero. He gets to be as important to team Dai-Gurren as Kamina was. But he's not Kamina. He doesn't need to go out saying some showy line like "Later, buddy." He just needs to get the job done so his friends can keep moving forward, and he does so brilliantly.

Both of those men are fantastic characters.
>> ARTICLE
> There is just too much happiness and awesomeness to not shed tears

This is very true. I probably did a bad job at expressing that not all of it was sadness

I didn't even have to do anything. That pose is so damn hilarious

And they're both gone :C

:( Helps add to their badassery, though.

And great work with your reactions/write-ups! Can't wait for the last one tomorrow.

True story, you can emotionally compromise someone who's seen Gurren Lagann with just one line: "What's the matter, Simon? You lose your drill?"

I watched this shows three times already, and I can just put on the last episode (or the whole 'waking' sequence from second to last) anytime, and I WILL cry.

>My concept of how much time they spent together may be completely off, but I dont think it was too long.

Remember there was a short (few months I think?) time skip in first part.

>And Im gone.

Well, at least it was the most badass way to go ever.

>Umm. May I ask, exactly what is that centre picture about? Those are the alternate dimensions, right? So

Those are worlds that they created in their minds. So maybe Leeron's dream?

>AGHHHH I FORGOT ABOUT THIS. NO MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP. Fucking hell, WHY????

I love this scene. He has such a simple dream..

>My one issue, and correct me if Im wrong, was that I feel like the Kittan and Yoko scenes were kind of added in to give us more of an emotional investment in Kittans death and maybe to look at Yoko as some sort of tragic heroine. 

Well, the relationship was hinted at earlier a few times, at least from Kittan's side, so it wasn't completely out of the blue.

When they mentioned that Beastmen can't reproduce, I tried not too think too much about it. I'm kind of pissed they decided to remind us again
>> ARTICLE
So this is why everyone loves TTGL. Yeah, it's ridiculous and over the top. Yes, it's an action show at the core and it centers around explosions and big fights. But the characters that lie underneath it all make it so much more than that. They serve to strengthen the show beyond just a ridiculous action series.

Speaking of, sitting down now for that writeup I mentioned a week or so ago.

You're not wrong, in that there's nothing to suggest it pre-timeskip. There's really nothing hinted at romantically at all, pre-timeskip other than Simon/Nia and Kamina/Yoko. However, it's pretty blatant from her showing back up again in episode 21, so I've always headcanon'd that, like Kiyoh and Dayakka, it was during the timeskip (since Yoko had only been gone for a year or so, so that's six years for them to get close). 

>especially /u/EditorialComplex. Man, you were not kidding about the music and, just, damn. THOSE SCENES. 

:) 

I'm glad I could be as service.
>> ARTICLE
Ive always seen the Kittan x Yoko thing as very 1 sided, in that Kittan was falling for her but she was still in love with Kamina (even after all this time, as show by her snippet in the Labyrinth).

Yoko doesn't really seem to realize how Kittan was feeling until the kiss and then he dies before she can even consider what it all entails, the scene in the labyrinth shows her turning off the TV just before the wedding kiss, It's always felt like more of a bittersweet 'This could have been, if only'

But thats just how i've seen it.
>> ARTICLE
The scene where Yoko gets returned to action by Kamina confirms what you just said.

Before Kittan's sacrifice, one can wonder whether his feelings were returned or not, it's not that clear. You could say Yoko didn't back off, but then again how much sense could that ever make when he was relinquishing his life for the sake of their goal. The best interpretation for me is that whatever his dying wish was, it took precedence during that moment.

But when Kamina awakens her - or anyone else for that matter - from her dream where she was apparently married to Kittan, a parallel must be drawn relative to Simon's more detailed 'pull from dream' equivalent. They were all being pulled from a life that appeared obliviously comfortable but which reflected neither their true selves nor their fate.

This is not to say the scene implies she is still necessarily in love with Kamina, even though my opinion is that she could never let go of him. But it does imply that for her, Kittan was not meant to be, regardless of how much she admired the man he had become and what his resolve had accomplished for humanity.

In other words and in a more literal interpretation, we can compare the Kamina in Simon's dream to Kittan in Yoko's dream. The real Kamina came along to show them that neither was their truth, and they chose to go back.

>> ARTICLE
I agree with like 70% of that. I think it's obvious that post-timeskip Kittan's feelings for Yoko are much larger than anything the other way around. 

I don't, however, think she's still in love with Kamina. She was still a teenager, it was seven years ago, and they only spent a few months together, if that. I think he *inspired* her on a truly deep level, as he inspired Simon, but it was a teen crush and little more. Could it have become more? Of course, but fate conspired otherwise.

I do think that even if she hadn't considered it beforehand, the idea of being with Kittan meant something to her. From a purely narrative perspective, the waking sequence involves characters rejecting the false realities set before them for the harsher truth, and it doesn't mean anything if they don't want the things they're having to reject. Gimmy and Darry want a parent (Dayakka). Viral wants a family. Tetsukan and Cybela want each other. Simon wants a world with Kamina again. Their waking is meaningful because they reject these pleasant false realities in favor of what needs to be done. So I think Yoko's turning off the TV at the wedding doesn't indicate that she didn't love Kittan, quite the opposite - that it, for her, was a nice thought that she would have liked. Which is why her rejecting it means all the more.

I fully agree with this, other people say that she didn't like him but I belive that she liked Kittan. 
Kittan was like Kamina in some way, so Yoko felt attracted to that. Also, when she sais to Kittan that he was on the bottom pulling the Dai-Gurren brigade, she sais it to encourage him but is also true.
She grew up and was prepared to a relationship, with a man like Kamina, a true man.

I read it and it's a good point. Yeah, maybe she isn't in love with Kittan, but I guess she is neither with Kamina. I mean, it was a lot of time ago, she has grew and overcame that. When she thanks Kamina, it may seems she stills in love with him, but I believe that is a feel like nostalgia for the man that she loved.

Who knows, I'm not good at reading people. I didn't understand anything of NGE xD.

In case you've already watched episode 27, [TTGL](/s "she does end up alone even after the 2nd time gap. That coupled with all the flashbacks she has during the series, plus her strong venting in that shower scene - 'you said you'd pay me ten times over, what were you thinking, leaving a hole in my heart that's ten times larger' - leaves me with the impression that she was never able to get over him. But that's me!")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I watched it, this is the second time.
I remember that scene yes, and also in [episode 27](/s "she refers to Kamina as a man bigger than other or something like that, she didn't say Kamina but I guess she was referring to him.") So I guess you are right, :).

Yeah, exactly! When she spoke of a "man greater than any of us" it also gave me the feeling Kamina would always remain the same to her. 

Ah well, I have to agree - Yoko is a pretty tragic character all things considered.

I expected you to be considering how you were reacting so far... Anime rarely affects me strongly but even i shed a tear when they showed Viral with his imaginary family. 
>> ARTICLE
I was surprised how easily he shed it. It was a sad and beautiful dream that would have been an 11/10 sob-fest if he'd just looked back and hesitated for even a second.

Instead he was all "welp, shits not real I'm out."
>> ARTICLE
I think he forced himself not to hesitate, because he was sure he would waver if he looked back.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, his character development suffered a little bit towards the end. 
>> ARTICLE
It's even more tragic this way, in my opinion.

He is *perfectly aware* that it's completely impossible to *ever* have something like this. You know. Something resembling a normal life in any way.
>> ARTICLE
actually its even sadder considering that Viral's only dream was to have a family and thats something he cant have, he never could because its physically impossible for beast-men to reproduce 
>> ARTICLE
But it is possible, if he had just stayed. :(

Absolutely. He leaves easily because he knows it's a dream.

Of course, on the upside, he's returning to something that he knows matters and has serious weight for him which is pretty awesome to watch.

**Episode 25: In which a death scene is so awesome we can't even be sad, and then we get sad anyway**

Episode 25. Glorious episode 25. The episode that cemented Kittan in the position as my \#1 favorite character in Gurren Lagann. Ugh, it's so good.

Let's be fair: Kittan is flying so many death flags this episode that he's practically doing death semaphore. It's so incredibly obvious that he's not making it out of this episode alive, the only question is when. He gets the "when we get back" conversation with Yoko about her students, he has a mentorly conversation with Gimmy (and Darry), he indicates willingness to go out alone and risk his life. It's obvious.

But my god, is it spectacular. 

As I said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3800ba/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_19_20/crr618n) in the episode 20 thread, Kittan's journey is as the workhorse of Team Dai-Gurren. He's not the leader, he never could be. He never has Kamina or Simon's charisma, their way with words. But he's the drill sergeant who yells and gets everyone's asses in gear. He's the field commander who leads the troops while Simon plays hero. He's trying to live up to the long shadow of Kamina, without ever realizing that he's long since surpassed him - just not in the ways he thought mattered at first.

In a show that's so characterized by its over-the-top nature and hot-blooded yelling just a notch below DBZ, perhaps my single favorite moment is oddly a very quiet one, after Kittan and Yoko embrace and the piano starts in. She can't talk him out of what he's about to do. He wanted to do it, after all. And his spiral power surpasses even Simon's; he gets main character powers by virtue of force of will alone, dies in a massive explosion, laughing about how awesome all of that just was.

The result is one of the greatest death scenes in anime history, right up there with [Fate/Zero & Code Geass](/s "Rider's last charge and the Zero Requiem"). It's so impressive that it even overshadows the whole rest of the episode, and *a lot of awesome shit* happens in this episode. Boota as Spiral battery. The birth of Galaxy Gurren Lagann. 

(Incidentally, remember what I said about the King Kittan looking like a star, instead of a banana? That's the reason for Simon's silly sunglasses; they're meant to be Kamina glasses plus a star in tribute to Kittan).

I've always liked [this AMV, mostly about this single episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZKe9F7ROA). It's not mindblowingly well-edited like some, and the video quality kinda sucks, but the song is an excellent fit for Kittan's last stand.

So we salute you, Kittan Bachika, loving uncle, devoted brother, mighty spiral warrior. You've earned your place in Valhalla. [Relevant fanart](http://i.imgur.com/0vNgQS3.jpg).

**Episode 26: In which manly tears are shed because my god that scene was awesome YOU KNOW THE ONE**

Episode 25 is a hard act to follow, but Episode 26 succeeds in style. The first half is action even ridiculous by the standards of TTGL thus far. Throwing planets, shooting *every part of time and space at once* - it's madness. It's awesome.

And then the second half hits. After 18 episodes, Aniki is back, but not how we know him. It's such a surreal scene, seeing this craven, cowardly Kamina. It's almost enough to overpower the rest of the crazy shit in this episode, like meeting *the* Anti-Spiral and Boota's instaneous evolution into Shota McFurry. 

But it has what vies with Kittan's death for the single greatest scene in all of Gurren Lagann, starting with a simple question: "What's the matter, Simon? Did you lose your drill?" 

Fans have been debating for years over whether or not that was the actual spirit of Kamina, back from the dead in his little bro's greatest hour of need, or whether or not it was simply the spirit of Kamina that lived within all of them, but it doesn't matter. It's a magnificent scene that sets the stage for our final confrontation, and many manly tears are shed. 

"It looks like you've grown taller than me." What a scene. What a wonderful scene.

[Lagann-hen movie spoilers](/s "I do like one of the changes they made to this scene in the movie. Like I said yesterday, most of Team Gurren survives, except for Kittan, so he's the only one in the box. There's a great callback to Episode 7, with him going "I'm here too!" and Kamina going "...who are you again?" before grabbing him with a playful noogie and going "AS IF I COULD FORGET!" I love it. I prefer the show to the movies in almost all ways, but that one bit is excellent.")

Of note: Pay attention to all of the dream worlds the characters are stuck in, and what they say about their desires. Simon wanted Kamina back. Yoko wanted to be with the kids, and was thinking about a world with Kittan. Dayakka, Gimmy and Darry want family. Leeron, Attenborough and Gabal want to be mechanics still. Tetsukan and Cybela are secretly in love. But the most poignant, of course, is Viral wanting what he could never have, as a beastman: A family of his own.

And the final scene, Nia's last moment of resistance, sets us up wonderfully for the grand finale.

It'll be one hell of a ride.

Thanks for this. I always felt there was something special about Kittan's death; the way he, the everyman, rises to the occasion and tastes greatness for one ephemeral moment. Definitely agree that it stands as one of the best deaths in all of anime. 
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly it. Kittan wasn't the cutest, bravest, smartest, most charismatic, or even the opposite of any of those things. He's the most forgettable of all of them. But when the occasion arises, he steps up to being the best of them. 

Another fond memory I have of Kittan is his mistaking that Yoko had kids. In a few moments he lets go of his irrational desire (like a lot of men) for Yoko to be a single virginal female on a pedestal, and instead accepts her entirely for whatever she may actually be. That's a real man.

Episode 25

* So, to anyone else who is watching this for the first time and is wondering when they are finally going to get back to that opening scene that looked like a flash-forward to some future time, you can just go ahead and stop waiting. Turns out the creators just sort of lost track of where they planned to go with that plotline, so just pretend it was some alternate universe shit.

* Youd think this narrator would want to lend a hand and help these guys out of their shitty situation. Even the uncaring narrator in Space Dandy helped move the plot forward at drastic points.

* If ultra-dense space looks like water, does ultra-dense ice look like space?

* Wow, its raining hard outside. This has nothing to do with the show; it just is.

* [Kittan, you playa.](http://webm.land/media/urhF.webm)

* Attenborough would probably shoot his own mother if it meant firing a gun.

* Attenborough: Do you even have to say it?

* Kittans gonna die, isnt he? Like, for real this time. Fuck me.

* [*Cue Ship Happens AMV*](http://i.imgur.com/pf25Ys4.jpg)

* Kittan talking about Kamina in front of Yoko. He knows how to get her all emotional and sentimental.

* Okay, the narrator just going no-holds-barred with saying that Kittan died. Blunt as fuck.

* [Wow, I had no idea those things where *that* big.](http://webm.land/media/Gtrc.webm) Theyre literally throwing planets at each other now. Thats like Galactus-level OP. Hope no lifeforms where inhabiting those.

* [](http://webm.land/media/Ydpb.webm) CAUSE WHY THE FUCK NOT?!

* Darry: They can manipulate probability? But I thought that was Gods domain.

* Lordgenome: You do realize by now that your God is a gunman, right?

* Darry: Yes. I just figured that since gunmen are influenced by Spiral Power

* [Did the Anti-Spiral just explain the theory of Eternal Return?](http://webm.land/media/iaCe.webm)

* So Spiral Power means we all get so OP that we overwhelm each other to the point of gravity taking care of the rest. Im okay with it. At least Ill die huge.

* Lordgenome knows just what to say so as to not lie, but still motivate Simon to fight.

* [How do those glasses stay on his face?](http://i.imgur.com/IuIa7oh.jpg)

* Did Attenborough actually help in some way that didnt directly involve pushing a button? Well, yet.

* [Could*nt* care less, Yoko. Could*nt*.](http://webm.land/media/8fvP.webm) Youd think this far into the future people would have gotten that.

* [Wait, what the fuck?](http://webm.land/media/OyyM.webm) Is this a dream? An Anti-Spiral illusion? What the fuck is up with Kaminas shirt? Is *that* where he got his glasses from? But Wait what?! Theres police cars?! Why is Simons cut so small? And why is it the ring he gave Nia? Why do I not care? ^Oh^right^cause^Kaminas^awesome. Wait. Everybody just wait. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Is this an alternate universe version of them? Like, a universe similar to ours, where humanity was never forced underground? You know, maybe I should stop theorizing and actually watch more.

* Okay, so this is a version of reality where they made it to the surface (or at least at of their village), but Kamina never got killed and they never took down Lordgenome. I think. Now, wheres Yoko? She had better be there.

* [There she is!](http://i.imgur.com/lGnevBS.jpg)

* [*Sigh*](http://webm.land/media/2CRN.webm)

* [First of all, holy shit the Anti-Spiral looks fucking creepy.](http://webm.land/media/woo9.webm) Second, so all three of my theories were actually correct. They are all trapped in dreams by the Anti-Spirals, but the dreams are not completely fictional. Rather, they are inhabiting the bodies of their selves from alternate universes, sort of overriding that original universes self while still maintaining that selfs memories. Its confusing as fuck, I know.

* [Oh, hey its that guy from the first episodes prologue.](http://i.imgur.com/FOaLwFN.jpg) I guess they didnt totally scrap *everything* from that.

* As disturbing as it sounds, its actually kind of cute to see the [Anti-Spiral laugh.](http://webm.land/media/a0PV.webm)

* [Well, that one kind of backfired on ya.](http://webm.land/media/vdym.webm) I will say, the Anti-Spiral does have a really cool voice and look. Im guessing his reappearing has to do with the Anti-Spirals being a hivemind. Killing one is pretty much the same as losing a skin cell.

* Kamina begging for his life is both ridiculously out of character and hilarious.

* [THERES *our* Kamina.](http://i.imgur.com/hpHjmPT.jpg)

* Id like to believe that thats not just some fragment of Simons subconscious, but really is the real Kamina, who decided to swing by from the Bro Heaven universe to help Simon out.

Eh, not really. The universes weren't real until they imagined/observed them. There is no "other self", they just generated universes around themselves and fabricated their own memories.

Also, Viral's dream makes me really sad. His deepest desire is apparently to have a family, but he never can because he's a beastman.

> Yeah, this guy is super helpful, which is weird, but we're all just kind of okay with it

It's not weird. He was basically freed from being Anti Spiral's guard dog, and can now be in a sense a Spiral Warrior again. It's no surprise he is grateful.
>> ARTICLE
> How do those glasses stay on his face?

Spiral Power obv.

>Second, so all three of my theories were actually correct. They are all trapped in dreams by the Anti-Spirals, but the dreams are not completely fictional. Rather, they are inhabiting the bodies of their selves from alternate universes, sort of overriding that original universes self while still maintaining that selfs memories. Its confusing as fuck, I know.

Not exactly. It's more like they are constantly making new universes for themselves. Or something. It's complicated as hell.

>Virals reaction to waking up is probably my favorite. Hes just like, Me? A family man? Yeah, right.

I found the fact that he dreamed of having a family oddly cute.




>> ARTICLE
Well lets think its called a multidimensional labyrinth. So its most likely that ya they are stuck in an endless loop of experiencing different realities where all their dreams come true/the things they want or desire are used to trap them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Anti Spiral states that it's "series of universes that are created instant to instant as they are perceived". So basically they are creating their own 'labyrinth' based on their thoughts. Certainly they aren't perceiving existing alternate universes (like someone else mentioned) or anything like that.

> Id like to believe that thats not just some fragment of Simons subconscious, but really is the real Kamina, who decided to swing by from the Bro Heaven universe to help Simon out.

As I pointed out in episode 8, he did come back to life to avenge his own death. It's not much of a stretch to just say that it *is* Kamina in the afterlife coming back to set his Bro back on track.
>> ARTICLE
i believe it really was his spirit, too.  there's nothing to support it other than the fact that kicking logic to the curb and doing the impossible is how team dai-gurren rolls!

I remembered today I have the DVD of the first movie, popped it in my laptop, and it still works perfectly. Neat.

Oh god Kittans giving speeches to the kids this wont end well (I actually really like this speech)

Boota: Emergency Spiral Power Source Via Osmosis

I kind of love the bit where the inspirational music plays as the missile charges up and then cuts out as soon as it fizzles out. 

Yep, Kittans going heroic sacrifice to take out the space ocean. And we get our first use of Libera Me From Hell, which is the weirdest-best soundtrack piece from this show. Opera meets rap meets ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER.

KING

KITTAN

GIGA

DRILL

BREAK

Everyone Yoko kisses dies. Its a sample size of two, but still.

SUPER GALAXY

GURREN LAGANN

A mech the size of the moon, being piloted by a mech the size of a city, being piloted by a normal-size mech, being piloted by a human, a Beastman, and a hamster-thing. Welcome to TTGL, everybody.

26

Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann gives no fucks and Simons crying blood.

The Spiral Nemesis: overusing Spiral Energy will kill everything. Naturally, the heroes decide Yeah, screw you, well beat you AND not fuck up the universe."

ALL THE MISSILES EVER IN ALL THE DIMENSIONS EVER. Attenborough is momentarily useful.

And then a wonky-looking Giga Drill Break. The shoulder-pad-drills are neat.

Whoa, trippy.

The remainder of this episode is funky dream sequences. Please enjoy the ride.

Bootas human transformation amounted to literally nothing. I dont get why that was a thing.

kamina what are you doing you dont beg to WAIT IS THAT THE REAL KAMINA OH MY GOD

Hey, when did you get taller than me? ;_______;

Oh hey, its Kittan and Those Other Guys! 

LIBERA ME FROM HELL: ROUND TWO

Simon is also a robot, your argument is invalid. (seriously, what)

Oh god, Yoko, Im sorry for cracking jokes. Thats heartbreaking.

OH GOD VIRAL THATS EVEN MORE HEARTBREAKING ALL HE WANTS IS A FAMILY

Okay, Anti-Spiral getting a bit rapey.

Nias ring summons robots. Fuck you, Anti-Spiral.

***WOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE MORE TO GO***

> Everyone Yoko kisses dies. Its a sample size of two, but still.

Still, 100% death rate. Can't argue with results. Sad that Kamina and Kittan are gone, but I guess it was a good thing Yoko didn't kiss Simon back when he had a crush on her.

PS Just a joke. Love Kamina and Kittan. Don't hate me.

**Our Friends hopes and dreams etched onto its body**

**Transforming the infinite darkness into light**

**Unmatched in Heaven and Earth**

**One machine, equal to the Gods**

*The chills man!*

Boota's forced evolution FTW, Kittan going out like the BAMF he is, battles moving into the realm of *altering time and probability*... Fuck Yeah!
 
*

Did anyone else find Simons transformation into Gurren Lagann slightly disturbing? Like seeing it with an actual human face was some uncanny-Vally level shit.

I also noticed something interesting this time around: Lordgenome is free of the alternate reality trap, up until his contact with Boota's spiral energy and subsequent evolution.  Another (kind of large) tidbit in line with with some of his more subtle changes. Also that *damn right* nod!
>> ARTICLE
Incase anyone doesn't pick up on how awesome the "when did you get taller than me?" line/scene is: Simon had his heartbroken middle section of the story where all he could think about was how he could never be Kamina and never live up to the greatness of his bro, and had to come to realize that he needed to stop trying to be Kamina and instead be himself. Now as we've seen in the later episodes (especially when he gets his current outfit and hair style) we see how he has grown into his own person but there's still this huge impact that his bro had on who Simon became. Now in this scene Simon finally gets to see Kamina again, and Kamina recognizes that Simon has grown up to be an even greater (or, "taller") man than he was. Plus the scene is just great because it's so awesome to see Kamina again and get one more speech from him. "The badass reputation of Team Gurren echoes far and wide from Giha Village! It's leader a man of indomitable will, a paragon of masculinity! As if there could ever be more than one of the mighty Kamina".
>> ARTICLE
I thought I was all over Kamina's death but seeing him again made me really miss him. That taller scene was great, it showed how great Simon is now and Kamina's tone while saying is really well done.
>> ARTICLE
I have a raging hard on for death scenes and Kittans has to be one of my favourites.
>> ARTICLE
just gotta say, that when super galaxy dai-gurren rises out of the sea of spiral power transformed into super-dense space, he throws out one of my favorite lines of the series.  

>The hopes of my friends are etched upon its body; turning the infinite darkness into light. Unmatched in heaven and earth. One Machine to equal the Gods; Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann! I'll show you... the power of the human race. 

"the hopes of my friends are etched upon its body" - how many members of the team have made the ultimate sacrifice now?  

"turning the infinite darkness into light" - the sea of ultra-dense space reconverting back into spiral energy to power the super dreadnought's transformation into human form.  incredible.

"unmatched in heaven and earth, one machine equal to the gods!" - i just..  i tumblr every time.  i can't even.  what a boast.  *equal to the gods*.  what are you going to do with that power, simon?

next episode, man.

it's also worth noting that the second gurren lagann movie, lagann-hen or "childhood's end", takes episode 27 and practically doubles it...  so go ahead and watch it this weekend, after you've had a chance to off for a day on friday.

Despite being a rewatch for me, it's still taken a significant exertion of willpower to hold off on the last episode. Not sure if I could have if this was my first time.

I marathon'd the hell out of TTGL the first time around, and finishing it was like coming off of an ecstasy binge. The real world was dull and grey, and utterly insufficient. It was too much awesome for my fragile mind to handle in such a short time.

I love how the portrayal of anti-spirals hints at them being fundamentally different then other life forms. Even their theme has an alien feel, and of course that black blob is completely out of place.

The second half of ep 26 is to me the pinnacle of the show and my favorite part of it. Also i kind of feel that even though TTGL is a shounen it has a very wide appeal.

Well, we've hit 3 of the 4 moments from this show that just killed me right in the heart.  Kamina's death, Kittan's death, and Viral's dream.  They all just kill me.  Especially Viral's dream tbh.  It's just....so simple that it's utterly beautiful(and his little transition from a gentle face to holygodhelookspissedoff right before he flies off is great).  Number 4 comes tomorrow.

Sorry I am late folks came down with a bit of a cold so it took a while for me to drag myself out of bed to watch the eps.

Episode 25:

	Kittan x Yoko?

	DIE IN A FIRE!

	None of this makes any sense.

	So what do those fuckers run on if not spiral energy?

	Its okay Kittan he gets it.

	Kamina was a pretty good leader.

	Not even gonna talk about death flags just being on this team is a death warrant.

	Gimmy, Darry if you die I will stop watching.

	Simon that is an awful idea.

	Master what is happening to you?

	Only 300 seconds plenty of time.

	These lines are killing me.

	Dont let any more space in.

	Is master even a pig-mole he is tiny as fuck.

	Okay what the fuck is happening.

	Oh so now you mention that not only humans have spiral energy.

	Kittan it was nice knowing you, you shall be missed.

	But hey you got to get some action if only a bit before your death.

	A baller death fit for a ballar like you Kittan.

	Logical you say.

	Hey Kamina I think something is wrong with your goggles.

	I just dont even anymore.


Episode 26:

	Simon your eyes are bleesing.

	What the fuck even am I seeing what are they throwing at him?

	How are you two outside and fine?

	So what you are saying is if they sacrifice each other its a sin even if they all die anyway?

	Anti -spiral god what are you even talking about?

	Im gonna be honest with you all I think im sidding with the anti-spiral here. Now if they could have gone about all this in a nicer way it be fine but I think Im switching sides.

	This is just getting stupid. What type of gunmen even is that?

	Hi Nia.

	I see Simon is tripping balls.

	Why are we in the past I dont care about the past.

	What in the world is this?

	So this is an alternate universe right?

	Lordgnome you cant be confused as well.

	Master that was an awful idea.

	Oh shit master can speak and he has the voice of a girl.

	Gonna be honest idk if its the cold or this episode but its boring me.

	Oh hey real Kamina.

	And theres the line we all hate.

	Oh hey Nias capsule.

	Why does everyone have a drill suddenly 

	Aw Viral has a family.

I am just not even sure how I feel about this show anymore. It just keeps getting even more crazy and I wish I loved it as much as I want to. But I just could careless for the antagonist because he honestly is not 100% wrong in his actions.

I wasn't criticizing her. I actually think it's pretty smart not to trust her right away. Of course, after she starts talking, it's pretty clear that the girl is harmless....
>> ARTICLE
And I didn't assume as much, I was just asking. I mean they've come across a ton of people ever since they left the village and she's never distrusted anyone, so I can't see why she'd suddenly distrust Nia so bluntly (before they met and talked).

I only asked in the first place because her face is a typical anime face of jealousy. You know, when girls see their crush hanging around with another girl. But in this case that just wouldn't make much sense.

agreed.  i thought she was an annoyingly soft-spoken wallflower (a la asahina more than nagato), but upon rewatch her character really shone.  

she continues the arc words, "who the hell do you think [i am/we are]?!", only so much more politely ("are you aware of who i am?") that in the dub i didn't even catch the fact that she was doing it.

and when she ran out to confront adiane, she showed so much courage!  no gunmen, no weapons, not even assured that she'd have backup from the team... only her royal heritage to rely on, she ran toward the sound of chaos to protect friends she'd only known for a day.  she's a much better character than a lot of people give her credit for.

It's a joke. Ghost Stories was so awful they completely rewrote the script for the dub as a 4th wall-breaking comedy and hammed it up.

It takes a while to get used to. I used to watch only subs, but recently I've been watching Cowboy Bebop dubbed - it was weird at first, but I can't really imagine Spike sounding any other way after 22 episodes.

Really? The Ghost Stories dub is probably one of the most natural sounding dubs I've heard due to the amount of freedom the English voice cast was given when recording. They could practically ad-lib lines.

Thanks for the comments yesterday guys. Most of them were pretty comforting. But still :( I dont want to watch this episode. If I werent doing this rewatch, I would probably drop this for about a month and then come back to it. But I know how anime works. An important character dying for the sake of plot progression and the development of other characters is a very common and effective formula to follow. I hate it, but I get it. And I think Ive dealt with worse deaths, so Ill carry on and try not to cry throughout the entire episode.

I also want to thank all of you. None of you said anything too obvious (I think) which, despite my small rant yesterday, I do appreciate. I feel like I knew it was coming, though. Probably because I read something about it a long time ago, and that preview kind of indicated what was gonna happen. Still 

**EPISODE 9**

	Kamina not being in the opening has already got me teary. This is gonna be hard

	[Yeah, see](http://i.imgur.com/Jw0zWDf.png), the lack of Kamina is no doubt really sad. But the fact that now Simon has to come to terms with it and keep going is much sadder to me.

	So [these](http://i.imgur.com/WLlx9z8.png) are the other 3 generals, huh? Looks like I was off when I said that the more human Beastmen look, the stronger they are.

	Uhhh, [rock drills](http://i.imgur.com/LarvLnm.png)?

	Gotta love [mystery boxes](http://i.imgur.com/E2oE6Nq.png). Whats inside??? Im so excited! [Thats](http://i.imgur.com/A6w4Lr7.png) one hell of a mystery box. Damn.

	[Never change, Simon](http://i.imgur.com/GIe2lQW.png)

	So, whats [this girls](http://i.imgur.com/vdKs2LE.png) deal? When I watched yesterdays preview, I thought she was a robot or something, but now Im starting to think that she was maybe raised by Beastmen and never really knew what a human was. If thats the case, she definitely seems to have turned out better than others who were raised by an enemy species

	[This](http://i.imgur.com/XWVrHyp.png) has to be, by far, the worst attempt at describing a human being I have ever seen. Simon, what are you doing? This is the best you came up with??

	[My gosh.](http://i.imgur.com/RgBrEly.png) How is he so cute? 

	The robot [wont obey a weak pilot](http://i.imgur.com/UoLYd6m.png) or something? Oh, is [this](http://i.imgur.com/sFceMbY.png) why Laganns being uncooperative, cause Simon has a death wish?

	[Did it look cool? Did I look cool??](http://i.imgur.com/vx3r60i.png)

	What is [this face](http://i.imgur.com/HDcU3Ge.png) about? Is it something like, Who do you think you are, holding my sons hand?

	Haha, [shes so cute](http://i.imgur.com/9Pipp4O.png)

	[This guys](http://i.imgur.com/nwDZrKV.png) still here!??! DID YOU [JUST](http://i.imgur.com/ePzmyqG.png) FUCKING NOTICE!???

	Is her dad gonna end up being the king guy?

	[D:](http://i.imgur.com/6hrAw3I.png)

	[Fair enough](http://i.imgur.com/QR3O5vr.png). Why was she thrown away though? Wait, is she not human? Can I get confirmation on whether shes a human or Beastman? Unless its a spoiler

	I love [this](http://i.imgur.com/p8iGQub.png). And [this](http://i.imgur.com/omdsj7H.png).

	This guy needs to [calm down](http://i.imgur.com/ifZJ4YN.png).

	What are you [talking about](http://i.imgur.com/K1JFcJz.png)? Thats a pretty fucking good reason not to start shit. Um. This girl [needs an adult](http://i.imgur.com/Ji1rdUc.png)?

	[Naw, kid](http://i.imgur.com/afw0eXV.png). You tried!!

	[I dont like you.](http://i.imgur.com/k4DU1YN.png)

	Whats going on [here](http://i.imgur.com/9LNRm38.png)? Ahahah why did he [eat it](http://i.imgur.com/DXRVsRf.png)?

[True](http://i.imgur.com/sPnMZwb.png)? This whole thing is great

	Please tell me, that Simon will eventually be the leader. [This guy](http://i.imgur.com/s0astje.png) isnt very, um, equipped to be the leader

	[UGHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/CkCD8Ia.png)

	[Yeah](http://i.imgur.com/xM0hd4h.png)

	I just realised something. Did they bury Kamina? They would have, yeah? When they found the bones in episode 2(?) and he remarked that there was no point in burying the bones and Yoko says that it might be him one day or something along those lines, I guess that was a death flag.

	[This](http://i.imgur.com/ivMCFKn.png) feels even more harsh because shes not mad at him or anything, shes sort of just calling it how she sees it

	[Yeah](http://i.imgur.com/j81OGMr.png), I noticed the robots mouth last episode, but I didnt want to comment on it. But its, like, right in my face right now so

	[Why, though?](http://i.imgur.com/FJ95kdN.png)

	Now that Kaminas gone, they need someone to fill the [arrogant, obnoxious, gaudy idiot](http://i.imgur.com/ZY2A3Xq.png) role. Shes much less likable than he is though

	[Hey, he started it!](http://i.imgur.com/RZ327W1.png)

	Ahahah, [shes too cute](http://i.imgur.com/9JfdQDr.png)

	I just want Viral to heel-face turn. Its hard to properly like him like this

	[Not if the king kills her](http://i.imgur.com/bUuMoQr.png)

	[He doesnt know](http://i.imgur.com/5ok9vCi.png)

	Her [#1 fan](http://i.imgur.com/aJPV1Mc.png)!

	Far out, Viral. This is the second time shes beaten his ass and he just takes it. This seriously pisses me off

	[Shes great](http://i.imgur.com/PQDouHB.png)

	[Stooooop](http://i.imgur.com/NUiFFN0.png). I just want him to be happy!!!!


Its starting to get to the point where I really wanna jump ahead and watch more, so Im glad its been amped up to 2 episodes a day. But I want more!!!

>Did they bury Kamina?

You'll find out in due time.  If you want to know right now, [very minor spoilers] ( /s "He was buried at the volcanoes with his cape and his trusty Nodachi").

>Is Nia human or beastmen?

A big spoiler that would involve revealing why Lordgenome is on the surface and the history of the beastmen.  All in due time.
>> ARTICLE
It sounds weird but I'm really excited for you to see the rest of the series. Most of your thoughts so far have mirrored mine during my first watch through. You can't appreciate it now, but the first arc and Kamina's death are an important part of how fucking AMAZING this show becomes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Its starting to get to the point where I really wanna jump ahead and watch more, so Im glad its been amped up to 2 episodes a day. But I want more!!!

Yeah I thought 2 was going to be enough but nope not enough...really want to go ahead...
>> ARTICLE
As hard as it was to watch Simon's struggle after Kamina's death, Yoko was even more difficult. Simon has an excuse to be the way he is - everyone knows how close he was to Kamina, and he's not in a leadership position, so there's no pressure on him to keep his chin up. Meanwhile, Yoko has not only the pressure of a leadership position but the added issue of nobody really knowing that she was in love with Kamina, so there's this huge internal struggle for her that she can't really reach out for help with, both because of her situation and her pride.
>> ARTICLE
This is something that made me like this show very much. Closed one's death hits you hard. Especially when you have to keep strong despite the sadness.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... Watching her wait until she's alone to grieve is really hard to watch and kind of unfair
>> ARTICLE
Since w're only on episode 8 out of 26, I feel it's sufficiently non spoilery to say: don't let this discourage you from the show. They come out of it, and when they do, it's in a big and very satisfying way. This period of sadness only serves to make the show better as a whole and it doesn't last forever.
>> ARTICLE
The way you all talk about TTGL, leaves me with no doubt that they'll be okay and that the show benefits from all of this :)
>> ARTICLE
> I like the brother, but this is too far.

The episodes following Kamina's death are difficult to watch for multiple reasons - sure, you get upset at how depressed Simon is, but you also start to become frustrated (much like some members of Team Gurren) at how he can't pick himself up again. You have to keep in mind that Kittan and the others have lost several comrades already, and Simon's inability to perform as a leader is endangering the entire team - so of course he's going to be harsh.

I would also say that the show drags it out a little longer than it needs to, as I remember getting impatient with Simon myself the first time I watched TTGL. For now, though, just keep watching. Best girl is here to tide us over, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
The entire group revolved around one guy, with him dead and his successor unable to get over it the group is falling apart. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit worried that I'm gonna start to feel frustrated at him too... Also, I didn't consider how the others have lost heaps of people too, so thanks for that

>This guy needs to calm down.

Attenborough shall never calm down. Ever. There's a reason we call him Beamspam McMuppet.

>Um. This girl needs an adult?

Insert DBZ Abridged line here. 

>Please tell me, that Simon will eventually be the leader. This guy isnt very, um, equipped to be the leader

The next few episodes are all about Team Gurren figuring out where they belong in a world where Kamina can't lead them. Kittan figures out his strength soon enough. And he's actually really good at it.
>> ARTICLE
> There's a reason we call him Beamspam McMuppet.

I have no idea what any of this means

It's a spoiler, just wait. All will be revealed.

I'm not part of the rewatch, but I've always thought episode 9 was the best episode of the series, if not one of the best anime episodes ever. 

The way they show depression, their use of color to show the emotions and the influx of color when he meets Nia is amazing. Not to mention Simon having to deal with his responsibility in killing Kamina, as unlike most shows, he can actually be partially blamed for it. Great episode.

**Episode 9**

They showed the kiss again ;.;

Simon is a changed man it seems...this is hard to watch

Yoko's face...this is too much

Mech puking haha

Mystery box...this key thing is pretty damn useful

A girl dressed covered in clothes!! New favourite character! Dunno about those eyes though..

Annnndddd I'm now shipping them

Yes...it would be very creepy if everyone had the same face

She stopped the rain...she metaphorically stopped Simon's tears 

DANG! Thought since he had a girl with him things would work again...stupid *male spirit*

Ok Nia is amazing

WWHHAHAAATTTTT?!

**Episode 10**

So I wasn't sure about doing 2 episodes a day, I'm pretty happy we are now haha

Going to be harder not to binge ahead though...

Cannon guy managed to be annoying in like 5 seconds of screen time..

Dude that's a legitimate excuse, this guy is a jerk

Her not knowing this is just adorable :3

Did they really need to put the mouth there? Uncomfortable...

Wanted Simon to save her :(

Open the door for her!!! urrgg

So 2 episodes a day isn't enough...
>> ARTICLE
Cannon guy is called Attenborough, popularly known as Beamspam Mcmuppet by fans. Reason for the name should be pretty self evident :D

I can now hate him by name thx haha :p

Good to see you all back, members of Team Dai-Gurren, sorry I'm late today. Today we get to meet Nia, best girl IMO. I mean look at [her](http://i.imgur.com/2bTk6pe.png), she has adorable eyes and her hair is like a cloud! SHE'S SO CUTE! Welcome to "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

Because we're going to do 2 episodes a day now, I will choose 2 songs instead of 1 and I'll try to get 2 facts but I'll will do at least 1 fact.

- For episode 9, the "Song of the Episode" is ["What is "Moe" Exactly"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAp1zalsNBw&). A nice, soft song for when the rain stops.

- For episode 10, the "Song of the Episode" is ["The Wolf Has Come"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beldmsw9UdY&). This song has a very calm-before-the-storm feel; I love it.

Today's fact about the structure of the story itself; no spoilers so don't worry.

- "Bringin' back the 70s": The first arc of Gurren Lagann, episodes 1-8, is a take on the 70s era of mech anime. This was characterized by hotblooded, over-the-top characters and a monster-of-the-week format. Probably the 2 most inspiring mech anime for Gurren Lagann were Getter Robo and Mazinger Z; both aired during the 70s and had hotblooded main characters.

That's all for today, what are your guys' thoughts on Nia? I'm starting to run a little thin on facts so there may be an absence of facts in the future; to be on the safe side I'll try to do only 1 fact. See you all tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts". Same heaven piercing time, same heaven piercing channel.
>> ARTICLE
Bear with us, new viewers! These episodes are hard. But 'happily ever after' only has meaning because you had to go through hardship first, right?

We finally meet the Spiral King, Lordgenome - and yes, much like Fuhrer King Bradley, "Lordgenome" is his name, not "Lord Genome". We also meet a bizarre ray of sunshine in Nia. 

As Simon struggles with his despair, Kittan struggles to replace Kamina as the leader of Team Gurren. But while he's Kamina's equal in terms of asskicking, he just doesn't have the charisma or way with words. Somehow, he'll find his place on the team before too long.

Dayakka is starting to prove himself as Best Team Dad. Meanwhile, Rossiu tries to support his friend, the only boy on the ship who is his age, through his grief. But can he really learn how to pilot Gurren?
>> ARTICLE
> But can he really learn how to pilot Gurren?

I was wondering that and thinking who I'd actually like to see pilot the Gurren and I think he's the only one. Then again would love it if Nia somehow did haha that would be so fun I bet

Fuck this was depressing, I hope it gets cheerful and fun again but I suppose even if it doesn't I'll enjoy it anyway. I just want them to be happy again :(

Yeah I just want to binge ahead to when things are happy again :(

Episode 9

* Im still emotionally drained from the last episode, but Ill try to push through this.

* Oh, I always thought the narrator was talking about Simon when he said a man that has yet to realize his destiny. That sucks.

* [I cant tell if these girls are supposed to be his daughters, or](http://i.imgur.com/MPXAb3K.jpg)

* [After watching NGE and Future Diary, is it like mandatory for these hard-ass female leader-types to have eyepatches?](http://i.imgur.com/XpNurc0.jpg)

* FUCK! Just one more reason Kaminas death is the worst thing in the history of ever. Were he still alive, wed be getting some hilarious sexual passes toward Adiane at the same time he was busy kicking her ass.

* Apparently the [Spiral King](http://i.imgur.com/dm2mwzE.jpg) lives on [Omega.](http://i.imgur.com/f1JLd4u.jpg)

* They seek out the light Clearly this guy has never heard of Redditors.

* [Simons turned into Aang after Appa got stolen,](http://i.imgur.com/iCjjjLS.jpg) only he *knows* his best friend is never coming back.

* [Alright, interesting new text style.](http://i.imgur.com/Xz6rv5e.png)

* I still just cant believe it. Preaching to choir, sweetie.

* What, you think you can pilot it all by yourself? Why, yes. Yes, I do actually.

* And Simon immediately agrees with me.

* You know, if youd held it together, Kamina wouldnt be dead right now! Oh, yeah, because thats what you yell at a grieving child to help him move on. This guy has seen way too much anime. You cant fix grief just by yelling at someone.

* [Is this show suddenly tackling a crisis of faith message?](http://webm.land/media/2z93.webm) Thats right, this studio made NGE.

* [I wouldnt be surprised if Yoko tries pulling a sacrificial suicide-run the first chance she gets.](http://i.imgur.com/IGcnAPw.jpg)

* [Fuck, she looks depressed.](http://i.imgur.com/h7FMMmA.jpg)

* [I cant even make a bad sex joke out of this scene.](http://i.imgur.com/xhQf02u.jpg)

* Rossiu, you should know by now that combining wont work as smoothly with a person hes angry at is piloting the other one.

* [Fuck me. This hurts to watch.](http://webm.land/media/6wfn.webm) I mean, its not up there with the Betrayal episode of Code Geass, but it still hurts.

* I guess Kamina finally managed to get the message through to Simon not to feel fear

* [He was so upset that his Lagann actually puked.](http://webm.land/media/RTM4.webm)

* [Notice how the type font for Gurren Lagann is different from all the previous times.](http://i.imgur.com/jPOfASb.jpg)

* [Am I watching Revolutionary Girl Utena or some shit?](http://webm.land/media/ucce.webm)

* The chick has fucking [plus signs in her eyes.]( http://i.imgur.com/TtSUyHu.jpg) What, is she some failed [Arbiter?](http://i.imgur.com/7ZX2hES.jpg)

* Okay, so my theory about her being a beastwoman was wrong. Shes just quirky. And has crosses in her eyes.

* Its so thick and cold and wet and gooey and squishy. Its wonderful. Okay, fuck everything.

* [Nia confirmed as Simba.](http://i.imgur.com/kTOizuP.jpg)

* [Is Nia related to Princess Peach?](http://i.imgur.com/z8Rzp6I.jpg)

* Was it just silently standing there, waiting to be acknowledged?

* Im guessing it doesnt work because his fighting spirit is coming from rage and not sheer will. Hes kind of like Zuko from Avatar.

* [Im not even gonna question anymore how the physics behind that thing work.](http://webm.land/media/1YUA.webm)

* Is Nia voiced by Starfire? *Checks Wikipedia* HOLY SHIT! What is it with this girl voicing mysterious, innocent characters with funny speech patterns?

* Good thing he fired one of those slow-moving rockets.

* [Does anyone else think this gunman kind of looks like a banana?](http://i.imgur.com/tqiCHEI.jpg)

* [Yoko:](http://webm.land/media/lXZc.webm) Shit, a new love interest? But I was just coming around to the idea of being Simons waifu.

* Okay, time for some bullshit speculation. [Speculation](/s "Nia is actually the Spiral Kings daughter (from what little we saw of him, he did look pretty human in comparison to the rest of the beastmen), and thats why shes never seen another one besides him before. It would also explain her royal looking clothes. For whatever reason, he decided to lock her in a crate and throw her off a cliff, and here we are.")

* [FINALLY!](http://webm.land/media/AFcF.webm) Somebody questions it!

* [Oh, cool.](http://i.imgur.com/lSSY75e.jpg) I just noticed Dia-Ganzan took on Laganns color scheme.

* [Theres no escape, filthy humans.](http://i.imgur.com/G7RormX.jpg) You know, girl, besides your scorpion tail, youre probably the most human-looking out of all the beastmen weve seen so far. Even Viral has fangs.

* First Princess Nia, daughter of Spiral King Lord Genome. Well I guess that answers my speculation. Go me?

Next.

Episode 10

* I wonder who all the other poor saps who got stuck in those boxes are. Simon sure didnt seem to care.

* Well, in that case well just have to kill her and pretend we never saw her. Damn. Thats fucking cold. [Ice cold.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk05JCQEl54)

* [Madame General, are you trying to seduce me?](http://i.imgur.com/c7LrbJL.jpg) Because its working.

* [I think Attenborough got caught up in that whole lip injection fad.](http://i.imgur.com/dNauKAh.jpg)

* What is a princess? Wow, man, I knew you were uneducated but I never knew you were *that* uneducated.

* Im gonna put the screws to that little girl and make her spill everything she knows. What the fuck, dude?

* [The capital I in this type font looks a lot like a J.](http://i.imgur.com/5mTeg81.png)

* The Spiral King is colder than his Generals. Just, Who gives a fuck if shes my daughter? Im the king, I can always just fuck some other fine bitch and get a new heir. Just look at Emperor Charles 80+ kids.

* [Please just be his servants Please just be his servants Please just be his servants](http://i.imgur.com/DctqZDl.jpg) These people have already thrown enough incestuous bullshit at me with Ragyo.

* [Thats the look of someone who regrets letting her king skull-fuck her in the eye.](http://i.imgur.com/uRTjuxw.jpg) (What the fuck did I just say?)

* [This guy has a fucking sleek design.](http://i.imgur.com/Z0vwdLe.jpg)

* [And he has spiral-eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/rDyr4t0.jpg)

* [Adiane:](http://webm.land/media/eZYl.webm) Oh, sorry, man. You had some dirt on your chin there; thought Id get it.

* [Her tail just sort of seems to spring from nowhere, doesnt it?](http://i.imgur.com/0nJNqTI.jpg)

* You dont have to roll out the red carpet for her! I dont know; I mean, she is a(n ex-) princess.

* Nia is more ignorant than Simon is. Also, how did she know what the word war meant last episode, but not fist?

* Ha! She got him to pull a complete 180 in like two seconds.

* The Spiral King reminds me a lot of Ozai from Avatar. Big, bad ruler who wants even more power than he already has for no real reason other than hes a jerk. What's really amazing me is how Nia didnt grow up to be an Azula-like character.

* I just thought: What if Leeron ends up getting killed? Oh, fuck, I dont think I could handle going through that.

* According to Leerons theory, Lagann is just trying to tell Simon to man up and get over himself.

* Notice how they didnt get Kaminas VA to say those flashback lines. Gotta save money wherever possible, right men? (Assholes)

* Kaminas Ghost: Dont believe in the me who believes in you, Simon. In fact, dont even believe in the Simon that believes in you! Believe in the hot, nave chick who youll probably end up marrying later in the series! Thats where true power lies: Sexual frustration.

* [Im so glad this show actually has the sense to show how real people would react to being told to just get over it.](http://webm.land/media/njYw.webm) A lot of other media, not just anime, could learn from this.

* [Normal type font is back.](http://i.imgur.com/UODoDNy.jpg)

* [Adiane is like the anti-Moses.](http://i.imgur.com/Mh2FcqZ.jpg)

* I swear she said sticking humans.

* [Okay, thats pretty funny.](http://webm.land/media/XBnn.webm)

* Knowing Yokos rifle, a shot in the back from that thing would probably be like getting hit with a Destroy Decomposer level Dominator in Psycho-Pass.

* [Adiane can make some disturbing fucking faces.](http://webm.land/media/9NIH.webm) Isnt her title The Elegant?

* Wait. So does this mean that all those crates are filled with his abandoned kids? Is this like an [Baccano Spoiler](/s "Ennis") scenario, where once your kid screws up you just off them and make another one?

Damn, Nia sounds terrible in dub.

Also happy I didn't watch Madoka dub..

EDIT: Also
>I just realized the irony in that a show where the machines are powered by manliness, one of the Four Generals is a woman. Eh, lets just call her a lesbian. Its an anime; its not like its that unlikely.

I'm not sure if this counts as spoiler, but I'm quite sure only few gunmen are actually powered by Fighting Spirit. At least not in the way that Lagann (and anything it connects to) is.
>> ARTICLE

> Also happy I didn't watch Madoka dub..

I thought the awkwardness of her voice fit her personality quite well...
>> ARTICLE
Well, it does kinda fit her, but still, it's so damn high-pitched I can't really listen to it.

Also since I always watch subs, I kinda get conditioned into what voice "belongs" to a character, and anything else sounds worse, so that's also a factor. (I also love recognizing VAs from one anime in another, but that's another topic).
>> ARTICLE
> (I also love recognizing VAs from one anime in another, but that's another topic).

I do that, too. Recognizing Rob Paulson has become an artform.
>> ARTICLE
At this point whenever I hear familiar voice and can't place it I have to pause and check MAL to see where do I know it from.

You can find some strange matches also. Like Kyubey (Madoka) has same VA as Hachikuji (Monogatari).
I'm talking original voices, of course.
>> ARTICLE
And the dub voice for Kyubey is the same as the dub voice for Ritsu.
>> ARTICLE
Most surprising for me was Holo (Spice and Wolf) having same VA as Ryuko (KlK). (Again, original voice) 

Found by accident, the don't sound similar at all.

That's Koshimizu Ami, also Kallen from Code Geass.

> Oh, I always thought the narrator was talking about Simon when he said a man that has yet to realize his destiny. That sucks.

I thought he was too, but the narration for this episode was definitely talking about Kamina as well. I guess he talks a bit about both of them.

> Is Nia related to Princess Peach?

Bubblegum, maybe.

> Oh, cool. I just noticed Dia-Ganzan took on Laganns color scheme.

Rewatching TTGL for the first time since watching KlK, Dai-Gunzan reminds me of [Kill la Kill spoilers](/s "the ship Nudist Beach used, the one from the hype thrusters gif.")

> Well, in that case well just have to kill her and pretend we never saw her. Damn. Thats fucking cold. Ice cold.

I'll watch that video every time it's posted. So good.

PS Adiane shares a VA with Villetta.

"Fighting Spirit" is a better translation. I never liked the "manliness" interpretation, other than it making sense from Kamina's fairly chauvinist worldview. 
>> ARTICLE
Beastmen Gunmen are all solar powered (It was stated in the second or third ep)

There are *some* rules to how "Fighting Spirit" works, not really many, and they kinda trump all the other minor rules like physics and such, but the show will actually explain some stuff in time.

Ok guys this were probably the two most depressing episodes of this anime, but they introduced Nia and showed what a fun and wild bunch Team Dai-Gurren is, so I can't be too strict with this two episodes, I only wish Simon stops having this fucking ugly look on this face...

To be fair, he hasn't really done much in the series at this point. The hype will come, just gotta give it a few more episodes.

Holy Shit Quotient?  
From the first episode onwards it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous. I don't know, because i don't follow your rewatch for TTGL but do you guys plan on watching the movies or atleast Lagann-hen afterwards? It's almost a must!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not actually rewatching, I'm just figuring out which episodes it is from the thread and joining in the discussion. 

I have seen Lagann-hen, it is fantastic. Dunno if it's in the schedule. 

Yeah, I was gonna link to the tvtropes page for HSQ, but >mobile.

Basically me, when i saw they experienced the glorious ending that episode 8 had. Didn't even know a TTGL rewatch was running... Would be cool to see in the sidebar maybe with a link to the most recent discussion thread.

For TTGL it would be an multiplier that doubles itself with every episode... Like trying to fold a magazine in half 24 times.

Actually, what you describe is y=x\^2 for y>0, an exponential would be y=2\^x for x>1.

**Episode 9**


Starting off with the first Kamina-less op of the show :(


This episode probably hurt me more than the lat one during my first watch. Seeing Simon and Yoko so broken is really brutal.


Ok so this episode does something really cool that I wanna point out. A lot of the animation and art in , especially in that of the characters' faces and bodies is very "messy" or simplified, even out of focus. This is most obvious in the hallway scene with Kittan and Simon fighting. To me, this really helps to reflect the emotional turmoil they're going through. Together with the constant rain, it creates a really depressing atmosphere throughout most of the episode.


WE MEET NIA THIS EPISODE! EVERYONE SAY HI TO BEST GIRL.



**Episode 10**


If you haven't fallen in love with Nia by the time this episode is over you have no heart.


Seriously though, gainax does a really good job building up her character throughout this episode and she quickly becomes a favorite.


VIRAL IS A [BADASS](http://i.imgur.com/zIpEaNI.jpg). Literally throws around the dai-gurren like its nothing.


Simon still battling with the belief that he's powerless without Kamina :( [DONT DO IT](/s "however, the payoff of Simon overcoming this in the next episode is one of my favorite moments of the entire show.")

As far as I am understood Nia addresses everyone like royalty which is hard to translate

I couldn't put my finger onto it until the rewatch, her tone has such a relaxed softness without the usual extreme cute girl intonation which makes her so plesant to hear.

Damn...I didn't remember this level of despair. The are all so sad, IT HURTS :(.  
What really got me was the sad piano version of "Pierce the Heavens with your Spirit" :,(  
I also don't remember Nia being this likeable. First time I watched it she was quite annoying, but now it's the opposite.

Pretty cautious of these episodes

**EPISODE 11**  
	Straight to [this](http://i.imgur.com/vb7Q91D.png), ey? This is gonna be a fun ep

So, this is what I meant yesterday when I said they pull out of their slump in a big way. And this is, incidentally, one of my favorite episodes of the show simply for Simon's re-emergence into the spotlight.

There are other villages like Littner that have established themselves on the surface, and have to survive against Gunmen raids. The beastmen are projecting an image of the battle above their heads as a propaganda tool; the idea is that everybody will be demoralized after watching their heroes die. The result... wasn't what they had hoped.

The armadillo always struck me as the most intelligent of the Generals. He's the only one who respects the fact that the humans can be formidable opponents.

It's Gurren Lagann. The reasoning is "because it's awesome."

Rossiu cares about Simon so much. He's so happy to have him back. 

>Kid. Im genuinely so happy about all that hes saying. Must. Hold. Back. Tears!!

No you don't. There's nothing wrong with letting them flow at this point. This is perfectly 100% acceptable at this scene. 

>This is so awesome

Remember what I said yesterday: These episodes are about people trying to figure out their place in Team Gurren without Kamina. Some fall into it naturally, like the inherently captain-like Dayakka. Some try to be what they aren't, like Kittan, who lacks Kamina's charisma. Some need to awaken to it, like Simon.

I'm so glad he did.

Me too. This is Simon's show, and he grows into it.

WELCOME BACK, SIMON.

Today we have one of Gurren Lagann's first truly legendary moments, and the first of its three equally legendary insert song scenes. (There are more than three scenes with insert songs in the whole series, but it has three *particularly awesome* ones. You'll see them when we get to them, though.)

Here's the payoff for those three episodes worth of depression and mourning. Simon realizes that he needs to live for himself, not just in the shadow of Kamina. That he's the one who needs to believe in himself. And it's **fucking awesome**. 

But now that we've hit Episode 11, I'd like to talk about Kamina for a bit.

[Way back in the Episode 1 thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/36eujs/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_1/crdfwpe), I told /u/franklyn26 that my feelings on him were a little complicated. Fearing I'd spoil it, I quickly backtracked and simplified it, but let's actually get into it now:

So the first time I watched TTGL, right after it'd finished airing, I couldn't stand Kamina. The internet wouldn't shut up about how awesome he was, how crazy and cool he was, but I just thought he was an egotistical rude asshole. He was sexist, he couldn't comprehend people believing different things from him, he was ungrateful for help (see him complaining about what little food he's offered in Rossiu's intro episode), and he was a reckless moron who almost - and then eventually did - get himself killed. He was fun, sure, but I didn't get the love.

And then we get the flashback in this episode. We learn that for all his bluster and grandstanding, Kamina was... a kid. He was insecure, even scared a lot of the time. And he realized that the one who really could change things wasn't himself, but Simon. That this scared kid was blustering his way through life, drawing as much support from Simon as Simon was from him. 

And to me, that's an *infinitely more interesting* character than the surface level Kamina that everyone seems to love by default.

So yeah, I like Kamina in the end, but for none of the reasons everyone else seems to :P 

Also of note in Episode 11: Of the Four Generals, Guame gets to be a little more impertinent to Lordgenome than the others. Makes you wonder what his story is, mm? Also, /u/The-Sublimer-One, Lordgenome's girls come from villages like these, so they are thankfully NOT his daughters. 

ANYWAY, we also have Episode 12, which is definitely a breather after the emotional peak that's Simon's rebirth. It's a fun episode (Kittan, what the fuck is that little speedo) and also builds the relationship between Yoko and Nia. And Viral fails again. He can't be very happy about that.
>> ARTICLE
> And to me, that's an infinitely more interesting character than the surface level Kamina that everyone seems to love by default.

Agreed. Kamina is incredibly fun and likable on the surface, but he's so much more than that. By putting up a facade he was able to sort of trick Simon into being a confident kid. Simon looked up to him. He couldn't just tell Simon he was scared of things. As Simon's big bro, Kamina had to act confident. Fake it till you make it. Simon learned a lot from Kamina, but realizes he doesn't have to be Kamina.
>> ARTICLE
I think the guame thing is answered in the first movie
>> ARTICLE
It's answered in the series, actually. I just pose things like questions to get the new viewers a-ponderin'
>> ARTICLE
> It's answered in the series, actually

I thought that was one of the few questions that didn't get answered in-series. They gave you everything you needed to figure it out, but never actually provided the answer itself.
>> ARTICLE
> [Ep 17/18 spoilers](/s "In the episodes when Rossiu is interrogating the Lordgenome head and he tells about the Spiral War, you see his past self and Guame is on his shoulder a la Boota to Simon.")
>> ARTICLE
Huh. Good thing this is a rewatch, because I completely missed that little detail.
>> ARTICLE
> And to me, that's an infinitely more interesting character than the surface level Kamina that everyone seems to love by default.
> So yeah, I like Kamina in the end, but for none of the reasons everyone else seems to :P

That is actually precisely why I love Kamina. I mean, he was a fun character before this by all means, but this is what really made him interesting and much more than just an overly confident jackass. 
>> ARTICLE
I sorta agree about Kamina.  I do think that Simon is 1000x the character he ever was,  infinitely more interesting. He's not a bad character at all,  but he's overhyped (and Simon underhyped?) 
>> ARTICLE
> Here's the payoff for those three episodes worth of depression and mourning.

Makes it worth it :p

> Viral fails again. He can't be very happy about that.

I feel like this might be a recurring theme

This.

> And to me, that's an infinitely more interesting character than the surface level Kamina that everyone seems to love by default.

I love characters like this. I loved his arrogance and stupidity, but I was really happy about the flashback scene. It gives him way more substance. 

I could probably comment on everything you wrote, but I won't. I just really like your explanation and I'm a little relieved that you *do* like Kamina, gotta say
>> ARTICLE

I do like Kamina! I like some characters better, but I do like the guy, especially for the depth he gets in this episode.

Welcome one and all to "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts". I hope you're ready to see more Nia, *in a bikini*!

- The first "Song of the Episode" is none other than ["Happily Ever After"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFahCRRS1K8&), this is the only song acceptable for Simon's big comeback.

- The second "song of the Episode" is ["Can a Mole Pig Dream of Spirals"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEABuO45q5I&). Nice Sax.

Today's first fact is just something random about one of the members of Team Dai-Gurren.

- "That guy needs to calm down": You've probably already seen him, his name is [Artenborough](https://nerdmaids.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/attenborough_cortitch_by_scruffyronin-d2y04lm.jpg), his nickname is "Beamspam McMuppet" and his nose is a strawberry.

Today's second and third facts are from episode 12.

- "Manly Omage": While it's not specifically stated, the [posing](http://i.imgur.com/sQA8x2X.jpg) that Kittan and the others are doing can be considered a [JoJo](https://satchiikoma.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/the-jojo-poses.jpg) reference; I mean look at that, no one poses like that unless it's a JoJo reference.

- "Yes, that is Squidward": If you didn't notice it(and I don't know how you wouldn't have), [Squidward](http://imgur.com/HB46lhs) was in episode 12; he was making a [much needed cameo](http://imgur.com/0YaqibP).

That's all for today, if you've stuck around this far you can see that it is definitely worth it! Simon's big comeback is the start of something amazing, time for Simon to fill in those big shoes left behind. See you tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

Episode 11

* I could probably get into this series more if I didnt have to write these super-detailed lists. It was a lot easier with Code Geass, where I already knew what was gonna happen.

* Im wondering if Lagann is like a prototype gunman, that all the other gunmen were modeled after, and thats why its so unique and powerful.

* [Cytomanders outfit is way girlier than Adianes.](http://i.imgur.com/aBAvSGF.jpg)

* Yes, of course. Youre just as shrewd as ever. Hes not a shrew. Hes a tortoise.

* [Stop being so cute.](http://i.imgur.com/mXlgQ2g.jpg)

* [Lol. These guys just pop up like its nothing.](http://webm.land/media/gcc8.webm)

* Wow, these guys really dont like Simon right now. Not even Yoko.

* [Okay, I admit thats borderline obsessive.](http://i.imgur.com/Q7vO0KX.jpg)

* Im crazy, arent I? All heroes worth their salt are.

* [Simons hand looks like its just moving up and down.](http://webm.land/media/edpN.webm)

* [Holy shit, I *am* watching Utena! That explains the worse-than-hentai dubbing on those characters!](http://webm.land/media/C8TG.webm) It in no way has to do with those girls possibly being part of some trap. That would just be silly.

* Kittan: Everyone shut up! This is my first chance to bang somebody who Im not related to, isnt already in a relationship, and probably isnt a loli! Now, listen to me namedrop Kamina, so youre all guilted into following my plan!

* [Oh, Leeron, you dog.](http://webm.land/media/sbWV.webm)

* I wonder how awkward it was for the male beastmen to have to change forms to look like that.

* Yoko: What the hell were you thinking, moron?

* Kittan: I just wanted to indulge in the pleasures every man is entitled to!

* You know, youll never be your bro. I think you should always be yourself. Thats pretty much exactly the moral of the last monologue Kamina gave Simon.

* [Where the hell are they, even?](http://i.imgur.com/ONeWUWz.png)

* So, the Spiral King is Skips? Even more Ozai parallels. (Ozai and Skips are voiced by Mark Hamill.)

* Self-awareness if overrated, anyway. Thats why I waste my days watching anime.

* Nias gonna be the mother of a brothel.

* And someday theyll be discarded, exactly like you were. Gotta give the guy points for honesty.

* [Damn, thats one hell of a pimp slap.](http://webm.land/media/KsI0.webm)

* [Did these guys get their inspiration from Toy Story 2?](http://webm.land/media/XRFX.webm)

* This bedrock is incredibly tough. Its like nothing Ive seen. Well, thats easy to get around. Just switch to Creative mode.

* Is Simon digging with his drill-key, or is he just that awesome?

* [Yep, drill-key.](http://i.imgur.com/ADevj0u.jpg)

* [THANK FUCK!](http://i.imgur.com/aIeJBM6.jpg) Oh, sweet, glorious flashback, how Ive yearned for you!

* [HOLY SHIT THATS AWESOME](http://webm.land/media/Imp1.webm)

* [Damn, this show is fucking funny.](http://webm.land/media/7zgC.webm)

* Nice job opening your big mouth, [Nia.](http://i.imgur.com/4UalRfa.jpg)

* [Old Simon:](http://i.imgur.com/O207gCR.jpg) Sorry I took so long. This old bladder has a mind of its own.

* [I want to make a Kamina joke about how close that was](http://i.imgur.com/K1a7g1J.jpg), but, well, you know.

* [That purple-haired girl](http://i.imgur.com/H7xDpDQ.jpg) actually looks a lot like one of the girls a beastman was disguised as.

* [What is that projection hitting thats stopping it?](http://i.imgur.com/MdOMPrH.jpg) *Is* this a Hunger Games area?

* [Simon:](http://webm.land/media/IB5B.webm) I have no idea, but damn if I dont sound rad as hell!

* [Holy fucking shit.](http://webm.land/media/708d.webm)

* These are all princesses who were thrown away like I was. Sexist, bitch. How dare you limit those womyn by the oppressive term of princess.

* [Waitress:](http://i.imgur.com/rcYvQbm.jpg) Simon, thats a piece of a broken beer bottle.

* [Wait, so that all-female village is legit and the beastmen only pretended to be some of the girls?](http://i.imgur.com/MTzUBoP.jpg) What?

Episode 12

* [At first I wondering why they would use human footprints for their graphic, then I remembered that theyre signifying that the Dia-Gurren is comprised entirely of humans.](http://i.imgur.com/8ZyptE7.jpg)

* Yoko, Would You Do Me a Favor and Disrobe? Im sure the last two words just couldnt fit on the title card.

* [Hey, its the Kill la Kill sparkles.](http://i.imgur.com/nXCF1dX.jpg)

* [Luckily for Yoko, shes been unwittingly wearing a bathing suit ever since she first showed up.](http://i.imgur.com/7NvzBWH.jpg)

* You know Leeron has the water-gear all ready. He just wants to see some hot guys without their shirts on.

* No, she didnt do it right! That ball was totally out of bounds! If only Brief was here to give us an unbiased ruling!

* [I think watching anime beach-episodes inspired Carrot Tops entire act.](http://i.imgur.com/uM4f5od.jpg)

* Also, Nia and Yoko just attempted to kill an animal in cold blood.

* [Nias position reminds me of Evangelion.](http://i.imgur.com/z10EqBZ.jpg)

* [Yoko so kawaii.](http://webm.land/media/Eq3O.webm)

* Those kids were like half a second from being bugs on a windshield.

* [Thats a really smart detail.](http://i.imgur.com/Pl8YwvG.jpg) What with how the pressure differential messes with their urinary tract.

* Viral really likes making dramatic monologues, even when no one is listening to him.

* Nia attempting to establish the Church of Simon, Prophet of Kamina.

* [Or you could just let Viral shoot him, and *then* crush her, thereby leaving Dia-Gurren without its head resource, and pretty much assuring your victory.](http://webm.land/media/K8OY.webm) But, no, by all means go ahead and gloat.

* [Dinner and a show!](http://i.imgur.com/SD2pE9q.jpg)

Yo, got a question if you don't mind.

Why do you watch it in English? Don't kill me, just wondering.
>> ARTICLE
It lets me pay more attention to what actions are actually occurring on screen, rather than having to always look at subtitles. It also makes making WebMs easier. Normally, unless the dub is unusually bad (i.e. Revolutionary Girl Utena or Higurashi), I'll watch it that way.
>> ARTICLE
I see. It's a valid point, but I can't help but feel like we're watching two entirely different shows.
>> ARTICLE
If you want two completely different shows, compare the dub and sub of Ghost Stories.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same with TTGL. Or most shows, to be honest. Few have dubs that match the theme of the source material.
>> ARTICLE
However, some, like Ghost Stories, Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, Dragonball Z, etc. actually improve the show over the original dub.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. Now there's something I didn't think I'd ever hear hah.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the Japanese dub of Ghost Stories is dreadful. The English dub is practically an officially licensed abridged series.

It got shot twice by Yoko.

#**AWW HELL YEAH, SIMON'S BACK, BABY!**
>> ARTICLE
I think episode 11 with Simon becoming a man was the first time I've ever teared up in joy watching an anime. It was so beautiful to see and I've rewatched the scene countless times. 
>> ARTICLE
Same exactly.  My most rewatched scene of any anime. The flood of emotions watching it for the first time cannot be described. 
>> ARTICLE
I re-watched this scene a lot too. 

If you haven't already, I recommend watching the movie version of this scene. It's basically the same but the voice acting is a lot more powerful: Simon is practically *growling* out some of the words.
>> ARTICLE
That entire scene is the only thing worth watching in the first movie TBH. A lot of the VA is also redone in both movies too to make them more powerful actually.

**Episode 11**

This opening is just still so good...Nia is adorable in it

Did they get her shoes? 

Nia slap!

And Simon looks like he's finally back!

He finally gets to save her :3

That music blend with Simon's speech...okay that was pretty cool

Princess burial ground...that's a depressing amount...

So just leaving that village of only girls alone?

**Episode 12**

Is this the beach episode?

Yoko's already half naked anyway...

And they've realized it haha 

Poor Yoko but Nia is just too great

Did they forget Yoko behind?? Ok no phewf lol

Woah intense shooting from Yoko, Nia haircut? Not sure how I feel about that...

Viral continues to live lol

So this might be an unpopular opinion but "trading" Kamina for Nia was well worth it, I'm liking her as part of the cast a lot more then I did Kamina

Also was the "beach" episode? If so then that was a pretty good beach episode.

>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was the beach episode.

Was pretty great timing for it!

***FUCKING***

[**GUNBUSTER POSE**](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/664/747/f5f.jpg)

FUCK YEAH! The most badass pose in the history of anime makes an appearance in TTGL. 

Fun Fact: Simon's character development in this arc is based on that of Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster.

Funner fact: While this is a reference to the Gunbuster pose, the Gunbuster pose itself is a Getter Robo reference which is by far TTGL's biggest inspiration. Other things TTGL took from Getter are [TTGL SPOILERS](/s "the infintely fucking huge mecha and Spiral Energy which is 100% the exact same as Getter Rays from Getter Robo.") Getter Robo is an absolutey insanely fun read of a manga if any TTGL fans are interested in that by the way.

Also, daily reminder that Gunbuster and Diebuster are like required viewing for TTGL and NGE fans alike. Also, shameless plug, I'm hosting a [Gainax rewatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/36emc1/studio_gainax_rewatch_marathon_is_going_forward/) featuring those two and more (FLCL for example) that starts right after this rewatch if anyone is interested! They're both only 6 episodes and they're great to watch right after TTGL so why not have a look?

Wish I could fully participate in this rewatch but I've watched TTGL like 4 times in the last year so I'm kind of burned out! Will pop my head in every now and then though just because I love reading the reactions to one of my favourite anime. Still have my Limited Edition BluRay for the next time I get the urge though.

In case anyone is wondering, the girl who voices Nia in the english dub also voiced Starfire and Princess Bubblegum.

I guess she just got typecast as the socially awkward princess.

I've never before had such a strong desire to watch a dub

It's a very good dub

Yes, yes... Soon we will completely take over the anime-watching industry, and Japan will be forced to do what happened to Space Dandy for every anime.

Blasphemy!

But seriously, the dub of Space Dandy is like ten times better than the sub.

She's just that good at being a princess. Maybe she secretly *is* a princess.

Episodes 11&12 were alright I get the feeling they were toned down a bit in terms of story progression because of what will happen in the next few but the death of 3 of the 4 whatever their name is is good.

>> ARTICLE
>Okay why does everyone keep acting as if they have known each other for years you knew him for maybe a few months. You cant act like he did all this since the time you were a small child.

Except he did live in an underground village with kamina for his whole life.
>> ARTICLE
But from what we see he never interacted with him till the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
What makes you think that? The only flashback we see just proves that they were together before the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
From what i remember in the first episode simon acted like a stranger to Kamina. And after that Kamina just straight up makes him join his crew.
>> ARTICLE
Simon knew kamina's name when we first saw him, though he did say that he is an only child after kamina said to call him "bro", but he did call him bro after he explained that it was "bro" in a metaphorical sense.
>> ARTICLE
> Its a fucking battle ship what do you mean it cant go in water

So I'm not the only one who questioned that.
(I mean this is absurd even for TTGL "logic")
>> ARTICLE
Did you see a propeller on its ass? Because I sure didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Guame didn't die. He quite clearly orders a retreat. 

So he and Cytomander (bird guy) are left.
>> ARTICLE
See idk why i forgot that.
>> ARTICLE
Best part in EP 12 is the way the bridge crew is, *ahem* in touch with Dai-Gurren.

Especially Leeron.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 11**


This is definitely one of my favorite episodes in the entire series, and is so awesome it could probably have its own discussion thread.


Kamina's story about Simon is a great scene that still makes me tear up once in a while. Kamina had so much faith in Simon, and continues to be a force that drives Simon forward.


[Such a badass](http://i.imgur.com/OBO4YgY.jpg)


Probably one of my favorite scenes ever. When Simon starts his speech and "Happily Ever After" kicks in, I get so pumped up. This is one of the greatest payoffs in character development I've seen in anime, and its just such an awesome sequence overall.


[LETSGOOOOOO](http://i.imgur.com/q9gVlIe.jpg)


This is one of those episodes I rewatch over and over when I just want to feel awesome. Absolutely fantastic, and its followed up by:


**Episode 12**


SUN, SEA, AND SWIMSUITS! BEACH EPISODE TTGL STYLE! 


Poor yoko gets the spotlight completely stolen from her by best girl


Seriously though this is a really cool Yoko/Nia bonding episode thanks to the crazy trust Nia has in Yoko at the end of the battle.


[BAKANAAAAAAA](http://i.imgur.com/JgAfzoc.jpg)


Nia with short hair actually looks really good. 

>> ARTICLE
So, are we gonna actually watch episode 16 as part of the two episodes a day thing, or will that be optional?
>> ARTICLE
It's completely unnecessary. Just a recap episode with some cool concept art of the characters at the end. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay. I think I know what to write for that.
>> ARTICLE
It *is* included, but you don't have to. I ain't, so why should you?
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite episodes! The manly tears!!! [They won't stop!!!!](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/4054382/images/1237793046234.jpg)  
The beaten hero getting up is such a cliche, but TTGL executes is so perfectly! Once again, Motivation: The Anime!  
  
I remembered the beach episode being nothing more than useless fanservice, but it actually had some good moments! Especially in the second half! It just feels good to see Simon being a badass!
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh...I love the way Viral repeatedly loses and yet somehow still makes a comeback. 
>> ARTICLE
Poor Viral. He just tries so damn hard. 
>> ARTICLE
This is my second time watching TTGL, and I'm switching between the sub and the dub, and one thing that kind of bothers me is that while the dub is pretty good, the Giga Drill Break kind of lacks the same oomph as in the original.
>> ARTICLE
The voice acting in the sub is just phenomenal! I've watched TTGL probably 4 times already and still get chills every time they bust out the GDB.
>> ARTICLE
#New viewers: There are two different versions of Episode 6!!

The aired-on-TV version is half clipshow, and is titled "Sit in the Hot Tub 'Till You're Sick!!" The other version, the director's cut, is called "There are Some Things I Just Have to See!!" and is (to the best of my knowledge) the actual episode that we're watching for tomorrow.

It's also one of the funniest episodes in the series, and you will completely understand why they aired the clip show version instead. 

*Make sure yours has the correct episode title.*
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads-up! I'll look forward to reading the thread tomorrow, then, since Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Hulu all list "Sit in the Hot Tub 'Till You're Sick." This will save me lots of confusion!
>> ARTICLE
There are other options to watch it, but we aren't allowed to talk about them...
>> ARTICLE
Scared I'm going to mess this up...
>> ARTICLE
> *Make sure yours has the correct episode title.*

Don't tell me what to do.
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather die than do what I don't want to do!
>> ARTICLE
Its only been a day, but Im looking forward to the regular animation coming back.

* [Ohhhhh!](http://i.imgur.com/Zc0acBk.png) First got her of the day. Wow. Hes just running down the lists of [things to insult her on](http://i.imgur.com/G8IDCXY.png)
* [Children, please](http://i.imgur.com/FVEBC6d.png)
* Well. [It](http://i.imgur.com/ioIrE6G.png) was bound to happen eventually. Im a little annoyed at myself for not predicting it. I guess I was mostly waiting for the beach episode to consider it
* Can I ask why theyre leaving the teenager to [deal with these strangers](http://i.imgur.com/sQAHCpB.png)? And why he has to be the one to awkwardly tell her to cover herself?? Where are the adults? Also, how many of you kicked up a fuss when he said this? How many of you glared at him through your TVs and wished death on him and his family for this?? Come on, you can tell me. I wont judge.
* Damn. [Shes so cute](http://i.imgur.com/8f45Vgx.png)
* Even though the near nudity is unnecessary, [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ile4yFu.png) is kind of a fair point
* Kamina. [No.](http://i.imgur.com/ZiCALZB.png)
* [This](http://i.imgur.com/tkPPHvu.png) is satisfying. Sorry guys, but hes been asking for it all episode
* [Is it even that though?](http://i.imgur.com/XU94WyT.png) Isnt it more that he just has no filter and doesnt think before he acts or speaks?
* [Onii-chans hurt!!](http://i.imgur.com/AHy0ZnP.png) Your onii-chan deserved it, Simon.
* [Okay.](http://i.imgur.com/wkJwRwC.png) Stick a few of them in a hole and make them fight to the death. Problem solved. You are welcome
* [Knock it off!!](http://i.imgur.com/oYmeTcH.png) I dont want to go through that hell again
* You know, if you want to dissuade someone or even persuade someone about something to do with religion, [THIS IS NOT  THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT](http://i.imgur.com/RtVuMNh.png)
* No, [this](http://i.imgur.com/LJVZzDZ.png) doesnt need to be worded into a question.
* Uhhhhh, is this guy [about to draw straws](http://i.imgur.com/MhA2CQr.png) to determine if him or his kids get to live???
* [Uh-oh](http://i.imgur.com/c1dyKHQ.png)
* Dont fucking [egg the kid on.](http://i.imgur.com/qojmwhi.png) 
* [He looks so cool](http://i.imgur.com/L8ouPY4.png). Ugh.
* I was gonna refute [this](http://i.imgur.com/qOscS1b.png), saying that the people would be super sad cause they spoiled the kids and probably grew to care for them, but I guess theyd all be feeling more relieved that it wasnt them or their family What a bummer
* Dude, you literally just told him that your religion was fake. Whats he gonna do with [that](http://i.imgur.com/SdmAcVu.png)? That shit looks heavy, why would he want to carry it with him?
* [This guys such a prick.](http://i.imgur.com/6fbziTh.png) Hey kid, want to take this book to read about God, even though our God isnt real and you cant read. (Lol)
* [WHAT THE HELL IS EVEN WRITTEN IN THE BOOK THEN???!](http://i.imgur.com/cHZ6x3d.png) Also, this kid sure is calm and fine talking to the dude who lied to him for his entire life and is kind of responsible for killing his mum
* [Thats what Im saying](http://i.imgur.com/CdtJ3QQ.png)!
* Yay! [More friends!](http://i.imgur.com/NF4XkSe.png)
* Ohhhh yaaaay [Fan service episode.](http://i.imgur.com/0UuPQbP.png)


So it looks like Team Gurren is expanding, which is nice (I did already forget all the new kids names, though). I wonder if theyre gonna collect more kids on this adventure. Anyway, I definitely liked this episode better than the last. And Im so glad that the animation is back to normal. But this definitely felt like a set-up episode (to get those kids). Not that thats really a bad thing. I imagine therell be a few. Ummm, next episode looks promising? Nah, Im still expecting it to be entertaining (even if it is gonna be filler-ish. I imagine I may end up having a lot to talk about.


Also, a hot spring episode is pretty much just a different type of beach episode, yeah?

>> ARTICLE
>Kamina. No.

Don't tell Kamina what to do!
>> ARTICLE
Don't tell me what *not* to do!
>> ARTICLE
> Is it even that though? Isnt it more that he just has no filter and doesnt think before he acts or speaks?

In the OVA episode 5.5 (half the length of a normal episode, bundled with the DS game and having absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the series), Kamina has a line that pretty much defines him. "I don't know anything, and I don't care!"
>> ARTICLE
So I should go and watch the half episode, yeah?

Also, I think he said that line in this episode too. Either way, yeah, that's pretty much him summed up
>> ARTICLE
It's fun, but completely unnecessary. [I summed it up here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/36x3sf/spoilers_tengen_toppa_gurren_lagann_episode_5/crhvfv0).
>> ARTICLE
>Also, a hot spring episode is pretty much just a different type of beach episode, yeah?

Why not have both? 
>> ARTICLE
Instead of me talking about the episode for today, I have my friend /u/The-Sublimer-One talking to us today. In all honesty, though, he currently isn't here as he is working right now, so instead he asked me to put this stuff up just for you guys. So, enjoy!

Episode 5

* Heres hoping this ones animation doesnt look like something out of the last two episodes of Evangelion.

* Lol, I accidentally starting watching episode 5.5 and didnt even realize that the characters were speaking Japanese for like twenty seconds.

* [Looks tasty.](http://i.imgur.com/YqmkmVs.jpg)

* Okay, from now on Im just gonna call them gunmen, like the show does. Im starting to get cognitive dissonance calling them gundams.

* Kamina: What the hell are you doing here in my gunmen, anyway? Didnt we build you a transport out of wreckage and scraps?

* Yoko: Yeah, you did, but we need to give the fans as much shipping bait as humanely possible. [For example](http://i.imgur.com/J9Tkmsm.jpg)

* Kamina *thinking*: Dont get boner dont get a boner dont get a boner

* [Simon:](http://webm.land/media/Wask.webm) Wow, Leeron, by comparatively did you mean compared to age of the universe? (Im American. 400 years is a long time for us.)

* Leeron: My, what an enormous cavern! Ive never seen anything like it other than that time someone linked me to goat.se. They told me I would enjoy it for some reason.

* [Well, Im getting dj vu.](http://i.imgur.com/SrB6B5B.jpg) Now, aside from my taste in Denzel Washington movies, that shot reminds me of the first episode.

* [Kamina:](http://webm.land/media/z20z.webm) Oh, great. Scientologists.

* Rossiu: Im very sorry, Im afraid that these two children have no parents. Everyone spoils them cause

* Kamina: https://youtu.be/egVWxwxlMnU?t=3m14s

* Kaminas is sickeningly like me. The second I learn something, I just start flaunting about how dumb others are for not knowing it. By the way, did you know that Tom Cruise is secretly gay?

* [THERES the signature Gainax boob-bounce weve all been waiting for!](http://webm.land/media/VqSE.webm)

* [Even the show recognizes how flauntally shes dressed.](http://i.imgur.com/HdJkhP2.png)

* [Im loving the muted colors in this episode.](http://i.imgur.com/I2esO0d.png) Reminds me of that episode of Space Dandy with the library planet.

* Did she just call him a louse? I mean, I know hes kind of an ass but I didnt think he was a parasite that they scrub you down in prison for.

* Triplets? Time for a reality show on TLC!

* This village is like if China got shoved into a 10 x 10 meter hole.

* [His tails still gone.](http://i.imgur.com/XQ0lr8I.jpg) I wonder if it will ever grow back.

* Kamina just up and ready to shatter an entire group of peoples faith like its nothing.

* [What the hell is with this guys nose?](http://i.imgur.com/ZOdIddd.png) It kind of reminds me of a gunmans nose.

* [Kamina agrees with me about his nose.](http://webm.land/media/2Bip.webm) Good man.

* [See!](http://i.imgur.com/IV7Ximo.jpg) Even the show agrees with me about his gunman-like face. (Im getting way too held up on this.)

* [Okay.](http://i.imgur.com/K9V71jG.jpg) 1. How did you not notice that until now? 2. The positing of that lever is hilarious.

* I wonder why Simons gunman is the only one (at least that weve seen) that requires both fighting spirit *and* a key to make it work. Probably one of the things that makes it special from the others.

* Thats one hell of lifestyle where, when confronted with having you own babies lives getting purged, your reaction is Theyll probably die of starvation or something in a few months anyway.

* This is the most depressing game of pick-up sticks ever.

* You know he left those last two in there on purpose just because those kids bugged the shit out of him.

* Kamina: Seriously, I dont get it, not one bit! Man, its hard to work these episode titles in. (If anyone gets that reference, I love you.)

* They cant drag you around because this show is already too close to getting sued by Nick as an Avatar rip-off. (Joking, please dont castrate me.)

* I think Im starting to get why people keep posting Just who the hell do you think I am?!

* [Kaminas glasses]( http://i.imgur.com/GETIAQv.png) must have been hiding in the same place the Gurren Laganns helmet was last episode pre-transformation. (Also, in that lighting, I think he just made himself blind.)

* Kamina is actually winning by ruining his reputation in front of these people. Is his father Xanatos?

* [I love how driving a gunman is about as complicated as just pushing levers and hoping that pushing them make the gunman do what you want it to.](http://webm.land/media/5hQV.webm) Its basically every mecha series broken down to its base element.

* [Seriously, dude.](http://i.imgur.com/MMJPlJg.jpg) At least consider wearing a helmet or something.

* The gunman driver is actually insulted that got attacked by an older model gunman. Heh.

* Still waiting until their gunman grows again. I just wanna see this thing like become the size of Hawaii or some shit.

* [While I was writing my last point, I actually thought to myself that it might be the elder and not Rossiu piloting that thing.](http://i.imgur.com/wqbeIOM.jpg) No, really, I did!

* Ha, Kaminas upset that they had to save the guy.

* The elder pretty much just confirmed that these things are less controlled by the levers and more just willing the levers to do stuff. How can you mimic their movements when you couldnt see what they were doing in there? (I probably sound like an idiot, saying what everyone else already knows.)

* Ha! Called it. He so set them up.

* How ironic would it be if those holy scriptures were actually a copy of the Bible or something?

* [And that bumps the group number up to lucky seven.](http://i.imgur.com/VGg9NZw.jpg) I wonder whos gonna die first? Im betting on the red-headed kid. (Im a terrible person.)

The next episode preview and its title make me think bathhouse episode. At least theyre getting it out of the way early.

Hello. So I came here after watching Kill LA kill and it rising to my favorites. I heard this is the same. So is this show good? Should I watch it? Edit: I'm convinced, gonna watch this as soon as I finish KLK.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a grown man. TTGL made me feel like I was 6. No other show has made me want to jump up and down in my living room fist pumping so hard. So many awesome moments. So many great lines.
>> ARTICLE
if you liked kill la kill i think you are going to like gurren lagann, just a feeling tho. 
>> ARTICLE
Studio Trigger, the studio that made KLK, was founded by a ton of people who worked on TTGL. KLK is very much a spiritual successor. Less clothes, more giant robots and drills. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea which show you're referring to with "less clothes."
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Kill la Kill than you will definitely like this show, it is one of the most motivating anime out there, and Kamina is a great character.
>> ARTICLE
O heck yea it is, Kill la Kill is the spiritual successor of Gurren Lagann. If you love Kill la Kill then Gurren Lagann is a must watch. The same can be said the other way; if you've seen Gurren Lagann and you loved it then you must see Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
Incidentally, there's a 12-minute OVA episode that came with the DS game that's included on the BDs, usually referred to as episode 5.5. 

It has nothing to do with the plot at large, and is mainly only worth watching for the [cute catgirl beastman](http://imgur.com/qj0B9su) who never ever ever shows up again. 
>> ARTICLE
Yoko teasing and their back in forth <3 strong ship here

It is pretty indecent Yoko...

This reminds a lot that Lottery story

You can just tell this high-priest dude is a jerk, agree with Kamina

It has a booger!

Well that was a big coincidence...priest man doesn't seem surprised

Kamina edging him on in the background...he really is great haha

It's weird how I would probably be saying the same things as Simon

Not sure how I feel about the added cast...should be interesting to see how they all mix together though

Quick and late write up today as I'm still sick :/

Day 5 of the epic journey. Today we got to meet forehead boy and to a lesser extent, Gimmy and Darry.

- Today for "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts" I've got ["Ahh! A Skeletonn!! A Skeletonnn!!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVTRHAhA1DI&penis) for today's song. I chose this one because it has a good feel for the majority of the episode being underground.

Once again I have 2 facts for today. These ones may not be as interesting as others but there isn't much to say about this episode that's interesting.

- Right and Left: Gimmy and Darry's names come from the japanese for words for "right" and "left", respectively; it symbolizes how Gimmy and Darry are like two halves of one person, they're always together.

- Forehead Boy: Kamina often calls Rossiu "dekosuke" which is an insult about his big forehead.

- BONUS FACT: For those of you that are familiar with the Fate series, Father Magin may seem a little familiar because this isn't the first time the voice actor has played [a prist with fighting skills and questionable morals](http://myanimelist.net/character/506/Kirei_Kotomine).

On another note, [Rossiu's](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091110164843/gurennlagann/images/1/12/Rossiu_Adai.jpg) eyebrows remind me of another [certain character](https://2ch.hk/sf/src/78553/14101735531750.gif) from Trigger. That's it for today. Out of the early episodes this one stuck with me the least, hell last episode is more memorable than this one.

This day Team Gurren grew 3 members larger.

Soo this was an episode...
I don't know I am always annoyed by this one, I don't like the priest and I really don't like Russio that much so this is one of the weaker episodes for me....
Also still no Viral, I AM DISSAPOINT.

[Spoiler] (/s "this gets even funnier later on")
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished this show about 2 days ago. And to those who just started watching it, you're in for a ride :^ )
>> ARTICLE
The next episode is going to be one of the best you'll ever watch in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Excited :)
>> ARTICLE
We're back to normal animation for this episode! Except someone turned the color saturation all the way down. Oops.

Episode 5! It's thematically and tonally so very different from the ridiculous over-the-top-ness of all of the episodes before, and we won't see another one like it for quite some time. Still, I really like it despite all of that.

It also introduces another important supporting character in Rossiu, aka Forehead Boy, as well as the two little twins Gimmy and Darry. Rossiu is... well, he's an interesting character to talk about and has a very intriguing character arc, but we'll get to that in time, won't we? 

Incidentally, when I was first watching Gurren Lagann, this was the episode that made me actually dislike Kamina. Kamina is a *dickbag* in this episode. He's rude, he's disrespectful, he complains about the villagers giving them literally as much food as they can spare. 

Sure, he's ultimately right about the religion not being real, but in the words of the Dude: "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like Kamina at first as well. Everybody was going on about how he's the best character, but I just saw him as a rude, dumb idiot who acts big but doesn't know shit. My image of him got better later on though.
>> ARTICLE
Alright. Hoping for some actual plot this episode

	[Dammit, Simon](http://i.imgur.com/wI0Xlfz.png)

	[These subs](http://i.imgur.com/vPRpibR.png) are incredible.

	The magnitude of [this](http://i.imgur.com/Mjo19yA.png) entire dick joke is impressive.

	[Poor Viral](http://i.imgur.com/p9sGqqY.png)

	I like [this](http://i.imgur.com/MXH7lcG.png) a lot. I wonder, though, if its 100% accurate or if its more that thats just how Kamina wants it to be 

	I mean, I wanna call [this](http://i.imgur.com/ia11BEi.png) out for being a bit Deus Ex Machina, but this sort makes sense with the whole spirit fuelling the Gunman thing, I suppose

	This flying Gunman is [a terrible aim](http://i.imgur.com/MktF5OP.png)

	Wait. Why is the [creepy old man](http://i.imgur.com/ke0Tmd7.png) with them??? Hahah, do they even know hes there?

	Ive literally forgotten everything [he just said](http://i.imgur.com/ZjIaqfo.png). Im not even trying to be funny. I think I tuned out a little. He says too many things

	The both of you are so [extremely rude](http://i.imgur.com/XuLILsj.png)!!!

	The sixth camera is the [most important one](http://i.imgur.com/JVpE9QA.png).

	[Nawww](http://i.imgur.com/bAwZWO5.png). They just care so much about each other!!

	[So much faith](http://i.imgur.com/PJ6XKoY.png). Far out. [Hes just waiting](http://i.imgur.com/WjPkdgH.png), knowing full well that Simons gonna take care of it. I love them too much.

	[I sure hope so](http://i.imgur.com/nbPuaku.png). I really want to see more of Viral. Id love for him to change sides also, but I dont know if this is one those kind of stories

	Team Gurren got even [bigger](http://i.imgur.com/FhxsXRu.png)! How nice for them

	Oh, so [this](http://i.imgur.com/IwbPdCv.png) is what /u/Pred007 meant about the Laganns drill looking more like a screw. Maybe? Like, its supposed to screw into Gunmans (or is it Gunmen?) and then overwrite the system or something?? And thats what Leeron meant when he was saying that its special?

	[Hes such a great guy](http://i.imgur.com/44dVvkp.png)

	DAMN YOU, YOU PIECE OF SHIT VOLCANO!!! Something was probably gonna *happen*! Im assuming romance is a minor sub-plot in this anime and well probably only ever get these small moments of hope and tension, but I still would love to see it work out between those two

	Okay [This](http://i.imgur.com/wRYe9sS.png) whole thing definitely feels ominous.

Im really hoping its nothing, but Im a bit nervous about the next episode. Super excited to see all of those robots fighting. Its as if theyve got their own army now.

Also, I was gonna add this to the main post, but Im thinking I should probably spoiler tag it, even though its only speculation, and it may be obvious, but with [this](http://i.imgur.com/DD27YPm.png): 
[Speculation](/s "Is that what was in the first scene of the first episode? It had the Team Gurren flag too, didnt it? So, maybe thats how they get to the moon. I may be overshooting it, but I feel like thats where this is heading.  I really wanna watch that scene again, but I also dont")
>> ARTICLE
Kamina's faith in Simon is one of the things I really like about him. I don't see a lot of people pointing it out but it's really amazing.
At this point, no one but Kamina believes that Simon's drill can pierce the heavens.
>> ARTICLE
> These subs  are incredible.

I'm so happy that line remained intact in the dub. I don't want more of a reason for people to tell me I'm dumb for watching it.
>> ARTICLE
I think the subs in the BD release are just a transcript of the dub. So it's no coincidence they're the same. Unfortunately this means the subtitles are an absolute shitshow and do not really correspond to what is being said.

Actually, I've watched episode one both subbed and dubbed, and the subs are noticeably different at points.

Hey, everyone! For anybody wondering why Im the one posting this, in a reverse of the past two days, /u/angel10701 is the one without Internet access at the moment, so he asked me to post this instead. So, here it is. Now, on to my own episode reaction.
***

Episode 7

* Man, Im tired. Being an adult sucks.

* Oh, dont be so dramatic, Viral. Its only been four episodes since we last saw you.

* [Viral is such a master of comedic timing.](http://webm.land/media/vTLC.webm)

* So from what I gather from all this Capital talk, Team Gurren accidentally broke through the surface into the current Hunger Games arena and Viral is the Head Gamemaker trying to get them to leave.

* The Spiral King is nothing. You should hear how obnoxious the Spiral Queen can get.

* Thats not a mountain Its a space Eh, forget it. I already made the Star Wars joke in a previous episode.

* Viral seems really hung up on getting his helmet back. Maybe his mom gave it to him as a birthday present.

* [See!](http://i.imgur.com/ISTtBcf.jpg) Thats the kind of sized gunman I was hoping for when I started this series.

* If it were just Kamina piloting that gunman, he could kick the other ones ass no problem. But of course hes gotta have Simon with him, bringing them both down.

* Kamina refers to Viral as cannon fodder. Hilarious.

* [Even in an animated show, they didnt have the budget to show that fight on-screen.](http://webm.land/media/IqE3.webm)

* Aw, Yoko is worried about Kamina. Shes like, Fuck Simon, though.

* Never retreat, never surrender, never look back! Imagine if the aliens from Galaxy Quest had used *this* show to model their technology after.

* [How the hell do you even design something to do that?](http://webm.land/media/UGHI.webm)

* [Okay, thats fucking funny.](http://webm.land/media/gAVv.webm)

* Why does Viral always sound like hes on the verge of orgasm? Not that Im complaining.

* Come on, Viral. This is like rule three in the main-antagonist manual: Dont gloat until you are 100% sure the other party is dead. (Side note: Never say Theres no way they could have survived that, after seeing someone fall from a great height, especially if you didnt see them hit the ground. You basically just confirmed that theyre alive.)

* [I love how that kick was so epic, it actually made the animation style extra-detailed and hand drawn for a few seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/WLwNpQB.jpg)

* Did Kamina get killed? Come on girl, this is an anime, not Disney. They wont kill the comic relief character until like two-thirds of the way through the series.

* [Whoa! When did old Simon get there?](http://i.imgur.com/qRMV3v4.jpg)

* Hey, [Narutos back.](http://i.imgur.com/JaifxJE.jpg)

* [The fact that the horseshoe part of the helmet isnt symmetrical has always really bugged me.](http://i.imgur.com/2VNkZGq.jpg)

* [Either that hands moving really fast, or theyre just breaking sorts of laws of physics.](http://webm.land/media/XIqD.webm)

* Thats Kittan, ya jerk! Did you forget all about me already?! Well, unlike your sisters, you lack amazing cleavage.

* [See? Even the beastmen cant look away from em.](http://i.imgur.com/OZeqlCL.jpg)

* Oh, I see Viral finally woke back up.

* Man, Yoko really wants Kaminas nuts. Just tell him, girl.

* [Kaminas face actually blocks the fourth wall bar.](http://i.imgur.com/VLvbS69.jpg)

* Kamina really has a death wish, doesnt he? Hasnt he ever heard of a tactical retreat?

* I choose to believe Simon got his inspiration for that trap from watching Tremors.

* Viral really likes to draw out his Ill be back! speeches.

* Im less surprised that Simons chief took in the other villages women and children, and more that Simons old village was even still populated after that gunman fight.

* [Rossiu is this shows Azusa with all the head-thwacks of Ritsu.](http://webm.land/media/G4RQ.webm)

* They guy voicing Kidd's doing his best Greg Ayres impression.

* Its kind of an oxymoron to call something a hunk of junk, then rave about how its gonna be your headquarters.

* So, thats Laganns ability. Whatever it combines with, it automatically becomes the power-holder over.

* [Oh, hes paying attention, alright.](http://webm.land/media/QHPC.webm)

* Who the hell do I think you are, Kamina? Someone with badass glasses.

* Just go back to when I said Team Gurren and add a Dai to the front of the second word.

* [Kamina:](http://i.imgur.com/NBz1Kh7.jpg) So are we gonna do it right here, or

* Yoko: Hey, flames are coming from that mountain. Hm A phenomenon like that should have a special name. How about a Lelouchtic?

* Kamina: What the hell kind of name is that?

* Yoko: I just really wanted to make a Code Geass reference

* The dialogue in the preview and the [lack of exclamation point in the next episodes title](http://i.imgur.com/olBtFix.jpg) kind of has me worried that some shits gonna go down next episode.

Until tomorrow, everyone. Oh, and I hope you have a good Memorial Day weekend, my fellow Free-mericans.

>> ARTICLE
>/u/angel10701 is the one without Internet access

The horror.

>* Kamina refers to Viral as cannon fodder. Hilarious.

Is it funny because it's a funny name to call him, or because it's true?

>* Thats Kittan, ya jerk! Did you forget all about me already?! Well, unlike your sisters, you lack amazing cleavage.

Even so, he forgot the sisters too. His head is so full of all thosr amazing one-liners that he has no room to remember people

>* Kamina really has a death wish, doesnt he? Hasnt he ever heard of a tactical retreat?

Are we watching the same anime??
>> ARTICLE
> Either that hands moving really fast, or theyre just breaking sorts of laws of physics.

Gurren Lagann gives precisely 0 fucks for the laws of physics. Gurren Lagann beats the laws of physics up after school. Gurren Lagann makes the laws of physics do its homework and then tosses the homework away just to make the laws of physics have to do it again.

Somewhere around episode 15 the laws of physics finally succumb to their trauma-induced depression and hang themself from a ceiling fan.

Didn't expect Viral to come back so soon!

Jump right into the action with this episoe!

I like how they got allies but would be nice to get some that would actually do something lol

Everyone screaming for Kamina...poor Simon

Fighting spirit really does seem to fix everything

Ouu new powerful ally?? Oh nice glad to see them back and with power this time :p looks like I got what I wanted haha

Nice Simon stepping up :D

Got a little army going...not a meh fan but those are pretty ugly lol

Yoko x Kamina moment...interrupted :(

Simon gaining some fans!

Wow this episode went by fast, really getting into things now!

I love that best girl = Leeron.

Listen if someone better shows up his rank will be stripped but for now he is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
After three episodes in which we alternately built up the supporting cast and had wacky shenanigans, it's time to get to plot! Viral's back, and we have our first sniff of a Big Bad! That's a very large gunmen...

On the plus side, Kamina and Simon are no longer alone! They've got a team now.

Side note: It's hilarious how different the official romanizations of the newcomers' names are from what we used back when the show first aired with the fansubs. The only ones that are the same are Jougan/Jougun, Kid and Makken. Zorthy was Zoushi, Iraak was like Ailac or Eylak or anything like that, and Balinbow was Barinbou.

Tomorrow we have our first boss battle! Go, Team Dai-Gurren! Fight on! 

[Major Spoilers for later in the series, first time watchers beware](/s "I lied about the 'later in the series' bit to throw them off the trail. Are we really doing Kamina's death on Memorial Day? That's hilarious.")

So after tomorrow we go to 2 episodes a day, that gives me the feeling that something's going to happen tomorrow and I'm not sure I'll like it, but I suppose I'll find out. Not matter what happens I'm really enjoying this series so far :)
>> ARTICLE
It's the end of the first major arc and we have to move to two episodes a day SOMEWHERE. I wouldn't read too much into it :)
>> ARTICLE
Ok that's reassured me a bit, I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Nice save. That'll really make them surprised.")
>> ARTICLE
Is everyone ready to grit their teeth tomorrow?
>> ARTICLE
I really liked this episode because it gave Simon a chance to shine and be awesome at doing his thing.

And hello, walking phallic symbol.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah was great to Simon be to cool guy supreme for once haha hoping for more moments like that!

Soo who else is ready for some Viral? I sure am.

Maybe to your surprise:

First: Kamina and Simon (can't decide between these too, although Simon a bit over Kamina) Second: Viral, Third: Kittan

Hello friends and not friends. Episode 7 is wierd episode in my opinion, mostly because it's not that memorable because it's kind of like a "calm before the storm" episode. Welcome to "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

- Today's "Song of the Episode" is ["Is it Okay to Burn with Passion"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO3SUBwPQmA&), you've probably already heard this and you'll probably hear it again throughout the series during fights.

Today's fact is about one of the new members of Team Dai-Gurren, [Makken](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/157/a/1/makken_jokin_and_mo_shogun_by_shinsoulthief-d3i6yo5.png).

- "Sneaky Kamina": Makken's voice actor is credited as "Reo Kaminaga". Reo Kaminaga, when rearranged, is "Ore ga Kamina," meaning "I am Kamina" in Japanese; Makken's VA is Kamina's VA too.

That's all for today, see you guys tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

Question: We probably won't be watching the compliation movies, right? Because Lagann-hen (the second movie) has a *great* callback to a moment in this episode that I'd like to reference when we get to the equivalent part of this series, so I want to know if that's kosher.

>> ARTICLE
Okay, lets do this.

* Leerons face answers [this question](http://i.imgur.com/EHuEuIk.png) better than I could
* I was just thinking what this kids purpose would be. The children are adorable and silly, but this guy actually needs something going for him. Smart to make this kid the [level-headed foil](http://i.imgur.com/PnDQqB4.png), to their [idiocy](http://i.imgur.com/6PDZlIo.png). Necessary. Its a bit of shame that there are [more of them](http://i.imgur.com/TJzrBmx.png), though
* [Simon](http://i.imgur.com/0lJnDzA.png), you precious child!! 
* So I was okay with Simon twirling through the boob tunnel. Not sure how I feel about [this boob conveyor belt](http://i.imgur.com/tJCIL8Y.png). His face is great, though
* Yoko, [your jealousy is showing.](http://i.imgur.com/MYplCcM.png) It really cant be helped, though. You only have one set of breasts, while these girls have several combined sets. And if animes taught me anything, its that the more boobs there are, the better
* [Aw](http://i.imgur.com/bfzi05L.png), I feel bad for him. This kids gonna have so much more suffering to deal with now that hes the comic relief character
* Hah! [She wishes!](http://i.imgur.com/enG8AsF.png)
* [Had some things to take care of.](http://i.imgur.com/00VfjRL.png) My mental imagery is completely dependent on whether they mean outside or inside the hotel
* There is literally *so much* going on in [this one frame](http://i.imgur.com/aPUQg05.png) that I dont know where to begin
* What did the cockroach-rat ever do to deserve [this](http://i.imgur.com/AKm0iro.png)??
* Yeah, [you did](http://i.imgur.com/hYTiRJQ.png). But I mean, you only managed to do it cause Yoko was fighting a robot and they accidently fell through the ceiling of your underground cave. I dont have the creative capacity to imagine what has to happen to get you guys to the moon. But you know what? Im not even ruling it out. Sure, go to the moon. Why the fuck not?
* Its not an onsen episode, without girls [squealing](http://i.imgur.com/ZoKLEUT.png) and [touching each other](http://i.imgur.com/25cmtkE.png) next door to the boys. This is such a common occurrence in anime and manga that I honestly want to know if Japanese girls do this to each other
* [Simon!](http://i.imgur.com/EdGkwZC.png) If you didnt do this, then this would not be a *true* onsen episode! Have some respect for your culture, boy!!!
* [This is just sad.](http://i.imgur.com/RUfvVTt.png)
* 
* I cant. I just cant. If I put a link to the screencap, Im genuinely worried that Im gonna have cops at my door telling me they got a tip saying that Ive got child porn on my laptop. This episode crosses so many moral boundaries for me. Im disgusted in this anime for showing this; Im disgusted in all of you for having so much love for this anime; and Im disgusted in myself for not being able to stop laughing.
* IT GOT WORSE IT ACTUALLY GOT WORSE! How do I erase all the evidence of this episode on my laptop??
* IT GOT WORSE AGAIN!!! OH MY GOSH IT GOT WAYYYY WORSE. If this were in any other context, it wouldnt be too bad, but the insinuations are so *real*. Fuck man, just getting rid of the evidence of me watching this episode isnt gonna cut it. Im gonna have to burn my laptop
* [WHAT ABOUT HIS DRILL????](http://i.imgur.com/3MaS5hp.png) No, please, [I cant take it](http://i.imgur.com/P7ZZUgc.png). I cant breathe!
* The cockroach-rat [looks so comfortable](http://i.imgur.com/kntaIAw.png). He aint even mad. Im a little mad, though^Move,cockroach-rat
* Theres too much to comment on. Im just so exhausted now. I wanna go to sleep. I want this to be over
* Again. Why with the young child? Who wrote this?? Who okay-ed it? I dont even have the strength to caps anymore. I cant believe how this episode has turned out
* [Yeah, I get it](http://i.imgur.com/4B2juaQ.png). It looked like he was doing something else.
* [Cold blooded!](http://i.imgur.com/aBpseLq.png)
* Awwww, sweetie, I still love you! Naw, guys hes [crying](http://i.imgur.com/6CPlhkP.png) :(
* Ahahah its like hes [completely at peace now](http://i.imgur.com/i1q8ZlW.png). This is why I love him. So much heart and innocence. I want to adopt him!!! Someone give him to me!
* I know where [this](http://i.imgur.com/NrQyCwF.png) is [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KDnKjZPb68).
* [ENOUGH!](http://i.imgur.com/MLnncyH.png) Youve played out the joke; I have nothing more to add!! No, wait a second. I do have something to add. I love how Kamina uses the tiny cockroach-rat, but Simons got this excessively large drill. Clever
* Ahahah, [oh man](http://i.imgur.com/PxLdNnK.png), so close. [Theyre screwed.](http://i.imgur.com/jV2WAoJ.png)
* [YOURE KILLING ME](http://i.imgur.com/i22pJlg.png). And theres like a three second pause. Oh, goodness that was amazing
* So can Beastmen take on a human form, or is it just these guys?
* Did she [honestly expect](http://i.imgur.com/VIVdl0T.png) him *not* to fall for it???
* [Well said.](http://i.imgur.com/s0e1CDd.png)
* Come on, Kamina, [FOCUS](http://i.imgur.com/uil21Hs.png)!
* [YESSSSSSSS](http://i.imgur.com/2mhuFuk.png)
* Sweet. [Stylish AND practical](http://i.imgur.com/ogrb0dL.png)
* You know, after all that, Im kind of [happy for them](http://i.imgur.com/rWrCYVk.png)
* [Yoooooo](http://i.imgur.com/EJ6Oc3I.png), hows it going, kid? Glad I get to see you again

I hope you animals are all happy. I hope you got some fucking laughs out of these posts cause Im not gonna be able to do these any more from prison. Or hell. My family would be so disappointed in me if they knew what I was doing. *Im* disappointed in me. Fuck, Japan. I knew what you were capable of, but I didnt imagine that that would be woven into something this mainstream.

In all seriousness though, that was a super entertaining episode.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was never comfortable with this episode either but you'll enjoy the rest of the anime
>> ARTICLE
> Its not an onsen episode, without girls squealing and touching each other next door to the boys. This is such a common occurrence in anime and manga that I honestly want to know if Japanese girls do this to each other

No idea whether the trope has much basis, but there's a very amusing subversion of it in the B Gata H Kei anime.

> You know, after all that, Im kind of happy for them

They're an endearing pair.
>> ARTICLE
> They're an endearing pair

Pair of *what?*
>> ARTICLE
Hah, I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. The setup from that line + screenshot was too good :P
>> ARTICLE
> In all seriousness though, that was a super entertaining episode.

It was worth it just for [this face.](http://i.imgur.com/Guy1sjk.png)

[And of course this.](http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg148/Freakachris/Animations/KaminaButtSlapmedium.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice Lagann's face!!!
>> ARTICLE
At least that's the last of the odd episodes. Probably. Maybe. I think so. Any ways,
> Sure, go to the moon. Why the fuck not?

Don't underestimate them.
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely not. Actually, I'm gonna be disappointed if they *don't* go to the moon
>> ARTICLE
On the subject of Gimmy the red haired child and the hot spring:
In Japan, this is morally okay because he's considered too young to be sexualized in any way. 

Glad you enjoyed the episode overall tho!  Your love for the series should only increase from here on out!
>> ARTICLE
Poor Yoko haha tha smell's got to be brutal

That wink to Simon...why must you tease him Yoko

Onsen episode? Hopefully it's not too...nvm

Jealous Yoko is adorable though

Cover up Kamina lol poor Boota and poor Simon, ouch

From pyhsical pain to emotional blows :(

So much nudity...

Kamina...come on...

Yoko blurting out her true feelings :p

Well this was probably the worst episode so far...if I wasn't in a watch thread would probably put it on the side for a bit.

Should have realized this is what people meant by funniest or "one of the best" in the last thread




>> ARTICLE
It's just the stereotypical onsen episode that you have to sit through in most anime. At least TTGL's stereotypical beach episode is better.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but the comments from the last thread had me hoping for something else haha
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think you too will end up looking back fondly on this episode by the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
We'll see about that!
>> ARTICLE
> That wink to Simon...why must you tease him Yoko

Yeah, poor kid. Doesn't stand a chance...
>> ARTICLE
Hope he finds a girl in this serious, would be so adorable!!
>> ARTICLE
He deserves to
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't have agreed with people saying it's "one of the best" either, although it does have a few funny parts.

That said, this series isn't really one where I think of individual episodes as stand-outs. While there some very memorable moments, I think it's more the journey as whole that makes it special.
>> ARTICLE
It had funny parts but that was a pretty hard episode to watch for me personally. Looking forward to seeing the story as whole then!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I guess we can say a little bit about romance given the episode though! Yoko's dismissive attitude about Simon is a bit harsh and unfair, but very teenaged. Both her and Simon have quite typical infatuations for their age.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah felt really bad for Simon but I can understand where Yoko is coming from, it was nice she did kind of compliment him though!
>> ARTICLE
That's true, she's still definitely a nice person, after all.
>> ARTICLE
Oh come on Amethyst, how can you [not love this?](http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg148/Freakachris/Animations/KaminaButtSlapmedium.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I did laugh at that bit :p
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else see Asuka and Rei from NGE in this episode?
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and they're not the only ones making a cameo in this episode. The blonde one with that strange thing on her forehead is Lal'C and the pink haired one is Nono, both from Diebuster. Also if I remember correctly the redhead near Asuka in one of the scene is Freud from Gunbuster. In fact half of those girls come from Gainax previous works.

edit: grammar

Sorry about the delay, had some important stuff that just came up. Here is /u/The-Sublimer-One comment of the day.
***
Episode 6

* I hate my job.

* Bath time!

* [Judging from the title](http://i.imgur.com/cERhkrx.png), I believe I got the uncensored version. And I feel Im going to be agreeing with this title very soon.

* [Thats nothing.](http://webm.land/media/3ToZ.webm) You should hear about the time Matthew Broderick lost Godzilla on Manhattan Island. Now that was just silly.

* [Kamina:](http://i.imgur.com/k3WKsNQ.jpg) Yoko, what did I say about making weird, little noises?

* [Hes so manly that hes able to spit *through* his gunman.](http://i.imgur.com/zzIOttX.jpg)

* [Ive never really noticed until now how freaking powerful that gun of hers is.](http://webm.land/media/uKEV.webm)

* [Wow](http://webm.land/media/bsG4.webm) You You guys are idiots.

* Are fogs really that common in the middle of the desert? Eh, maybe its a plot-aware fog.

* [Hey!]( http://i.imgur.com/a5uoiOD.jpg) Its [Old Geezer](http://i.imgur.com/o2ki6dY.jpg)! (On a related note, while searching for that I found this: http://i.imgur.com/2cPbFUY.jpg)

* [Goggles.](http://i.imgur.com/3TDKZEn.jpg) Future Simon. Calling it now.

* [HOLY SHIT!](http://webm.land/media/spiI.webm) This *is* a Gainax series!

* This is gonna turn out to be like the Island of the Lotus Eaters, isnt it? You get such amazingly good treatment that you never want to leave, thus distracting you from your true quest? Eh, [Im okay with it.](http://i.imgur.com/kJuPJgc.jpg)

* Its gonna be hilariously awesome if even Yoko and Rossiu get sucked into this place, and Leeron has to bail all their asses out.

* [Oh. I get it.](http://webm.land/media/cKNI.webm) Rossiu with the sick puns.

* [Hey, guys!]( http://i.imgur.com/6V0Zpj2.jpg) Look where we got hired! We tried to get jobs at [Boobies](http://i.imgur.com/10t1mZw.jpg), but they told us that we were too fanservicy.

* [Come on, Yoko.](http://webm.land/media/RH6Z.webm) Just wo-man up and tell him how you feel. Hell respect you making the first move.

* All [this](http://i.imgur.com/hF7FSG1.jpg) is missing [is](https://youtu.be/J3ats4Ld61s?t=18s)

* How the fuck did I get lost watching Shakira music videos? Anyway

* The hot-spring owner sounds and looks like that insane environmentalist lady from Cowboy Bebop. Would explain why all her staff have mutated into bunnies.

* [Kamina:](http://i.imgur.com/thwQHSp.jpg) When I was told this thing was gonna be filled with hot bods, I didnt take it to be so literal.

* [Okay, no doubt, that guy is totally old Simon.](http://i.imgur.com/2g8Nk5I.jpg)

* [I fucking love this interim card.](http://i.imgur.com/DprAUqN.jpg)

* [Sometimes when Kamina drinks, he likes to pretend Simon is a girl masquerading as a boy and re-enact scenes from Mulan.](http://i.imgur.com/TcXU5id.jpg) (Hey, at least this time hes not re-enacting Boku no Pico.)

* [Im just gonna play this whole thing, so you guys watching the sub can enjoy the fanservice in *both* languages.](http://webm.land/media/ywaW.webm)

* Oh, I just noticed that [Bootas tail grew back.](http://i.imgur.com/3WhoLP5.jpg)

* [Its like that thing artsy hentai do.](http://i.imgur.com/TgcbHA4.png) But nowhere near as funny as when they do it.

* [Simon:](http://webm.land/media/GaAK.webm) Thank God Im bound by anime physics.

* [I should *not* be watching this episode with my parents right behind me.](http://i.imgur.com/OMqLYZg.jpg)

* It took them this long to think of using Simons drill?

* [In this shot,](http://i.imgur.com/z3EzzsW.jpg) I cant tell if Kaminas talking about the moon or just moons in general.

* Why is there just a [random, not-quite-tall enough tree](http://i.imgur.com/0kIqjTi.jpg) right next to the wall? Is it just there to taunt desperate men?

* [Kamina:](http://webm.land/media/dqF8.webm) This is why bros before hoes, bro. However, I did hear the blonde one say she wanted me, so in this case Ill make an exception.

* Simon: Im finally gonna turn my life around and become a strong, dependable man. Not for me, but for boobs. Because they are the dreams that all living things aspire for.

* I think Rossiu just really likes talking about fish.

* Did Kamina just get cockblocked by a gunmen?

* [I have no words](http://webm.land/media/feqj.webm)

* [Dat euphemism, doh.](http://i.imgur.com/hAN2uKe.jpg)

* [That is the most brilliant way to get a person to surrender Ive ever seen.](http://webm.land/media/9na2.webm) It reminds me a bit of [this tactic.](https://youtu.be/NUaqUTP2L4k?t=1m32s)

* [Poor Kamina doesnt know that hes technically in Japan, where even the porn porn isnt really porn anymore.](http://i.imgur.com/leGfkKq.jpg) Even though for some reason little-boy penis is A-Okay. Seriously, Japan, fix your fucking censorship laws.

* [Theyre so quick to forgive him after he just risked their lives to see them naked.](http://webm.land/media/9bpn.webm) Only Yoko is tsundere enough to not cheer. That just proves she loves him the most.

* [*Now* youre speaking my language.](http://i.imgur.com/PC5tgkT.jpg)

* [Yoko is actually kind of flattered that Kamina was willing to give up just to perv out on some hot girls.](http://i.imgur.com/XW6ajkD.jpg)

* And she says that all he had to do was ask to see them. Is Kamina secretly Akihisa from Baka and Test?

* Why *is* Boota just clung to Kaminas crotch this whole time, anyway?

* [I love how shes just lightly tapping on his head.](http://webm.land/media/m87H.webm)

* Spiral King? Okay, Im guessing thats the big bad of the series. And I still cant get over how Gimmy just has it all out, and *no one* in the Japanese Censorship Board gives a crap. (Seriously, try getting your hands on an uncensored hentai made in the last five years. Its impossible.)

* [Im amazed the poor guy didnt just die of disappointment there.](http://i.imgur.com/wyJt4kI.jpg) Also, old Simon just hanging out on his back.

* [From what Ive gathered from this show, the perfect pilot for a gunman is just an insane person who is 100% confident anything they do with it will work.](http://webm.land/media/py34.webm) So Kamina, basically.

* [For once Kaminas the one doing the near-impaling.](http://webm.land/media/qpfi.webm) And in his Sunday best, too.

* [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/GYLAegM.jpg) combined with the entirety of Kill la Kill has convinced me that the guys behind this shit just do not know that women have nipples, same as men.

* [Dude, Viral just made your dreams come true.](http://webm.land/media/7BgZ.webm)

* By the way, Virals back.

Heres hoping I can start assuredly posting these myself soon.

Oh, well. Thanks anyway. I should be able to post my own comment tomorrow.

This isn't uncommon at all. Take first season Dragon Ball. young Goku is naked so very often and nobody gives a shit.

I've been waiting for this, it's been waaaay too long since I've seen the bathhouse episode.

- To kick off "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts" I chose *the* most fitting song for this episode, aptly named ["Peeping Tom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icNLQDMqHkI). There is literally no other choice besides this one.

I've only got one fact today but it's a nice easter egg.

- "Hey, those girls look familiar": You may or may not recognize them but those [bunny girls](http://pds5.egloos.com/pds/200707/15/61/c0020161_04073071.jpg) are actually all Gainax characters. From left to right, [Rei](http://myanimelist.net/character/86/Rei_Ayanami), [Mahoro](http://myanimelist.net/character/1314/Mahoro_Ando), [Nono](http://myanimelist.net/character/2058/Nono), [Asuka](http://myanimelist.net/character/94/Asuka_Langley_Soryu), and [Lal'c](http://myanimelist.net/character/3887/LalC_Melk_Mark).

Naturally it goes without saying that you need to watch this episode without censors; Kamina would agree. A very fun and memorable episode indeed. See you all tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

It's been a while since I watched it, but I'm pretty sure this episode was the most fan-service-y by far. I don't recall the beach episode being too bad. I think it was just usual beach episode shenanigans.

Kamina was killing it this episode

Funny episode. Literally nothing happens to advance the plot aside from the Black Siblings' trio showing up (I wonder where Kittan could've gotten off to) and Viral reappearing at the end. 

But it's fucking funny sooooooooo we don't care.
>> ARTICLE
This episode is hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda maybe was going to participate in this rewatch but ended up watching way ahead (woops).

Just a quick warning to anyone watching on Netflix: Avoid reading the episode previews if you can. That is all.
>> ARTICLE
Heavily veiled spoilers, maybe?

Wow, perfect timing - I just finished Netflix binging TTGL yesterday, and there's a group rewatch going on!

I can't believe how much better the uncensored version is. Not for the "plot", personally, since there are other shows that do it better. No, this episode is the foundation for the romance of the entire rest of the series. Everything makes sense to me now. Anyone following on Netflix/Crunchyroll, if you want to understand why that story goes where it does, FIND THE UNCENSORED VERSION AND WATCH IT.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, I'm not following you. 

[SERIOUS MAJOR SPOILERS FIRST TIMERS DO NOT HOVER](/s "Since you know who only has two more episodes with us, and Simon doesn't end up with Yoko, what does this have to do with his romance with Nia?")
>> ARTICLE
[Full series spoilers](/s "Because of the hinting in some of the earlier episodes, including this one, a part of me always thought that Simon X Yoko might happen. The scene in this episode where Simon peeks through the wall is a great character building moment for Yoko. It helped me understand her attraction to Kamina, and later to Kittan, and why she never goes for Simon.")

Edit: Spoilers fixed.

Viral is too awesome to let his own theme song finish before getting some nice end-of-episode banter in.

That Kamina rage is so epic, I crack up every time I see it

There was a warning that todays episode is directed by someone else and so the animation is different. This worries me


* The cockroach-rat has a [name](http://i.imgur.com/lXmARxS.png)
* Sorry, did he just [throw a boulder at Simon](http://i.imgur.com/dC8AuM7.png)? Is this some sort of extreme rough play between siblings?
* Oh shit, the cockroach-rat is mad. [Fear its tiny rage!!!](http://i.imgur.com/n9rgBKW.png)
* [Can you not?](http://i.imgur.com/ylEoLw6.png)
* [His hand slipped.](http://i.imgur.com/2mzeZIM.png) Is the rest of the series just gonna be episodic adventures where each episode Kaminas stupidity almost gets them all killed?
* [What is going on???](http://i.imgur.com/695g2oW.png) This is the most dangerous coercion Ive ever seen. This isnt even him training Simon. Hes literally just throwing rocks at him until he submits and agrees to combine with him
* [You were in your Lagann a minute ago](http://i.imgur.com/TbQr70j.png), werent you? Why did you get out?? Did your hands start cramping up or something?? Why did you think getting out and running would be better!?? Get the fuck back in the robot, you moron
* One pair of [giant boobs](http://i.imgur.com/sPSXxHp.png) is more than enough for this anime.
* [Aww](http://i.imgur.com/mEIEhH9.png) look at how uncomfortable and shy he is!! Silly Simon, never display this kind of weakness in front of older woman. They can smell it on you
* Please dont ask for him to [pay with his body](http://i.imgur.com/JVJkxOo.png)

* Ahahahah [the disappointment!](http://i.imgur.com/TfuXmob.png) He just lost the attention of some pretty girls to his older, seemingly cooler brother. That must be such a shit feeling. [Hahah](http://i.imgur.com/Px9CE5J.png), killing me
* These poor girls Theyre so deficient of men that theyre gushing over a guy who was throwing rocks at a kid earlier
* You will definitely die if you eat [that.](http://i.imgur.com/Eyqc7i5.png) No, [it really doesnt.](http://i.imgur.com/GyFkl4T.png) You will absolutely die if you eat it.

* Simon, no, [do not eat that.](http://i.imgur.com/OpR7VCQ.png) Its not food. Even the girls are unamused by it now. Did you do this to be *funny*??? Dont you think youve taken this joke a little too far?
* HAHAH Simon just owns up to biting the cotton ball immediately. Bless this boy
* [Whats going on?](http://i.imgur.com/f0txeFw.png) Im completely lost
* He totally just [said Team Gurren](http://i.imgur.com/xs1ZfT8.png) cause the other guy used his own team name, right? He just wanted to show off that hes got a team name too
* [All](http://i.imgur.com/T3dWbNn.png). [of](http://i.imgur.com/iC4qHrx.png). [this](http://i.imgur.com/A9vWy78.png). Top notch
* [FUCK YOU AND YOUR TRAINING!](http://i.imgur.com/kNlX1YH.png) Stop whacking him!! WHY WONT YOU LET HIM LOVE YOU, KAMINA!?!!
* Whoa. The scene with Simon inside Lagann, the way he moved the levers was nicely done. Pulling back, turning, and pushing the levers forward. Its like I could actually see and feel the weight behind his movements. I liked it
* No, [stop with that face](http://i.imgur.com/Itz7CKJ.png). Seriously. Stop trying to act cool, you nearly died. Again 
* Where the hell did the [helmet](http://i.imgur.com/kwbMoGu.png) just come from??
* Simon saying [this](http://i.imgur.com/6yG0Wq3.png) with Kamina is too funny. Its super cute, also
* [This](http://i.imgur.com/zBum70V.png) kind of makes me mad! But I kind of agree!! And that makes me even madder!! Dammit

* [This is it.](http://i.imgur.com/dwRLg8T.png) This is the entire show.
* [DRILLS!](http://i.imgur.com/2s2UOfV.png)


Okay, so yeah the animation was off. It wasnt *that* bad, but Im glad its gonna go back to normal for episode 5. As for the episode itself, it was my least favourite one so far. But it could have something to do with the fact that its 3am right now. Sorry if most of that didnt make sense. Im so sleepy. Let me know if I missed anything important

>> ARTICLE
It wasn't the best episode, but those new characters needed to be introduced somehow. It gets a lot better from here.
>> ARTICLE
Your comments make me want to rematch this show for the fourth time...
>> ARTICLE
Do it.
>> ARTICLE
Should I do it with the rewatch or marathon it? Actually I'll marathon and just keep commenting on your posts

>> ARTICLE
It's the least favorite episode for a lot of people. There are a few points now and then that i personally didn't like that much, but trust me, it's worth pulling through.

And even at it's weakest, TTGL is still enjoyable.

My brain is forming images I don't want.

Lol. NGE references.

> Theyre all shit

Them's fightin' words.

> Where the hell did the helmet just come from??

1. Don't question shit in this show.

2. I think it was attached to the front of the Gurren before.

I love reading your reactions the most. They're so confused and bipolar and spastic; it perfectly fits the tone of this show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this anime is like a rollercoaster of emotions

> Them's fightin' words.

I don't want to fight, but you boys and your fucking waifu wars, I swear...
>> ARTICLE
What's your opinion on shipping wars?
>> ARTICLE
Incredibly unpopular.

Nah, I don't really have an interest in shipping so I sometimes roll my eyes at the whole shipping war thing. I don't watch harems though, so I suppose I haven't really allowed myself to get involved in it.

I do, however, absolutely love anime with a primarily male cast, but likewise, the shipping wars for those anime pissed me off too. I actually lurked frequently on tumblr, but the shipping wars over there kind of forced me to come here to lurk.

You have no idea how disappointed I was when I realised that the anime side of a site that is dominated by males, is just as bad as one dominated by females.

But yeah, it doesn't bother me that much, sometimes it's actually really funny, but I just like to complain and poke fun

Seriously, though, Yoko best girl.

> Try watching Space Dandy.

What do you mean by that?
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is known for having a bunch of different directors and writers, due to the episodic nature of the show. As such, the animation style in some episodes can get [surreal.](http://i.imgur.com/339LeTc.png)
>> ARTICLE
I saw the first two episodes of space dandy, big fan of champloo and bebop, couldnt get into this one tho :(
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend you try watching to at least episode five. That's when the series really starts to find its footing and develops a nice balance of comedy and seriousness.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely gonna give it a shot then
>> ARTICLE
Yay!
>> ARTICLE
If you were watching the sub before, switch to the dub. Really better captures the characters' personalities, and you can focus on the whole screen and not just the subtitles.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the dub at first, it wasnt bad, i just always prefer subs over dubs, but ill try it
>> ARTICLE
That was the best thing about Space Dandy, though. No two episodes were alike, you never knew what you were gonna get. It was an experience like no other.
>> ARTICLE
Fun Fact that what was Gurren Lagann was supposed to be like. They stopped doing the guest director thing after the drama that surrounded this episode.

Totally.

> The **cockroach-rat** has a name

Aw poor Boota :(

He's a hamster, uh guinea pig, uh rodant thing. Ok I'm not really sure what he is, but he's adorable. 
>> ARTICLE
He's a baby pig-mole?
>> ARTICLE
Another day, another ep- OMG WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ANIMATION!?!?! Good afternoon (for me at least) fellow members of team Gurren! Episode 4 is definitely an odd one out of the bunch, everyone remembers it because of the poorer-than-expected animation quality.

 - The "Song of the Episode" for today is [Moero Sankyoudai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGx14rfg9kA), it's a pretty good song and it's basically the theme for the three sisters of the black siblings.

Today I have another 2 facts, both come from the manga so you don't have to consider it canon but it's still interesting.

 - Kittan's Grudge: In the manga, the Black Siblings show up a lot earlier than in the anime; before the end of episode 3. Before the battle against Viral, Kittan says that he and the black siblings have been hunting beast-men because a force led by Viral wiped out their village.

 - Lagann Gurren?: In the manga's equivalent of episode four, there was a scene where Kamina wanted to combine to form the ["Lagann Gurren"](http://imgur.com/HKsScwf).

Quick thing, in case any of you first timers don't know or haven't found out yet, the reason this episode looked like this was because they had a guest director for *just* this episode. See you guys tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".
>> ARTICLE
What is it with these guys and their fourth episodes having weird animation?
>> ARTICLE
If you're referring to Kill la Kill, I think they did that on purpose as a joke referencing Gurren Lagann
>> ARTICLE
I'd expect that from Trigger.
>> ARTICLE
I first watched this episode after coming home from a college party. As you can imagine, I was, to use the common parlance, "fucked up." I was so fucking confused.

**Congratulations, new viewers! You've made it through arguably the weirdest episode of the show.** 

Not only is the art style totally different (which does not get repeated from here on out), but the plot is... so weird. Throwing rocks as training? Defeated by hunger? Fighting a family of fuzzballs? Boota literally pulling off his tail so Simon and Kamina can eat it? It's weird. It's really fucking weird. 

However, it introduces one of my favorite characters. Kittan! He may seem like just a loudmouth douchebag right now, but he has one of the most satisfying character development arcs in the series. 

Incidentally, he's also the second 'K' in the 80s cop show AU webcomic "Double K." (Which is excellent, but unfinished, and I don't recommend checking it out just yet because of spoilers. Unless you've already finished the series, in which case why the fuck haven't you read a webcomic about Kittan and Kamina as awesome 80s buddy cops with Simon as the hapless rookie partner yet?)

We'll be slowly building our secondary cast over the next few episodes as the adventure arc continues.

Yeah, I don't really know what to say. It's a weird fucking episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I miss Double K, I wish it wasn't unfinished. It was really well made and the story was going places.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Simon, all the girls like Kamina more :/

All the animals look gross...backwards dogs? lol ok

Him calling Simon a dumbass and the hitting haha it's mean but still funny

"Would you just shut up and combine already" Yoko reading my mind haha

The bad guys even thinking it's cool :p

Boota with the big sacrifice :(

Could be because I'm still sick but I just couldn't get into this episode as much as the others so far :/



>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's just the sickness, this is arguably the worst episode in the entire series tbh
>> ARTICLE
That's good to know, looking forward to the next episode being back to the normal pace then!
>> ARTICLE
I finally finished Kill la Kill for the first time, and Im so fucking pumped. 13/10. Best show Ive ever seen. Lets do this shit.

Episode 4

* Starting with a narrator. Interesting turn.

* I dont think the power is that hidden at all. Its the Assimilator ability, also known as the You Lose It, Youve Lost It power.

* [Kaminas](http://i.imgur.com/e35Y8WC.jpg) gone 1990s.

* [Kamina just casually endangering the life of his little brother.](http://webm.land/media/Y9nA.webm) All in a days work.

* [Is Leeron Michael Jackson?](http://webm.land/media/zEgc.webm)

* [I love that hes mostly concerned that his probe got wrecked.](http://i.imgur.com/taG7hwq.jpg)

* [Cant believe I *just* now realized that Gurren and Lagann are split again.](http://i.imgur.com/iSqibOo.jpg)

* [The Sandpeople finally found an outfit that protected them from the elements and was much more comfortable.](http://i.imgur.com/AShLoNk.jpg)

* Is one of those Sandpeople voiced by Sarah Williams?

* *Checks MyAnimeList*

* Huh, guess not. Again, Im still coming off a Kill la Kill binge, so I have Nonons voice tattooed inside my head.

* [Simons starting to turn into a harem MC.](http://webm.land/media/g7G7.webm) 

* Lol. It turns off because hes hungry. Theres a metaphor here somewhere.

* [Naruto lost his headband.](http://i.imgur.com/Dppmxx1.jpg)

* I had to watch [this scene](http://webm.land/media/ah9g.webm) twice to figure out what Kamina said.

* [Simon just lost harem MC status to his big bro.](http://webm.land/media/XlNr.webm) Ouch.

* And weve got [Sawako]( http://i.imgur.com/JMt9V5M.jpg), [Mio](http://i.imgur.com/ak1GcaQ.jpg), and [Ritsu.](http://i.imgur.com/xtpZ9jX.jpg) (Seriously, though, both Kiyoh and Sawako are voiced by Karen Strassman.)

* [Lol. His only reaction to these two, new strangers is upset that he cant fight Kamina anymore.](http://webm.land/media/HpTd.webm)

* [Even the interim cards are alive in this show.](http://webm.land/media/EU8T.webm)

* Heh. The Black Sisters like a man with long eyelashes, it appears.

* [Is that the Cotton Candy Blob from Scooby-Doo?](http://i.imgur.com/3Aupwow.jpg)

* [Hey, look!](http://i.imgur.com/cY5A9QP.jpg) That [cloud](http://i.imgur.com/U3nNwQ2.jpg?1) kind of looks like [Nuis eyepatch!](http://i.imgur.com/C58GZm0.png)

* Something the lighting in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/cBDMYhS.jpg) made me at first think that they actually went and photographed a live-action pink, puff ball on a plate, and stuck it into the show.

* [DID THIS SHOW JUST MAKE A FUCKING LOONY TOONS REFERENCE?!](http://webm.land/media/DU5K.webm) What the fuck?

* Kamina: No, Simon! I didnt say for us to combine! I said for us to *combine*!

* Yo, dawg. We heard you like combining. So we combined some combined mechas, so you can combine while you combine.

* [Lol, Yokos eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/xPHNp5d.jpg)

* Well, Im glad Simon gets it now, cause Im still lost.

* [The people in this show are just as immune to explosions as the Honnouji Academy students.](http://webm.land/media/Jo83.webm) (Dat slight Kamina yell.)

* So, Kaminas lesson was the only way to combine is by landing on top of the other partys head. Manly.

* [Simon is gonna end up killing Kamina one of these days doing that.](http://i.imgur.com/nGEyW0C.jpg)

* [Does anyone seriously think theyre dead?](http://webm.land/media/cvDJ.webm) Do they think weve forgotten this is a Gainax show? (Also, Yoko's eyes again.)

* [So. Fucking. Metal.](http://webm.land/media/oVCu.webm)

* Aw I was hoping we would see them absorb even more gundams and grow even bigger.

* [Even the fucking show is pointing out how that was obviously a bait-and-switch.](http://webm.land/media/HVlS.webm) (And again I suck at editing.)

* Kittan: Hey, you! Amateur 1.1!

* Kamina: What the hell does that mean?

* Kittan: It means I just watch End of Evangelion and Im fucking confused.

* Is Kamina insinuating Boota should eat himself? Thats hardcore.

* More like I Dont Get It, Not One *Drill*bit!

You can all kill me now.
>> ARTICLE

Not sure how I feel about this.

I said in my episode three post that I know what they're called. I'm just so used to using that term for big, robot mechas.

Kittan may be my favorite character which is why I kinda like this episode even though it's silly and weird as hell.

My god. For such an insanely good show to have such a bad episode boggles my mind still to this day.

Yeah the animation was flat out terrible, but the content of the episode didn't help much.

Obligatory *sorry first time watchers*... tomorrow we'll all be back to the unique awesomeness of Gurren Lagann.

Well, after introducing Viral last week this episode's villain was a bit... underwhelming, but the introduction of a new group of freedom fighters more than makes up for it.

The fact that they tried to eat a beastman cracks me up, especially because they kept trying even after they knew the truth.

The real hero of this episode, is of course Boota. How many of us would be willing to tear off a piece of our butt, and feed it to a friend in a time of need?

#PSA: NEW VIEWERS

This especially goes for those of you who are taking screenshots or making webm files: In each of the next three episodes, there will be a point where insert songs begin to play. *You will know when this is happening*, I promise you. 

I urge you, the first time through, *do not stop to take screens* or videos or anything. Just watch the scenes until the music stops. Then go back if you want to cap stuff.

Trust me. The scenes in question are worth viewing in their whole, the first time around.

Episode 23

* [Oh, man. I forgot how much this must be hurting Coco.](http://i.imgur.com/zNQ3qP6.jpg) The guy practically has no purpose without Nia.

* [Changing up the text style, maybe for the last time?](http://i.imgur.com/hjc8p1j.png)

* [Simon:](http://a.pomf.se/jfcfpr.mp4) And if I hear one word about a Virmon slash-fic, all of you are getting shot into space.

* You know, Lordgenome was able to use Spiral Power to literally create life with the beastmen and even gave Viral an immortal body. Think maybe you guys could talk to him, and have him explain how he did that, so you can then give yourself immortal bodies while fighting the Anti-Spiral? You can change back later, but for now Im just saying it would be very helpful.

* [Kittan is so fucking cool.](http://a.pomf.se/xklsrf.mp4)

* Oh, hey. Anyone seen Rossiu? While Im hoping Simon is gonna give him a well-deserved punch before inevitably forgiving him, I know it probably wont happen. Still, I can dream.

* [Leeron:]( http://i.imgur.com/bHtvuwO.jpg) Whoops! These arent my computer-interface gloves. These are much more personal.

* Okay, I guess that explains why Lordgenome would just leave something so big that the Anti-Spirals could easily use it to destroy the planet just a few million meters away from us. It wasnt exactly his choice.

* [Wow.](http://a.pomf.se/emerlj.mp4) That really puts into perspective just how freaking big that thing really is.

* [Yoko dont give a fuck.](http://i.imgur.com/b1PtVUs.jpg)

* Spiral Power. That refers to the power of evolution present in us lifeforms possessing a double-helix genetic structure. Or in other words, checkmate Christians. Spiraltology One True Religion.

* Its a big coincidence that the driving force of evolution in the universe is Spiral Power, and the most distinguishing thing about a drill is its spiral shape. Maybe that means only drill-workers can truly master Spiral Power.

* Right. Because, as everyone knows, opening up a gateway to another universe is no harder than hitting something really hard. Simon did it just last episode.

* Leeron: Because they dont possess Spiral Power, they cannot have children like we can.

* Yoko: What?

* Leeron: Im saying theyre as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.

* [Love changes the universe.](http://i.imgur.com/93KuxNi.jpg) So, does that everyone with Spiral Power [Mati?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRfr8yOeOdo)

* [Im amazed Rossiu even remembers where this place is.](http://i.imgur.com/2eYPh81.jpg) He only saw the outside exit once.

* Kinon: Simon, its terrible! Rossiu left a message for me on the last page! He said that hes really in love with Guinble!

* Simon: Who? Is that the blue-haired guy with no characterization other than he likes to brown-nose Rossiu?

* Kinon: Maybe!

* I have to admit. I actually started chuckling along with them in [this scene.](http://a.pomf.se/jiorqx.mp4)

* [Whoa!](http://i.imgur.com/gMQNCFx.jpg) Who flipped Rossius serious switch?

* [For some reason I expected them to have laser guns.](http://i.imgur.com/k5BF5Wf.jpg)

* Kinon, I am grateful for your friendship. Ooooooooooooh. Thats a friendzone to the gut. Thats what she gets for being such nice ~~guy~~ girl.

* [Okay, I think Im over my Rossiu hate by now.](http://i.imgur.com/IksYkBi.jpg) I still say that him condemning Simon to death like that was a prick move, but at least he seems to have come to terms with it.

* [Aw, damn it.](http://a.pomf.se/ffuilr.mp4) Now I cant even be (that) mad about that, anymore. Ugh, fine. I still love Lelouch more, but I agree with Rossiu did have a good heart. Still say that comment about Kamina dying was a low-blow, though.

* [Oh, come on.](http://i.imgur.com/yY8Inm9.jpg) You literally *just* succeeded in making me like the guy, again, and you gotta pull that?

* I wonder whose idea it was to add that Row, Row! Fight the Powah! line to the interim cards.

* [I fucking love how neither of them are even questioning what just happened.](http://a.pomf.se/xletht.mp4) Theyre both as self-aware about what show theyre in as I am.

* [HOLY SHIT MY PREDICITION WAS RIGHT!](http://a.pomf.se/wsqedy.mp4) AND IT WAS RIGHT IN THE BEST FUCKING CALLBACK EVER!

* Everybody makes mistakes. I hate myself for having the next line of that Hannah Montana song pop into my head immediately upon hearing this.

* [Im actually completely okay with this.](http://i.imgur.com/ten87Pp.jpg) It says something about this shows writing when they can get me to like a character, then absolutely loathe them, then like them again all in the course of a few episodes while still staying realistic. (Did I just use the word realistic to describe this show?)

* Kinon: Rossiu! Finally I can tell you to your face how I really feel Im gay. Its an anime; one of the girls sort of has to be.

* Anyone else notice that [Rossiu](http://i.imgur.com/0ER3NYo.jpg) has [Steins;Gate eyes?](http://i.imgur.com/ykJiGZT.jpg)

* [FUCKING AGAIN WITH THIS GREAT GATSBY SHIT!](http://i.imgur.com/rEeJ7rN.png) ITS LIKE THE JAPANESE HAVE JUST A BIG A BONER FOR FITZGERALD AS THEY DO FOR ADMERIAL PERRY!

* [Shia LaBeouf:](http://a.pomf.se/fgluks.mp4) So, youre saying they hide in the space between spaces?

* Viral: This isnt like you people. Explain? Do you know what fucking show youre in? Leave the explaining up to the weebs who will actually bother to watch this. Lets just blow some shit up.

* [Fucking Viral.](http://a.pomf.se/fkifed.mp4)

* Yoko: Weve found the enemys stronghold, so lets go smash it up. Thats how weve always fought our battles in the past.

* Simon: But wasnt that technically only one battle?

* Yoko: Potato, tomahto.

* [Rossiu looks high here.](http://i.imgur.com/F758WuS.jpg)

* [Ugh, its hideous.](http://i.imgur.com/qLXxq9j.png)

* [I couldnt stop focusing on Kiyal throughout this entire scene.](http://a.pomf.se/uigqkd.mp4) Shes just so fucking adorable.

* [No comment.](http://a.pomf.se/blzeid.mp4)

* So the Anti-Spirals stole the original moon, hid it in imaginary space, along with all the square roots of negative numbers, transformed Lordgenomes flagship into the moon, and then left a counter on it, monitoring surface-life numbers. Sounds reasonable.

* [Notice how his eyes literally turned into breasts with stars on them for a split-second.](http://a.pomf.se/nuawtp.mp4)

* [Oh, so thats what he was working on in the opening.](http://i.imgur.com/W0PMT1B.jpg)

* [Oh, shit. Its actually still there after all this time.](http://i.imgur.com/jeVcaar.jpg)

* [Is that a Pokball symbol?](http://i.imgur.com/gMfE4qU.jpg)

You have to realize that all of us who'd seen it before were snickering at this part, yes?

>Wow. That really puts into perspective just how freaking big that thing really is.

It's literally the mass of the moon.

>Its a big coincidence that the driving force of evolution in the universe is Spiral Power, and the most distinguishing thing about a drill is its spiral shape.

Sarcasm? Because that's not what I'd call a 'coincidence' as I'd call 'incredibly appropriate' :P

>Im amazed Rossiu even remembers where this place is. He only saw the outside exit once.

You have to figure they mapped the surface, right? I mean, Adai seems to have been one of the villages they evacuated to get a census, seeing as Father Makin is the only one left.

>Aw, damn it. Now I cant even be (that) mad about that, anymore. Ugh, fine. I still love Lelouch more, but I agree with Rossiu did have a good heart. Still say that comment about Kamina dying was a low-blow, though.

TOLD YOU but no seriously, most of Rossiu's actions in episodes 18-19 make a lot more sense when you consider that he was pretty much forcing himself to be an exterior hardass in public because otherwise he knew he'd break down like he did in private.

>Kinon: Rossiu! Finally I can tell you to your face how I really feel Im gay. Its an anime; one of the girls sort of has to be.

Despite smashing through space time to reality-deck Rossiu, I still think Kamina's delivery was better, both the first and second time. He literally came back from the dead to knock sense into Simon.

It was never implied he did that with Spiral Power. I think if he did the Anti Spiral would be on his ass too, so it was probably using some advanced technology.

> Who flipped Rossius serious switch?

Rossiu's serious switch was basically on since the time skip.

>Anyone else notice that Rossiu has Steins;Gate eyes?

Not really, since his iris is solid, and not a bunch of circles.

Episode 24

* I could listen to this shows ED all day long.

* So, is this a universe where theres air in space, or are they going by Jimmy Neutron rules, where theres just some magic air-forcefield surrounding them?

* It pretty much boils down to Simon and Nia being connected by feelings that transcend time and space. Did this show inspire Interstellar?

* Zorthy: How far do you think were gonna go?

* Kid: As far as Gamagori is big.

* Iraak: So as far as we need to.

* Balinbow: YEAH! KILL LA KILL REFERENCES!

* Jorgun: SATSUKI BEST GIRL!

* All: You know?

* [Oh, my gosh; her outfit is so ridiculous.](http://i.imgur.com/4yTaU5j.jpg)

* Attenborough: Ah! Theres a giant, naked woman floating and space! And the worst part is that she [comes with her own censor bars!](http://i.imgur.com/IyuE90U.jpg)

* [Yay! Shes back!](http://a.pomf.se/igjbed.mp4) I was afraid that she had only gained her sanity for a few seconds the last time we saw her.

* Huh. I expected the Anti-Spiral to have a less normal sounding voice. Im talking both English and Japanese. They both sound like just some regular man talking. With the Anti-Spirals being a hivemind race (I think) I expected it be either a bunch of voices talking at once or a computerized voice a la GLaDOS in Portal. Eh, oh well. Maybe their power lies in their seeming normality.

* [So is this a See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil kind of thing?](http://i.imgur.com/E6mp08c.jpg)

* Simon: We dont know the meaning of the word despair!

* Anti-Spiral: Oh, it means

* Simon: I was being rhetorical, you overly-literal dick.

* [Yoko, you cheeky bitch.](http://a.pomf.se/rirprr.mp4)

* Viral: I just dont think our drill is gonna be enough.

* Simon: Did I just hear a lack of fighting spirit, Viral? Cause we definitely have no chance with that attitude. No, literally, we dont. So stop it.

* Why didnt they just start out piloting the Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann?

* [Kittan. Youve earned it.](http://a.pomf.se/yqjlou.mp4)

* [Simon went Berserk.](http://i.imgur.com/LIFMSEO.jpg)

* [Okay, thats creepy.]( http://i.imgur.com/kjDywad.jpg) I mean, not air-conditioner-from-Brave-Little-Toaster-exploding creepy, but creepy.

* No! Not [that guy!](http://i.imgur.com/5z9ObMH.jpg) I loved that guy!

* [Okay, that one actually hurt a little.](http://i.imgur.com/i01Tm8V.jpg)

* [Shit, the secondary characters are dropping like flies.](http://i.imgur.com/MAL0014.jpg) I just pray we dont get a Kamina 2.0 with Simon, Nia, or Yoko after all this. That would just I dont even know.

* They went and bought it without us. Selfish bastards. Add Kittan to that list.

* [I can see how these guys earned their TV Tropes page.](http://a.pomf.se/jivklx.mp4)

* [If you look closely, you can see Space Dandy surfing on that wave.](http://i.imgur.com/FNejUJ1.jpg)

I don't know if it's been stated yet so I'll spoiler it just in case.

[Minor Spoiler](/s "I don't remember the exact words but it was something about the humanoid form being the best at manifesting spiral power")

So if you consider that, it makes sense for the *anti*-spiral ships to be shaped like that. There is one more reason I can think of but I consider that a much bigger spoiler so it will have to wait until last episode.

Yeah, the entire fashion in this last arc is really, really silly. And we haven't gotten to the worst fashion disaster yet.

It's cause we're not five anymore. We're all grown up now. Yaaaaaaay. I don't know though. I still don't think the anti-spiral hand face guys are that creepy. Strange, maybe. Eh, I guess if I *was* five it would be frightening as hell.

Actually, the bars do make sense in-universe. They are the damage from her being analysed.

Maybe it's not that strange sounding, but his Japanese voice is AWESOME. It's sad that VA did only I think one or two more roles.

>> ARTICLE
i actually liked the anti-spiral's english voice a lot better than the japanese one.
>> ARTICLE
His English voice is actually quite nice and fitting. For me it lacks the effects that were added to his voice in Japanese version (the slight echo, and generally the voice is a bit modulated, I think). I like when they do that in a fitting place, see Ameno-sagiri in Persona 4. Also his Japanese voice is a bit softer, which somehow fits his 'form' better for me. (I don't think he was shown yet, but you'll see what I meant)

EDIT: But I have to say that from all voices from this dub I heard he has probably the best and most fitting.

Far. So much happened!!! You guys warned us pretty well yesterday, but this still exceeded my expectations. Those two episodes were incredible. Im pretty sad that there are only 3 episodes left, but Im so excited to see how all of this goes down.

I just realised that I wrote a tiny amount for the second episode. There was so much action, though. And every single second was incredible.

Prep yourself for the ride of your life. I don't know if you tend to screenshot as you go, or go back episode-by-episode, but I really recommend watching the next three episodes back to back. There's really nothing that compares to marathoning the last 3 episodes of Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
We can't watch back to back to back, we can only do back to back, break, and then finale. 
>> ARTICLE
Just suggesting a slightly different method is all. I know quite a few people in the Hunter x Hunter rewatch who are ahead but still participating in the discussion.

Besides, I feel like marathoning the last two hours is the ideal way to experience the show.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of agree with you. I can't imagine what it will be like to watch 25 and 26 and then wait another day to watch 27. It doesn't matter if it's this show or any other. How can you just leave the final episode for another time at that point?

It was tough/weird doing it during the Code Geass rewatch. I could never fault anyone for breaking the rewatch schedule just to finish out the final episode of a series.

That said, you first timers stay strong if sticking to the schedule is what you want to do! I believe in you all!
>> ARTICLE
Ultimately it's personal preference, but I think it's kind of cruel with a show like Gurren Lagann to have to wait a day fir the final episode. Not to mention your no longer carrying those emotions into it with the strength you would have if you marathoned.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, I started marathoning Gurren Lagann at episode 5. It's like all these other people have jobs and responsibilities or something.
>> ARTICLE
I was gonna stick with the rewatch's schedule, but watch the next 2 eps without taking any notes/screencaps, and then go back for it.

But now you make me wanna watch all 3 at once...
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm not gonna say it's not worth it but I think it's more fulfilling to follow the rewatch schedule.

You'll get to watch them in order anyway if you stick around for the movies, which I highly recommend.

> you admitted that your religion was bullshit. I dont understand any of this.

Yes, but he still thought that the book he had was something of importance, at least.

>[Oh boy](http://i.imgur.com/J40tWW0.png)

That basically sums up the whole show.


>> ARTICLE
> Where the fuck did it come from?? :O ALIENS?? Dude, you admitted that your religion was bullshit. I dont understand any of this.

He admitted that he could never read the book, didn't he? That doesn't equate to 'the whole religion is bullshit.' I always got the impression that it was something handed down generation after generation in the village, with each new high priest assuming that somewhere down the line had been able to read the book and that's where they got their beliefs.

>That is an impressive amount of cigarettes.

That's hilarious. I've watched these episodes so many times and I've never even noticed that.

>Oh yeah, how did this happen anyway? Was there any chemistry between these two in the first part of the anime, or was it all off-screen?

All offscreen, for the most part. I don't remember anything in the actual series other than that I think Kiyoh piloted Dayakkaiser after Dayakka took over the captain duty. 

>Far out.

Her expression breaks my heart. I never really cared too much about most of the side pilots, but Makken had a family :(

poor leita.  that broke my heart. she's such a trooper, too.  she reboots straight into [heroic safe mode](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode) and gets right back to work.  no time to mourn right now.  we're in the shit.
>> ARTICLE
At least you got to watch 24 immediately after.

The week's wait after Simon flies up, plants the flag into the ship and gives the speech all to the music in the background felt like an eternity.

Actually every episode after 11 felt like that. Watching this while it was airing is one of my favourite anime related memories. I recall logging into the PA forums after watching the newest episode and the first thing I see, all in caps is "THEY PUNCHED THE GODDAMN MOON!"

While I was watching the last 2 episodes I actually thought about how hard it must have been to watch this while it was airing and wait every week. But I'm glad that it was a great experience at the same time :D

He knew that the God was just a gunman. He never knew that the book itself was just gibberish.

>  If we use a heap of long and complicated words and claim that our token genius cant understand it, then we dont need to come up with an answer, right?

It's like they saw the Star Trek episode where they joke about Spock not understanding some techno-babble and went, "Yep, that'll work."

**Episode 23: In which our hero invents teleportation to punch someone in the face**

Here we finally have it, Rossiu's redemption episode. It's a sorely needed breather/transition episode after the craziness we just finished, but it still manages to just be a really great watch with plenty of character moments for like, everyone. 

So, I started to do a little bit yesterday, but now that we've seen his full arc (or like 99.5% of it) let's talk about Rossiu.

He's honestly one of my favorite characters in the whole show (I mean, I wouldn't put him in my top five or anything, but that's just because there are *so many great characters* in TTGL) because he's so unlike anyone else. In a series full of HOT BLOOD KICK REASON TO THE CURB ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER he's... calm, measured, and coolheaded. All excellent qualities, but as we've seen in this past arc, he exists in the wrong universe.

The most obvious comparison, of course, is to Father Makin, the priest of his village. Like Rossiu, Makin's individual decisions were understandable from a purely pragmatic point of view; Adai simply could not support more than 50 people at a time, so for the greater good, people had to be exiled to the surface. Of course, it's effectively condemning an innocent person to the death every time, so while we can understand *why* we're doing it, we can still feel appalled at it - similarly to Rossiu condemning Simon to death, abandoning the people in the shelters, and closing the Arc Gurren doors early. The show itself draws an explicit comparison - in the scene when they're sitting together on the rock, take a look at how similar their outfits look from behind.

Rossiu, like Makin, was a good man making hard decisions. Unlike Makin, Rossiu's chief mistake was not recognizing that there were other ways to handle it. As I said yesterday, there's a terrific (and I think completely intentional) irony in that the character who grew up as a devoutly religious acolyte is the one whose fatal character flaw is a lack of faith. Even as he keeps the trappings of his faith ("How far will God test us?") he simply *does not believe* in things he cannot measure, test or construct.

As Makin was bound by a book of God that he could not understand, Rossiu is bound by hard data. He wants exact census data of the population of the planet. The Grapearls, designed to be superior than Gurren Lagann, are the weapons he trusts in over the "antiquated" Gunmen. When Leeron presents him his simulation data, he takes it as gospel. But he can't believe. He doesn't have the faith that it'll somehow work out that the rest of Team Gurren does.

And this is a *good thing*, for the most part! As Kamina needed Simon to keep him in check, Simon needs Rossiu. Simon, mighty spiral warrior, is completely unsuited to doing the sort of work that a peacetime civilian government needs, the sort of work at which Rossiu excels. Let's not forget that it's only through an invention of Rossiu's - the Lordgenome biocomputer - that Simon is able to realize that the moon is really Cathedral Terra, and ultimately able to find Nia and bring the fight to the Antispirals. Without Rossiu, Simon doesn't succeed in either of these things.

Rossiu's biggest mistake, and the one for which most people hate him (at least until we see Kinon's flashback about his grief) is condemning Simon. Leeron, at one point, worries that Rossiu will burn himself out because he's *trying to do it all himself.* He's trying to take on all the responsibility, trying to be the one who has to make all the hard calls, when what he should be doing is having faith in the people around him and working together with Simon in the first place. And that's the exact advice he writes Kinon in what he intends to be his suicide note: Don't try to do it all yourself. Rely on the people around you. 

By the end of this arc, Rossiu has rediscovered his faith. Not in God, but in people. In the weight of an individual human life. And this comes back in one small moment we haven't seen yet, that's one of my favorite tiny moments in the series. 

So yeah, I think Rossiu and his arc are *fascinating.* Gurren Lagann is way smarter than it seems at first glance.

**Episode 24: In which all the people you don't really care about die**

There's not much to say about this episode, which is primarily one giant action sequence. We're starting to get into the "this is pretty absurd but it's awesome" stage of the series. 

The big development, of course, is the death of every other non-main-character pilot in Team Gurren. To be honest, I've never quite liked how they do it, just getting rid of all of the minor guys in one go. It's why I think that 24 is arguably the weakest episode in the entire Simon Arc (not to say it's a bad episode by any means, just that it's not as awesome as the others). 

[TTGL Movie 2 spoilers](/s "One of the few things I like better in the movies is this change, where they all survive instead. It makes it feel less cheap, and makes later developments more weighty.")

There's a moment in this episode that will never NOT be hilarious for me, though. When they can't break through the shield with Arc Gurren Lagann, Viral says "looks like our drill won't be enough." Simon responds with "you mean we need an EVEN BIGGER drill?" Like... doesn't even think about using something other than a drill. Just jumps straight to 'a bigger drill.' When all you have is a hammer, right?

The most important thing about episode 24 is that it sets up the remainder of the arc. 

I really hate to be the overexaggerating type out of fear that it'll be raising expectations for the newcomers a little too much, but I'm so excited for tomorrow's thread. 25 and 26 are, arguably, the two best episodes in the entire series. Between them, they have what I would consider, without exaggeration, two of the best scenes in any anime of all time. 

Do the impossible.   
See the invisible.    
Touch the untouchable.     
Break the unbreakable.    

See you tomorrow, everyone.

Edit: Holy shit, I wrote a wall of text about Rossiu.
>> ARTICLE
Oh hey a Rossiu sympathiser!

I agree that he's born in the wrong universe. He makes a fantastic foil to a most everyone in this universe as a result. When one finds himself hating Rossiu's guts, that's when one has completely bought into TTGL's central theme: The ends do NOT justify the means, fight even in the face of impossibility. Rossiu's sin is never being different, it's in the fact that despite the many many instances of miracles in his universe, he still clings to the logic of our universe. He's Doubting Thomas. In his universe it actually doesn't make sense NOT to believe in spiral power. 

That being said. Re-watching again, I can see the overall spiral theme being played out once more, and therefore I can appreciate this arc on artistic grounds. This is the exact same story. He is Father Makin, he is Lord Genome, he is Anti-Spiral: the ends justify the means, and because I can't see anything other than the pessimistic ending, I will use fear and despair to justify the evil I am about to do. 

What a beautiful story. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that's a little unfair to Rossiu, the Genome and Antispiral comparisons. Rossiu made some poor calls (the least defensible of which is the Simon thing) but he never traded in fear or despair. He tried to give the people hope. 

Besides, even this show subverts this at the very end. [Ending spoilers](/s "Simon doesn't fight to bring back Nia. He lets it go. He makes a hard choice, Rossiu-style. Rossiu's not always right in this arc, but that doesn't make his way necessarily wrong, either.")

>> ARTICLE
Rossiu is the Andy Reid of anime characters. This is why though I understand his motivations, I still think he's a dick.
>> ARTICLE
The *only* thing I disliked about Rossiu the first time around was that he didn't let Simon try to fight back. Rossiu knew what Simon was capable of. He fought by his side when they were kids. At least give the guy a shot. He's your strongest defense against the Anti-Spirals.

All of Rossiu's decisions are rather logical, except maybe sentencing Simon to death. I can't straight out hate him since he was making the tough calls, and no one else was doing/could do that. Still, it's fucking TTGL. Shit is crazy. It's fucking Simon. Let him do his thing. Don't kill the man.

>I really hate to be the overexaggerating type out of fear that it'll be raising expectations for the newcomers a little too much, but I'm so excited for tomorrow's thread.

Oh, gonna hype people up for the remaining episodes huh? You sob.

Just kidding. I feel like rewatchers can be excited to see reactions for the final few episodes of a show. It shouldn't ruin it for first timers at this point. It's the end of a show. Are you really not expecting to enjoy seeing how the story you've been watching concludes? And especially since everyone here has been saying "shit just gets crazier from here" every single thread. TTGL is a wild ride right til the end. Everyone should know it by now.
>> ARTICLE

Simons is a statistical impossibility. you can't account for simon. Rossiu is a good character in the wrong universe. this universe is pretty much "fuck logic" when Rossiu does the logical thing. he matures quickly over the years where as Simon is just simon a bit older. Simon quite literally condemned the world to death (although unknowingly) including both humans and beastmen, you try justifying what was done.
>> ARTICLE
> you try justifying what was done.

Fuck logic.

I don't think I picked up in as much of the nuance in Rossiu's arc till you laid it out there. Thanks for that!
>> ARTICLE

Yeah I laughed at that, drills are all he knows! :p

> Between them, they have what I would consider, without exaggeration, two of the best scenes in any anime of all time.

Setting the bar high...so are most of the people here haha I doubt I'll be that impressed but I'm looking forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
Rossiu is probably the best foil to Simon in the show (lot of similarities in their origins and such, but one awakens to self-belief and fighting power while the other loses himself in clinging to logic and rejecting faith), and its incredible watching his  character arc as he sinks deeper and deeper into despair, before being pulled back by his friends. He really is the MC of another show that somehow got lost and ended up in TTGL lol. 

As you said, he truly has a really fascinating arc that I often get into big disputes about with my other friends who are big TTGL fans (but most of them still really dislike Rossiu ;_;). Gainax created and developed some absolutely amazing characters in this show and I fucking love it so much.
>> ARTICLE
My interpretation of Rossiu is slightly different. Simon plays to win. Rossiu plays to not-lose. Rossiu constantly chooses the course of action which is likely to do the least damage. [More obvious after the next few episodes](/s "But TTGL argues that in the long run, playing to not-lose leads to stagnation and a greater loss").

Rossiu's one risky action was to resurrect Lordgenome. In most other shows, that is the sort of mad scientist move which backfires horribly. In TTGL, it's the one move he makes that works.
>> ARTICLE
> I think Rossiu and his arc are fascinating. Gurren Lagann is way smarter than it seems at first glance.

we are of one mind, you and i.  i have always been a supporter of what seemed like a very small, vastly outnumbered camp of rossiu sympathizers, and you've done a great job of breaking down a lot of what makes his character great.

i'd just like to add, and it's not much, but... i think one of his best lines is right when he's booting up the lordgenome computer.  "now, tell me all the secrets of this world!".  there's so much determination in his voice.  he's going to shoulder the burden of all that knowledge in order to save the people around him.  he's noble, in a way.  he just got born into the wrong universe.

like you, i am pumped to see the community's reaction to 25 and 26.  
>> ARTICLE
Yay, Rossiu sympathizers unite! I never felt like I hated the guy. The only thing that disappointed me was when he actually intended to kill Simon, their trump card, instead of letting him off behind the scenes with an ultimatum or something which would have still been effective in preventing government corruption. Anyway, he stuck to his beliefs and they were always respectable in my eyes. People HATE talking about Rossiu lol but this arc was enlightening and did an excellent job in setting up a grand finale.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly their death flags were raised as soon as they got more than 10 seconds of screen time and they had more than 1 line. I'm still sad they're gone. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

- Today's first **"Song of the Episode"** is ["He is so XXX"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAf_tCwId0s). This is Leeron's theme.

- Today's second **"Song of the Episode"** is ["Ahhh! A Skeletonn!! A Skeletonnn!!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVTRHAhA1DI). 

I already used episode 24's **"Song of the Episode"** back in episode 5 but I realize now this is that the better choice would have been ["Adai Village's Dekosuke"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwA9NBypJ9g) instead. I only care because once we're at the end of this rewatch I'm gonna put all the song's at episode coordination in one post. I've got a lot of facts for today as well!

- **"I think they're trying to tell me something"**: In the background of the song ["He is so XXX"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAf_tCwId0s), you can hear someone saying letters which spell out  "Leeron is gay he is so gay gay he loves my asshole asshole".

- **"Gainax's turn"**: So we've left the 90s era of mech and now we're experiencing Gainax's take on the mech genre with some "power of love" added in. 

- **"I don't really have a title for this one"**: I hope you picked this up by now but Gurren Lagann is split up into 4 arcs; in order, Kamina's Arc, Nia's Arc, Rossiu's Arc, and lastly Simon's Arc. Each arc is pretty centered on that character and his/her actions.

- **"Gainax loves referencing themselves"**: A [giant naked Nia in space](http://i.imgur.com/sfVHCYn.jpg)? [END OF EVA SPOILER](/s "Where have I seen a giant naked lady in space before?") **EVA SPOILER LINK -->** [SPOILER](http://i.imgur.com/QPfKOB8.png).

I can see all of your reactions now, "Was that water in space?". Keep watching and keep reading! See you all tomorrow for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!

	Pulling a Kamina on him huh.

	Well what do you know now they are both redeemed because mah feels.

	See thats love calls her fat and she still loves him.

	You are allowed to be stumped this time everyone. He is talking a lot of bullshit.

	Nigga thats a ring not another universe. Unless we are going to start talking about pocket universes then ill concede.

	Fucking course we are talking about pocket universes who am I kidding should have just watched for 2 more seconds.

	Viral its alright she wont bite you.I think.

Episode 24:

	Darry stop trying to rationalize this plots crazy.

	 [No really am I going crazy or are some of these eps not using title cards.]( http://i.imgur.com/CHvJWTb.png)

	How did none of you fuckers notice her till he pointed it out?

	Thats a bunch of faces and hands.

	So now we have big ass old school gunmen?

	Yoko stop causing distress in Kittan before a big fights you know that cant be smart.

	Im sorry I need to rephrase that its not a bunch of faces and hands. Its a bunch of  face hands.

	[So we just gonna conveniently forgot about the big ass space ship you came on. Which Ill assume has a fucking drill because everything in this show has a fucking drill if not many.](http://i.imgur.com/skHa8g8.jpg)

	DARRY NO!

	Not you too Makken.

	Both of you have to live ;-;.

	 Jorgun, and Balinbow you cant die as well ;-;

	Welp Im sad now.

	No fuck you, you cant tell me after all that shit it was a trap to put you in the space ocean.

its way more satisfying when people recognize the anime when i wear [this shirt](http://www.theshirtlist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LETS-JAM-T-Shirt.jpeg)

**EPISODE 21**

* [It happens](http://i.imgur.com/AadCP74.png)

* Shes [dressed so modestly](http://i.imgur.com/rf6xePb.png). Im kind of hoping most of this episode will be dedicated to what Yoko got up to when she left

* [This kid](http://i.imgur.com/3vu6umn.png) is utterly adorable

* [Why Yomako?](http://i.imgur.com/lmw6t8A.png) Oh, shes [hiding her identity](http://i.imgur.com/krkNGwa.png)

* Ugh. [Kids can be so gross](http://i.imgur.com/Iu5m4MJ.png). Get a fucking tissue

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/IRZ8ZPy.png) is not how a teacher should act. This is bullying. Teachers arent meant to bully their kids

* Ugh, so cute, with his [clay Gurren Lagann](http://i.imgur.com/Ig4kuMm.png). Loving this montage

* Ahaha, the [other chalks still there](http://i.imgur.com/haSxJVa.png). How threatening

* Look how fucking [satisfied Yoko is](http://i.imgur.com/Xs02P5d.png). Shes such a mean teacher. You shouldnt enjoy punishing your students

* I want to criticise [this](http://i.imgur.com/sRBo5Q6.png), but its definitely better than anything I could draw

* More like, [How the heck did they get up there?!](http://i.imgur.com/h4uHfei.png)

* [His dads dead](http://i.imgur.com/0c9rkQt.png) Are we switching main characters?? Its pretty late in the show for that, isnt it?

* I dont understand how [this](http://i.imgur.com/LlK55Fz.png) works, but it sure is pretty. Glad theyre using this kind of shot again

* Missed [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/266LXfm.png)

* How did she manage to become [more badass](http://i.imgur.com/4OJ3FWn.png)??

* [Yeah](http://i.imgur.com/YG8X1fu.png), it feels a bit

* [True?](http://i.imgur.com/reX21FH.png) She just leaves him with the shit job. Have fun with that, shitheads

* [Finally](http://i.imgur.com/R5MGlpL.png). Hes finally gonna fight with them. FINALLY!

* [Duh](http://i.imgur.com/mqrzNyX.png). What are you? Some kind of idiot?? Get your head out of your ass, Viral.

* I will never get sick of hearing anyone say [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZpqVfWZ.png)

* I know very little about astronomy, but Im pretty sure [we kind of need the moon](http://i.imgur.com/d1lYe7V.png)

* Its honestly that [mesmerising](http://i.imgur.com/5L1Khhr.png)

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/j08bzeJ.png) is a better outcome than I could have ever thought of!!!! Im gonna cry, Im so damn happy!!

* Shh, Yoko! [Theyre having a moment](http://i.imgur.com/n7inisC.png)

* [Man](http://i.imgur.com/A633Ict.png), its like a sports team. Morale is super important

* Are you seriously fucking asking [this](http://i.imgur.com/S43yCvM.png) after ALL this time??!?

* It took me, like, a solid 10 seconds to figure out [this sentence](http://i.imgur.com/QY2qENY.png). English is hard, sometimes

* [These two are way too much.](http://i.imgur.com/VId4imv.png) I love it


**EPISODE 22**

* Is that the [rude moustached dude](http://i.imgur.com/WQS5N2u.png) from two episodes ago??

* [Someone needs to stop her](http://i.imgur.com/NTjn0Tb.png)

* [Seriously](http://i.imgur.com/Fy3T3Rr.png), this guy was with them for a long time and he was even involved in fights! Did he suddenly forget what powers the robots??? 

* [These two are practically besties](http://i.imgur.com/287Pl7R.png) at this point

* [AHAHAAHHA](http://i.imgur.com/zEGSpTE.png), aww that sucks

* [What just happened??](http://i.imgur.com/uD8kEff.png) Is there an actual explanation for how he managed to absorb all that firepower and send it back? Did he use a special drill? What do you guys find more ridiculous: this show or the fact that I still question it after 21 episodes?

* As if shits not bad enough, the [baby starts crying](http://i.imgur.com/vDO4QNB.png)! My ears!!! [Oh my gosh](http://i.imgur.com/naEX74A.png), alright, I forgive you

* [Leeron speaks for all of us, probably](http://i.imgur.com/PNQmD3V.png)

* [DRILL!!!](http://i.imgur.com/Ha8iwR7.png)

* [And what of it, bitch?!](http://i.imgur.com/A6GUIbH.png)

* Ahahah, so Gurren Lagann is now piloting a mecha??! [Mechaception.](http://i.imgur.com/BCOVcbl.png)

* THAT ENTIRE SCENE WAS [SO FUCKING COOL](http://i.imgur.com/YaSYxAo.png)

* Um. [They broke space](http://i.imgur.com/CqOryzC.png) Or I suppose you could say that they busted through the heavens?? (I'm sorry) Was the quote always meant to be literal?

* [Hey!](http://i.imgur.com/JtOB1gM.png) Virals there too, ya know?

* [Combining with the moon is so like this anime](http://i.imgur.com/s57D81u.png)

* I kinda feel [bad for him](http://i.imgur.com/rNrMIQN.png)

* Oh, [for fucks sake]( http://i.imgur.com/keMnAqQ.png), Nia. Shes [playing dirty](http://i.imgur.com/U8IdQj5.png). But couldnt he just use the drill to slap her away, without killing her? [Yeah](http://i.imgur.com/oNISGtL.png), it looks like youll have to talk her down

* [Glass half-full](http://i.imgur.com/K3IqPmN.png) much?

* [Boom](http://i.imgur.com/CnyF4yd.png)

* I love the amount of [faith](http://i.imgur.com/MC7fGmo.png) that these characters all have for each other. Like, they dont doubt and I just find it super sweet

* Here comes the [guilt](http://i.imgur.com/pqgP0nC.png)

* Well, thats [pretty obvious](http://i.imgur.com/8Ty2RVy.png), isnt it? Theres still, like, 5 episodes left

* [But its not zero](http://i.imgur.com/oPlUsIa.png), so

* [No, Simon](http://i.imgur.com/9DvAIu1.png). I dont think this is how maths works

* [Kill me.](http://i.imgur.com/MzqPNQO.png)

* Theres no need to be [so hard on yourself](http://i.imgur.com/GjddPDG.png), kid. If you were in our world, youd be really good at what you do

I wasnt really expecting a rescue the damsel route in this type of anime, but Im not exactly opposed to that trope being used, so Im looking forward to the next few episodes. Viral joining Simon was the obvious highlight for me with these two episodes.  I also loved seeing what Yoko was doing while she was away. And that split second where Nia returned was so good, yet heartbreaking. Also, Simons scream. Dude.

That action and transformation scenes were top notch, too.

I just hope Nia gets a chance to shine too and isn't a complete damsel in distress!

> Viral joining Simon was ~~the~~ obvious

This groups' fascination with him made it pretty obvious so it kinda pulled a bit away for me but still was pretty fun to watch!

> I also loved seeing what Yoko was doing while she was away

wonder if they'll explain more into why she wanted to go into teaching. Those scenes were so much fun, especially when she was throwing the chalk :p

>> ARTICLE
viral's acceptance by simon and the rest of the team is probably the thing that bothers me most about the show.  viral literally held kamina down while thymilph stabbed him to death...  and the team just lets him tag along?  i mean...  it's not like forgiveness is an underlying theme of the whole show, so i just don't get it.
>> ARTICLE
He did help them with Cytomander (flying dude), when Yoko was trapped & Viral was ordered to kill Simon.

Simon knows Viral is just a bro on the other side of the war. 
>> ARTICLE
if you don't think that simon would have kicked reason to the curb and done the impossible without viral's help, you haven't been watching very closely.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's been awhile and they know they need all the help they can get.

In Simon's case he's seen more of how Viral is now rather then how he was then

Yeah, me too. She's cool either way, though
>> ARTICLE
> wonder if they'll explain more into why she wanted to go into teaching. Those scenes were so much fun, especially when she was throwing the chalk :p

Just think back on what Kamina's goal was, to give children a world where they can look up at the sky without a care.

Well, she is doing that.
>> ARTICLE
Well isn't that cute :p

And as she said herself "I'll go get it back for you. I'll go save the pure blue sky that you kids love."

> Duh. What are you? Some kind of idiot?? Get your head out of your ass, Viral.

This should be your response every time someone in this show says they'll do something ridiculous. Just roll with it.

> I love the amount of faith that these characters all have for each other. Like, they dont doubt and I just find it super sweet

It's kind of the core of Gurren Lagann. Below the explosions and mechs and ridiculous scenarios, the characters are the glue that hold the whole show together, and honestly it wouldn't be even half as good as it is without them. The over-the-top delivery is just that - delivery. It's a vehicle. The characters are what make Gurren Lagann special. I can't imagine the show without them, but it probably wouldn't be anything more than a confusing clusterfuck.

> Well, thats pretty obvious, isnt it? Theres still, like, 5 episodes left

Aww, honey. You have no idea.

> Kill me.

I take it you're pretty invested in Nia and Simon at this point?
>> ARTICLE
> Aww, honey. You have no idea.

Hey now, no, come on. Why do you guys do this to me?

> I take it you're pretty invested in Nia and Simon at this point?

I'm pretty invested in all the characters and their relationships with each other. But yeah, especially those two
>> ARTICLE
> Hey now, no, come on. Why do you guys do this to me?

To make you even more excited, obviously. Nobody can ever be too excited about Gurren Lagann.

> I'm pretty invested in all the characters and their relationships with each other. But yeah, especially those two

Like I said, the best part of the show is the characters.
>> ARTICLE
> What do you guys find more ridiculous: this show or the fact that I still question it after 21 episodes?

The fact that you still question it after 21 episodes.

> Virals there too, ya know?

Beastmen are incapable of producing spiral power, remember?
>> ARTICLE
> The fact that you still question it after 21 episodes.

Okay

Yes! Do it! It's too awesome not to cry.

> Is there an actual explanation for how he managed to absorb all that firepower and send it back? Did he use a special drill?

Isn't that what he was doing against the Mugann on Earth?
>> ARTICLE
> Isn't that what he was doing against the Mugann on Earth?

Was it? Probably. I can't remember
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was. His drill can absorb and redirect anti-spiral weaponry fire because Lagann is a powerful Spiral Race war machine, as are all gunmen.
>> ARTICLE
>I love the amount of faith that these characters all have for each other. Like, they dont doubt and I just find it super sweet

I'm going to talk more about this tomorrow because it sort of concludes Rossiu's main character arc, but I think it's incredibly interesting that the main character flaw in Rossiu, a character who was introduced as being deeply religious, is his *lack of faith*. Rossiu is intelligent, rational, capable of making very difficult decisions... but he has no faith in things he can't measure or analyze, which is what leads him to ruin in this arc. He can't have the faith in his teammates that the rest of Team Gurren does.

Which makes one singular moment that we'll get to before the end all the more satisfying, but I won't get ahead of myself :)

Good morning kids, ready for a lesson from Ms. Yomako? I always wondered if the reason Yoko became a teacher was because she wanted to make sure those kids would get the childhood she didn't have. How freaking cool is Arc-Gurren Lagann. IT PUNCHED THE GIANT MUGANN SO HARD IT HIT *NOTHING* AND **BROKE IT**. I've got A LOT of stuff for today so let's get started. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

- Today's first **"Song of the Episode"** is ["Fleeing the Hot Desert, Team Dai-Gurren Can Continue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahWrSfx_o_s).

- Today's second **"Song of the Episode"** is the ED because I'm lazy, ["Minna No Peace"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt_N8mjrmdw).

In addition to today's **"Song's of the Episode's"**, now that Yoko is back I wanted to include ["Boin vs. Boin"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nemajizj_tU) or "Boobs vs Boobs" because it's pretty much Yoko's song.

FACT DUMP INC; I've got a lot of stuff for today!

- **"Viral's Allusion"**: Ever heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh? Well in the story there is a man named Enkidu, Enkidu was a man created by the gods to punish Gilgamesh for his hubris. After fighting each other, Enkidu and Gilgamesh became close friends. Remember what Viral's mech was called? Enkidu. Viral is the Enkidu of this series.

- **"Another GaoGaiGar Reference"**: [Arc-Gurren Lagann's transformation sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JqG3L42cCs) is slightly reminiscent of [GaoGaiGar's transformation sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbesSY6iliA).

- **"Fooly Cool Reference"**: [Yoko's yellow hover scooter](http://i.imgur.com/ZAuktfI.png) is similar to FLCL's [Haruhara Haruko's yellow hover vespa](http://i.imgur.com/3bCX5mP.jpg).

- **"90s Kids"**: If you hadn't picked up the pattern yet, this arc we were just in was a take on the 90s period of mech anime. This era was characterized by little fighting and a lot more politics were involved. Everything was a lot more psychological; the conflict was internal instead of external.

- **"Captain Garlock"**: People frequently call that [man from the opening scene of the series](http://i.imgur.com/cbYkABQ.jpg) Captain Garlock because he looks like [Captain Harlock](http://i.imgur.com/EztUocj.jpg). Fitting with that, the [Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren](http://i.imgur.com/M9i47Bt.gif) looks like [Captain Harlock's spaceship](http://i.imgur.com/gOSrFkf.jpg).

We've made it guys, from here till the end it's gonna be nonstop action. I made a [visual representation](http://i.imgur.com/VlWB4OF.png) of where we are right now in the story line. I hope you guys are as hyped as I am. I also hope you guys enjoyed the splooge of facts I had for today. See you all tomorrow for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!

EDIT: I changed the graph because some people wanted more.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of charts, someone needs to make something like the [GaoGaiGar chart](http://i.imgur.com/r5MWVJ5.png) for TTGL. The amount of hype in TTGL is worthy of a chart like that. The hype can't be conveyed on a simple line.
>> ARTICLE
There's something similar that goes episode by episode but I won't link it due to spoilers. Gurren Koma should find it for you through google, but as I said, contains major spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
It's finals week for me so maybe if I'm not feeling lazy after finals are over. But yea someone should make that.
>> ARTICLE
>I made a visual representation

that growing is not fast enough....
needs more breaking through time and space to be correct
>> ARTICLE
[Does this work?](http://i.imgur.com/5CPNbeq.png)
>> ARTICLE
Add a spiral at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Does [this](http://i.imgur.com/D9edieC.png) satisfy you?
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I think that's good enough
>> ARTICLE
Additional fact/Get hyyyype: the next five episodes contain 40% of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's total budget.
>> ARTICLE
Which explains all the still shots as people talk in this arc.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 21**

Yoko vs Nia I'd still choose Nia's side though...

Want more ground stuff then space scenes...

Yoko wearing clothes?!?

Ok Yoko is amazing...this class is too adorable...if they die I swear...

The gang's back together :)

Yoko interrupting  Viral and Simon's moment ;)

What a manly ending haha

**Episode 22**

This just keeps getting crazier haha

What's next he combines with the moon

Wait did they just break Space?? lmao

The moon is Jack Skellington!!

Everything is a giant machine in this...why are they still surprised lol

He's gonna combine with the moon haha

Seeing the old Nia ;.;

Urge to marathon increases...

Episode 21: Why Yoko Is Best Girl.

-Seriously, between the epic new jacket, being an awesome schoolteacher, and then downing two Gunmen with her rifle and a hoverbike, holy crap.

-I also love Simon's sleeveless getup in these two episodes.

-VIRAL HAS JOINED THE PARTY

-Rossiu, you fucked up, but at least you realize that now.

Episode 22: And The Escalation Begins, in all caps starting NOW

-THEY JUST VAPORIZED HUNDREDS OF MUGANN BY YELLING

-THEY JUST COMBINED WITH ARC-GURREN

-IT'S A CITY-SIZED ROBOT BEING PILOTED BY A NORMAL-SIZED ROBOT BEING PILOTED BY PEOPLE

-IT JUST PUNCHED A MUGANN SO HARD IT CRASHED INTO NOTHING ***AND THE NOTHING BROKE***

-SURE IS MAJORA'S MASK IN HERE

-OH GOD THE MOON IS A ROBOT TOO

-ROSSIU YOU DI... ACTUALLY I CAN'T REALLY DISAGREE HERE (I honestly don't. If Arc-GL gets smashed along with Earth, that's total extinction.)

-OH DAMMIT NOT NOW NIA

-OH THANK GOD IT WORKED AND NORMAL NIA'S BACK (AND THEN GONE)

-THEY JUST LANDED A CITY-SIZED HUMANOID ROBOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY BECAUSE FUCK THE SQUARE CUBE LAW

--So yeah. ***This*** is where it all begins.

* [I wish I had that kind of talent.](http://i.imgur.com/YNFVhrZ.jpg)

* Holy shit, Im making a lot of screenshots this episode. And its not even the halfway point.

* [Maosha](http://a.pomf.se/kqzeqr.mp4): Bastards trying to say we arent engaged, huh? Time to go Yuno Gasai on his ass.

* How did Maosha (cause lets be honest here; it was totally Maosha) even manage to get his bag all the way up there?

* You guys wanna maybe lay down some pads? Blankets? Just stand under the tree? You know, just in case?

* [So, do you often go around tearing your blouse clean-off, or what?](http://a.pomf.se/xrford.mp4)

* [WHAT ARE PHYSICS?!](http://i.imgur.com/yF5XGZV.jpg) Like, I could buy the Lagann flying high enough to get such an impossible view, but what?!

* Hiroyuki Imaishi: Your physics are for pussies.

* Reminds me of when Kamina scaled that tree hoping to see the girls naked. Twas a simpler time.

* Nakim the Tree-Climber? Seriously, thats the best youve got? Even for grade-schoolers thats lame.

* [Yoko:](http://i.imgur.com/x1Y60UJ.jpg) Ew, black-and-white. It was better when there wasnt even such a thing as TV.

* [Whoa, a teacher hiding her true views for the sake of her childrens peace-of-mind?](http://a.pomf.se/wcxexy.mp4) Clearly this is not Tennessee.

* Whenever anything bad happens, she runs up there and cries! Actually, shes just trying to get to Columbia. She just hasnt been able to figure out the code yet.

* [Cause why the fuck not?](http://i.imgur.com/ORFwLt8.jpg)

* [Oh, its the ending to Another.](http://i.imgur.com/93CtFey.jpg) How long until people start saying, Send the dead back to death, so much that I start rooting for people to eat it?

* [Dude, I think I just hit puberty.](http://i.imgur.com/dhacjyv.jpg)

* [Yoko:](http://i.imgur.com/lJJB2MO.jpg) Well, I succeeded in making myself go deaf, not to mention I gave myself second-degree burns all along the back of my body, but I think I proved my point.

* [Okay, how the hell could they survive *that*, but Kamina couldnt survive a spear in the back?](http://i.imgur.com/RMyTrNU.jpg)

* I put your bag up there. Wow, never saw that one coming. Also, Im a really good tree-climber? Like, I climbed trees all the time when I was young, too, but I was never crazy enough to go higher than twenty or so feet.

* Oh, and he forgave her. Yay.

* Please, contact me immediately. Ignore the fact that I total set up my former and your current best-friend to be the fall-guy for everything, and didnt even try to give him a fair trial. Well need all the fine bitches we can get while were up in space partying.

* [I think this violates some sort of policy.](http://i.imgur.com/9VRvwvd.jpg)

* Kittan: You show up out of nowhere and steal the rescue for yourself?! But Im supposed to be Simons husbando!

* Yoko: Pu-lease! Dont act like that isnt Virals job!

* [Viral:](http://a.pomf.se/gjjipq.mp4) You couldnt have just used her scythe, or anything safer?

* Simon: No! It wouldnt have made me look badass enough!

* [Hey, youre stealing my line, Viral.](http://a.pomf.se/gjysba.mp4)

* [Well, its about damn time.](http://i.imgur.com/Up0zszs.jpg)

* Listen, bozos! Were gonna smash up that big-ass ceiling up there! Who gives a fuck about the tides?! (Speaking of which, how have there not been massive floods yet?)

* [You hit the wrong chest there, buddy.](http://i.imgur.com/BTg2PCG.jpg)

* [THERE we go.](http://a.pomf.se/wjttbu.mp4) Thats better.

* Even with the humiliation I have suffered at its hands, my body is telling me what it wants. Just Just let those choice of words sink in for a little bit.

* [Yoko:](http://i.imgur.com/Vp7EoPU.jpg) Hey, save the homoerotic undertones for the slash-fics, will ya?

* How can a machines power be influenced by human emotions? Dude Did you just forget *all* the times Simon spent kicking ass in Lagann? Or did you convince yourself that the fighting spirit power was a hoax?

* No, Rossiu, *do* give up, and let the good characters take center-stage. Or at the very least shut your mouth.

Episode 22

* Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Okay, I think Ive recovered enough for us to continue.

* [Leeron gets off to thinking about the advancement of humanity.](http://a.pomf.se/wynnpv.mp4)

* Ive already cum to the to Who the hell do you think I am? scene, so lets continue.

* This is My Final Duty. Hopefully, Rossiu finally grows a pair and sacrifices himself in a blaze of glory. It wouldnt exactly be up there with [Code Geass Spoilers](/s "Lelouchs sacrifice"), but it would be something.

* [Swag.](http://i.imgur.com/EXgfull.jpg)

* [Now the moon comes equipped with a fucking energy beam?](http://i.imgur.com/NQQwxRg.jpg)

* [Took you fucking long enough, dipshit.](http://a.pomf.se/iixgtu.mp4) Also, his irises are squares.

* By this point, some of you may be complaining about how you can hear the explosions even though theyre in space. Fuck you, Gurren Lagann says. Fuck you and your pretentious, artsy Kubrick bullshit.

* Simon: You little!

* Viral: Actually, Id say theyre quite big.

* Simon: I direct you to comment about space-noise!

* [](http://a.pomf.se/rxldbo.mp4) Did Lordgenome just climax? (And, yes, I listened to it in Japanese, too. He still sounds like hes getting off.)

* Leeron: Its not easy being popular.

* Kermit: Oh, you think thats bad?

* Leeron: Not now, poorly sequitured Family Guy joke.

* [Shit fucking yeah!](http://webm.land/media/mG2f.webm)

* Viral: Can I kill him?

* Simon: Dont act like he isnt kinda hot.

* [Im just gonna end up making WebMs out of this entire episode, arent I?](http://a.pomf.se/umflml.mp4) He literally hit it so hard that he ripped a hole in space-time. Like, where do you go after that? Im sure this show will answer me, but Im not sure how.

* [Well, I guess that answers my mass-flooding question.](http://i.imgur.com/5RhbyBe.jpg) Id just think it would have started a lot sooner.

* [ARE YOU SHITTING FUCKING ME WITH THIS FUCK?!](http://i.imgur.com/aJvezPO.jpg) The *MOON* is a fucking gunman?! What the fuck?! What the fuck?! What the fuck?! I mean I guess it helps explain how they were able to make it fall out of orbit, but what the fuck?!

* I guess that *really* makes the moon a satellite. EheheheheheheOw.

* So, I guess that one kind of backfired on ya, Lordgenome. Unless they planned on just smashing Mars into the Earth.

* Viral: Spiral King!

* Lordgenome: Viral

* Viral: Spiral King?

* Lordgenome: Viral.

* Viral: Spiral King.

* Lordgenome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xda64LfVOjQ

* From the size of the hole, Id say itll take a Giga-Core Drill. Coming from you, Leeron, Im not going to argue that.

* [The way they just pop up like fucking Ashley in Resident Evil IV is fucking hilarious.](http://a.pomf.se/dyyhwu.mp4)

* I just realized something I TOTALLY FUCKING WASTED MY STAR WARS REFERENCE EPISODES AGO! FUCK! Wait! I can still save it! At least this time, the clear pathway to the center of the enormous fucking space station is a *good* thing for the guys who made it.

* [You know what, Rossiu?](http://a.pomf.se/trrwdp.mp4) I can actually understand that. If only you had been that rational and regretful for the past six episodes, I wouldnt have hated you as much. My biggest problem was really that he just seemed to have little to no qualms making the hard decisions. Yeah, you could see his hands shake when he was forced to leave those people behind, but he seemed to be itching to sentence Simon to death. That and he didnt stop for a second to think that the Anti-Spiral may not be totally cool with hundreds of thousands of people just escaping like that. Not exactly the type of guy Id elect as leader.

* [Okay, thats just fucking cheating.](http://i.imgur.com/VHEuLI4.jpg)

* You gotta give these Anti-Spirals credit. They really plan ahead when it comes to making people suffer.

* Okay, I gotta ask, why dont they just try brushing her out of the way? Like, that teleporting thing she does seems to take a few seconds. Why not just flick her with the other arm, then insert the drill before she can teleport back into the way? Eh, who cares? Weve got monologues to shout!

* [For some reason, this line cracks me up.](http://a.pomf.se/chwnuv.mp4)

* Okay, I admit it. [This scene](http://a.pomf.se/hkylta.mp4) had me wheezily chuckling in relief. Idiot, I know that from the number of episodes left that he must have convinced her. But for some reason its still extremely cathartic. These guys really *did* make Kill la Kill.

* [I wonder, how *did* Lordgenome manage to cover that entire thing in space rock?](http://i.imgur.com/gfTrsnT.jpg)

* So, uh Remember a while back when I said I was hoping this show would have mechas the size of Hawaii? [I guess I got my wish.](http://i.imgur.com/VWaspiA.jpg)

* For these Anti-Spiral guys hating Spiral Energy so much, they sure seem to have no problem using a fuckload of any other type of energy to stop it.

* [This guy definitely knows what show hes in.](http://a.pomf.se/iepnua.mp4)

* Also, [this face.](http://i.imgur.com/9a4vNu2.jpg)

* [Can never again become human, huh?](http://a.pomf.se/cfiyzq.mp4) Eh, so I was off by two episodes in my prediction. Still, not too shoddy.

* On a side note, Im sure someone is going to tell me at some point how grating Nias English voice is in comparison to her Japanese one. Im sorry, okay! Dubs make focusing on the action easier!

* [Glad he finally recognizes who (the hell) the real top-dog is.](http://a.pomf.se/jiokgd.mp4)

* The lunar impact has been averted. The ship will return to the Earths surface momentarily, where I am sure we will be greeted by masses of joyful and exuberant people, who in no way are upset that they got left behind to die.

* Oh, and /u/franklyn26? Remember how you were asking how in the hell they would get to the moon in episode six? Teeheehee.

* [Is it just me or does the Arc-Gurren look a lot smaller than it used to?](http://i.imgur.com/cQ33jVL.jpg)

* I really like this ED.

The next episode preview, and the fact the Simon is narrating it, is getting me super excited. This is gonna be fun.

**Kittan:** So we're gonna go fuck up that moon right?

**Simon:** Your god damn right!

My SO walkes in on the start of episode 22. *"So they killed the bad guys with bro magic?"*

"Yes."

*"Kay, I'm going to bed."*

I actually cried with how awesome episode 22 was.

Between Simon and Viral becoming besties, and immediately destroying an armada of invulnerable multi-dimensional beings with the mere presence of their epic bro-ness, the reunion of Team Dai-Gurren, Arc-Gurren's transformation, punching an anti-spiral boss ***OUT OF THE UNIVERSE***, and assuming control of the fucking moon, which also happens to be an awesome spaceship... And that spit second where real Nia breaks through, yeah, I cried again. You guys watching the dub missed out on that one.

Gurren Lagann is better than Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
Its not. kill la kill has better more entertaining characters and better plot. There you have it
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't like it after Kamina died and lost interest in Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
You lost your way
>> ARTICLE
For me I found that whichever one I was watching at the time was better. While watching one show, the amount of hype and awesomeness overshadows the memory of the other, but the same thing happens both ways. 

Gurren Lagann is on a larger scale than Kill la Kill for sure, and it really wins in overall quality (most likely due to Trigger not having as much of a budget as Gainax), but in terms of story quality and hype I put them about equal. 
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't be any more true. I mean, when it comes to scale, NOTHING beats Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
You're crossing lines.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so sorry /u/The-Sublimer-One, but /u/angel10701 is right.
>> ARTICLE
I love you.

YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME!!! ^I ^don't ^really ^mind. ^It's ^just ^fun ^to ^yell.
>> ARTICLE
Finish out TTGL first. It may be tough for you to say it's better than KlK because you watched KlK first. That's completely understandable, but I think you'll at least be able to see why so many others would say Gurren Lagann is a better show.

Both are fantastic, and to be honest, I hate comparing shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say KlK is better at its pacing for the entirety of the series (every single episode just kept building up to the final showdown, and the only characters I hated were the ones I was supposed to hate), but TTGL is better at delivering on its hype.
>> ARTICLE
I like that all these people are salty but you can't compare Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zjo573zlk) explains why you can't compare the two. **SPOILERS OFC**
>> ARTICLE
Gah, the mispronunciations and misuse of "penultimate" grate horribly.

Otherwise, good video.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that was a really solid video.

I'm keeping my opinion, but for what it's worth, KLK is by no means bad.
>> ARTICLE
Wow this was a great video, and here I was sitting enjoying the action of KLK and TTGL and thinking that the whole point of these shows was only being fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always surprised with how in depth both these series are. Mostly Gurren Lagann, when I first watched it I also thought it was just to be over-the-top but there was actually a whole lot more behind the scenes. That's why I'm doing **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"** because of how much trivia and stuff there is to know in Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
Are we going to have the final episode have its own discussion? It'll be really hard for ~~the first timers~~ everyone to hold back and not watch it but I think it deserves its own discussion
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It deserves to have the last episode be in only one thread.
>> ARTICLE
This is a fact and anyone that tries to dispute it is wrong.

KLK was great, but it was juuuuuust missing something that made TTGL truly memorable and an anime that will stand the test of time.

People might remember KLK, but people will be watching and rewatching TTGL for years to come.
>> ARTICLE
I will stand up and dispute this so called 'fact'! If that is wrong, I don't want to be right!

In all seriousness I rate the two shows about equal (and by equal I mean both totally awesome). But I can't deny that Gurren Lagann had better overall technical quality which just gives it the edge. I don't think it's indisputable though. 

I also really like to contrast the difference in leadership style between Kamina and Satsuki, both extremely charismatic in totally opposite ways, and both of which carried their groups at times through sheer determination
>> ARTICLE
This man...

This man is me.
>> ARTICLE
muh nigga
>> ARTICLE
That needs to be said?
>> ARTICLE
Now, yes. Then, no.
>> ARTICLE
this is a true statement even if you replace "kill la kill" with any other anime ever created.
>> ARTICLE
That's a fact. And Trigger is like Gainax except they skipped the part where they actually made some of the most awesome shit ever. People call Gainax and Trigger the same studio all the time for some reason but Trigger is like a hollow shell of what Gainax used to be. That seems to be a bit of an unpopular opinion on this sub though.

That said, Little Witch Academia is fucking awesome. We can all thank Trigger for that.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 21: In which Yoko appeals to a whole different set of fetishes. 

I really do love the first half of this episode. It's so fucking cute, and the lightheartedness is a desperately needed break from the tension ever since the timeskip. It's a reminder of what everyone is fighting for, and Yoko is so very awesome in it. 

And then, of course, there's the big development that most watchers saw coming, of Viral finally joining the team and piloting Gurren. 

I do find it endlessly amusing that the 'that' to which Simon refers in "Let's do 'that'!" is apparently just... posing awesomely and saying their catchphrase together. And it *works.*

Episode 22: In which they punch an enemy so hard that it breaks the universe.

A fun climax to the arc. Awesome battle scenes, they break the universe (pierce the heavens hurr hurr) with an awesome punch, Gurren Lagann gets even bigger. The moon is a giant Gunmen, the big reveal comes that Nia's original personality has been present this whole time, and there's an epic moment of faith. 

Rossiu keeps on making the hard choices that need to be made, and it's hard to argue with his choice to pull Arc Gurren Lagann back in that particular context, but once more he's outclassed by simon because he's in a universe that fundamentally does not run on logic.

However, it's worth noting that again, Simon wins by dumb luck: If the moon hadn't really been the Cathedral Terra but instead a big round rock like the *real* moon is, they couldn't have stopped it. Simon's way alone wouldn't have worked.

Of course, you could argue that part of spiral power IS being lucky, so. 

Anyway, this concludes Rossiu's arc! We get one transition episode tomorrow as a breather, and then we're off to the final arc of the series, and boy is it a fucking doozy. 
>> ARTICLE
> he lightheartedness is a desperately needed break from the tension ever since the timeskip.

Yeah I really appreciated it. Was even happier that nothing bad happened to any of them! 
>> ARTICLE
Two amazing episodes!

A lot of background for what was going on with [Yoko during the gap](http://i.imgur.com/HsU86Ep.jpg), and a return to the [over the top action](http://i.imgur.com/fUouV8Y.jpg) we all missed already.

Also Simon finally has an [equally spirited bro](http://i.imgur.com/bzcOkfM.jpg) fighting alongside him, and it turns out there might be [hope for best girl](http://i.imgur.com/GHkj6Ln.jpg)!

Ready for Sexy-Sensei Yoko?
Although she is wearing more than ever in episode 21

**Episode 21**
---

Fucking YES everything is back on track now, no fucking politics no betrayal and questions of morality. We are fucking back at Team Gurren being badass. AND NOW IT IS FUCKING TIME TO KICK THE ASS OF THESE FUCKING ANTI-SPIRALS AND SAVE NIA... after stopping the moon of course.

And Viral just fitted right in Team Gurren he even immediately picked up the epic speeches only a Gurren pilot could do.


**Episode 22**
---

I'm so happy that Gurren Lagann is back to its roots...
And in that what we saw this episode is in my opinion the biggest strength of TTGL how the scale of everything is exponential growing, I mean first episode our heroes saw the surface for the first time and now they have the fucking moon as a battleship. But wait there's more in the last episodes look forward to it :)


>> ARTICLE
Lucky hit with the 2 episode format, waiting after the episode 21 announcement of asskicking would have made me binge the complete rest. 

This is the point when the rollercoaster totally goes off the rails
>> ARTICLE
I would make the argument that you lose something by episode 23 not being the last of a pair of episodes. But that's mostly because I've already seen it.

If we a pair of episodes did end at 23 most of the newcomers would binge the rest of the show because of how it ends.

Episode 21:

	No fuck what did you think would happen they were just going to let you leave.

	Man this kid is jelly as fuck.

	Yomako, ya alright.

	When did this turn into a SOL featuring Yoko.

	I have no idea what is even happening right now.

	How the fuck did they even get that bag up there.

	How in the world are they seeing this.

	I really could care less about this episode.

	Oh hey Gun-men.

	I care a tiny bit more not but it still is filler.

	Why the fuck would you wear that under just get some fucking underwear.

	[Hypocrite!]( http://i.imgur.com/xEXHM8f.jpg)

	Right? Shes such a bitch Kittan.

	Saving your bitch ass.

	[ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA?]( http://i.imgur.com/r2UhLME.jpg)

	MASTER YOUR ALIVE! PRAISE OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR BOOTA!

	[ya but if you blow up the moon life is still fucked either way.]( http://i.imgur.com/KuCXl5g.jpg)

	This ep was saved by the appearance of Boost and Gimmy/Darry.

	FUCK OFF! WHY MUST YOU RUIN EVERYTHING?

	Do they plan to merge with everyone?


Episode 22:

	[I just realized I either missed the title card from ep 21 or it did not exist]( http://i.imgur.com/tgWrApm.png)
	[Of all the shit to be worried about this is the last.]( http://i.imgur.com/6E1xbXl.jpg)
	[Being a butthole.]( http://i.imgur.com/fMYD7FV.png)
	Oh as long as its not a order your fine with it.
	Was that a spirit bomb?
	Nigga fainted.
	You arent going anywhere.
	[I...I just. Nope Im not even going to try do whatever you want I dont give a fuck.]( http://i.imgur.com/sbJYIUH.jpg)
	[NO!]( http://i.imgur.com/7zWxDpm.jpg)
	[Perfectly normal thing to happen.]( http://i.imgur.com/RrIdvyD.jpg)
	So where is Nia in all of this mess?
	 [I always assumed our moon was a fucking demon as well.]( http://i.imgur.com/couK4Dd.jpg)]
	Good luck you two I know you can do it.
	Of course you would get in the way now.
	 This still means you have no moon and will all die.
Man I really did not write a lot during either of these eps the first one because it was filler and this one because I was just watching without thinking much.

After they released [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O0okV1mu4Y) (NSFW), people were really hoping for a Yoko spin-off, but it never came.
>> ARTICLE
Some of that was actually really interesting, sad to hear it's not a thing
>> ARTICLE
I totally don't agree that the first half of 21 is filler. Not only does it give us insight into what Yoko's been up to, it also provides A.) a breather from all the tension and stress of the past few episodes, and B.) a reminder of what's at stake. The only civilians we've seen other than like Kittan's sisters have been the ingrates in Kamina City who, for obvious reasons, people aren't fond of. The cute kids who've never known a life without a sky are a plot reminder of why Team Gurren has to win.

Im super happy I dont have to wait till tomorrow for the next episode. Disappointed in the lack of montages, though


**EPISODE 14**  

* Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/VUKuY7U.png) a grave for Kamina? Ugh, [I hate this shit](http://i.imgur.com/wcvLh3Z.png). I better find out what it was she said soon. But I guess Ill forget it before the episode ends, so I dont really care

* So [this](http://i.imgur.com/gwVW4f0.png) guy *is* God in this anime? Hes [kind of mean](http://i.imgur.com/9BFz7Ga.png)

* [It can fly!](http://i.imgur.com/omQAJwf.png) Thats super!! *But can it survive outer space?*

* Hahah, [this](http://i.imgur.com/EhOJGsU.png) is great

* Were they able to [replicate the glowing orbs technology](http://i.imgur.com/QKjMbUf.png)? Or is this one of those things that I should ignore?

* [Good for them!](http://i.imgur.com/4zD707G.png)

* [DRILL ROCKETS!](http://i.imgur.com/A69a2Ds.png)

* [This poor guy](http://i.imgur.com/FFFTYl3.png) lives for the sake of us pitying and laughing at him. Damn, hes doing alright, though

* Is it too early to want Viral to come and save them?

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/BAROquy.png) is great. [Really, it is](http://i.imgur.com/eyex1bL.png). But I just want Viral to save the day

* Ohhhh, I just heard the Row, Row, Fight the Power thing (or is it powa? I dont know why, but I feel a bit embarrassed writing that out). I didnt know it was a background song

* [You know](http://i.imgur.com/M7xRoGS.png), just because you have the word death, doesnt make that name threatening. Like, at all

* Aw man, we just [met that dude](http://i.imgur.com/b8Ki0Lb.png). No, [that](http://i.imgur.com/XQVXuRY.png) definitely seems like a stupid idea. [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/DFSqZyO.png)

I was live-blogging (well, sort of, mostly like this) my first run through TTGL on an old forum I hung out in. People kept posting the "Do the impossible / see the invisible" quartet, but I totally missed it in the background of this episode.

The first time I noticed those lyrics was during the very beginning of a certain scene where we first hear LMFH. It blew my fucking mind.

Episode 13

* This is the story of a man who we really should name so as to not confuse people about who were talking about.

* [Nia:](http://i.imgur.com/q68OZme.jpg) I knew it; I look like a loli, dont I?

* Simon: No! Well, yes, but that will just help boost our ratings!

* Nia: I want to be put to work!

* Simon: Oh, I can think of some things you work on Heres a rag. Now, go swab the engine room. (Ya pervs.)

* [Yoko is like my mom during high school.](http://i.imgur.com/Qp5cKtL.jpg) Always, You have to eat; its vitally important. You know what else is important? Us being able to pay the bills.

* Shes gonna accidentally poison them all, isnt she?

* Rossiu: I told you bastards when you put me in here I could relieve that pent up stress if you would just leave me alone for five minutes.

* He got sick from eating Nias cooking, didnt he?

* [How the hell is that hat staying on his head?](http://i.imgur.com/mdWTOXw.jpg) And what is that blue-haired guy doing stealing Kaminas glasses style?

* I feel like [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/NcBMPJQ.jpg) is missing something [Oh, yeah!](http://webm.land/media/zGX3.webm)

* [Im a little confused here.](http://i.imgur.com/UvxkGup.jpg) Is seeing Kaminas image giving her bad memories or something?

* [Boota:](http://webm.land/media/mSEt.webm) Oh, Im not trying to give you courage or anything. I just wanted to spend some more time in that sweet, sweet cleavage.

* [Has she always had fangs?](http://i.imgur.com/2JbIKIW.jpg)

* Maybe now would be a good time for Lagann to combine with Dia-Gurren again.

* [Shots like this](http://i.imgur.com/Q4XDGuu.jpg) are what you guys meant when you said episode 13 just completely gave up on physics, right?

* [WHOOOOO!](http://webm.land/media/WmAk.webm) Finally, they combined with something else! Took them long enough.

* [Where the hell were you guys?](http://i.imgur.com/MMA8qsQ.jpg)

* Dont you mean the Dia-Counterattack?

* Viral *really* likes to hear himself talk.

* Havent mastered flying yet? How have you not yet realized that the levers themselves dont do jack shit?

* [He even has his own disco hall.](http://i.imgur.com/4DGTu5f.jpg)

* Probably the only slightly good thing to come from Kamina dying is being able to tell Viral what a fucking pathetic loser he is.

* Simon: Did you know that Kamina did not in fact survive that initial impalement only to succumb to his injuries, but instead actually died, willed himself back to life, then decided he was done living anyway? Because hes that awesome.

* Simon trying to make himself the star of a harem anime what with all the girls hes rescuing.

* [Thats why youre never supposed to bring someone with a personal vendetta on board.](http://i.imgur.com/5XhZmvV.jpg) Theyll care way more about getting vengeance than actually completing the mission.

* [Leeron can make anything a double-entendre, cant he?](http://webm.land/media/7OcK.webm)

* Can Viral just defect and join their side already? This is really getting dragged out.

* Ive never got the whole playing dirty threat. Who cares how it gets done as long as it gets done? You plan on killing them all anyway.

* [Theyre fucking turning in mid-air.](http://webm.land/media/7lwC.webm) This show is incredible in every possible way.

* I dont know if shes serious about Boota protecting her, but Im just gonna assume she is, because thats funnier.

* [Ive always wondered where the cameras are on these things to broadcast the feed onto the monitors.](http://i.imgur.com/Ul9Mu9d.jpg)

* Yoko: Simon did you know Did you know I kinda had a thing for Kamina?

* Simon: How could a person not? You blushed every time someone just said his name.

* [Where did she get those flowers from, her eyes?](http://i.imgur.com/fpye1f0.jpg)

* Leeron really likes flowers.

* [Ha, called it.](http://webm.land/media/2Qab.webm)

* [Either she made that specifically for his (and Bootas) taste preference, or hes just ridiculously polite.](http://i.imgur.com/TkgtSfH.jpg)

* [I wonder how much those spirals irritate his corneas.](http://i.imgur.com/y2oYhK4.jpg)

About Yoko being hesitant to get inside Gurren, It's probably because she'd be sitting in the exact place Kamina was when he died. Wouldn't you get nervous if you had to use something that belonged to a person you liked who was now dead?

Episode 14

* [Fucking times skips, again.](http://i.imgur.com/ja9mZsm.png)

* [Yoko:](http://i.imgur.com/hfOT0uv.jpg) You think we could have set up this memorial in a place where there isnt the possibility of the wind blowing his cape away?

* Simon: No! It wouldnt have looked cool enough while we were walking away from it!

* [Sure, its impressive, but its not very structurally sound.](http://i.imgur.com/MtKYY48.jpg)

* Okay, theyre referencing the Bible, so this planet 100% definitely Earth, in case anyone had any doubts. Unless this is some other planet whose Ancient Holy Scriptures happen to include God creating the world in seven days, and man on the sixth.

* Only 200 years Well, he is a tortoise.

* Why bother sealing them underground instead of just killing them all? Youve shown that youre not exactly the merciful type.

* The Power of the Spiral will ultimately lead to their doom? Someones been watching too much Psycho-Pass, having adopted the idea that too much freedom equals destruction. (Seriously, fuck the Sybil System.)

* Why havent they just adopted the strategy that whenever theyre attacked to have Lagann just combine with whatever the biggest gunmen in the fleet is?

* [Bitch, did you just dare use Kamina/Simons catchphrase?](http://webm.land/media/Idj4.webm)

* [Kiyoh dont give a fuck.](http://i.imgur.com/1VyHKlZ.jpg)

* [Im getting Power Rangers flashbacks.](http://i.imgur.com/trc4MuG.jpg)

* [Thats terrifying.](http://i.imgur.com/eqNIj4x.jpg)

I wonder how his love for  Lelouch will affect his opinion of certain characters in the second half.

And I'm still curious about your feelings on Lelouch affecting your opinion of certain characters in the second half.

I think after watching Code Geass I'll be forced to change my thoughts a little bit about certain characters. We'll see. I'm still rewatching TTGL. I haven't skipped ahead entirely.

#NEW VIEWERS: EPISODE 16 IS A RECAP EPISODE. 

It is literally just footage from past episodes to remind you what happens in the first half of the series. Unless you seriously need a reminder of what's happened so far, only watch the last ~1:50 or so, because they have some cool storyboards / concept art of characters, scenes and so on. Also, you may be intrigued by the episode preview.....
>> ARTICLE
A semi-related question (well, just slightly, but I have no better place to ask). How much do the movies add for someone who have seen the anime few times? From what I understand they are basically 'condensed' version of the anime (like the [two](/s "no, there is no third one") Madoka movies). Do they have enough changed/new scenes to make it worth watching them?
>> ARTICLE
Not really. They change some stuff, re-animate scenes and the like. 

The second changes more stuff, especially towards the end. [Full series & Lagann-hen spoilers](/s "Unlike in the series, most of the team (Kid, Zorthy etc) survive; Kittan is the only one to die. The final battle also has a bunch more elements, with pretty much everyone getting their own Tengen Toppa mech and finally all combining into an even bigger Super TTGL. It's worth seeing at least once.")
>> ARTICLE
Heh, that sounds like exactly the type of story rewriting I dislike (Rebuild, I'm looking at you), though on smaller scale.

Well, then I'm in no hurry to watch it. I will still happily follow the rewatch until then, as I love reading people's reactions, especially first time watchers.

Which is good because it gives the newcomers a chance to process Episode 15 which is Fucking Incredible (title case necessary)

We're still including it in the rewatch though yeah?

I mean you can watch it, but there's no point. I'm not going to. It's literally just past episodes, no new information or anything until the last 2 minutes.

Alright. I typically don't watch it so, yeah, I probably won't. Appreciate the heads up. I'll watch the last couple minutes then

I saw TTGL 3 times already and am only following people comments, but you made me watch the last part of the recap episode (which I never watched before as I usually skip recaps) and I have to thank you for that. I had no idea those awesome concept arts were there!

Today's episodes were really fun, we got to see Gurren Lagann get an upgrade! and now things have been taken to the skies!. This post was hard to make because I did it on mobile today. Welcome to "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

- The "Song of the Episode" for episode 13 is ["Spinning Spinning Spinning Spinning Spin!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufm396xap0k&).

- For the "Song of the Episode" for episode 14 I'm gonna cheat a little and choose ["Rap is a Man's Soul"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYhzCVphiwA&) again because it's so awesome.

Today we've got 2 references, nothing special but I'll hope you appreciate them.

- "Banzai!": In episode 13, the [bombs](http://i.imgur.com/tQkOYAA.jpg) that are dropped on Dai-Gurren are [Banzai Bills](http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/2/2b/BanzaibillNSMBU.png/200px-BanzaibillNSMBU.png) from Super Mario Bros.

- "The King of Brave references": The new [wings](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130720080247/gurennlagann/images/0/00/Gurren_Lagann_Glenn_Wing.png) that Gurren Lagann obtained is similar to the wings of [GaoGaiGar](http://www.fanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GaoGaiGa.jpg), a really good mech anime from the 90s. The MC of GaoGaiGar is voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama, Viral's voice actor.

Damn is it getting hard to pick songs that haven't been heard yet or aren't better to pick later on. A lot got done in these 2 episodes, Guame and Cytomander were both taken down. Who else is super hyped to see more of that giant gunmen at the end of episode 14? Keep watching and I'll see you tomorrow for more "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

EDIT: Sorry the links didn't work out for some reason. I fixed them but I'll blame it on the fact that I posted this over mobile.
>> ARTICLE
So those guys *were* based on the Bullet Bills from Super Mario Bros???
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 13**

I do miss her hair as she looks more childish now but she pulls it off nicely, I'll get used to it quickly

Get rid of all the mechs, fight scenes and manliness and just leave those Simon and Nia moments and I would still be happy :3

Like seriously the other general is here already haha love the fast pacing but would not mind some more calmer episodes either

We get to see Yoko pilot?? 

Spider-man mech nice :p

Gurren is way too ~~OP~~ cool

Did not think that simon would be putting up such a good fight, nice to see

Viral showing some good qualities

Don't you dare fall for Simon Yoko...

Aweee was really hoping Nia would be good at cooking but figured it would be like this :(

But Simon liked it so that's all that mattters :)

**Episode 14**

One month later? Really? Did not see that coming.

Bachown died? He reminded of Kamina awe

All of them are just dying...lol thank you Nia and she's still head cook? These people are brave!

Of course it's a gunman lol everyhting is

So as a first time viewer apparently there's a recap episode coming up? Should I bother watching it?
>> ARTICLE
>Viral showing some good qualities

Viral *only* has good qualities

>> ARTICLE
> just leave those Simon and Nia moments and I would still be happy :3

> would not mind some more calmer episodes either

You just want a nice, easy going episode where Simon takes Nia out on a date. Though I'm not really sure where they would go since the Earth is rather barren. I'm sure Yoko would spy on them and try to break them up so she can snatch Simon for herself. As long as the night ends with Nia giving Simon a kiss, you'd be satisfied.
>> ARTICLE
> You just want a nice, easy going episode where Simon takes Nia out on a date. 

I need this.

> As long as the night ends with Nia giving Simon a kiss, you'd be satisfied.

Woah woah holding hands would be more then enough, they only just met :p
>> ARTICLE
Just a quick smooch on the cheek? Holding hands would be cute though.
>> ARTICLE
See now if I don't get a kiss on the cheek I'll be pretty disappointed... lol
>> ARTICLE
The recap episode is 16, after 15, which ends the first half of the series. You can watch 16 if you like for some cool concept art drawings of the characters at the end, but it is 100% skippable. 

You might be interested in what's shown in the next episode preview, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm alright then maybe I'll do a quick watch of it, depends on how 15 goes!

Thanks! :D
>> ARTICLE
13 + 14: Solid episodes! They're mainly building us up from one peak at episode 11 to the confrontation with Big Bad Lordgenome tomorrow. 

Notable developments: Viral learns he's been losing not to Kamina, but to Simon. Gurren Lagann, and later Dai-Gurren, get themselves flying devices. The world's most pointless cannon fodder die pointlessly. Cytomander is killed with Dayakka's epic pelvic thrust. And Viral is set to be exposed to the secrets of this world.

Incidentally, note the DNA symbolism with the Four Generals. Thymilph, Adiane, Cytomander, Guame. TA CG - the four bonded pairs of what make up DNA. And Lord*genome*. Hmmmmm.

These were some pretty good eps cant wait to see what happens with mah man Viral. Plus it looks like the fighting is about to get even more real.

Hey, what's the name of the soundtrack in episode 13 when Gurren Lagann incorporates the plane wings? It's played in previous episodes, too.
>> ARTICLE
The discussion finally caught to where my disgusting temptation left me off. It was hard to put off TTGL for a few days, but reading the discussion really is worth it. I don't remember much of episode 13 besides the last scene where Viral learns his birds and bees from King Spiral.

 I just finished 14 and the episode felt kinda meh to me. I felt like the whole battle could've been two episodes with more fight scenes or something but that's just me. After putting the site on hiatus for a few days, I totally forgot how much of a bad ass Simon became. I don't know if it's just the music with the final scene of the battle or Simon's many expression, but I always get the chills watching him utterly destroy the last gunman. Of course Nia is best girl.

To anyone still hanging around here who has seen TTGL, question, how can there still be like 20 episodes left? At the speed the plot seems to be moving i would have though that we had at most 5 left. Is it going to take 20 episodes just to take down the Spiral King?
>> ARTICLE
> To anyone still hanging around here who has seen TTGL, question, how can there still be like 20 episodes left?

So, there are 13 left... +1 with the recap, if I'm counting correctly? But really, to answer your question, have you seen Kill la Kill or InouBattle? They might give you hints...

Ah episode 13, Viral gets beat up and fails and we finally see Cytomander the Fabulous in action.

Episode 19

* Seriously, how long until Nias back to normal? Like, three episodes?

* Ah, quit your bitching and be glad you get a death as cool as the moon falling on you.

* [You know he could just pop his arms off if he wanted to.](http://i.imgur.com/CEPrkfZ.jpg)

* Why are they giving them a three-week grace period, again? If the Anti-Spiral has all this power, youd think they could just slam the moon into the Earth in like three hours.

* [Are these motherfuckers seriously?](http://i.imgur.com/AOZg3Xq.jpg) Hey, does anyone know if the Anti-Spiral is hiring? Ill be the bagel boy if I have to be.

* Please, wait here until it is time for your trial. Im sure Jesus was told something similar during his trial.

* [LET ME AT HIM!](http://webm.land/media/QmRk.webm) ILL KILL HIM! ILL KILL HIM! ILL TEAR HIS FUCKING PONYTAIL OFF AND STRANGLE HIM WITH IT! FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU! YOU SON OF A BITCH YOU DESERVED YOUR MOM DYING YOU FUCKING FUCKER FUCK! **FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!** YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ANTI-SPIRAL CAUSE ILL THROW YOUR ASS INTO THE MOON MYSELF! ***FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU!!!!!!!!!!!*** AND I THOUGHT NINA WAS BAD!

* [YES!](http://webm.land/media/HASZ.webm) GET BURNED YOU HYPOCRITICAL FUCK!

* In case I havent made it clear yet, I really fucking hate Rossiu as of now. And anyone who supports him. Sorry, Kittan, but your brunette sisters gotta go.

* Rossiu may have common sense, but hes so cold hearted. I really cannot stand that guy. On the plus-side, your youngest sister gets a full pass.

* What the hell do these rioters hope to accomplish by killing Simon? Losing the one guy who can pilot Lagann? Yeah, yeah, I know they arent thinking rationally, but come on.

* [Leeron knows how to deal with this bratty, little shit.](http://webm.land/media/EUnV.webm)

* Weve already talked about the dub unnecessarily changing his name to Artenborough, so lets move on.

* [Poor guy. If only that werent so hilarious.](http://i.imgur.com/9dS06Qt.jpg)

* Wait, what?! There are 36 underground villages that can withstand the moonthe fucking *moon*crashing into the Earth? What?! The moon is one-sixth the size of Earth itself. Something that size crashing into our planet would be enough to completely fuck up its orbit. And even then, the Anti-Spiral would still show up to finish off anyone who was left. Fucking idiots.

* Its so annoying how characters will sometimes spout off exposition like the people theyre talking to are blind, deaf, and dumb, but when it comes to the big stuff, mice make more noise.

* [This is what happens when you choose not to save the Council.](http://i.imgur.com/GMTdpBz.jpg) (Not like it makes much of a difference, anyway)

* The asshole is flat-out admitting that he rigged the whole thing just to try to win the publics favor. I dont give a shit what this guy is telling himself to rationalize this, or if he tries to make amends for it later. Im hoping the Anti-Spiral shoves a giant, molten laser beam up his nose, while they make his two lackeys watch, then do the same thing to them.

* I still dont fucking get how they expect going underground will work. Theyre just in fucking denial. I also dont give a shit what secret plan Lordgenome had hidden. He told you that they *lost* to the Anti-Spiral before, and that was with multiple races from multiple planets fighting it. You dumbasses are more fucked than Panty after a night on the town.

* [Sup, bitches?](http://i.imgur.com/O40RYZE.jpg) Heard you lower lifeforms were staging a coup, so I thought Id come and remind you how pointless your lives are.

* I still cant get over Mugann. Its like naming a soldier Private Donut.

* [Oh, hells yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/alpOMs5.jpg) Its gonna be fun watching you pretentious dicks get your asses handed to you.

* If you try anything funny, anything at all, I will not hesitate to hit the switch. 1. He could easily just separate. 2. Go ahead and do it. No one that I care about is gonna miss you besides maybe Kittan, but hell get over it.

* I wouldnt be surprised if Rossiu is fucking some other bitch on the side and is hoping he can take care of two problems at once.

* Have I mentioned that I really fucking hate Rossiu? Like, this must be how /u/EditorialComplex feels about Lelouch, but Lelouch at least had the decency to take responsibility for his own actions in the end. Rossiu is just pushing all the blame onto Simon first chance he gets.

> WHY DO THEY THINK LEAVING THE PLANET WOULD WORK?! Its over! Youve been chosen for extinction! The Anti-Spiral wont give a shit where you are, as long as your species still fucking exists!

This cannot be emphasized enough. For everyone saying that Rossiu is just being sensible and trying to save as many as he can, this is the counterpoint. If the anti-spirals are all-knowing enough to count your exact population and powerful enough to drop the moon on you, you think they're going to just let you fly off and escape? Clearly even if you fly off they're going to hunt you down and kill you. 

And what's the only thing that's consistently been able pull off seemingly impossible odds against superior forces? Simon and Gurren Lagann of course. So what do you do to them? Obviously imprison one and discard the other, yeah that makes sense. 

Getting rid of your most powerful and reliable leader and soldier while a superior enemy is attacking is the most ridiculously illogical thing anyone could think of. And what are they sacrificing him for - to mollify some disgruntled civilians? Who cares if without Simon's help EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY!!!

Anyway I kinda dislike how Rossiu's actions are seen to be cold and logical as compared to Simon's emotion and passion, when really what he does is shortsighted at best and just plain idiotic sometimes.

>Have I mentioned that I really fucking hate Rossiu? Like, this must be how /u/EditorialComplex feels about Lelouch, but Lelouch at least had the decency to take responsibility for his own actions in the end. Rossiu is just pushing all the blame onto Simon first chance he gets.

This just isn't true. What Rossiu accuses Simon of - recklessly endangering the populace, triggering the Human Annihilation System - is *true*. Now, obviously he's trumping up the charges and clearly going beyond what's necessary, which is a dick move.

But think about it from Rossiu's perspective for a bit. Episode 19's title is "We will survive by any means necessary," and that's exactly what he's trying to do. Rossiu, right now, is trying to make sure that *humanity won't go extinct* no matter what he has to do. From a coldly rational perspective, isn't sacrificing a single person in order to quell public disorder *so that he can put his plan to save people into motion* worth it? And past that, he's clearly taking responsibility for these actions, and it's clearly weighing on him.

Lelouch's motivations were not nearly as altruistic, and the depths to which he sinks are much, much lower than Rossiu's. Like I said last time, when Rossiu starts turning people into mindless slaves who follow his every command, then you can start comparing them.
>> ARTICLE
> recklessly endangering the populace, triggering the Human Annihilation System

When did he "recklessly endanger the populace"? He fought the Mugann above their capital, and did everything he could to stop it from unleashing further destruction. The Mugann's target was clearly the city itself, so drawing it away wouldn't work; the only option was to kill it as quickly as possible, which is what he did. The fact that it was rigged to explode wasn't something anyone could have predicted

As for the Annihilation System, pinning that on Simon is completely unreasonable.

>Rossiu, right now, is trying to make sure that humanity won't go extinct no matter what he has to do

Does he think the anti-spirals will just give up when they're floating in space? These things *came* from space, and they want humanity dead. What makes him thing the fight will end once they're off-planet?

> Lelouch's motivations were not nearly as altruistic, and the depths to which he sinks are much, much lower than Rossiu's

I disagree, for reasons that I'm sure have already been addressed in the countless Code Geass discussion thread arguments.

The fact that it was rigged to explode wasn't something anyone could have predicted

But what about when he fought the pair afterwards, above the city, knowing that they would explode? What if the Mugann debris hadn't been affected by Grapearl gunfire? He took a *huge* risk there.

>Does he think the anti-spirals will just give up when they're floating in space? These things came from space, and they want humanity dead. What makes him thing the fight will end once they're off-planet?

The Antispirals let humanity survive once before, after directly challenging them. For all Rossiu knows, the Annihilation System is completely automated, and after the moon falls that'll be the end of it. If they go back underneath the HAS detection threshold, they'll have a few generations to figure something else out. 
>> ARTICLE

I never got that argument. Isn't that the whole idea behind the show? That Lelouch has the power of complete obedience? Of course he'll use it to further his cause.
>> ARTICLE
Well, not just the idea of Geass, but [CG R2](/s "Specifically, turning people (who otherwise hadn't done any wrong, like the rather-kind-seeming Odysseus) into thought slaves, 'become my slaves' and all. That's a HUGE moral event horizon, and Rossiu never even comes close to it.")

>> ARTICLE
Oh god, it's the Geass threads all over again. Fun times. How I miss them.

I'm not trying to defend Lelouch or Rossiu, just throwing some stuff out there, cause why not?

So yes, on Lelouch...

> the depths to which he sinks are much, much lower than Rossiu's.

And you're right. [very slight CG spoilers](/s "Lelouch does terrible things, but he's not in the same situation as Rossiu. Lelouch went out and created a bunch of trouble himself, but Rossiu is having the trouble thrown at him unwillingly.")

> when Rossiu starts turning people into mindless slaves who follow his every command, 

Rossiu doesn't have Geass. He can't sink that low. [Code Geass spoilers](/s "Even in Code Geass, barely anyone had the power. It's something entirely foreign to human beings. But for the few who do have it, it becomes a part of them. It gives them an advantage over all other humans. And the thing is, those who had Geass were all, how should I put it, idk, naturally gifted? They were already a step above their peers and Geass lifted them higher. If they had such an incredible power, why wouldn't they use it? It would be stupid not to.")

Even so far we see Rossiu trying to do what's right. Not everyone has the capacity to make decisions like he does, so it's hard to understand that he's not being full blown evil.
>> ARTICLE
I don't disagree with anything you've said. 
>> ARTICLE
And to add to what /r/Neawia said, [CG](/s "remember that Lelouch was purposefully trying to go past a moral horizon. He needed people to despise him with every fiber of their beings, or the Zero Requiem wouldn't have worked. Judging from how you see him, I'd say he succeeded.")
>> ARTICLE
That's a very interesting point. Quite right. By that point [CG](/s "he had to be a supreme jackass for his plan to work.")

Nice.

[CG](/s "Well, sure, after a point that was the plan. But that doesn't change all the morally questionable stuff he'd done before he decided on the Zero Requiem. Even just comparing R1 Lelouch to Rossiu, Rossiu is still holding the moral high ground. Rossiu betrays Simon, but Lelouch betrays the rest of the Black Knights to go after Nunnally.")
>> ARTICLE
[CG](/s "Is quantity the only thing that matters though? I see what you're saying, but to me, I don't give a fuck about most of the Black Knights. Consequently I don't care at all if they're betrayed. Betraying Simon is a much worse crime in my opinion. I guess it's just a different way of looking at anime. There are usually about a dozen or so characters I care about in any given anime and they're worth more to me than the other 7 billion people.")
>> ARTICLE
[CG](/s "Sure, subjectively speaking if you like the characters beying betrayed more. But speaking objectively, Lelouch abandons a group fighting desperately against a brutal imperial regime in the hour of their greatest need, for purely selfish reasons. That's way worse than Rossiu's necessary evil in the hopes that he'll be able to save all of humanity.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on that one. Lelouch was a fucking selfish idiot in that scene, and he lost a lot of respect from the Black Knights for it. The guy just couldn't control his emotions, and that cost him dearly.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. Rossiu defaults to the most painful option possible, without considering other possibilities. It's his tragic flaw as a character. 

He inflicts unnecessary suffering in order to secure a pittance of survival, as he was trained to do growing up. Furthermore, it's his arrogance to think that he is the only one who can save what's left of humanity that leads him to continually fail. He says that it's a leader's job to make the hard decisions, when the correct decision in that circumstance is to fight (since it marginally increases the current zero odds of survival).

Masochistic hubris is adult Rossiu in a nutshell. He never left the cave, because he learned to love the suffering.
>> ARTICLE
Fighting is completely *not* the correct decision in any rational world. Fighting wagers it on an "all or nothing" chance. Either the team beats the Anti Spirals and the day is saved, or they lose and without any other preparations, they lose everything. Rossiu takes the logical route, which is to get an (as close to) guaranteed chance at survival for *some* rather than taking a very poor bet.

Like, look at the decisions Rossiu makes. His first plan, with the Arc Gurren and the 36 shelters, is hardly the "most painful option". Had the moon not had the mass it does, this would have been a perfect solution with the only misstep being what he did to Simon to initially restore order.

His next hard choice is when he's faced with the moon destroying anyone who stay behind. He can't change that. And he can't load them all on to the Arc Gurren. So he again, makes the sensible choice of taking who he can, while also providing for food + repopulation of animals after the impact. His third hard choice is to take off ahead of schedule when the Mugann attack. (Remember, this attack was ahead of schedule because Attenborough started the Arc Gurren way before he was supposed to.). The shield lasted for 30 minutes, and so that was the maximum amount of time he could buy to load people.

Each of those choices, on its own, is a completely rational and sensible one. What was he going to do, fight the Mugann with 180k people on board the Arc Gurren? If they lose, humanity is done. 

[Tomorrow's episodes spoilers](/s "Remember, even WITH Simon and Arc Gurren Lagann and the rest of Team Gurren helping, they only win by a stroke of fortune, that the moon is actually Cathedral Terra and can thus be controlled. Had it just been, you know, a normal moon? Simon's way would completely have failed. Again, in tomorrow's episode, Rossiu makes another perfectly rational decision with his mindset: We'll spend all the time we can helping Simon, but we will get out of the way of the moon if it's not fixed in time.")
>> ARTICLE
The problem with this whole argument was basically summed up by what /u/The-Sublimer-One said, i.e. 

> WHY DO THEY THINK LEAVING THE PLANET WOULD WORK?! Its over! Youve been chosen for extinction! The Anti-Spiral wont give a shit where you are, as long as your species still fucking exists!

If the Anti-Spirals are knowledgeable enough to count their population and powerful enough to bring the moon down on them, surely they're not gonna let you just fly away from this. Given that, removing your most powerful soldier and leader while the war is going on is the dumbest thing you could think of, and what does it gain? Maybe a slightly mollified population who gets something to blame? Certainly nothing that is worth losing Simon. 

Some of his cold decisions make sense, for example when he closes the doors and launches arc-gurren. The one that definitely doesn't make sense is imprisoning Simon and discarding Gurren-Lagann. At least keep him as a soldier to help protect the ship as it escapes. I can't emphasize more how dumb it is to try to get rid of him, it is absolutely shortsighted at best and arguably completely idiotic. As it is, this action almost causes the annihilation of the whole population, and many more could have been saved if Simon had been allowed to fight from the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
My problem with all of that is if simon hasn't gotten in the robot  then they would have lost all of humanity anyway.  They completely get rid of their strongest weapon and then expect that the anti spirals won't chase them down or have a contingency plan if they ever tried getting off the planet which they totally do. 

His choices may be 'logical' but he has to realize that they aren't in a 'logical' universe and that 'extermination' doesn't mean- we kill the planet and let some people go cause we as an advanced and thus far infinitely superior force can't tell if someone is trying to leave the planet

His plan makes sense and I can't fault him for that but the fact he constantly is trying to make logic work in a universe where thus far logic hasn't worked is the reason I can't like him for all his logical plans. 

Yes fighting is all or nothing but them trying to escape is just as all or nothing and that's what anyone should have realized when the anti spirals are saying they will exterminate them. 

[Spoiler](/s "I mean if they had moved out of the way of the moon the anti spirals would have hunted them down anyway and with most of their military then gone they would of just prolonged their death by a couple days or so. The only chance they actually had was Simon and those strong in spiral power")
>> ARTICLE
>His choices may be 'logical' but he has to realize that they aren't in a 'logical' universe and that 'extermination' doesn't mean- we kill the planet and let some people go cause we as an advanced and thus far infinitely superior force can't tell if someone is trying to leave the planet

Rossiu is a completely reasonable "real robot" leader. He's just in a super robot show.

And I'm not sure it is - we know the Antispirals let humanity live after Lordgenome and the rest lost the Spiral War. It's not completely unreasonable to have concluded that if they go back below the HAS trigger threshold that they'll get to survive. 
>> ARTICLE
And because he's in a super robot show his logic is basically fruitless a majority of the time.

We know that only worked because of what Lordgenome did to make sure the anti spirals wouldn't murder everything. I mean that's technically a spoiler in a way but they aren't going to give them another chance after they avoided their extermination plan to potentially survive again and become a threat again. 

[Movie spoilers] (/s "the anti spirals let Lordgenome go because he betrayed the spiral army and murdered most of them after the anti spiral showed him true despair and thus let him go back to keep the rest of the spiral race of humans in check; with the moon as a back up plan. The anti spirals this time were thwarted because their generosity backfired and their back up plan was utterly beaten.  They would not take a chance on them after that, it goes against what logic they work on.")
>> ARTICLE
But his plan to run away doesn't make sense in regards to the already observed abilities of the Anti-Spirals. We've already seen that they can quite literally appear out of holes in space. Apparently anywhere as well. Running away from an enemy that can appear out of the air anywhere any place isn't that smart of an idea.

I'm not actually trying to interject into this argument about the merits of optimism vs risking it all. Just wanted to gripe about the flawed premises of Rossius actions. Hell if he spent 30 seconds and asked his biological computer Lordgenom it would probably straight up tell him that the Anti-Spirals can teleport/appear out of the air anywhere in the universe.

Well, it's not bad, and if you take other dubs as comparison then it IS good. However I'm comparing it to the original, and really, hearing anyone other than Norio as Emperor is, well, disappointing to say the least. You really do miss that thunderous voice of his. Also I find Jun's work as Lelouch to be really awesome, especially the shifts between speaking as Lelouch and speaking as Zero.

So maybe I should change that statement. The dub isn't bad as far as dubs go, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original voice acting.

This is a good, but relatively slow section of the show. There's not much to be said about it, since it's straightforward and mostly easy to understand. I really do enjoy this little lull though.
>> ARTICLE

I thought it was said that they also wanted to be able to repopulate earth later with them (like with Noah's ark), but I might be mistaken.
>> ARTICLE

Bruce Ironstaunch! When this was airing, fans LEAPT on that guy, assuming it was supposed to be a 'fuck you' gesture and there's like. Way more art of him than there should be.

>Is he talking about Rossiu?? Leeron still thinks hes doing the right thing, yeah?

Yeah, he is. Rossiu, as you can see by this episode, is being increasingly destroyed by the actions he's taking. Leeron thinks he's probably taking the *sensible* course if nothing else.

>Criticise him however much you want to, I actually think hes more cut out for this than Simon

Rossiu, Dayakka and maybe Kittan are the only people who have any business being in government. You're not wrong.
>> ARTICLE
People don't criticize Rossiu for his plan when it comes to the Ark and making sure at least some of humanity survives. Where people tend to find issue is him arresting Simon and sending Gurren Lagann to the scrap heap, and then acting like there's nothing they can try to do to save everyone.
>> ARTICLE
> He sure did become cool

Like Kittan wasn't always cool.

Seriously though, that scene was great. He must think he's going to die. He's going up against some strange, new, powerful enemy with only a shotgun (even if it did have spiral powered shells). He's simply buying enough time for his sisters, neice, and Dayakka to get away. An excellent man.

I'd say they captured her whiny bitchiness perfectly. And I will never stop making them with sound. Mostly out of spite at this point.

Well, maybe, but damn is that voice annoying. For me she sounds like a character from some cheap cartoon. Dunno why, but almost all anime dubs I hear have this type of voice. You never hear something like that in a movie.

Hmm, so you just put a video on pomf.se and it's automatically converted to webm? That's handy..
>> ARTICLE
> For me she sounds like a character from some cheap cartoon.

That's kind of how I feel about all high-pitched girls in Japanese dubs. Maybe it's because I can't understand the language.

> Hmm, so you just put a video on pomf.se and it's automatically converted to webm? That's handy..

Yep.
>> ARTICLE
>That's kind of how I feel about all high-pitched girls in Japanese dubs. Maybe it's because I can't understand the language.

Well, problem is, for me she sounds much more high-pitched in dub than most anime characters I ever heard sound in original. ([here](http://a.pomf.se/nkwrgp.mp4) is how she sounds in original. I have no idea why it didn't upload video. Shouldn't it have no problems with mp4?) And that happens in any dub. They just have to make them as high pitched as possible.

As for language, for all my talk about superiority of original VA, I'm not fluent in Japanese. My Japanese is at very low level, though thanks to watching a lot of anime I can usually tell what conversation is about without looking at subs, though that's more on an instinct level than understanding the language. What always amazed me in Japanese voice acting was how brilliantly it conveys emotion, even if you don't really understand the language. That's why subs are perfect for me, as I can grasp the meaning from combination of subs + my poor understanding of language, and feel the emotions from the voice, which sound much less artificial (usually, there are some terrible exceptions) than most dubs do.

On thing I find strange is that I have no qualms about watching things that are originally in English. They don't sound artificial to me or anything. It's just the anime dubs that are terrible, so I'm not sure if it's some personal bias or is English voice acting in dubs just that wore than normal acting in movies?

>> ARTICLE
> I have no idea why it didn't upload video. Shouldn't it have no problems with mp4?

It shouldn't. Don't know why you got black.

> It's just the anime dubs that are terrible, so I'm not sure if it's some personal bias or is English voice acting in dubs just that wore than normal acting in movies?

I think it's more that after becoming so used to hearing Japanese voice acting, hearing the more reserved or "artificial" voice acting most dub VAs give makes them come off as sounding bored or disinterested, at least to someone who's not used to it.
>> ARTICLE
> I think it's more that after becoming so used to hearing Japanese voice acting, hearing the more reserved or "artificial" voice acting most dub VAs give makes them come off as sounding bored or disinterested, at least to someone who's not used to it.

That might be it. Still, the fact that I don't have this problem with American/British/whatever movies points to the fact that the dubs are done differently than normal voicework. Well, that is to be expected I guess.

You know, it's really rare to have a discussion about dub/sub on the internet with this civil tone.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's partially due to, simply, the difficulty in translation and having to match mouth movements. Compare it with the voice acting in any major American cartoon: The Simpsons, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, you name it. The shows that are written for English-speaking actors, surprise, sound way better in English. I'm not sure I'd want to watch The Simpsons or Looney Tunes in Japanese, either. 

I mean, for another example, check out Hedy Burress as Yuna in Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2. In FFX, they had to use the original Japanese mouth flaps, and she tried her hardest to match them which gave her an artificial, stilted tone of speaking. In FFX-2, when they were able to reanimate the mouth flaps to fit her dialogue, she sounded infinitely more natural.

Of course, I think we're also biased in that it's probably harder to recognize bad acting or awkward performances in a language you don't speak. 
>> ARTICLE
> You know, it's really rare to have a discussion about dub/sub on the internet with this civil tone.

FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU! YOU DARE CALL ME CIVIL?! I'LL TEAR OUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING EYES, BITCH!

*cough*

Yeah, I think part of the reason dub voice work is done differently than normal is because the VAs have to read scripts and do inflections that match the lip movements more than carry the real meaning and emotion of the line. Some notable exceptions are Watanabe dubs, as he is a fan of western culture and makes his shows with dubbing in mind, so they're pretty much aces across the board. (The dub narrator in Space Dandy blew the Japanese narrator out of the water.)

Alright back into this. If it wasn't for this rewatch I would have binged this all after the last episode...

Wow people suck...Simon is the best. Why arrest Boota?!

Kamina statue ;.; screw these people!!

I want the good times back...

Why do they have that button for the chair?

Love when Simon goes back to drilling techniques

Nia saying goodbye :(

Now that's an explosion wow

Ugh frustrating again!

How does Rossiu dodge those punches...

So we'll get to see why this group loves Viral so much now?

If this episode is as frustrating as the last two I swear I'm going marathon the rest...

How are there towels staying on...I thought anime towels were the flimsiest things haha

They made it seem way too easy for Rossiu to dodge them. I can understand Kittan not being 100% focused on his punches because of what Kinon just went through, but still.

I mean, the show's established that Rossiu's one real skill in fighting is defensive actions / evasion. Think about dodging all those missiles vs Cytomander's crew.

**Episode 19**
----
the last episodes I nearly forgave Russio, but episode 19 brought back the hate. Man fuck this asshole, talking about how humanity has advanced and civilized while sentencing Simon to death.  
I also hate how Russio is looking so fucking deadhearted the whole time not on bit of regret...

On the other hand is Simon who wants to rescue everyone even when he is hated by the people who he is protecting. I think that's why I can't forgive Russio or the population of Kamina City, because betrayal and (in my opinion) undeserved hate really are hitting my nerves. Best example of a movie that made me hate almost everyone involved is [Hero](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104412/) where I even bawled at the TV screen, because everyone shat on the main character the whole movie, I believe no other movie had made so mad like this one, and still I liked that movie for no reason.

But this Episode has a silver lining, we get to see our [favourite Beastmen](http://i.imgur.com/E8m0Ejm.png) again.

Again I know I am being unfair to him, still everytime I see this episode my hate against Russio is boiling up, can't do anything against it.")

God Dammit Rossiu, what are you doing. Things aren't looking good for Simon. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

- The **"Song of the Episode"** for episode 19 is ["Rap Was a Man's Soul... Right?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GeQK0fOAew). This song brings the feels.

- The **"Song of the Episode"** for episode 20 is ["Poison Prison"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l22el0xbUE).

I've got another 2 facts for today!

- **"Gone but not Forgotten"**: Even though Kamina has been dead since episode 8, Kamina is still referenced, directly or indirectly, every episode by at least one of the characters.

- **"Biblical Reference"**: The Arc-Gurren is the equivalent of Noah's Ark. Except instead of a giant flood, the moon is gonna crash into the Earth, and instead of a boat, it's a giant ship.

Rossiu's such a dick, it's understandable why he's doing what he's doing but that don't mean I hate Rossiu any less. See you tomorrow for more **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

Leyte installed weapons based on the "capture in bubble" technology they recently developed, but notice that the Ganmen are overall effective against Mugenn, even when not using those new weapons, while Grappals (however you spell that) couldn't do anything to them without the new technology.

Edit: In the excitement about Yoko I forgot to mention how much I love Kittan. Episode  20 really solidified how much of an awesome character he is and if he keeps it up he could even surpass Kamina.
>> ARTICLE
Now; I don't hate Rossiu as much as others I'm certain but even though I get why he is doing what he is doing and attempting to do it boggles my mind honestly. Like how has he not realized that the anti - spirals are just gonna hunt them down and kill them all? Or that the universe they live in isn't so Rational that all his logic and plans just won't work especially when you. Are planning to put to death the single most powerful being on your planet who is capable of fighting them and winning as we have seen. 

It's impossible for me to like him when he is doing all this even after I understand why. 
>> ARTICLE
Shit's getting serious, yo! Episode 19 is probably Rossiu's worst moment, largely because we're missing some information we'll get to see later on. Still, it's worth noting that every decision he makes after deciding to condemn Simon to death is a rational one: If you're going to send a condemned man to fight, make sure he doesn't run (or detatch Lagann and fly away). We also get some hints from Kinon that she's, emotionally, not entirely on board with this. 

If you watch Episode 20 and don't come away loving Kittan, I have no idea what's wrong with you. Kittan *shines* in this episode. 

I'll talk more about Kittan at a later date, because he's my favorite character and he hasn't reached Peak Awesome yet, but this is just a great all-around episode for him. Remember after Kamina's death where Kittan was trying (ineffectually) to be the team leader before passing it to Simon? I'd said that he was trying to work out what *his* role in Team Dai-Gurren was, and he finds it: He's the workhorse of the team. He's not inspirational like Kamina or Simon, but he's the field commander who gets stuff done. Remember that it was Kittan who originally united Team Dai-Gurren based on Kamina's ideals; he told everyone that there was this crazy asshole stealing Gunmen, and told them where to find him. 

One of my favorite minor moments for Kittan in an episode filled with great moments for him is immediately after Rossiu shows him what's going to happen to the earth. He grudgingly accepts that Rossiu's plan is the only logical one for making sure that *some* of humanity survives - and he damn well makes sure that his sisters, brother-in-law and niece are on Arc-Gurren when it takes off - but he hates it, and chooses to try the old Team Gurren way, too. 

The other interesting things from this episode are Simon and Viral finally having a face-to-face clash, and the reappearance of Yoko. Hey, I wonder what she's been up to for all this time...? Maybe we'll find out.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I actually disagree about his decisions being rational, although his intentions are definitely good ones. Rossiu doesn't want to take the risk of facing the anti-spiral head on, so he decides to crucify Simon in order to regain public order and then save as many humans as he can. The anti-spiral, who have explained they're powerful enough to drop the moon down on Earth, stated they would annihilate humanity due to them surpassing the population limit previously established.")  
  
[](/s "They never said they would give up after dropping the moon down on them, they said they would eliminate all humans. Therefore, there's no way to minimize losses because you can't exactly hide or escape from them. Hiding underground will do no good, even if they moon's impact doesn't kill them, because the anti-spiral would still eliminate them. Escaping into space will do nothing as well because they would still go through with eliminating humanity no matter what. The only two options when facing such an adversary are submitting to their conditions or taking them down.")  
  
[](/s "Lordgenome failed to take them down, and thus decided to maintain humanity's population below a certain level. However, now that the threshold has been surpassed the anti-spiral will not accept any other type of compromise, they are hellbent on destroying humanity. The logical conclusion is to risk it all on taking them down. No matter how difficult a task, it's the only choice where there's a small chance of some humans surviving. This means deploying all their forces, including Simon and Gurren Lagann, but Rossiu was too focused on humanity's survival in the very near future he didn't stop to think the anti-spiral have no reason to give up after dropping the moon on Earth.")  
  
[](/s "Rossiu was facing incredible pressure from having to save humankind and, as it's revealed later on, has some inferiority complex regarding Simon and Kamina. These affected his judgement, which led to the most logical/rational character at the moment to make such illogical decisions. His intentions were good, but his decisions were naive and foolish.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I'm not sure I agree. We (meaning Rossiu) at this point knows two things: 1.) The HAS is largely automatic, simply following a predetermined routine; 2.) The AntiSpirals stopped short of destroying humanity after the Spiral War, so it's possible that if humanity goes back to below the threshold to trigger the HAS, they'll leave them alone again. It's not an unreasonable decision to come to make.")

[Still spoilers](/s "Besides, as we see in tomorrow's episodes, even Simon's way wouldn't have worked without an extreme stroke of luck; i.e that the moon is actually the transformed Cathedral Terra. If it had just been a normal moon, Rossiu's order to pull Arc Gurren Lagann out after buying Simon all the time he could would have been the only way to survive. Let's also not forget it's an invention of Rossiu's - the Lordgenome head biocomputer - that even makes it possible.")

[Yup, still spoilers](/s "Which, of course, leads us to the REAL right actions, which would have been Simon and Rossiu working together using Simon's fighting spirit/Spiral Power and Rossiu's intellect and logic. Which is, of course, the path they arrive at after episode 23 :P")
>> ARTICLE
Rossiu's actions of using arc-gurren to save as many people as possible is not illogical. His condemning and discarding of Simon and Gurren Lagann is definitely illogical - what's the point of 'maintaining public order' when you lose your most powerful soldier and only chance against Anti-Spiral retaliation? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, consider that at the time he did that, the Grapearls were thought of as superior to Gurren Lagann in every way. It's not until the next episode where Lordgenome tells him that Gunmen were designed to fight the Antispirals. 
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "I love how fitting a quote of Russio from episode 7 became to your first point:
"Good intentions can sometimes tempt people down the wrong path"")
>> ARTICLE
> and chooses to try the old Team Gurren way, too.

Was pretty great to see their old mechs come back :)
>> ARTICLE
Again,^Rossiu^did^nothing^wrong  
The problem is, he is thinking rationally in an irrational universe.
>> ARTICLE
I hope russiu dies. Painfully. Running away like a coward instead of believing in simon. "Oh its impossible" have you not been paying attention mutherfucker?! He's won like a dozen impossible fights so far
>> ARTICLE
They should swap costumes imo
>> ARTICLE
I would agree as well. Actually I don't think Nia fits either personality. I would rather see Yoko and her "personality" in both costumes. 
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe yoko in senketsu and that scorpion chick whose name I forgot in junketsu
>> ARTICLE
i think that angry nia or [spoil](/s "anti spiral nia") is much closer to junketsu and satsuki thank yoko.  yoko is WAY more like ryuuko "ms. hothead" matoi.
>> ARTICLE
Scary thing is that Nia would probably fit Nui the most. 

Fakeness aside that is.
>> ARTICLE
I think it'd be hilarious to see Nia as Mako
>> ARTICLE
[Gurren Lagann final arc spoilers](/s "Fakeness too kinda. Nia's whole bit was going above and beyond it but she was still synthetic to begin with. If Nui weren't the villain she's probably be even closer.")

I must say that's it's just wrong seeing yoko without a sniper rifle

Angry-face Nia is really jarring.
>> ARTICLE
no doubt.  it's like the kind of thing that you would see *once* in an entire series, right before shit got *fucking real*, quick and in a hurry.  [Beware the Nice Ones](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes)
>> ARTICLE
Now I'm afraid of Mako.
>> ARTICLE
Mako is fucking amazing. There is a lot of nia in her. She's kind of a ditz and that leads directly to her utter and complete lack of fear. A person with no fear is always dangerous, because there is absolutely *nothing* stopping them from pulling out all the stops. And mako is no slouch - she assaulted Kinagase (who had guns and explosives and accupuncture magic) with a broom, to intervene on ryuuko's behalf, and gave ryuuko the [cooldown hug](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownHug)...*after* the [get ahold of yourself](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan) slap failed during the naturals election. 

Mako is a seriously under sung hero so far, and I for one am looking forward to seeing what finally sends her off the deep end. 
>> ARTICLE
Mako is best girl for sure. Hell just when she got shot with money she just catches everything mid-air to go shopping.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but notice Nia's unusual angry face. I wonder what she would look like as Nui...
>> ARTICLE
This is an awesome picture. Am I the only one who thinks that since they replaced the scissor sword with a drill they should have also replaced the sword with a sniper rifle?
>> ARTICLE
But that's Kamina's sword, right?
>> ARTICLE
GAHHH that makes so much more sense now. *chills*
>> ARTICLE
maybe, but yoko never uses it, so the sniper rifle is still fitting IMO
>> ARTICLE
In case anyone was wondering, it says   
   
 - shiketsu - death blood (as opposed to  - sanketsu - fresh blood)   
 - kamiketsu - god clean (as opposed to  - junketsu - purity)   
   
Neither really make sense since they aren't real words while the actual uniforms are.
>> ARTICLE
shi comes from shimon

kami comes from kamina

it makes sense because simon and kamina are the kamuis here
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, Simon and Kamina didn't have Kanji associated with their name. So it would be a case of the artist grabbing random Kanji with a reading similar to their names. If that's the case, then they could have just as easily said  (four blood) or  (hair clean), as it would have been pronounced the same (but admittedly make even less sense).   
   
Anyway, what I mean when I say they don't make sense, is that they don't translate to real words.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was pretty clear that the kami in Kamina referred to [kami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami) in the shinto religion. as for Shimon, I have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
The kami you are referring to is the same one as I am, . Anywhere I look, Kamina's name is spelled "" which is just the phonetically sounding of "Kamina". So, it's probably not an overt reference to kami, and instead just a name.   
   
EDIT: what I'm trying to say is that, his name is just a phonetic spelling rather than a word. The "Kami" in his name could be a reference to  (god), but it could also be a reference to  (hair), or  (paper), or whatever Kanji that has a reading of "Kami", or more likely, is just a name.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I might not have explained myself very well. Although officially it's spelled using katakana, It makes sense in the context of the plot that the  kanji would be used since [](/s "In episode 26, Kamina appears in everyone's memories to break them free of the anti-spirals") and Kami are said to reside in all things according to the shinto religion. Although it's only my theory and definitely not canon, so in all fairness the artist probably should have used the katakana instead.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I mean, they're clearly not random. They were probably shooting for something "cool" (hence death and god, both very strong words) rather than four and hair (which are, as you said, pretty fucking random).
>> ARTICLE
"You!  You are a pissing off person arent you!?"
>> ARTICLE
This seems completely backwards. Nia was always the calm one that had lots of presence, while Yoko was the firebrand.

Nia doesn't have the commanding, superior presence of Satsuki though 
>> ARTICLE
Wouln't  be read as "Jinketsu", not "Kamiketsu"?

So I just got home. It is currently 3.20am. Im pretty glad that I only have to really watch one episode. You guys will have to forgive me if this makes no sense


**EPISODE 15**

* She just [tries so hard](http://i.imgur.com/lO4YMwm.png). And I appreciate it *so damn much*

* So [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/HxWqUgy.png) were of absolutely no importance. These poor dumbasses were created just to be killed

* Okay TTGL, how are ya gonna pull [this one off](http://i.imgur.com/cC1Lf5q.png)? Im excited to see how this goes down

* [Stfu](http://i.imgur.com/rwt4NGP.png). Stop being so self-aware. I get it. This anime is crazy. Stop rubbing it in my face

* [Chill the fuck out](http://i.imgur.com/SoGf2cN.png), cockroach-rat. You dont even have a choice. Youre going no matter what!

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/KCGYIHp.png) is so sweet.

* Is he just a really [supportive old man](http://i.imgur.com/WRhfx08.png)? OR could there be more to it??? Like, hes her estranged grandfather. And he has joined these guys hoping to be reunited with her. BUT, after seeing her and how shes trying to live, he couldnt tell her so now he kind of just watches over her and helps her out when shes in trouble. What a nice old man.

* [Fuck](http://i.imgur.com/a4ERvs2.png). Just all of this entire scene. The way she jumps into Lagann and how he holds his arm out and smiles and how she jumps perfectly onto his lap. This actually makes me feel emotional, but thats probably just cause Im so exhausted. Either way, I want a gif of all of that to cry over

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/u74JOGs.png) is so friggin cool

* Sorry, [what](http://i.imgur.com/nFhWLrO.png)? Sorry, [can you repeat that](http://i.imgur.com/CC5rCpE.png)?? [NOOOOOOOOOO](http://i.imgur.com/EMtthdV.png) (so badass) They pretty much just lost their home

* I wonder if theres any significance to the king calling Simon Man of the Spiral

* [:(](http://i.imgur.com/BcBf4XC.png)

* [I mean](http://i.imgur.com/yUlMpme.png) All of that is useless if Simon kicks your ass so hard you cant move anymore

* Maybe because [you dont want to beat him.](http://i.imgur.com/jjdbwXL.png) Yeah??

* [Dont you dare](http://i.imgur.com/OfhSjVt.png)

* Now he said Power of the Spiral. Am I an idiot or have we not been told yet what this means exactly??

* [Thats really not that bad](http://i.imgur.com/izYg3Ly.png). I guess you wont be able to get any revenge, but Im sure you can make money off of this somehow

* Is [it](http://i.imgur.com/Ua0JIJA.png) to protect them or something? I think the kings an asshole, but I just cant put anything past this show

* Stop [being so vague](http://i.imgur.com/U6pgkkh.png)!!

* [Naw!](http://i.imgur.com/IXCt8v8.png) Look how much fun hes having

* [It sure is!](http://i.imgur.com/upzqW8t.png) I sort of love that they use this quote to remind us what were watching and to negate any arguments related to the non-existent logic of this show

* Im so sorry. Im sure youre all sick of me saying this, but [SIMON IS SO CUTE I LOVE HIM](http://i.imgur.com/recjeqr.png)

* Hahaha, shes [screaming with him.](http://i.imgur.com/bi79b0O.png) Shes so supportive

* Ahahah, hes just casually [like](http://i.imgur.com/avf94Nq.png)

* Is the Spiral stuff the ability to [summon drills](http://i.imgur.com/3BD1ADE.png)???

* Ooo, [somethings happening](http://i.imgur.com/xgDA4le.png)! Um. He turned it. And it made a clicking noise okay

* Far out. [This](http://i.imgur.com/QDFmZFW.png) looks like it would hurt!

* [Dont you DARE](http://i.imgur.com/XGYlxrK.png) Dammit

* [Not bad](http://i.imgur.com/p2rtrH2.png). I accept this fully.

* [I cant](http://i.imgur.com/VFQAmjR.png) No, [I just.](http://i.imgur.com/EvgUDl1.png)

* Way too excited to see [whats gonna be next](http://i.imgur.com/PPtOTDT.png)

You sort of answered that with [your webm](http://webm.land/media/z7SV.webm) of Simon using that power. Look what it's capable of. The other gunmen are powered by other means, but Lagann is pretty much better than them in every way, yeah? The nerdgasms wouldn't be as powerful anyway if they didn't have Simon's fighting spirit to fuel them.

Oh, and umm...

> Regular Show

[Hmph hmph, hmph.](http://squizz.deviantart.com/art/Regular-Show-x-Gurren-Lagann-259046475)

Just stop. Stop it. It's like in every one of your posts you talk about another show that I like. It's getting ridiculous.

>> ARTICLE
Have you seen the Regular Show episode that was an homage to TTGL? (As well as Voltron, Gundam Wing, and pretty much every other mecha anime. And FMA.)
>> ARTICLE
I haven't because I'm an idiot and am behind a whole bunch of eps. I heard that episode had a lot of anime references though. Hopefully I'll get some of them. Probably haven't seen enough anime yet, but I'll keep an eye out for TTGL and FMA too.

> What kind of cruel parents name their son after the full complement of genetic information that an organism inherits from its parents, especially the set of chromosomes and the genes they carry?

To be fair, his name is "Lordgenome", it's not Lord (as in title) Genome. So it's not like he was named directly that.

> The animation style on this guy is fucking badass.

He generally is badass incarnate.

> And does he have a tree tattoo on his chest?

If you look closer at earlier scenes you can see that this is probably chest hair, just stylised into a shape. Also the shape isn't consistent, as in this scene it looks like only a circle, while earlier there was clearly an inverted triangle..

Also, as another person I replied to, no mention of the preview from recap. Did you watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Also, the four generals are based off the base pairs in DNA (and elemental spirits). Adenine + Undine (Adiane), cytosine + Salamander (Cytomander), guanine + Gnome (Guame), and thymine + Sylph (Thymilph). Plus Viral ties into the whole DNA naming scheme as well.
>> ARTICLE
His chest hair turns into a spiral while fighting. This is intentional. 
>> ARTICLE
I just rewatched that part, and it looks like it changes when he releases his Spiral Power. When he is just piloting Lanzegan you can still see top of the triangle in shots that show him, but when he does the "I'm gonna go all out on you" it's already a circle.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT! HE BEAT UP LAGANN BARE-HANDED! I didn't even remember that! Now I'm reminded just how much of a fucking badass Lordgenome is. Also, [](/s "He did nothing wrong")

[spoilers]( /s "He only gets better")

We've made it friends. Episode 15, the final fight against Lordgenome, the Spiral King. I freaking love Lordgenome, he's so freaking cool. Episode 16 is just a recap episode so it's ok but meh. Welcome to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**.

- The **"Song of the Episode"** for episode 15 is ["All of you, Get Fired Up!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHeOlUI7ZhY&amp;amp;amp;). Another really enjoyable song, those of you that have seen [Spoiler-ish](/s "Parallel Works 8") may recognize this song and can understand why I chose it here.

Because episode 16 is just a recap I'm not choosing a song from the episode but instead I've got the ED.

- [Underground - High Voltage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Hvs3BZFnA). That glorious ED we've been hearing for the past 15 episodes.

- I wanted to showcase a really cool AMV in honor of Kamina, ["I'll Make a Man Out of You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlzPY5NyEU4&amp;amp;amp;). Don't worry, this AMV is spoiler free up to where we are.

I've got only one fact for today.

- **"Goodbye the 80s"**: Remember how I mentioned that episodes 1-8 was a take on the 70s era of mech anime? Well episodes 9-15 is a take on the 80s period of mech anime. This period was characterized by more character building and longer, larger battles as opposed to a villain-of-the-day format. A well known example would be Gundam.

Thanks for reading. I can't wait to start the next arc. I think the best part about doing the "song of the Episode" is getting to see all the names of the songs; they were really creative with their song names. As we all head towards tomorrow, I'll see you all for the next "Heaven Piercing Music and Facts".

EDIT: I wanted to mention this but I forgot, I was looking over the senior quotes from the graduating seniors this year and one of them was a quote from Kamina; "Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible!".
>> ARTICLE
See, I noticed the very clear divide between "super robot" and "real robot" (...ish) in the first and second half, but I think breaking it down into 70s and 80s seems a little too much.
>> ARTICLE
It is a clear divide between "super robot" and "real robot" but the stuff with the 70s and 80s is entirely true. You can check some of the most famous examples from those eras. 70s; Getter Robo and Mazinger Z, both were monster of the week and featured over-the-top casts. In the 80s; Gundam and even GunBuster. Both were more about character building and large scale battles.
>> ARTICLE
But even the classic 70s, your Combattlers and Getter Robos and Mazingers, while they were largely MOTW shows still had Big Bads who were (to some degree or another) responsible for the plot even if it was just sending the various MOTWs at the crew. 

And also think of GoLion/Voltron, which despite being an "80s series" is still very much in that "70s series" model. Meanwhile, the two biggest 80s mecha franchises, Gundam (teeeechnically 70s but hell it was 1979 so I'll give it to you) and Macross, are tonally far more in line with the third arc of TTGL than they are the second.

[Second half spoilers](/s "I mean, don't get me wrong, I totally agree that overall the show is very much a love letter to robot anime, but I very much just break it down into two parts between the first and second halves, since anything else gets a little messy. The real robot/Evangelion influence on arc three is unmistakable, though. But if you're going to say that the Kamina arc is 70s, Nia arc is 80s, presumably the Rossiu arc is the 90s, what does that make the final Simon arc, the 00s?")
>> ARTICLE
[Final Arc Spoilers](/s "Actually, yes. Simon's arc is Gainax's take on the mech genre with some of the previous eras mixed in. Gurren Lagann aired in 2007 so technically yes it is the 00s.")
>> ARTICLE
It's an interesting take, but I still think it's a bit of a stretch myself. 

I always perceived it as a division of three. Arcs 1+2 are past, arc 3 is present, arc 4 is future.

Ah, we can disagree though :) 
>> ARTICLE
I'll leave you with this then
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/TengenToppaGurrenLagann
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, I'm definitely aware that it's a love letter to mecha anime. But even as that shows, the references are spread all throughout the series rather than neatly coinciding with specific decades.

Also, good work with **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts!"**

I was wondering where you get the English names for these tracks from. The tracks I have are from the album Gurren Lagann Best Sound, and I think the translations were from some forum. It seems like TTGL has an official soundtrack, but I can't find a listing for the tracks or a download for the album.
>> ARTICLE
Not just those two, I especially like [second movie music spoiler](/s "My XXX is the Best in the Universe"). There's also classic "Boin vs. Boin" which roughly translates to "Boobs vs Boobs"

EDIT: didn't answer the question you had; I get the OST all off of a playlist on YouTube, the OST links I put are to the YouTube channel that has the OST playlist of you wanna check it out. The OST there is all in English.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the response!

I'll have to check out the playlist on YouTube and make sure I've got everything. Perhaps I'll double check around and make sure the translations match.
>> ARTICLE
In case you noticed, the pacing for episode 15 is just lightning fast. In the same episode they break into Teppelin, meet the end boss, discuss humanity and then kill him. And it's amazing.

Meanwhile, the transition in focus onto Simon and Nia has essentially been completed.

Was hard not to binge watch a bit since we only got to watch one episode today, so really looking forward for the next couple.

[This right here](http://i.imgur.com/9WAv7qe.png) might be my single favorite frame in all anime, it incorporates everything that is so good about gurren lagann and conveys its "stick it to the man" kinda themes.

Hell episode 15 in general is probably one of my favorites of all time its completely absurd, over the top and full of [dramatic](http://i.imgur.com/O9Moo39.png) [imagery](http://i.imgur.com/6tPEgJY.png) and serious speeches while still retaining the [sillyness](http://i.imgur.com/tVAbfeA.png). 

It does all this while throwing in [feel good moments](http://i.imgur.com/bAKoVd4.png) and cryptic messages to make us want more, this episode is everything i want from an anime and is perfect in everyway.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah for sure. Alongside the music and the whole hype of the scene with everything building up to this huge monumental assault, it just dazzles with epicness. Absolutely awesome.
>> ARTICLE
> This right here might be my single favorite frame in all anime, it incorporates everything that is so good about gurren lagann and conveys its "stick it to the man" kinda themes.

Yes! Absolutely. I said it up thread but basically from when the music kicks in and the camera pans around to show the scale of what they're up against is one of my favourite things.

What's wrong with the name Lazengann?
>> ARTICLE
Just seems like they are in love with certain sounds. Like gur, la, gann, from what i remember most of the mechs were named to something of that affect it just felt lazy.
>> ARTICLE
Lazengann sounds similar to Naruto's Rasengan which, if I remember correctly, means something like "Spiraling Sphere".
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily a Naruto reference but "rasengan" is the correct implication of the name, it's just anglicized as Lazengann. This show's all about spirals and drills.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't want to imply that it's a reference to Naruto (though it could be, given all the other references to pop culture -both western and Japanese- you can find in TTGL), I just meant to point out that it's not an arbitrarily chosen name, with a meaning connected to the theme of spirals and drills.
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's perfect 
>> ARTICLE
And now we've hit the halfway point! The end of the first arc of Gurren Lagann. It's a blindingly fast-paced show, the entire confrontation with the Big Bad (thus far) and his defeat runs like 8 minutes in total. 

Major developments: Dai-Gurren is destroyed, oh no! What will Dayakka captain now? Viral is immortal now, but still gets his ass kicked by Simon. Simon stabs Lordgenome with his car keys, but Lordgenome delivers an ominous prophecy. 

But we've beaten the Big Bad with over ten episodes left to go. What will our heroes face next? 

This episode also has another fantastic insert song moment (though it's not one of the three I'd qualify as 'legendary') including a particular shot which absolutely *does* qualify as legendary.

Seriously, [this is one of the best shots](http://gfycat.com/CleverMeanAnemone) ever in an anime. Ever.

To anyone who skipped the recap episode, I repeat what was said in last thread:

**Watch the last part of the recap, that is the 'ending' that contains many great concept arts, as well as the 'next episode preview' to get hyped!**
>> ARTICLE
Dat frontal assault! That whole sequence starting with Nia jumping out the window, right up to the final confrontation. Getting to see how far Simon has advanced; hey Viral, *sit the fuck down.*

Anyone else get a flash of panic when Dai-Gurren self destructs? That half second between hitting the detonator and actually ejecting made me realize just how attached I'd gotten to all these background characters, some of which haven't even warranted being named until this point.

Lordgenome is a boss, from start to finish. I think he's a far better villain [than](/s "the second arc's antagonist") not to mention Lazengen is one of the coolest mechs yet!
>> ARTICLE
I love the similarities between Lazengann and Unit 01, from how Lazengann is shaped to how organically it moves. [Spoilers](/s "This becomes becomes fairly significant later on, considering Lordgenome's past").

Super late today :(

**Episode 15**

So big boss time?

This is the size of the bad guy half way through...should be fun

^^Get ^^Her ^^To ^^Ride ^^With ^^You ^^Simon Yay :3

Immortality? Alright then.

The girls turned into drills??

"That man" who the King talks about...maybe it was himself? Kamina's Dad would be cool too.

Simon really has come a far way :)

The King turned into Hades :p

Did not expect him to die like that!

Ah that blend with the OP, masteful haha so good. They better never change this OP

Awe Nia and Simon moment!! :) seriously still my favourite parts of this so far haha

This series could have just ended here and I'd be pretty content

**Episode 16**

Only watching the last bit of this as not much point of a recap

After watching Shirobako I always question recap episodes :p

That art though was actually gorgeous

Nia looks really different

SEVEN YEARS?!?! What!?

I saw a ring on someone's finger...

Why couldn't we watch that episode today instead of the recap!

Well i guess i was kinda right with the speed of the plot. All these plot points would have taken like 6 episodes in another anime. I do wonder why Dai-Gurren blew everything up, surely there were some useful things on the ship still. Loved the fight with Lordgenome ~~waiting for a Kamina vs. Lordgenome fight for all eternity~~, especially the design of his gunmen. Lordgenome's weak spot is his chest hair, who knew? Anyway there goes the one of the coolest villains i've seen in a long time. His cryptic prophecy speak and the number of episodes left confirms that this is only the end of one plot arc. Also, this is just speculation but, is Simon going to drill the moon in half or something? Like, the series has repeatedly hinted at the moon being relevant somehow. Lordgenome's last words made me think the moon is a gunmen ~~which would be amazing~~. If it does occur that scene would just be the most over the top thing ever. Looking forward to next episode and where the plot goes from here.

At first I actually didn't like Gurren Lagann that much. I  generally tend to prefer the mecha shows with more of a military theme, but I kept watching because I just love giant robots and boy am I glad I did.

it's worth watching, but ignore the hype or you will be disappointed. people play it up like it's the best anime of all time, it really isn't. it's a fun and absurd mecha deconstruction that gets too introspective for its own good in the 2nd half. but it's definitely not bad.

You definitely should and also the father of Gurren Lagann "giant Robo:  the day the earth stood still" 
>> ARTICLE
what about mazinger or getter robo? both are older with just as much, if not more influence

>> ARTICLE
That is true. He should definitely try to watch anime like getter Robo and Mazinger and I did recommend those shows in a later post. 

Giant Robo and TTGL are both unique anime because of the sheer quality and epicness of it. Those are examples where the scale of the mecha anime created the show.

Getter Robo definitely had a massive influence on Gurren Lagann. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Gaiking did too.

At least one person  is going to jump down my throat for this,  but it is probably the best anime.

I wouldn't say "best", but from the pure scale of things, I would say the most "epic.

Out of curiosity, how long have you been watching anime? I'm not asking to criticise, I'm just asking because it seems that people usually watch what they consider to be "the best series ever" within a year or so of getting in to anime.

Since I was a kid :)  I saw TTYL for the first time when I was 18 and have yet to find anything that threatens it's position in my mind as the best.   The Hunter X Hunter reboot comes close,  I've recently become a huge fan of that

Awesome. TTGL is definitely one of my top 10 and might be one of my top 5. I don't think I could single out just one series as "the best" at this point or even choose a best in a genre.

>TTGL was a great love song to the mecha genre. It started as an homage and became something beyond the scale of imagination. A truly inspirational work.

First arc is a love story to the 70's or 70's styled super robots 

See:  see gaogaigar, new Mazinger Z, shin Getter Robo,  getter Robo, Genesis of Aquarion and others 

Second arc is a love story to the real robot anime of the 80's 

See:  the Macross anime, gundam, patlabor and others 

Third arc is a love story to the 90's and later darker, more philosophical, edgy anime like evangelion. 

See:  Neon Genesis Evengelion, brain powered, Bokurano and others 

The last arc is concentrated post evangelion reconstruction anime like RahXephon, gaogaigar and gaogaigar final fusion, Genesis of Aquarion... while going beyond those anime 

>If you liked TTGL, I recommend watching Giant Robo.

So much this 


>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else say Rahxephon like they do on the commercial break every single time they read the word? It's like a reflex.

Damn I loved that show. I basically watched it twice in a row (the second time was a combination of two reasons: rewatch for details that relate to the entire series and to watch it with my roomie).

Agreed, it's an amazing piece of art. I've been hoping someone would make a version that works better as a wallpaper.

>> ARTICLE
Is that the post ending scene you're referring to?
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Clannad and AnoHana? 

If so, you heartless bastard.

If not, go. Right now.
>> ARTICLE
Mind giving a description about the shows?
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana: Kids. Things happen. Things happen when they're older. Things get complicated. You think you're happy. Cry. Cry hard.

Clannad: Guy meets girl. Girl is shy. Go on adventures. Cry. Cry harder.

As spoiler free as I can get them :P
>> ARTICLE
But do they have the manliness that is TTGL as a backdrop?

I only survived TTGL because my testosterone was so high from the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen Anohana but Clannad is incredibly slow until you get to Afterstory and even then its more of a slice of life so there really aren't any moments that get you pumped up.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad only made me rage. It was typical and cheesy to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I know it has been said a thousand times, but give After Story a shot. The show really picks up (spoiler for Clannad: AS) [after they finish High School. I felt the feels only a couple of times during the first season, but After Story had me crying and laughing every other episode](/spoiler).



edit: had to test the spoiler code before actually typing out the spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it and it made me rage more. My fiancee felt the same too. Honestly, these "moe romance" anime lost all credibility with me once I experienced romance myself. It's so trite, dramatic and unrealistic, and not because of the magic, at least, that's my opinion of it. 

The last few episodes were excellent, but the rest of the series was absolutely dull.
>> ARTICLE
Once was enough.  Never again.
>> ARTICLE
Are you including After Story? Because the first season was just the (average at best) setup for that...
>> ARTICLE
After Story was terrible to me up until the last few episodes, which were pretty good, but a 40ish episode setup for that wasn't worth it.
>> ARTICLE
wow I thought I was the only one, AnoHana was a good anime though
>> ARTICLE
I nearly stopped watching when that happened. Glad I didn't though, such a great show.
>> ARTICLE
Why would you stop after that? The show got even more amazing after that!
>> ARTICLE
You might want to re-read what I said there, I didn't say I stopped watching. 
>> ARTICLE
It hit me too hard. I didn't like 90% of it after that :(.
>> ARTICLE
That's a damn shame.  The whole rest of the show is really stellar.
>> ARTICLE
TTGL has pretty fucking epic art to say the least. The art matches with the content of the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean some of the art? the whole series is a work of art.
>> ARTICLE
except the fillerific hotspring episode
>> ARTICLE
Now I must ask you this, have you only seen the TV version of Episode 6, or have you seen the DVD version? The TV version was censored and saw most of the second half replaced by a recap filler. The DVD version actually explained a couple of key plot points (that they re-explain in episode 7 because they were part of the censored half).
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that due to the producer running off with the script around that time? Or something like that? There was a lot of turmoil in the first 8 episodes within the staff I believe.
>> ARTICLE
That was one of the best episodes. We've been screening TTGL at my house for the past couple sundays with a bunch of people, and the hotspring episode (6 or 8 i think?) had EVERYONE laughing uproariously.  
  
I swear we're all normal, functioning adults, too.  
  
edit: I understand there was a censored for TV version of this episode. I never saw that one, and assume you may be talking about that version. 
>> ARTICLE
ya, i had forgotten its existence. It feels so out of place,just like Maggie Gyllenhall in Dark Knight.
>> ARTICLE
It was great when in that episode when pseudo-cameos by some of the other gainax girls 
>> ARTICLE
Damn it.  I am about half a thought away from getting that absurd box set... Please don't encourage me.

To be honest, I wasn't seeing much of a difference with the screenshots and previews of the HD version. I think anyone can survive with the $40 standard definition set.

Nooooo.

I just got paid today, too. Willpower is fading.

I just watched this show last week! It was an incredible journey. I was struggling with self confidence and I've been thinking about Kamina and Simon whenever I'm down on my luck. 

I ordered the core drill necklace off of Amazon and plan on wearing it for a long long time to remind me of this.
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend following Studio TRIGGER's work (Kill La Kill and Little Witch Academia) if you like Gurren Lagann. Studio TRIGGER = a new studio mostly composed of people from the Gurren Lagann staff.
>> ARTICLE
Something I noticed about [Gurren Lagann's ending](/s "At the end of the last episode when Simon leaves, he walks the same way that Kamina does in the second pic")
>> ARTICLE
I just finished putting together a young Simon cosplay! Makes me glad to know that there are people who are still enjoying this show.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this anime for it is all that is man.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched the first episode! I'm hooked!
>> ARTICLE
I think this anime has the longest timeline out of all of the one's I've watched. Starts when Simon is a child. Ends when he's an old man. The director had great vision when he planned it all out
>> ARTICLE
Legend of Galactic Heroes spans many years, but not quite a full lifetime.  This is without any major time skips, though -- TTGL has a pretty big skip between 2 arcs. 
  

>> ARTICLE
I see you've been enjoying the blurays.

Just finished the series last night. BLOWN AWAY. Loved it. Anyone seen the movies? Are they worth watching?

The movies are basically the shows in a two hour format. But the fight scenes are better in the movies, especially the last fight in the second movie (you'll have to re-watch it more than once).

I started watching it for the first time the other day. I'm on episode 10 and I feel like I already watched an entire series.

Honest to god, I got every episode out of that, fucking loved it
>> ARTICLE
That guy in the front? I was that guy the whole time! No other show has made me feel like such a little kid.
>> ARTICLE
This was brilliant, but you cant really appreciate it until you've seen the series.
>> ARTICLE
Gainax is one of the best anime companies, if not the best.
>> ARTICLE
That series never fails to impress me. It's over the top, a parody of itself, incredibly heartfelt, and absolutely inspiring all at the same time. Not many series can pull that off.
>> ARTICLE
i JUST finished episode 27 ten minutes ago. My watch was the first time but it was one of the most awesome, edge of my seat, gripping shows ive seen. 

Also, to remain relavent, i agree, the art is fantastic. [This](http://i.imgur.com/ETCW6GT.jpg) is my current wallpaper. thanks for the new choices!
>> ARTICLE
Gives me chills of awesomeness whenever I see any scene.
>> ARTICLE
What blows me away is the amount of people thinking this show isn't a parody and taking it to heart. 
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the best Mecha i reckon.
>> ARTICLE
It truly is. Especially when it comes to episode to episode plot and the immensity of scale.  

If you want a anime that's really close to Gurren Lagann, please check out Giant Robo OVA's.  They're both fun as fuck. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, i will check it out.
>> ARTICLE
Man I wish I could afford the Blu-Rays, it'd look even better in 1080p ><


>> ARTICLE
A classic since day freaking one!
>> ARTICLE
Just got a 1080p 5.1 audio version. I think the last one I watched was a shitty dvd rip. It's going to be like watching it for the first time. 
>> ARTICLE
Where did you get it? (Assuming it was a legit purchase... Just don't respond otherwise)
>> ARTICLE
Since the legit version costs $550, I wouldn't get my hopes up that it is the legit version he got.
>> ARTICLE
Man, it's been a while. I forgot just how freakin awesome that series is. Looks like I'm going to have to clear my schedule for a few hours...
>> ARTICLE
I'm so incredibly pumped for Kill La Kill. It probably won't have the scale of TTGL, but I recall hearing somebody at Trigger (possibly Imaishi?) claim it would be even more hot blooded.

After TTGL, Little Witch Academia, Inferno Cop, and Turning Girls, if there's one studio I trust unconditionally to smash one out of the park, it's Trigger.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing series. The beginning was truly epic, and it's still one of my favorite Anime series. Like you also a big fan of the art. 

But its not a perfect show. I still cringe at the " believe in the me who believes in you"  lines in the show. And while some people found the ending to be of epic because of the "scale" to me it felt repetitive and "power ranger/super sentai ranger"-ish Oh we're losing the battle "time to combine/get bigger.... over and over again. 

It's one of those shows I  have recommend to a lot friends who are getting in to anime and they had the same response. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know but it could have been said so much better, a simple "I believe in you Simon" or "I'm awesome and I believe in you Simon"  would have worked just as well. 

Maybe it sounds better in Japanese but it just sounds awful in English. When I encourage someone I never resort to referring to myself in 3rd person 

"Ah babe your cooking is good, Shenaniganz08 believes it good, you should believe it's good too"

Ugh... never mind, lets just agree to disagree


>> ARTICLE
Every time I see screen caps of this show I get really sad about how hard it is to find the Black Order subs.   The official Bandai release feels so...  Neutered in comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
It was recently re-released by aniplex, but I don't know if they did new subs/dubs or not
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I have the subs.  I just screenshot at times without text.
>> ARTICLE
Compare: "fight a duel with logic and kick off into the impossible!"  with "Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb!" 
>> ARTICLE
that shit was incredible.  I wish I could re-watch it.  Kind of slow in the beginning but after they start taking over shit it gets fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
What makes this show so great? I'm new to anime. Just finished Neon, and I can't see how any show can be better haha. I loved the depth, darkness, culture, everything about it. When looking up shows related to Neon, I always get recommended this one
>> ARTICLE
It is a roller coaster of emotions with huge doses of epic and manliness (that can be appreciated by anyone) that, combined with mecha and awesome characters make it one of the best programmes I've ever seen.

I don't want to over hype it, so I recommend you watch it. I also recommend not comparing it to NGE too much, they're not really in the same vein. NGE takes itself extremely seriously and TTGL does not.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, good to know. I'm excited to check TTGL out. Do yall know of any shows that do* take themselves seriously like NGE? I loved the grittiness, complex and somewhat realistic nature of NGE
>> ARTICLE
I'd say to some degree you need to check out Death Note. It doesn't have the same style as NGE, since the main characters are much more likable, but it is amazing and dark.
>> ARTICLE
Good/Decent shows that take themselves *very* seriously with minimal comic relief:  
  
Monster  
Legend of Galactic Heroes  
Fate/Zero  
Elfen Lied  
Berserk  
Gundam: 08th MS Team  
Patlabor 1+2 movies  
Ghost in the Shell movie (original 1995)  
School Days  
Madoka  
12 kingdoms  
Serial Experiments Lain
  
And then there are a ton more that are extremely good and can get and often get very serious, but have enough comedy/lightheartedness added in that I wouldn't call them *very* serious. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap haha. Ive heard of Elfen, Patlabor, and GITS. I'll watch those first unless you say otherwise
>> ARTICLE
The GITS movie is extremely cerebral, so be ready to pay attention to detail in that one. It's a similar style of film in mood, setting, pacing and even some general messages as Blade Runner, if you've seen that. It's one of my personal favorite films and is really special in what it does. The TV show is also good, but is much faster paced and light-hearted, aimed at a more teen/adolescent audience. 
  
Elfen Lied can be disturbing, and is very graphic. When it was newer it had a super vocal fanbase, and now for better or worse its kind of in the canon as a classic.  
  
The Patlabor movies were cool. Patlabor 1 is alright, but Patlabor 2 is an extremely interesting political/terrorism thriller.   
  

>> ARTICLE
You may enjoy Darker Than Black. Not a mech anime, but its pretty serious, has great character development, decent plot.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be checking it out tonight! Thanks, I appreciate it. Oh hey, I was told I could legally torrent anime in the US because of some loophole? I assume that's BS, but I torrent anyways so I torrented NGE. Is there other sites like Netflix yall stream through? I saw something like Crunchyroll. Is that good? 
>> ARTICLE
Mecha or just in general?
>> ARTICLE
I love mecha stuff, but anything in general. Something serious, dark, etc. Something like Breaking Bad, BSG, Or Dexter seasons 1-4 haha. Thanks for the input
>> ARTICLE
Of the 3 I've only seen BSG :(

But some of the more serious anime out there:

* Ghost in the Shell (all of it, the 2 movies and the series are in separate universes but the characters are the same)
* Ergo Proxy
* Welcome to NHK!
* Tokyo Magnitude 8.0
* Grave of the Fireflies

If you appreciate realism:

* Genshiken, granted this is "just" slice of life and not really dark, but it's the king of the slice of life genre, and it feels very much realistic. Note the anime currently airing is the 3rd season of it.

And anything Makoto Shinkai makes, is a much watch, such as

* 5 Centimeter per Second
* The Garden of Words
>> ARTICLE
+1 for Ghost in the Shell. It's not pretentious or faux-dark. It's genuinely an exploration of trans and post-humanism and technological advances. 
>> ARTICLE
It has all the emotions you could want in an anime. It makes you laugh, cry, cheer, and you also get to see some epic fights.
>> ARTICLE
my god if i could get these at a higher rez i would die happy :DDDD
>> ARTICLE
The best recent anime series.

Beautiful art, animation and characters. Individual moments that last a few seconds are greater than pretty much the entirety of other shows.
>> ARTICLE
Ive been re watchi.g it as well
>> ARTICLE
this is one of those anime I cant watch again because I get overly anxious

no idea why
>> ARTICLE
I really don't see why so many people go on about Evangelion, which was great in the 90s but whose graphics now seem dated and which is marred by a poorly executed ending and, to me, by a depressing mood throughout.

TTGL is a far greater masterpiece of the genre. A flawless gem.
>> ARTICLE
It's supposed to have a depressing mood... The director channeled his own extreme depression into his work, and it achieves that bleak atmosphere perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I made a comment a few weeks ago about fan-service and why it is appropriate in some shows and not others. I would argue that in shows like FLCL and Gurren Lagan fan service is an integral part of the plot. Gurren uses sex in the context of "spiral theory" (Alfred Korzybski's book- Manhood of Humanity), which heavily utilizes ideas about masculinity and desire in the evolution of humanity. Yoko acts as sexual archetype that "inspires" the protagonists in the early part of the series (love conflict) to achieve their goals, and this very much ties in to spiral theory/spiral energy. Thus the blatant sexualization of Yoko has an intellectual and thematic basis for existing in the story.

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!

Gainax, bro. Gainax.

Is this anime recommended if I like action? I believe I read its more comedy/slice of life kind of anime but haven't really looked into it.
>> ARTICLE
This is definitely action. It's a bit of a parody, but the action is definitely pretty cool.  
  
If you want dead-serious, no-fun action, then there are great shows for that, too. TTGL is for robot anime sort of like what Diehard is to gun-shooting action films: awesome high budget crazy cool action with a lot of clever humor and self-awareness.   
  
Guaranteed to entertain. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, that sun and moon thing that the third pic shows has always really resonated with me. One evening, I was driving north in the finger lakes on the top of a ridge and I actually saw this happen - the fading yellow-red sun on my left and a bright blue full moon on my right. It was incredible.

No anime will ever become bigger than TTGL

I never saw what everyone loves about this anime.  It was so corny to me I couldn't get much further than [](/s "when Kamina died.")  It felt like I was watching a show for 9 year olds.  IMO of course.

You've not seen any of Makoto Shinkai's works, have you.

TTGL is pretty awesome though, yes.
>> ARTICLE
Greatest eight episode anime ever. Too bad they did a bunch of downer spinoff episodes afterward.
>> ARTICLE
This post might as well not be here. Watch past 11, it gears right back up and becomes incredible.

Then the movies after expands upon it all.

Obligatory "Idiot" comment here.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I've watched every episode. I haven't seen the movie, but based on the later episodes I don't see why I would. I still say the anime's awesome dies immediately after 8. They tried to get it going again but it never really takes off. Then they try to have a really big finish but by then it's just bigger and bigger stuff for the sake of bigger and bigger stuff (Not entirely unlike DBZ after the Freiza Saga).

After ep 8 the show didn't just lose an entertaining character. It lost everything that gave the show intensity. The wild interactions with all the characters, the willingness to try new and unheard of things, and the total disregard for authority that the world sorely needed.  It stopped being a wild roller coaster and turned into an uneventful dash to the finish.

I'm not really sure what to say; During my younger years, I wasn't very social. Beyond this one guy, I didn't really have any other friends or anything else really. Things started to go to shit when he passed tragically; Everyone in the community loved him, and I handled the loss pretty badly, on reflection. But then, I met this girl. She was a foreigner, so there were some communication differences, but she was really sweet and loyal, and she brought me out of my shell, and we became close. [Then I led a revolution and blew a hole in her father.](/spoiler)

Actually, we're both just big Toppa fans. Since it was on Leap Day, she was the one who proposed to me;  Drove us out to where we first met (the airport), and proposed in the arriving terminal. I briefly considered taking up Nia's role in the proposal and pointing out that two people cannot become one, but thought better of it, and so we became engaged. [Hopefully she will not die as soon as the wedding ends.](/spoiler) That'd suck.
>> ARTICLE
so on leap day, the girl asks permission to murder your soul, instead of you just giving her permission to murder your soul

 TIL

(for real though, I always thought it was just some plot to an awful movie)
>> ARTICLE
Hahah Niiiiiiiiiiiice. He passed tragically... Everyone loved him. You took the loss bad. you met a girl and blew a hole in her father.

I didn't even notice until I read it the second time.
>> ARTICLE
No offense whatsoever, but I'm curious on your gender! You sound like a female, considering the story and all, but I'm unsure. It's cute either way, and the ring is beautiful! Congrats. :)
>> ARTICLE
If you aren't sure on gender just look at his finger nails. Finger nails of guys tend to be more roundish on males which they are in the picture.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, you are incorrect, sirrah! Those are a woman's hands, much like Blackadders.
>> ARTICLE
No offense taken, but I am a dude. On Leap Day, it's a probably not-as-well-known tradition that women can propose to men; refusal results in the man having to buy the woman anything from a dress, to twelve pairs of gloves. Thanks! :)
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. Your nails looked too well-done to be male, then again I chew on mine so I don't know what non-chewed male fingernails look like. Unless that's her hand. Speaking of, is she keeping that ring or you, if her, what are you going to do? SPIRAL DIAMOND. My suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
It's her hand. She gave me the ring on a leather cord to wear around my neck, but I insisted she wear it, it seemed a little weird otherwise. It's my job to figure out themed wedding bands, I believe.

I also chew the shit out of my nails.
>> ARTICLE
Aes Sedai band and a Malkieri signet ring, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Haha! I see now. Will you at least be getting a drill cake? People have novelty-themed cakes all the time, I can't imagine a golden drill cake being very hard to make. 
>> ARTICLE
Better yet, the cake can be a replica of Simon's drill pendant or the Giga Drill Breaker..

Oh by the way, congrats to A_Known_Cat
>> ARTICLE
Or a replica of the drill first activated by Gurren. Of course, I guess that'd just be the same drill but silver...but the point remains.

This seems like a great idea, and I will steal it and present it to her tonight as my very own!

happy cake day...

Men cant afford women proposing every other day :|
>> ARTICLE
Where in the heck did you get a replica of her ring? That's awesome!
>> ARTICLE
A few screenshots and a local jeweller, pretty much. He did an amazing job of replicating it, I think.
>> ARTICLE
What's the gem? Emerald? Looks a little bit like beryl.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's a synthetic emerald, I believe, as natural ones shatter quite easily, and she works with rather harsh chemicals (she's a research analyst/chemist/something or other. I just know they make morphine.)
>> ARTICLE
No wonder you got such a perfect color! Synthetic gemstones are virtually identical to natural ones anyway, so for a custom piece of jewelry I'd say it was better you got a synthetic one. We don't want to cut up too many natural gems.
>> ARTICLE
I was going to ask if there was a jeweler at an anime convention. Then ask if they charged convention prices + wedding prices. Seriously though, if you tell the jeweler it is an engagement ring, you pay way more than a ring that is a gift. 
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I'm pretty pleased with the price!
>> ARTICLE
From the sound of it you got a great price!
>> ARTICLE
Again, awesome. I did not think a jeweler would be willing to do such a thing, but then again I've never met a jeweler. 
>> ARTICLE
I worked at a jewelry store for a couple summers and if you pay for the rock and the service they'll take requests. Some jewelers may not want to risk cleaving a diamond like this (actually you might not be able to do this to a diamond anyway) because if you mess up you're out a diamond. But stones that are softer like beryl (which I think this is (edit: it's actually an emerald which is essentially deep green beryl)) are easier to cut.
>> ARTICLE
Cool stuff; good to know.
>> ARTICLE
Professional Jeweler here:  I'd be happy to make that for anyone.  The stone cut is called hexagon.  The stone looks to be lab created emerald.  I can order a mounting form one of my vendors that looks just like that.  The only thing that is odd is the way the stone is set.  That's not even hard, just different.  Those points sticking out have a good chance to chip.    

I would just order everything and stick it together.  Run maybe $750-850. +the diamonds, which will run 400-500, or you could use moisanites that will be about $90

Now if you wanted Full custom, and not use the pre-made mounting, you could tweek the look more, but it would add about another $300.

Jewelers are all trolls.  But, we like to make pretty stuff too.  Don't be scared to ask a jeweler to put something together for you.  The trick is to let them have some free way in the outcome, and let them know this.  We hate dealing with "NO, I want the side stones to be at a 12.76 degree angel, and the center stone needs to be 1.14mm higher, and can you make those prongs smaller."  
>> ARTICLE
I wish people who draw liked free way. Every one I've met gets pissed w/o details...
>> ARTICLE
>Jewelers are all trolls. 


That is the one thing I learned while looking for an engagement ring.

We got lucky for the wedding ring, no one likes what she likes so it was at the outlet discount store for 70% off. 

>> ARTICLE
Would like to also point out that the people selling the jewelery are not jewelers.  They are sales people, and will poop on anything that dose not increase their commission check.

If I remember correctly, I think it was something along the lines of "I hope your wedding ends better than theirs(Simon and Nia)."

my LPM went through the roof after reading this.

gah what was said...
>> ARTICLE
Don't quote me, but something along the lines of, "I hope your marriage has more luck then theirs."

I'm happy for you and I'm gonna let you finish but Captain Planet had the best rings of all time. OF ALL TIME.

YOUR MARRIAGE SHALL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
>> ARTICLE
OMG YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW JEALOUS I AM!!! Well, the caps lock gives a small inkling, but I am seriously like, looking a little greenish I'm so jealous. I never even thought of this for an engagement ring, now I need to tell my man before he actually buys me one. (Unless I'm too late, and then well, any ring will do, even if it's not anime related.)
>> ARTICLE
now she's going to disappear. :'(

WELL THANKS A LOT MAN

How can you of all people not have seen this?

It's okay, [she'll still be around.......in a galaxy far, far away helping an alien race take over Earth.](/spoiler)

Spoiler tags, bro
>> ARTICLE
Lol at least you will only have to have an anniversary every four years
>> ARTICLE
How come you're getting called a nerd on r/anime? A place where people pay unimaginable amounts of money on anime memorabilia, yet being proposed to and having a ring that showcases the couples similar interest and compatibility is too nerdy? Congrats to the happy couple, WTF to the forever alone guys/gals. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm totally getting my GF one of these.
>> ARTICLE
The wedding ring is going to have to be pretty spectacular to Tengen top that ring.
>> ARTICLE
At least the engagement went a bit smoother than Simon's did. Try to avoid any Tron cosplays for a while now, though. : p
>> ARTICLE
Firstly, I think this is absolutely amazing and I hope you wouldn't hate me for using this one day.  Secondly, how much did something like this cost (if you know). Perhaps if you don't feel comfortable disclosing it for all of reddit to see you could PM me? 
>> ARTICLE
No problem, it was around the $1600 mark. The ring itself is made out of white-gold; The stone itself is not amazing quality, but we wanted to get the colour just right. There are two diamonds flanking the emerald in the band, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much!
>> ARTICLE
Turns out it was $1200, I was a bit out. Remember these are also Australian dollars/prices, so it may vary from country to country.

Go beyond the love and kick reason to the curb! That's the Gurren-dan way!

that guy  is smart, celebrate your anniversary every four years, i need to hope on this
>> ARTICLE
That's incredible, please tell me your a huge fan of that show...

Edit: (As advised by Master7432 (Give the GGG an upvote!) I know the person receiving the ring probably is a huge fan, and loves the ring, but sometimes I feel compelled to ask a "stupid question" (just in case) Get me?
>> ARTICLE
Well, if they got a engagement ring based off an anime, then you would expect that they would like the anime...

Edit: Edited.
>> ARTICLE
Calm down, calm down. There is always a possibility that the giver of the ring is a huge fan while the person receiving the ring may think "meh" which is why I specifically said "huge fan"

I know the person receiving the ring probably is a huge fan, and loves the ring, but sometimes I feel compelled to ask a "stupid question" (just in case) Get me?

>> ARTICLE
Oh. Have an upvote and an edited original edited response.

Additionally, you might need to edit yours a bit so others don't complain.
>> ARTICLE
I get your question, and it's kinda a weird scenario. The ring was made for me (the guy), to wear around my neck on a cord, but I thought it'd be better to be on her finger. Since my fiance is the one who proposed, and therefore commissioned the ring, she made it to reflect something I was a massive fan of. She is also a Toppa fan, though, just probably not quite as into it as I am (but enough that she wants a Toppa-themed wedding).

Does that make sense?
>> ARTICLE
Very much so. Gotta be honest, couldn't tell from your hand whether you were a man or woman. I think you should take pics of the wedding if you're gonna make it a TTGL themed one, r/anime would love to see it I bet. 

Congrats on the wedding, many years of happiness to you!
>> ARTICLE
It's her hand, not mine.
>> ARTICLE
Just shows how confused I was, thanks for clearing that up.

Nia's dress is one of the prettier wedding dresses I've seen in anime, IMO. I hope your wedding is as beautiful as theirs.[though no disappearing bride...](/spoiler)

I'm reading the manga now out of curiosity. And I'm not impressed. I'm guessing its one of those where the anime is just better. Kinda like the opposite of Toriko.

Why does reddit have the strangest people on this earth? You are a dude with with an engangment ring? Do you let her wear a strap on too?

theres always that person that solo carries a certain part of the song, like that girl in the past one

Uwwaahhh it's embarassing to only hear myself at that part

I really liked that part lol

I recorded myself singing that part too, but the recording was too low; although you are a much better singer than me :D
>> ARTICLE
I thought it sounded really nice!
>> ARTICLE
Don't be embarrassed, you have literally the best voice of anyone in there.

your voice is amazing! don't be embarrassed, it totally had the feel of an anime opening's singer!

You've got some chops, bro. Be proud!

It was really good

I was thinking whether to add in more voice to cover you up

but naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
>> ARTICLE
You have the voice of a graceful-as-fuck eagle, my friend; you may very well become the Jebus of /r/anime. Keep it up, it's music to my ears!

[](#heart-thumbs-up)

Don't be embarrassed! Good job.

That beginning was so cringey, but the rest was surprisingly good, good job /r/anime.

"What anime is this from again?"
>> ARTICLE
I wish i got more stuff to work with. Need more people screaming random stuff in the instrumental sections

Are you looking for some volunteers who would join in these /r/Anime sings projects ? Because somehow I got interested ... that's why I wanted to ask if people can join for the next project

We do need a snack boy...
>> ARTICLE
[well](http://www.frogtownproductions.com/blogs/kittens/files/2011/04/1301798058252.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I definitely thought when you said "someone scream for me" that you were after that kinda growl thing in the original.

And yes, to those who are reading, my submission had an attempt at a death growl there.
>> ARTICLE
That start...The cringe is real.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like the start, but the song was ok
>> ARTICLE
We wanted to become more like /a/...and we succeeded...
>> ARTICLE
I actually DID think it was /a/ before reading the title (yes I click links without reading)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you guys are on about. I liked the start...
>> ARTICLE
Same, what was the issue with it?
>> ARTICLE
They are just jealous that they didn't leave their marks in the intro
>> ARTICLE
I agree, after all, I'm the one who got the first line RIGHT at the start :3 and I will always remember that
>> ARTICLE
I liked it.

^^^and ^^^^was ^^^^in ^^^^^it
>> ARTICLE
I was in it too ^^^but ^^^my ^^^"funny" ^^^part ^^^wasn't ^^^funny ^^^enough ^^^for ^^^the ^^^cut.

Edit. Formatting on mobile is hard
>> ARTICLE
The start was worse than /a/. Better than Nozaki. More livelier.
>> ARTICLE
I personally like the Nozaki one better. I listened to that one a few times but even though I like Sorairo Days I'm not trying to listen to that intro again lol.
>> ARTICLE
I can sense their power levels from here 
>> ARTICLE
what does the scouter say?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the delay, this turned out to be a much bigger task than I'd expected.

I received a whopping 92 submissions from you guys. Next time I shall try to go for a less popular ones and aim at 40 submissions. That was a massive task trying to find a place for all of you. There will be a few that are more prominent, but overall with this many people I believe it may be difficult to hear yourselves overall, something I'll try to improve on next time.

Aaaaaa snap, should have included my name in the e-mail right?

yes you should have done that

If that's supposed to be everyone, why am I not included? D:
>> ARTICLE
you are on the list though?
>> ARTICLE
Oh. I see it now. Odd that I got no notification. The video was awesome by the way. I wouldn't have included the "GIGA DRILL BREAKER" guy at the beginning, but otherwise great.
>> ARTICLE
It's like all the low male voices resonates as one and provides a constant backing track.
>> ARTICLE
there's no underscore in my username. no big deal though :)
>> ARTICLE
I just go by what you sent me in the email. I should've checked with pms next time. 
>> ARTICLE
Checked and there was no underscore in the email; probably just a copy and paste error along the way. I wouldn't bother with PMs, it could take quite a while and I don't think potentially catching a typo is worth that additional time. Your effort is better spent elsewhere :)
>> ARTICLE
Is there usually posts asking people for audio files? I keep missing them....

Yaay, I... can't hear myself for shit. But maybe I just don't want to... Anyway, it was fun, certainly up for another round!

I heard my splendid voice a couple of times. It was really fun doing over 100 takes. Ya know, but worth.

Question about the credits, is there any meaning behind those groups of nicknames? The first seems random, and the next two are alphabetical within themselves.

I waited so long for this 

awesome job /u/Jeroz thank you for your hard work

Hey, I just want to comment that you mentioned /u/blaziken331 but it should be /u/blaziken311 instead. 
Source: he's my friend :D
>> ARTICLE
Well I could only grasp my Giga Drill Breaker but this /r/reddit version is friggin' dank
>> ARTICLE
I could actually hear myself, but I think that's because there weren't too many female voices. Good job mixing it though, this was really fun.
>> ARTICLE
Same here! I found myself at the beginning, I think.
>> ARTICLE
>there weren't too many female voices. 

Probably around 12 out of 93?
>> ARTICLE
so /r/anime is 13% female, probably pretty accurate

>> ARTICLE
Huh. I'm actually a little surprised it's that much.
>> ARTICLE
Or proportionally female members are more likely to sing?
>> ARTICLE
We need a "/r/anime does something gender neutral" to figure this out. 
>> ARTICLE
Sex? Only totally gender neutral thing I could think of.
>> ARTICLE
Nice try. And sure, I'll have sex with you. 
>> ARTICLE
Score!
>> ARTICLE
At the start you guys were trying so hard to be /a/ it hurt. The rest was great though!
>> ARTICLE
This is almost as autistic as /v/ the musical. And I *love it*.
>> ARTICLE
Also, a massive thank you for those that provided me materials for the intro and the outro. It wouldn't be called /r/anime's own without them. You guys are the best!
>> ARTICLE
I'm regretting not doing anything for them, I will for the next though I promise
>> ARTICLE
So how about a /r/anime x /r/japan_anime collaboration next time?
>> ARTICLE
#Suggestions for the next song here

---

**The criteria are:**

1. Has to be **recent**(2012+), we've just done a classic after all
2. Has to be **hyper**. I want to hear a lot of you guys just having fun singing it. No slow ballad, give me the crazy denpa.
3. Doesn't have to be an OP/ED, but must have appeared in the show several times throughout the series. 

For example: [Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSQ23NRED8) from Yowamushi Pedal
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul Season 1 opening... PLEASE
>> ARTICLE
unravel is insane difficulty, i don't want to try that just yet
>> ARTICLE
You've got me dreaming!
>> ARTICLE
Would **Walk Like an Egyptian** or **Roundabout** from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** count?  They're certainly odd choices for ED's, so I can see why you might not want to pick them.  But they're both pretty fun and the fact that they're in English would make them pretty easy to sing.

If not, **Bloody Stream** (also from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**) would work really well I think.  It's pretty hyper and fun, but the lyrics are slow enough that it wouldn't be too difficult to perform.  It looks like a backing track has been released for it also.

**Stand Proud** and **So No Chi No Kioku** from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders** would also be pretty good.  So No Chi No Kioku seems to have a backing track too, but I couldn't find anything for Stand Proud.

TL;DR anything from JoJo that /a/ hasn't done already.

I'd *maybe* be willing to submit something myself, but there's no way in hell I'm recording myself screaming Japanese into the microphone when there are others in the house.  So I'd have to wait to be home-alone.

EDIT:  I found an instrumental version of Stand Proud but it has slightly audible singing for only some of the lyrics.  I don't know why.

Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love!'s [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B17DtIOrn8o) would be hilarious to cover.

I think [Kuroko no Basket's 3rd opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcF4Bjr-kIk) (or Second season 1st OP) is great
>> ARTICLE
I like the idea of either of the two Attack on Titan themes (I know there's a backing track for the first one at least), or the HxH opening.

And I'm not suggesting this for the next song since it doesn't fit the criteria, but I wanted to suggest at some point doing [Cha-La Head Cha-La](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asyO6tonbLQ).
>> ARTICLE
Id like to nominate the OP for [Space Battleship Yamato 2199 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv_WHH96Pf8)

Its both a classic and a recent song. Its very easy to sing and has a male version(for the majority of the subreddit ha) and a chorus version. Its a very hype song and always got me in an excited mood whenever I listened to it.
>> ARTICLE
/a/ apparently did it already but fuck it : Extra Magic Hour, Amagi Brilliant Park's opening. 

Also, I think most OP/ED singles have an intrumental version of both the TV size edit and the full version of the song. I don't know if you already thought about that when looking for an instrumental version.
>> ARTICLE
Some of them don't since they are "mainstream" songs that happen to tag onto an anime project, e.g. Database, Let Me Hear.

[AKINO - Kantai Collection OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULHQPm8hmVk). The chorus would be fun as *hell.*

[Jiyuu no Tsubasa - Attack on Titan OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCE-g8LNhTQ). German AND Japanese, what could go wrong?

[Uragiri no Yuuyake - Durarara!! OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O9hRcIAza0) - yes, technically breaks the 2012 rule, but damn it's a good song.

I second all of these, except that's Sakurasou's ED, not the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWqJZ_150h8).

what about the infamous [hunter x hunter OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3MkHWThYAo) ([instrumental vers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RctZ2eRPjYE))?

HxH just finished in 2014 and is the most iconic song of the series because it was the opening all the way through. And furthermore /r/anime really loves HxH so its really fitting.

Id also really like the witchcraft works ending because it is way too addicting to listen to and its even intended as a choir but Im not sure if its too hard. ([instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMWs6xsgsZE))

Last suggestion would be the Shigatsu OP 1 from Goose House and that just because I like this song so fucking much (Im not sure if it really fits the criteria of hyper) ([instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPb1JuFfnUc))
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Hikarunara is definitely on the card here. The album released the official instrumental version and there's an [official full version video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnXkhkEvNIM) as well.

Though I would want to make sure that we got enough high note presences in the crowd before we do it. It's one which I would want to have enough leads to cover the 6+1 different voices. I'll do a couple more other projects to get more people interested so I know who I can look out for. Sometimes when you love a song too much you want to make it at least presentable, you know what I mean?

The [op for the first season of Free!](https://youtu.be/k2iRnPsWqls) could be really funny with how frequently it switches from Japanese to Engrish. There's also an [instrumental](https://youtu.be/6Jb73-4poMU) available.

Assassination Classroom OP could be fun, you could try playing around with dividing male and female voices for some parts, just like in the OP.

Very interesting choice, probably could work as well. I'll have a look and see if it's feasible for consideration

It would be great because the original is mixed as a load of kids singing in chorus.

Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ccU7fflf74)?

That's slower than the actual song and kind of lacking a punch. Good find though, but I'm not really enthused about using that one since I'll have to edit it first. Please let me know if you find other ones

I think i might have to restrict the entries for Let Me Hear to those who can either hit the high notes or can scream nicely. I seriously cannot picture one where it's one or even two octaves down. Then again if there are a couple who can lead it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Quick question for the next /r/anime sings, is there any chance you could put in whose recordings you're using during each singing part into the video?

Needs more Viral
>> ARTICLE
Viral was busy being Sanageyama.

They actually managed to avoid having two characters from any of the overlapping voice actors (Viral = Sanageyama, Kamina = Tsumugu, Nia = Mako's mom)
>> ARTICLE
kamina's voice actor also did Guts voice tho ;)

>> ARTICLE
It's also missing Yoko of all people. Pretty much the 4th most important character after Simon, Kamina and Nia.
>> ARTICLE
What, the Doombitch? Hell no! She'd kiss someone, and they'd end up dead!
>> ARTICLE
She's pretty much 90% of the fan art too.
>> ARTICLE
"fan art", you say...
>> ARTICLE
As a whole, I think Yoko is a more important character than Kamina even.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone remind me what Yoko did in TTGL?

I mean, besides getting Kamina killed?
>> ARTICLE
She kissed Kamina and he died shortly after, she kissed Kittan and he died shortly after... I kinda see the pattern. 
>> ARTICLE
She kinda helped them out of the cave
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Yoko killed Kamina in the same way she killed Simon and Nia, by not doing it.
>> ARTICLE
Lol yeah pretty much...
>> ARTICLE
Why would you say Yoko got Kamina killed? I think it was more Simon and the rest of the season was him learning to accept it and move on.
>> ARTICLE
>Why would you say Yoko got Kamina killed?

Kiss of death. She's to blame.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, that was terrible timing for fessing up her love for Kamina. Everything would've gone perfectly if she'd saved it for after the huge important battle.
>> ARTICLE
She knew there was a RISK people would die! That's why she did it before! She would have been more fucked up if she didn't say anything and he died in the battle anyway, which was certainly possible.
>> ARTICLE
No kittan is.
>> ARTICLE
[Gurren Lagann](/s "Yoko is important because she created an invisible rift (more like Simon's fault, but whatever) that resulted in Kamina being killed. Should have been bros before hoes. Also boobs.")
>> ARTICLE
I didnt even notice I was to busy making sure rossiu wasn't in there. I have never been more disgusted by a fictional character in my life. It actually bothers me how much I hate that guy.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, Kamina was the drive for everyone. And you also have to remember that [](/s "It was Kamina's memory that brought everyone out of that vegetable like state the Anti-Spiral forced them into")
>> ARTICLE
Oho, that's true. Simon, Yoko, Nia, and Kamina really were the most important characters, and I don't know if any of them are more important than the others. Except Yoko. I'd say she was the least important of the most important. 

Nia's my favorite, though.
>> ARTICLE
Nigga pls.

Lord Genome comes above Yoko in terms of importance.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, this is true. He is the bad guy, after all. And what's a story without a bad guy?
>> ARTICLE
He lived long enough to become the villain.
>> ARTICLE
Then died hard enough and relived to be the good guy!
>> ARTICLE
i think he is an anti villain
>> ARTICLE
He was the Hero no one wanted but everyone needed.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Gamagoori had to tilt his head to stay within the frame.

And he has an object protruding from his head pointing towards Mako, and he's blushing.

FLCL in here too?

God damn it, now I have to watch TTGL again.... and I have no problem with that.

Im sorry for you. :P

The lack of Yoko disturbs me.

>> ARTICLE
What part of this is a spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
If you've only watched the first part of Kill la Kill, the implication that all the characters on the left end up working together is kind of spoilery. 

I mean, it's not exactly the most surprising plot twist ever, but still.
>> ARTICLE
But the Anti-Spiral is on the right...
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps the anti-spiral dude in the back.
>> ARTICLE
But you wouldn't know that was a spoiler unless you already knew who he was, in which case it's not a spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
happy Satsuki?
>> ARTICLE
lol yeah XD
>> ARTICLE
Well damn, that really brings to light how many characters actually died in TTGL, huh. I liked KLK's cast a *lot* more though, so I guess I won't complain about where the survivors are, ha!
>> ARTICLE
Really? Opposite for me (about the cast).
>> ARTICLE
To each his own - I feel like KLK had better supporting characters in the form of the 4 Devas, Mako, and Nudist Beach, not to mention Satsuki is damn near my favorite character in anime, now. 

TTGL definitely had some great ones too - Simon is a great lead, I do prefer him over Ryuko, but that's about it... I can't even name most supporting characters from TTGL by memory, though, and not a lot of them were developed that well in comparison. And for whatever reason I just really did not like Nia, just thought she was a really dull love interest.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe true...except for the fact that Kamina by himself surpasses the KLK cast combined.
>> ARTICLE
Kamina was a showy, flashy idiot. He was an incredibly FUN showy flashy idiot, but the show was made markedly better by his no longer being in it except as motivation and inspiration. Simon, Yoko, Kittan, etc were all much better characters.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with the Devas, I think, is that their imbalanced relationship with Satsuki could never beget friendship. They view her as someone inherently superior to themselves, and if the show hadn't glossed over this psychological fact, the Devas would've behaved a lot differently.
>> ARTICLE
Except for Nonon.

Sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
There's not enough Kamina love in those paragraphs! U.U
>> ARTICLE
that's because Simon had a full crew. Ryuko and Satsuki only had a handful of people helping them significantly. Less people = more time per person = more memorable characters
>> ARTICLE
Inu still only got like 10 minutes screentime.
>> ARTICLE
He's still my favorite, just because he's got that snip snap collar.
>> ARTICLE
probably because he was the weakest of the characters and the least "fighty".
>> ARTICLE
How was he weaker than Nonon, Mako, or even the butler?
>> ARTICLE
nonon went toe to toe with ryuuko for almost a full episode worth of air time.  ryuuko flattened inu in short order by *outsmarting the smart guy*.  butler doesn't even enter into the equation.
>> ARTICLE
This says nothing about the strength of their characters.
>> ARTICLE
alright, man, then go ahead, tell me what time it is

[Oh Senketsu](/s "....I cried like a baby when he died.")

I really hope it's not just a pachinko. I hope it's a new movie, a prequel movie telling the story of the spiral war and Lordgenome's past. A sequel or season 2 it's just not right. The series finale was so perfect xD. And it doesn't need a reboot either. A prequel would be the best thing to do in my opinion. That's the only thing that's left to tell.
>> ARTICLE
hope its a re boot 
>> ARTICLE
seriously i don't think gurren lagann needs another season, it's great the way it is now.

Edit: Wait Konami? GGWP 9/11
>> ARTICLE
Why is everybody so sure that it's a Pachinko machine?
Konami was involved in producing the original series too.
"Producers: TV Tokyo, Aniplex, Dentsu, Konami, Half H.P Studio, Bandai"

The Pachinko machine plan could just be a tie in to cash in on the new anime/whatever.
Also the teaser seems a bit much for just a Pachinko machine.
I could be wrong though :p
>> ARTICLE
Seems like a lot of hype over a pachinko machine, especially if they're gonna use words like 

> restart! Please wait for more announcements

...But what else could the PS in the link stand for?

Postscript, maybe? It could be the title of a sequel show: Gurren Lagann PS. Actually seems like a catchy, believable name to me.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite anime series,  Proud to say it made me the man who I am today.  During my time of not knowing what the fuck to do, I had no job, I wasn't going to school, I was a complete bum.  I'd watch anime and youtube videos all-day and do absolutely nothing.  It got to a point where I'd be almost homeless.  I then stumbled upon this anime and first thought "ugh another mecha anime... fuck it let's watch it".

I was completely hooked from the first episode.  The progression of the story was absolutely absurd but...it was inspiring.  To say FUCK IT, and just go all out, it was stirring something within me.  By the time of the later episodes, I was so fucking ambitious, I'd change everything I was doing,  even the way I acted.  I was hungry, wanted to change myself.

I'd proceed to finding a part-time job doing valet.  FUCK IT, getting some money, even if it's small.  Overweight?,  FUCK IT lets run around the block.  Finally, started getting into the groove of not being a lazy fuck anymore.  I'd keep this up until I landed an alright-job as a Service Advisor at a dealership.  Oh you've wanted to move to California?,  FUCK IT let's move from one coast to the other.

And now I'm here with big plans, still have the same drive to tackle any problem I face head-on and say FUCK IT.  This story might sound corny to you guys, but It's my story.  TTGL gave me the boost I need to get out of the hole I was digging myself.  Just talking about this, I'm gonna rewatch it again.

Better Fights and Animation? I remember thinking nothing could ever be better than that series animation wise.
>> ARTICLE
I remember watching TTGL shortly after it aired and again when the dub came thinking its the best goddamn thing since sliced bread.  

Then not long ago I got on Netflix and it was on there so I watched it and noticed the animation looks somehow dated and stiff than I originally thought.  

Both movies gave me multiple orgasms simultaneously though.

Watch that clip and be amazed
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying not too, I'll watch the movies soon. You had me at "2 Movies." 
>> ARTICLE
It depends on your perspective... Personally, while I found the movies a fun watch and I enjoyed seeing them, I still find the fights of the series superior. It's like the difference between a well-timed and orchestrated fireworks finale and someone lighting up a fireworks storage warehouse. Hell yeah, it's ridiculous to see so much go off at once, you should definitely give it a look, but it's not "better." 
>> ARTICLE
honestly....the feeling of the series final fight is great. it's over the top, way over the top, but it's just right. that clip's final battle actually felt slow based on the amount of action actually going on. really the only thing that was missing in the series was [](/s "the spiral energy Kamina")

Why is this downvoted so much ?

"too much fanservice"
>> ARTICLE
Ah ok. I've never seen it so I wouldn't know. 
>> ARTICLE
You should.
>> ARTICLE
Just opened reddit and saw I was downvoted so much. I was just saying what I saw it was. They could've done without getting almost hentai with Kill La Kill. TTGL was something that everyone can enjoy, and with the themes that Kill La Kill put up, many would be put off by it I imagine. You could show TTGL to anyone and they'll appreciate the epicness of it, but with Kill La Kill you just can't. 
>> ARTICLE
Truth, my partner doesn't want to watch it and she loved ttgl
>> ARTICLE
See, too much fan service is not only at times, but often a detriment.
>> ARTICLE
And that's fine. If an artist aims for the masses, the result is generic. *Alien* is too scary for some people, *From Dusk Till Dawn* is too B-movie, and so on, and yet it's exactly those qualities that attract the fans.

The greatest advantage of anime is that it's a niche medium. For example it doesn't have to care about the public's opinion of what is a 'good' amount of sex or violence, in contrast to American summer flicks that have a carefully tuned mixture of both. Only in anime you can have [a boy turn into a cancer-like mutation, complete with balls](http://i.minus.com/iwYfBDDOZYN6M.gif), or [a same-sex romantic incest love story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4535/Candy%E2%98%86Boy), or [cyborgs discussing human nature while hunting cyber-criminals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB-ik-Bpl0c).

I know I'm just a single opinion, I just view that its a bit too much and became somehow a detriment to the series itself. I guess Trigger will always be Trigger.

I'm actually watching Kill La Kill right now, and it's exactly the reason I'm rewatching TTGL :P

This is the second best "robot-merge" scene of **anywhere**.

The first you ask?  That would be when Megas XLR merges with S-Force by forcefully inserting his limbs into the robot animals.

Also, TTGL is the best by mere fact that in the end they [fight on a friggin' galaxy.  A Galaxy man!!](/spoiler)

GATTAI DA!
>> ARTICLE
That was the moment I realized TTGL > 99% of the other anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Watch more anime.
>> ARTICLE
I watch enough.
>> ARTICLE
Evidently not. TTGL isn't that good. It might beat Sturgeon's Law, but it isn't better than 99% of all anime. You're missing out.
>> ARTICLE
Your opinion is yours alone. If you'll read what I originally wrote, I didn't write "all anime". TTGL being better than 99% of the anime I've watched may be an exaggeration but it's close enough.
>> ARTICLE
I know you didn't write 'all anime'. I did. There are better ones in terms of a sensible plot and a more sane universe. TTGL was (apparently) a parody of the big robot genre. It is meant to be silly.

Not to mention, you're likely placing TTGL over things like Redline, Eureka Seven and its incredible soundtrack, Katanagatari and its enthralling story, Mawaru Penguindrum with its jaw-dropping drama (and music), FLCL with its eccentricity, Madoka and its powerful episode 11, Cowboy Bebop's style, Ghost in the Shell, Spice and Wolf's insight, and many, many Studio Ghibli works. This is just a sample of well made anime. It beggars belief that you would state that TTGL was absolutely better than all of these and many others.

You made an objective statement, or at least stated your opinion as fact. If your original observation was subjective, then my response still stands. I think that you are missing out on better series. That's my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
[Shameless self-link](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ibv2g/what_are_your_must_see_anime/c22krji) to a critical evaluation of Gurren Lagann (mainly of the characters and depth of themes) because I don't want to retype the essay. If you want to discuss production values, that's fine, but it basically boils down to genre differences. 

All of the anime you listed are of completely different genres, so of course you can't objectively state one is "better". A few of them overlap, but you can't really compare TTGL to Bebop beyond a few pacing issues in the early former which are comparable to certain middling episodes of the latter.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished that entire essay. I agree. You might want to consider freelance writing for an anime news site.
>> ARTICLE
My statement is my stance. TTGL is better than most anime I've seen because of how much I enjoyed it, not how insane I perceive the universe to be or whether it is a parody of the big robot genre, which I'm not exactly a fan of.

I haven't seen Redline yet but when I do, I'll make my own decision.

Eureka Seven was not very enjoyable because the main character was annoying. I dropped it after giving it many chances to redeem itself.

I loved Katanagatari and while I think it's one of the better anime recently made, I place TTGL above Katanagatari.

Mawaru Penguindrum was fun in the beginning but as I watched more of it it became less enjoyable. I will pick it up again when I feel like it and I have some time.

FLCL was one of the first anime that showed me what anime could achieve and because of that, it's on a pedestal I would never dream of smashing.

I plan to watch Madoka but I haven't gotten around to it because I've had it spoiled on accident a couple times and I don't want to go into it with artificially high expectations.

Cowboy Bebop is a great anime and well loved by many but I enjoyed TTGL much more than I did Cowboy Bebop. If we were to talk about Samurai Champloo, however, then I would actually say I like SC more than TTGL.

Ghost in the Shell is the same as FLCL and it really turned on a light in my then childish mind when I saw it. For anime I've put on a pedestal, whether out of nostalgia or not, I very rarely try to compare it with more recent anime I've seen like TTGL. Why bother? I know it's one of my favorites.

While Spice and Wolf is deep and insightful, I still enjoyed and like TTGL more.

Out of the Studio Ghibli works, my favorite is Princess Mononoke. While Spirited Away was good, I couldn't get into it and I don't see why there is so much hype over it.

Yes, there are anime better than TTGL, but not many, in my opinion, are more enjoyable.

I stated my opinion as fact in regards to me. I don't know you nor your views, how can I honestly say, "TTGL is better than 99% of all anime for everyone, and that's a fact."? How do you even interpret what I said as that?

Besides, I don't think I'm missing out on as much as you believe. I assert(in my opinion) that manga is better than anime because it's more enjoyable for me and tells a better story for me.

I'm not saying your opinion is wrong. I'm saying I don't care what your opinion is because TTGL is still one of my favorites due to my own preferences.
>> ARTICLE
And here we arrive at my underlying point: pedantry (me, not you).

If you meant that you enjoyed it more, then say it was one of the most enjoyable animes that you've seen. When I say that I think that something is better or good, I mean that I think that it is well accomplished and objectively and/or technically good in some or many areas. When I said that Eureka Seven had an incredible soundtrack, I meant that the soundtrack was actually impressive. It was an interesting mix of orchestral themes with electronic/house/acid house/trance songs sat comfortably in place with each other.

I personally enjoyed Gundam SEED a lot. I don't think it's that good, however. It was prone to laziness in animation, clichd lines, beam spam and seemed formulaic. I still think of it fondly. I've also just dropped Rinne no Lagrange because I wasn't enjoying, but it was still technically good, apart from the plot so far.

I should probably take the Spice and Wolf comment back, by the way. It's probably more an illusion of insight, as opposed to actually being insightful about anything too relevant. Otherwise, if I mentioned a particular trait in my list, I thought that that trait was technically/objectively well done. I don't really use how much I enjoyed something to rate it.

As for:
>I stated my opinion as fact in regards to me. I don't know you nor your views, how can I honestly say, "TTGL is better than 99% of all anime for everyone, and that's a fact."? How do you even interpret what I said as that?

This is the Internet. People do it all the time. In fact, they do it so often that someone might one day snap and, say, go off on a four or five comment bout of grumpiness.

Another way to state your assertion would be, 'I enjoy manga more than I do anime because I can immerse myself more in the story.' At the moment, it kind of sounds like manga is better than anime *because* you prefer it. Opinions can still be objective when well qualified. That's the point of critics, right?
>> ARTICLE
There are many ways to convey one meaning and while what I wrote can mean more than I anticipated, I intentionally left it ambiguous enough and exaggerated because I thought it not only sounded better, but fit in the thread better. To overcomplicate a sentence can at times destroy the flow or meaning to another. It's too narrow, too detailed.

It's obvious you have a better command of the English language than I do and you take words in a more literal sense but we as individuals grade things differently, not just us, but everyone. When I talk about one anime being better than the other, I grade entirely on my enjoyment because that's all that matters to me. A show can be deep, thought provoking and have the best sound track I've ever heard, but if I can't enjoy it because of my own pet peeves, I'm not going to continue watching it for much longer. I can justify giving it a second chance, a third, or even more chances but when I don't enjoy the time I'm spending for my entertainment, it's a waste of my time. This is what happened with Mawaru Penguin. I know it's a deep show with lots of symbolism, but that doesn't matter to me. I enjoyed it the first couple episodes but as I kept watching, I found myself bored and wanting to do something else. I don't dislike Mawaru Penguin and I plan to try it again because I know there's good in there, but if I can't enjoy it right now, I'm not going to watch it right now, nor will I think highly of it because that's how I grade anime.

I know Koihime Musou is a terrible anime that panders to Otaku and Yuri fans but I enjoyed it enough to keep watching it. While it wasn't technically good, I would still rate it well because it achieved what I want, to be entertained.

Jeez, I wrote a lot of words which state the same things over and over, oh well. I guess my point is, I understand what you're saying and while I know you understand, I still wrote all this crap and I don't feel like deleting it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure you realize this, but you just criticized TTGL for its nonsensical plot and insane universe and then praised FLCL.
>> ARTICLE
I praised FLCL for its eccentricity. From what I remember, the overall plot was sensible enough, if rather symbolic, and the universe more structured. TTGL's plot was simply the old shounen maxim of 'bad guy comes along; get stronger by being macho', with everything else, including the universe, being inconsequential.
>> ARTICLE
I've never had the chance to watch TTGL, I don't even know why I'm reading this thread (but I think that the possibility of Yoko's picture being here is part of the reason)...but one thing I can tell you: I don't know whether you're right or wrong, (as I said, I haven't watched it, so I can't judge it) but you can't seriously think that someone will agree with you when you're criticising one of the favourite anime of this subreddit in a thread dedicated to it...
>> ARTICLE
No, I get what you're saying. I was just joking that at a glance FLCL is completely insane and nonsensical and has a reputation for that. Though certainly if you really watch it and try to understand it, then the meaning becomes apparent.

In regards to TTGL, personally I love it for it's nonsense because it's self-aware nonsense. It's not a show you're supposed to think about, it's designed purely to appeal to emotion and at least for me it accomplished just that better than nearly any other anime I've seen. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. TTGL is definitely fucking awesome, but there are so many more anime that are just as great or better.

You have to remember that there's a *lot* of anime out there you don't see or even hear about, and it's for a good reason.

Haha, I'm not looking to assert my opinion over others. Because this is a thread about how awesome TTGL is, I figured I'd comment on how much I enjoyed it in relation to all the other anime I've seen. If someone else has a different opinion, more power to them, but he's not going to convince me my opinion is wrong. That's all this whole tangent is.

This actually made me stop watching the series cause I thought it was pretty stupid. I didn't pick it up again until I saw [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cV2NXrznv4) amv by NightHawk at AnimeExpo 2010 and it made me want to watch it simply for the second half. I find I'm one of the few people who thinks the seconds half of the show is far superior to the first half.

Have a quick question. How is the english dub compared to the japanese dub? Just wondering which one I should watch.
>> ARTICLE
If you want quality all around, stick with japanese. The english dub is okay, and while both Simon and Leeron (Steven Blum!) have great english performances, it doesn't make up for a lackluster overall dub. Kamina's voice actor is especially bad. 
>> ARTICLE
Both are well done.  If you plan on watching the movies though (and I certainly recommend them as they are probably 10x better than the series), they only come subbed - so you might as well get used to the Japanese va's.

its awesome, actually better in some aspects

Some people, I don't know why, hate Kamina's english voice actor. I, for one, love it. I had to watch the two movies in the Japanese dub, and the English dub does it for me more.

Fine.

Post #1: You're preaching to the choir. The first part of the series is generally better loved than the second. This is either an attempt to garner karma or to promote your post to the top. It's also possible that it's nothing sinister, but them's the breaks.

Don't worry, that's practically the only filler. There's maybe a recap episode after the first arc finishes, and then the rest of the show is straight plot.

Next you are gonna say FLCL?
>> ARTICLE
A bit unrelated, I remember finding out about Hiroyuki Imaishi. My top four were FLCL, TTGL, Diebuster, and Panty and Stocking, in that order. I was absolutely ecstatic to find that the same person directed every single one of them.

It's funny because even though it hasn't ended yet, Kill La Kill is actually my number 3 now. Top 5 all by the same person. I can't wait to see what he does after KLK.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Gurren Lagann and although I really like Kill la Kill, I don't get the same skin crawling "this is going to be ridiculous and awesome" feeling I get with Gurren Lagann.  :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's probably because Kill La Kill made it to low Earth orbit, whereas Gurren Lagann went into some silly spiral universe where a head is somehow a body and you can throw other galaxies(?) with ease. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel the opposite. I had shivers down to my very core with TTGL during the last few episodes with KLK I am just getting pumped. I think it's TTGLs music it was so good.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda agree, while their main insert songs I think are equally good in quality and conveying a message "Fight the power" and "Don't lose your way", I think TTGL had a better overall OST.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, KLK is awesome in it's own right but it really can't bask in the same light as TTGL IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I blew through TTGL in 2 days when I watched it. Because of that, my experience with Kill La Kill has been much different since I've watching it weekly from episode 1. Although I absolutely loved TTGL, the anticipation of  watching Kill la Kill each week is something I never got to experience with TTGL. Because of these vastly different experiences, I don't think I can fairly compare them until after I finish Kill la Kill and it marinates for awhile.

The ship they got in kill la kill is definitely an omage to the Dai Gunzan.

I also find it very funny that both Simon and Ryuuko are holding their 'partners' Nia and Mako. It just adds so much more to the whole reference factor.

is kill la kill good?  I loved Gurren Lagann.  
>> ARTICLE
It has that same crazy, insane ramp up towards the end, but is marred by excess fanservice, much more so than Gurren Lagann was.

It doesn't really start to get good until 10 episodes in when you start finding out the character's motivations and some back story, but just before the half way point it improves dramatically.

Still has a mother feeling up her younger daughter, which is creepy as fuck, so up to you.

Haha after Bebop and TTGL's endings have been spoiled for me I've been extra careful to not spoil stuff for others.

That scene was arguably the most hardcore "mecha" fight of any anime ever, in spite of its tragic ending.
>> ARTICLE
It was just so...raw.  It wasn't a beautiful ballet, it was savage and brutal, and more than a little cathartic.
>> ARTICLE
The key word in that fight is "weight." You could *feel* how heavy that blade she twirled around was. This is why the rebuilds, despite the spectacular fight scenes, I believe just won't scratch the surface of the mass produced Eva fight unless they pay attention to weight. All the Eva fights in the rebuild consists of the Evas prancing and jumping around like acrobatic fairys and it feels more like a shonen anime than a mecha one. 

(Just to clarify though, i'm not bashing on the rebuild, in fact I usually say to watch 1.1 and skip the first 8 episodes to any of my friends who want to watch the series)

Saitama punches Aizen through the chest

Aizen looks gravely injured but then smirks

Accelerator

You win this thread.

I think it would depend on what timeframe for accelerator.

This is correct. He's probably the only human that could take Saitama's punch.

I don't know. Aleister or [](/s "Awiass") could probably brush it off.
>> ARTICLE
By not actually taking the punch
>> ARTICLE
still counts.

i think they could fight into a stalemate. accelerator cant really hurt saitama and either
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how much damage Saitama can take. Accelerator can not only reflect damage back, but he can multiply it thousands of not millions of times. 
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I've seen Raildex, but Accel could just reverse the blood flow in Saitama and he'd die since he's just a normal human, no?
>> ARTICLE
I believe accelerator has to touch Saitama to do that 
>> ARTICLE
[OPM Manga Spoilers](/s "No. In One's webcomic version, saitama fought tatsumaki and she tried to kill him by reversing his aura/energy flow but he just stood there and said "woah my skin's feeling all funny"")

can accel wound saitama to reverse the blood flow?
>> ARTICLE
Accelerator's power is to turn ANY vector

Saitama's shtick is to be so strong that he can defeat anyone in any punch.

The question is who you believe overturns who.

Also /r/whowouldwin for people who haven't seen it.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama only had speed and strength. Accelerator can control anything with speed and a direction. Saitama would have to destroy the planet in order to beat him. 
>> ARTICLE
Which is still victory
>> ARTICLE
Kinda. They would both suffocate.
>> ARTICLE
Except that Accelerator is not strong enough to handle that magnitude of an explosion. [OPM Manga](/s "And Saitama also fought a portion of the Boros fight in space IIRC")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "He was only in space because he got hit into it. He jumped back down after that.")
>> ARTICLE
> Except that Accelerator is not strong enough to handle that magnitude of an explosion. 

What? Yes he is. His power is vector control. All he has to do is slap a negative sign on any impact and it's reflected, no matter how big, or fast it is. It's simple math. He has no limit to what he can reflect. For example, If the force was 10^1000000 towards accelerator, then all his power does is multiply a negative sign making it -(10^100000). His only physical weakness is that he needs to breathe.
>> ARTICLE
So then you're saying his ability was the same as when he was level 1? He has room to grow because he can theoretically [](/s "reach a level 6.") 
>> ARTICLE
As far as I remember, he's always been a level 5. At least he was a level 5 as a little kid.
>> ARTICLE
>It's simple math

Okay let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

For Accelerator, the smartest esper in the city, it is. His reflection calculations have nothing on the calculations needed for his other skills.

Not only him, like I said above, these 4 "Medaka. Kumagawa. Ajimu. lihiko." could all take on Saitama.

Medaka is even more broken than Saitama, her power is to copy and improve her enemy powers. And she keeps every power she ever copied.

Kumagawa has All fiction and Book maker. ( he would eventually lose because he cannonically cannot win ).

Ajimu has infinite skills, one of them would beat the shit out of saitama.

lihiko can reflect pretty much everything at full power, so I dont know if he would win, but he wouldt get one shot.

That's totally true. With Book Maker, Saitama will lose his "powers" and go down to Kumagawa's level.

Alternatively, Zenkichi Devil Style.

I don't know about that, I don't see Saitama as some glass cannon. He's shown to be pretty durable. He rarely concerns himself with dodging and just takes all attacks head on, unbothered by them.

It might be possible for Saitama with his incredible power to punch himself out, but I think that would take more than one. Then again that goes against the premise. [Manga Spoilers](/s "There have been a couple enemies that could take a 'normal' punch, or even a few. Even when he uses a 'serious punch', it seems he may not be giving it his all.

[His power is that he can defeat any enemy in *one punch*. His power is that he is un-defeatable](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Invincibility)

The only way he'll ever be challenged is if he finds someone who is equally as unchallenged as him


>> ARTICLE
Pretty much, the only people who can handle him at his max power are people who are even more hax than his hax powers. The only people who can really do that are already mentioned--STTGL, Demonbane, possibly the upper-level Umineko witches. Might be one or two I'm missing, but not really.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on the characters gimmicks.

Saitama can defeat anyone in one punch if he can hit them. Kind of hard to hit a god of destruction when he simply decomposes your body if you even attempt to touch him. Kind of hard to hit Goku who travels across the universe in a second and has galaxy shattering powers. Kind of hard to hit an Aizen who has hypnotized you into punching something else. Kind of hard to beat the power of absolute control - "Obey Me".
>> ARTICLE
We have not seen Saitama go anywhere near all out. In the webcomic shit gets pretty insane, but Saitama's full extent is still lightyears from being revealed. His power has no upper limit, and it defies any logic applied to it.

[]( /s "otherwise, how else is he able to stand against Tatsumaki? The chick is a ridiculously powerful psychic. By your logic she should be able to immobolise saitama easily.")
>> ARTICLE
No, cause he can punch or serious punch. And it's a difference, he is just too damn strong. It's not some weird ability that his punch overrides everything and kills in one 

The premise is he is too damn strong for himself 
>> ARTICLE
Imo it will ruin the series if he ever finds someone who he can physically punch and not kill. Mind you, I don't apply this to anyone who is actually fast enough/has mind powers enabling them to avoid the punches. But if he finds someone who he can seriously try to kill, and fail, it would ruin the whole point.
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean it's a comedy, so they wouldn't throw away the premise of him being too strong. 

I was just pointing out how he is just that strong and not that he has some weird power that he just insta-kill as that guy said. As shown by his ability to pull his punches. 

[Later on to go with your point](/s "He does fight someone who makes him have to put in effort, granted he doesn't use all his power but he does use a substantial amount, iirc more than 50% into his punch")

luffy is right, because of his devil fruit ability. Also, Goku is basically like a god. I'm not saying saitama is incredible, but compared to the universe saitama is and compared to the power of DBZ's universe, I don't think Saitama would win, cause it's not proven that  his "ability" is literally "invincible and always one punches someone", he justs hasn't found a strong enough opponent.

Anohana... don't know about that though, haven't seen it.


>> ARTICLE
Luffy takes damage if the hits are substantial, like during the Rob Lucci fight. Saitama's punches are at least planet busting tier so Luffy would get stomped.
>> ARTICLE
>Anohana... don't know about that though, haven't seen it.

I was talking about this one sorry I wasnt too clear
>> ARTICLE
No one. Saitama's power is literally "to be an invincible hero who can defeat any enemy in one punch." There is no amount of plot armor or actual armor that will stop him if he is using the Serious Series moves. 
>> ARTICLE
You're missing the point of the anime, though.

If Saitama used his full power, he'd destroy the universe.

The fitness test isn't even 10% of his total power. It's not even 1%.

However, I do think Goku, SSJgodSSJ would put up a semi-decent fight against Saitama, as we don't really know the full extent of his power. Yeh he can kill gods and all, but what would happen if he used his absolute maximum power for ONE guy?

Honestly, who do they expect to buy that? Even if I had loads of money I wouldn't buy it at that price on principle.

I don't care what kind of special features it has or how many blu-ray discs it has, it is not worth that price. My price point is about a tenth of that ($55).
>> ARTICLE
It's meant for the same type of people in America as those Japanese who buy the JP BDs.
>> ARTICLE
That price is actually not that bad considering the market. Fate/Zero sells for around the same price in Japan if you want all 25 episodes. Madoka Magica has the same per-episode cost currently as well. Hyouka is bit more expensive per episode, etc, etc.

>> ARTICLE
That is still ridiculously high.

Personally would not even buy it no matter how good it is for the price because it's still $600 dollars. That is the cost of a PS3 at release. It costs a whole fucking console and a blu ray player. Just let that sink in.

You can do so much more things with $600 than buy a blu ray of a single show. You can buy blu rays of so many other series and movies. You can buy a new 27 inch monitor or a pair of new speakers to improve your viewing experience of other series. You can literally build a new computer with that money.

I absolutely love Tengen Toppa and would want a blu ray, but I will never spend $600 on it.
>> ARTICLE
How is that price point even logical to the point of justifying it to other people? It's a ridiculously inflated price, if it had to come with something to make it 600 dollars then the title of the product shouldn't be "Bluray discs" since that is maybe 1/10 of the cost.  This is why people pirate shit.
>> ARTICLE
No, *you* wouldn't buy it at that price, but i can assure you 20-25k people in Japan will, given the popularity of the show. Unfortunately for you, that number doesn't increase much if you lower the price (they have tried), so it isn't viable *at all* to have a cheaper price, at least not initially.

EDIT: Numbers

It's an import. No one would dream of selling that blueray at that price in the states unless it was mounted on pure gold. 



The Japanese DVD / Blueray consumer is an entirely different animal from the US consumer. Articles on the subject creep up from time to time but I don't have any handy. Suffice to say, half the justification of the price is at some level "nerd bling" since only the truely devoted would drop that kind of money on it.

The past beneath his feet in the stone of the Carmel, he joins with his comrades to smash today and rebuild tomorrow!

He's strong, he's determined, and he's untiring in his never-ending struggle to bust right through the heavens themselves!

And if you ask people just who the hell they're talking about, they'll tell you he's ME, eaturbrainz-sama of Da'am!  Just who the hell do you think I am!?

> Btw, you're probably tired of talking about it but what makes Chuunibyou so good?

Never tired about it!

I can't compare it to anything else; nothing then, now, or ever will come close to its splendor. It's mostly because of Rikka and the other characters, but the top-notch comedy, the wonderful story, the endearing moments, the slick art and animation, the beautiful sound-work, and literally everything else comes together to form perfection.

It does everything right in my eyes one-hundred times over. :3

Wow this is great! No need to be embarrassed!

If I were to change one thing though to this drawing, it would be to give Simon a less manly face :P the masculine jawline makes his face a little too old for his body.

But other than that. This is wonderful!!
>> ARTICLE
Duly noted!! Thanks for your input, I will work harder!
>> ARTICLE
I'll start with the positives: I like the colours used and the proportions! The colours are nice and harmonious.

However, their expressions could be improved. Simon doesn't look particularly excited. When It comes to facial expressions, eyebrows and pupil placement plays an important role. Lift his eyelids away from his pupils. It will make him look more 'in wonder' of his surroundings. A personal preference on my part would be to give kamina a toothy grin or make his smile hook upwards to suit his personality. Study facial expressions from various cartoons(both anime and western cartoons). If you have problems finding a good anime for that, try kill la kill.

As for the overall 'togetherness' of the piece, yuko seems like an entirely separate object. Simon and kamina are facing one direction while she's staring at the viewer with her body turning away. They are in the 'same' environment and she should be interacting on something close to her since she sits on the same platform as them.  What you could to is to arc her back closer to kamina and have her look at either one of the characters or where they are looking. There are many many other ways to improve on the composition if you have other ideas you would like to share!

Lastly, lighting and shadow. It seems like the lighting is coming from all sides and doesn't make sense. An idea i have is to have no light from the bottom. It forces the viewer's eye to travel upwards to the main focus, which i presume to be their faces. You can hide some things in shadow to save time on painting.

I hope this huge chunk of stuff helps. Till then, keep improving and we hope to see more!
>> ARTICLE
Hey Acataeono!

Thank you so much for taking your time to write up a critique for this. Everything you've said is pretty spot on, and I'll do my best to apply everything you've written on my future works.

I would say most of the parts of this illustration that need improvement are because of comfort zone issues and expressions are pretty daunting when it comes to retaining style consistency while making them expressive enough. So I will try harder!

Thank you for your support and again, for your critique! I really appreciate it :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha i know what you mean. Its really tough to break out of something you are comfortable with drawing. Anime is not exactly the best medium to perform expression studies, with some exceptions. Most eyes drawn are flat and make no sense if you really think about it.

My advice would be to break down the face and its components into simple shapes. Don't stress yourself over the little details like eye lashes, nostrils, etc. They will come into play naturally when you've figured how the lines and anatomy of eyes work. Remember, the face is a 3D OBJECT!

All the best!
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, this is so great! I'm a huge TTGL fan, so I'll hope you consider making some more! :)
>> ARTICLE
That bonus video is downright adorable, and the picture is great. Take your own advice and believe in the you that believes in yourself!
>> ARTICLE
The colours are very nice, I could probably learn a lot from you in terms of how you do it.

But problems... ehn. You kinda suffer a lot from same-face syndrome. All three characters have essentially the same face, drawn in the same perspective even. Which is okay for Kamina, a little off for Yoko, and totally totally wrong for kid-Simon.

There's various small anatomy glitches here and there. Simon's arms are too short. Yoko's head is turned too far back to be realistic. Kamina would probably benefit from a different head-to-body ratio - he is bigger, in the end.

Your shading is inconsistent. By that I mean different parts of the image imply a different light direction. This kinda undermines the three dimensionality of the image.

Still, there's good stuff. I especially like how you did Kamina's musclature. That's very tricky to pull off.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your feedback!

I'm so thrilled by how much critique I'm getting by posting this to reddit because I felt like I've been stagnant in my improvement for a while now since no one ever really says anything. So thanks! It's really nice to know what areas need improvement so I can work harder on them.

Please look forward to my future works! I hope I'll be able to improve on some of the things you mentioned. 

Have a lovely day Fangzzz! PLEASE BELIEVE IN THE ME THAT BELIEVES IN ME!

this is very, very good all except one thing.

and I am kinda a stickler for this thing more then people usually are, so there is a significant chance I am over-reacting.

you have same-face syndrome.

Haha maybe?

I'm really conscious of style consistency and sometimes overdo it. If you don't mind, could you elaborate on why you feel this way? It's an aspect I would love to improve on.
>> ARTICLE
well, it has very good color lines and shading and is just overall good and I really like it, even aspects of composition I dont know the names for are well executed.

if you mean my slight criticism, the faces simply seem very similar to me, this is either my over-reaction (I sometimes have trouble telling faces apart and people think I am crazy when I say robert downey jr and hugh jackman look almost exactly the same) or its a very comman pitfall, I wish I could help you but I am actually a terrible artist, if you really need advice ask someone whose art you like if you have same face syndrome and follow their advice, all he artists I know are happy to help people looking for advice( but they are super insecure so they might tell you to look for someone better, dont listen when they say that)

Now that Gurren Lagann is brought up, I need help. I watched 18 episodes and can't get into it, every episode feels like a chore and the story seems so uneventful. Can someone please shine a new light on the story that could make it more enjoyable for me? Everyone treats it like a masterpiece and if feels like I'm missing out.

It took me three tries to watch the show. The first time I got to episode 5 and couldn't bare anymore and the same thing happened the second time around. However, when I watched it the third time I was engulfed by the story and amazing characters. So maybe you just aren't interested by it at the moment and should prob get back to it later. Don't bother watching it if you aren't enjoying yourself. It's a work of art when you want it to be.

Madoka magica Rebellion. The original series had a pretty conclusive ending, there weren't any loose ends really and it was an ending that you could both leave or use as a setup for further seasons.

I liked Rebellion's ending a lot, I thought it was a pretty good movie, but it really makes me wanna know what comes after. Where would the story go from there? It was pretty clear what would generally happen after the ending of the original series, but with Rebellion's ending it's not really clearly spelled out and I wanna know what *happens.*
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Rebellion, but I hated the ending. 
>> ARTICLE
To me it was the opposite, I hated the movie as it seemed to lag too long on the fanservice but loved the ending because it finally showed some plot progression.

I like the fact that it opens infinite possibilities about how everything will work out rather than going for the standard happy ending. I just wish the path to arrive there made more sense than just "miscommunication kills".

It is the 3rd and last (currently) movie. It should be watched after the series, as the first 2 movies are simply recaps.

Well the Panty and Stocking and is courently thatg one that both and love and hate.
>> ARTICLE
That ending was, IMO, really dumb because it seems like a controversial ending for the sake of a controversial ending. 

The show overall has had no hints of real drama and all of the sudden they throw out a twist, mostly just to fuck with people. I feel like I didn't actually gain anything from that ending. Like, what is at the end of that?

Unless they have a second season on which they can build on top of it, it's pretty terrible.


>> ARTICLE
I disagree a little bit--because all it was was Studio Gainax making fun of their own mindscrewy Gainax endings (Eva/TTGL) as well as of American cartoons that keep coming up with hilarious ways to stretch out their material and jump the shark as a result.  

I do think they were hoping for a season 2 also but were fine with getting a last poke of fun at themselves.  They poked fun at Eva and it's fans in FLCL for goodness sake, expecting any sort of traditional ending wouldn't be like them...

Probably one of the cringiest, most fucked up non-gore anime I have ever seen. Every action Haruki made had me like "what the fuck man."

Kill la Kill. I loved the series to death, but the ending always felt a little rushed to me. Like they could have had another episode just for the fight and to wrap things up. I mean, we got the OVA, but that still didn't feel completely right.


The original ep 24 ending has grown on me a bit, but I sometimes wonder "what if?..."
>> ARTICLE
I agree and the only thing that redeemed it for me where I loved it was that OVA.  I still would have loved more but that wrapped up enough of my questions where I'm content.....though wouldn't say no to any sequels

Sort of felt like a reference to that big famous Gainax anime but skirting around it. I enjoyed it for sure but it did feel like they wasted time on earlier arcs when they could have developed that point further.

The Disappearence ending was great, wrapping up the movie and the story in a satisfiying manner. I hate the fact that the ending made me feel satisfied even when knowing there's more to the story.

That said, after a long period of time, I've become completely pissed there's no continuation to the story. Haruhi S3 when???

[Not quite](/s "From what I could tell from the interview and comments, what the creators said actually best translates into Lelouch is "screen dead" meaning that for all intents and purposes he is dead as he will not be in any Code Geass adaptations that happen in the future, but they never actually said the other theories were wrong.")

Samurai Champloo [Spoilers] (/s "I really hated that none of the main 3 died because they had so many brushes with death. Hell when Jin uses his move there's a flashback where his master says his chance of living is basically nonexistent. Then after talking about how Mugen and Fuu were his only friends and how he hated being alone, he just ends up alone again. Also when they all split up at the end it's all happy, but in reality Fuu probably eventually died getting into trouble with nobody to protect her. However, I did think it was a fitting ending for the show and made all the concepts come together well.")

I don't think Fate/Zero's ending is conclusive in any way and if you haven're read the VN it's really confusing. After I rewatched it, having read the VN I still don't think it's conclusive, but I also don't think it needs to be, considering that F/Z is a prequel after all. It's just how it needs to be, tying the loose ends that had to be tied and leaving the ones, from which the parent story would eventually come to be, unresolved. Personally I like the ending a lot since it is tragic in a lot of ways but is also equally (maybe) optimistic. As for Kiritsugu,[](/s "saving Shiro and raising him really meant a lot for him, don't think of him as having lived his last years miserably.")
>> ARTICLE
I went into fate/zero completely blind and I loved the absolutely tragic ending with the faint glimmer of hope it's part of the reason I like to recommend anime only watchers watch f/z and Then ubw  because knowing the ending of zero makes shiro much easier to root for even if it's just for his father's sake.
>> ARTICLE
I'll halfass my explanation to the F/Z spoiler [F/Z](/s "The grail was corrupted and tried to choose Kiritsugu to become the winner of the War but refuses so he orders Saber to destroy it. The destruction made the corruption (Angra Mainyu) pour forth into Fuyuki City reviving Kirei because he was chosen by the corruption and Gil materialised from the mud.")
>> ARTICLE
I actually loved the Samurai Champloo ending, a very simple ending that fit perfectly with the show
>> ARTICLE
I agree, I would have absolutely hated if something like what the guy above you said.

It would have added some, IMO,way too much unnecessary drama. It would have felt like drama for the sake of drama and trying to be "edgy". I don't think the show would have really gained anything from an ending like that.

The way it ended was perfect for what it was IMO, a fun and at times depressing romp through Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think that people were just expecting it because those kind of endings are so popular in anime. I think people think this style is "realistic" or something, and I know some people who watch anime for the fact that it usually doesn't pull punches like Western TV.

Lucy's sentimental speech was emotional and everything, Natsu was being epic as always, but the cliffhanger ending, URGH. At least I was late to the game to I had the second season to start on.

Persona 4: The Animation. I love it because it's Persona 4, and Persona 4 is amazing. I hate it because it's not a good representation of the source material.

Why is it so much?
>> ARTICLE
An anime makes most of its money on Blu-ray sales, and weirdos in Japan will pay a lot for those blu-rays. Americans, however, will usually not. This means that a lot of American versions of the blu-rays are often cheaper than the Japanese versions. It also means that a crafty otaku will just double-import the American version since it will still be cheaper than the Japanese version. To prevent this, it seems that they have made both versions insanely expensive. 
>> ARTICLE
People need to use the word "crafty" more.
>> ARTICLE
It is such a useful word.
>> ARTICLE
Except this is a Japanese release with English subtitles. It's still an import and there is no North American blu-ray release yet.
>> ARTICLE
In that case, it's the normal Japanese Blu-ray price. Maybe a little cheaper if they aren't asking for our left testicle. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh. My mistake. Maybe if they do release a North American version( unlikely) it will be less insane. 
>> ARTICLE
There's actually a UK company who's going to license a blu-ray box so it should hopefully have similar pricing to a NA version.
>> ARTICLE
So the anime has 27 episodes

Each Episode is approx 24 mins

Thats 648 minutes total *(approx etc...)*

The Blu ray was $568 total

Thats $0.87 a minute

**So watching this opening would cost you approx $1.31. Time to pay up.**

I bought it, no regrets. I kind of look at it as paying for other things I've watched in the past as well, as I've got a decent sized collection, but it's nowhere near the amount of stuff that I've actually watched. It's the kind of collectors item that is right up my alley though, I can understand why the majority of people wouldn't think of it at that price point. 
>> ARTICLE
I could, but I won't because it's a matter of principal for me. I can't justify spending that kind of money on something when it could be substantially less, but the distribution company limits it's distribution. Anime distribution has always annoyed the shit out of me living in the US. Some shows you can get the entire thing for less than $40, others it's almost impossible to get the whole thing without buying individual volumes for $50-70 a piece, or a box set for $150+

I've never understood that since the shows that are often limited are some of the most popular ones.

I'm fifty fifty on whether I should spend five hundred dollars on a TV series or not. Now if this was cowboy bebop...well....

How can someone be fifty-fifty on it?

Either you're insanely rich and money isn't an object, in which case of course you'll get it because TTGL is worth it, or you're not and you won't because of that.

You don't have to be even mildly rich to drop $500; it does make it an investment though, but some people would rather buy a collectible than take a cruise or something.
>> ARTICLE
When it's five months of post-rent, facilities, food salary, it's a bit much.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I said it's still an investment, like most things people would save their money for.
>> ARTICLE
Five hundred is still a lot to spend on a bluray set. Doesn't mean I can't afford it. It means I try to pay what something should be worth. A TV series isn't worth five hundred anywhere.

Then you probably shouldn't buy it. Unless you would be throwing that money away regardless, don't. I think that's what he meant.

What about people that just want the HD remake of movies? I mean, TV anime was good, but movies had more and bigger ~~mecha~~ Ganmen, skipped stillbirth 4th episode and all of the fillers, [](/s "less characters died,"), **EXPLOSIONS**...
>> ARTICLE
I thought the spoiler was a bad part of the movies.

I liked the earlier 'filler' episodes a lot, and I feel like only watching the movies paints a very different picture than watching the series. Hell, my roommate was asking me [spoiler](/s "who Rossiu was when he had a gun to his head. Which was also a lot better done in the TV show, I thought. Hell, she still only knows Kittan as 'Bananaman'")

>  can I interrupt for a second? Why the hell do I have to type this clusterfuck of a spoiler code? Brackets solely for the sake of spoiler's source? That's rarely used and awkward.

So, mods - less anime, more attention to the details. End of offtop.

What thoomfish said. The typical "/spoiler" spoiler-tags are useless if anyone replies to you with a spoiler, because they'll just look like a link to the page http://www.reddit.com/spoiler with the actual spoiler as the text. The "/s" (or "#s", if you want a spoiler tag that works on mobile) spoiler tag will look like a link to http://www.reddit.com/s, except the text that shows up in your inbox (or anywhere else CSS doesn't apply) will just be whatever's in the brackets (usually just "spoiler"); the actual spoiler text will only show up if you hover over the link.

As such, the /s or #s spoiler tag is far better than the /spoiler version.

The reason for the /r/anime style spoiler is because the normal \[Spoiler content\](/spoiler) format doesn't show up as a spoiler in the mailbox or user pages, leading to potentially spoiling the person you responded to, whereas the [Spoiler title](/s "Spoiler content"\) format will just show up as a link with the spoiler title.

>  I think Movies game him better treatment as a person. Ideally he would get his arc from TV series, and it would be concluded like in Lagan-hen.

I'm not sure about that. I think his character loses a lot of depth in the movies because they effectively remove his backstory, including the parallels between the population cap in Adai village and Rossiu's obsessive census-taking in Kamina City.

I'm still confused what people find wimpy about Shinji, even if one was expecting him to be an over 9000 generic shounen MC he still seems pretty based. After hearing the "get in the fucking robot meme" plenty of times before watching it I was surprised when he got in it 5 minutes after learning of its existence, that's pretty fucking brave!
>> ARTICLE
He is pretty wimpy when you're trying to watch an Action flick. Does that make him a bad character? not necessarily but I hate how people try to say "he's not a pussy, you wouldn't risk your life either!" and like yea sure I wouldn't (some people might) but there isn't 25 episode anime about my pathetic life is there... If people don't want to watch a pussy let them not watch it. Don't try to defend it by saying "he's not a pussy he's got real problems yo." He is still a pussy.
>> ARTICLE
If you start NGE expecting an action flick then that's your mistake. Shinji really isn't a pussy. He's just not generic action protag-kun that has a hard on for action and adventure. He's a normal reasonable person who understands he is most likely going to die if he gets in the robot. [NGE Spoilers] (/s "And honestly if you really watch it, that's not even what he's scared of. He's more scared that when he does die he will have disappointed everyone who was depending on him. NGE is largely a story about Shinji learning to live for himself, and not for others. His decisions at the end of the movie reflect that fact. In fact his biggest tantrums occur when he feels like he isn't needed or doing a good job. Shinji is a lot of things, and he has more problems than i can count, but he is definitely not a pussy.")

Yes most people do, but still many complaints that lead to a drop are things the show will solve/change in due time.

I could see why, the beginning was pretty slow but it picked up after like episode 10.

I finished episode 6 and dropped it. I honestly dont see why its worth my time if i have to watch basically a full anime seasons worth to get good. I usually have a 3 episode rule but i gave it a few more because of how popular it was but i still couldnt get into it. Idk i might go back to it when i have time to kill
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate along with its ova, movie, and VN, are easily my favorite of all time. Great plot takes time to develop
>> ARTICLE
It can take time but that doesn't mean it has to or should, I did the same thing because honestly if it takes longer than two hours to get good I could have just watched a movie.
>> ARTICLE
in S;G I found it takes a while because a lot of the plot "greatness" comes from realising how important things in the first episodes were, several episodes later.
>> ARTICLE
I also dropped Steins;Gate, but I never picked it back up.  I've always heard it's good, but your comment here actually makes me less likely to go back to it.  10 episodes is far too long to wait for a series to get good.
>> ARTICLE
yea, for me I enjoyed the first 10 episodes (not sure about that number) but I don't really watch it when I rewatch the series so I understand why people wouldn't like it. But it is like setting the scene for a story and every part comes back into play. That being said I loved the characters and it was enjoyable for me. Don't watch it if you don't want to haha but the payoff is pretty nice
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara, because Hikari was an asshole. I eventually picked it back up because I was told it gets better, and it definitely did! 

It's now one of my favorite anime, and Hikari's my third favorite character from the show. Lovely character development~
>> ARTICLE
Awesome anime
>> ARTICLE
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

I was not impressed with the first few ~6 episodes. I had to force myself to pick it up again and to watch it to completion.

The weird thing with TTGL is that while I didn't like the first few episodes, I think they're great in retrospect. The first part of the show sets up the second part almost perfectly that, in hindsight, these episodes are not only necessary for the plot, but also good. Really weird experience to have. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the second Arc first, incidentally.

Gintama , now its my favorite anime

oh yeah i forgot about how it dropped it after watching the beginning of the first episode. those first 2 filler episodes are sooooo boring i wish i had known to skip them

So your telling me the first two episodes are filler? I should probably try it again then...
>> ARTICLE
MTE. I watched the first episode because I swear, everyone and their mother was going on and on about how amazing the series was, and yeah, I didn't like it at all. I mean, there were moments where I LOL'd a little, but it wasn't interesting enough to actually continue. 

I might give it another go, though.

Shinsekai Yori. It started off so slow and there was so much dialogue to take in, but then it just got so good.

I think i dropped it at around episode 9 or 10, maybe i'll pick it up again sometime.

I dropped Bakemonogatari twice at episode 3, then successfully marathoned it the third time and loved it.

Only thing I can think of off the top of my head. Don't usually pick things I drop back up.

I think I dropped it at the same place when I tried watching it the first time.  A year later I picked it up again and marathoned through the end of SS.

I had a similar problem, though I wouldn't say I dropped it. Instead it took about a few weeks to get around to each episode. I finally got hooked with the Hanekawa arc.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara, like 3 times. It was VERY worth it but yeah, it's vvveeerrrryyyyy slow to start with.

I dropped it during the fourth season during a particular subplot that just bored me. The jump from marathonning to weekly didn't help, I just couldn't stay hyped to watch it every week.

I dropped it the first time because of how the story was presented I just couldn't get into it. Then season 2 was announced and I was like well I guess I will watch it then. So I gave it 2 episodes and began to love it.

Bakemonogatari and Shirobako.   
  
Shirobako didn't strike me right away, so I put it on hold after the first 2 episodes, and picked it back up after it finished airing, it become my second favourite anime, and I plan to rewatch it soon.

>Shirobako didn't strike me right away, so I put it on hold after the first 2 episodes, and picked it back up after it finished airing, it become my second favourite anime, and I plan to rewatch it soon.


Same. I put it on hold after 1 and a half episodes. It seemed like it might be okay, but nothing noteworthy. I then decided to give it a go about 2 months later and LOVED it from beginning to end. It also made me decide to give Hibike! Euphonium a retry, a decision I do not regret. Suffice to say, Hibike! Euphonium has become one of my top 5 favorite anime, Shirobako is number one at the moment, and, thanks in part to both these series, I have been more willing to explore the genre of Slice of Life over the past few months.

Dropped K-On on episode 5 because it had no progression whatsoever and I was in the mood for plot.

Got back to it a few days ago, and besides eating cake, there wasn't any progression.
>> ARTICLE
actually the characters grow up in K-On. There's just no plot. Or explicit character development. You kind of just pick up on it based on little things they pepper throughout the series
>> ARTICLE
>there's just no plot

That's incorrect.
>> ARTICLE
S1 had a tiny bit of plot leading up to each school festival, but you can't seriously be arguing that K-On had a substantial plot
>> ARTICLE
Yes it did, did you watch the second season?
>> ARTICLE
It's one of my 10's yes. It had even less of a plot.
>> ARTICLE
There's a very clear chain of causality though, I don't understand how someone could miss it. 
>> ARTICLE
Plot isn't just a chain of causality. It's taking a story somewhere. Arguably, the story wasn't trying to go anywhere. It's a 40 episode long exposition of the world and characters.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 1 they are novice musicians trying to achieve individual goals. Episode 36 they are accomplished friends, and have accepted life's transiency. 
>> ARTICLE
yes, those things happened, but there isn't exactly a plot that took them from point A to point B. KyoAni's storytelling accomplished that *without a plot*, which is why it's a 10 in my books. 
>> ARTICLE
The more you watch the better it gets. So many little details added in, it's worth a full watch. I wasn't a huge fan of the film but the second series is really great, the gags are less like the gags in the first series and are more character based and it's just so comfy and nice to watch. 

Sure the plot goes no where but it's by far my favourite slice of life anime I've seen (until they decide to make Yotsuba&! into an anime)
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'm sold on watching it, just not anytime soon.

After knowing about FSN and many tidbits from my friend after a while I tried to watch FSN 2006. I dropped it after a while because it was just so.... ugh. Then I watched fate zero(don't remember why, maybe because people said it was better, maybe because FSN UBW just finished and there was a lot of the FS to watch I dunno). When I watched FZ I fell in love with the characters and story and watched the whole thing and picked back up FSN 2006 watched it and loved it despite it's flaws and continued to watch FSN UBW and here I am waiting for heaven's feel.

If you have the time, read the VN because it's a much better experience.  But it's also really long too.

Hunter x Hunter I dropped cause the small arc right after Hunter exam was dragging and other things were interdasting. Glad I got back into it. Rest was amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
1999 or 2011? I dropped the 1999 series after about 20 episodes because it seemed like the entire series would be about the Hunter exam and I gave up hope the characters would ever actually go off and *do* something.

The 2011 one. Yeah the series is definitely a slow burn, which is fine, but not when you are staring 150+ episodes in the face and none of the "feels" people talked about happened yet.

Dropped GATE around the middle and came back to it, only to drop the second season after episode 3.

I dropped Bakemonogatari at episode 8 but I decided to give it another chance a while ago. I watched the first 8 episodes again and put it on hold after that. For some reason I can't get further into it...  
I mean it's not bad but somehow I don't want to watch more.

AnoHana and Bakuman. Those shows were good shit, especially Bakuman since I somehow got attached to the characters, and has one of the best rivalries in anime imo.

Surprised to not see Classroom Crisis mentioned. Myself, along with I think a handful of people, dropped it after episode three where it looked to be going nowhere. After hearing this sub beating its drum saying that it "got better", I returned to see it quickly center itself thereafter, where it turned into one of the stronger shows of its season.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Highschool DxD, but as I grew older I slowly became more of a disgusting loser, and now this show actually looks appealing to me.

I really want to like that series, but I just can't. I dropped DxD twice already, I kind of a fan of harems but this series it's just to hard to watch to me.
>> ARTICLE
Detective Conan. Loved it as a kid, but as it became harder to find episodes readily available and with the *terrible* English dub of it in the early 00s, I just stopped watching the anime and only read the manga.  
  
Then I went on a binge one summer and watched a dozen of the Detective Conan movies and absolutely loved them. Favorite had to be Phantom of Baker Street, but I really liked Magician of the Silver Sky, The Lost Ship in the Sky, and the Fourteenth Target as well (love me some Kaito Kid).  
  
Of course, I've since not kept up with either the TV show, movies, nor the manga again...

My man.

I dropped Katekyo-Hitman-Reborn because of that filler-based first amount of eps with bad humour. I decided to pick it up again and its really a shitload of fun when the real plot starts 
>> ARTICLE
I picked up Shirobako back when it started airing, and was immensely disappointed that it wasn't a "cute girls doing cute things" feel good type of show. I dropped it cold turkey after the first episode, and never thought about it again until I saw how well regarded it is on this sub.

Fast forward 2 years. I just finished it yesterday and rated it 10/10. I cried a little bit when that scene in episode 23 (you know the one) happened. Not much is able to make me do that. I can really relate to Aoi and the theme of figuring out what you want to do in life, given that I'm a college student. I think I picked the show back up at just the perfect point in my life for it to hit me the absolute hardest, since I'm really struggling with those same types of decisions. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed Shirobako nearly as much, or given it as good of a score, had I watched it while it was airing. Because of that, I actually don't regret dropping it when it came out. So good on you, PA Works.

Also, it has some top tier girls that occasionally do some really cute things, so that's a bonus.

With One Piece, I've always been a fan since I started watching it around 2-3 years ago, however I'd usually binge watch it in 50-100 episode chunks, then put it on hold for anywhere from a week to half a year. Currently I'm in one of my breaks but I'm up to episode 700, so my next binge will probably take me to the end of Dressrosa (around 734 I think)
>> ARTICLE
It's currently at 738 and if you want to finish Dressrosa in a single go you'll probably want to wait another 5 episodes or so to be sure it reaches the end of the arc (it's close but not there yet).

I also suggest reading the manga as the anime's quality tends to be rather low (see: Pica walking across town.  You'll know it when you see it.)

I heard by 738 they've beaten doflamingo, but are pretty much doing what they did after CP9 while they were waiting for the Sunny to be built, right?

Pretty much

There are quite a few series I've put on long "holds" before continuing watching, so I'm only going to mention the ones I fully intended to never watch again at time of "drop":

* Dropped YuruYuri after [episode 5](https://i.imgur.com/BYsDl6k.png).  Toggled status between Dropped and Watching several times, finally left it at the latter after considering how much fun the show had been until that scene.  It ended up being the right choice, 8/10

* Dropped Beyond the Boundary after the first episode due to the actions of main girl, the bullshit reason she gave for them, and essentially acceptance of them by MC.  Ended up resuming watching the next day, since I'd liked the overall atmosphere of the show.   [Was glad that](/s "the real, non-bullshit reason behind the girl's actions ended up being explained later on to my complete satisfaction.").  Overall though, too much nonsense in the ending brought the show down to 7/10 for me.

* Dropped Saekano after Episode 0.  Suddenly being thrown into the middle of a harem with hot girls throwing themselves all over an asexual nerd for some reason - that just didn't appeal to me.  Months later, accidentally started watching from Episode 1 (I say accidentally because I didn't realize this was the same show I dropped) and ended up loving it.  9/10 (and 8/10 for Episode 0 treated as Episode 13 instead.)

* Dropped Assassination Classroom after 2 or 3 episodes.  I just didn't feel the interest to watch more of the story.  Watched a couple more episodes with my nephew later on, still didn't feel like continuing.  But recently read spoilers about what happens towards the end, which finally kindled some interest so I'm on episode 10 now :).  Unrated for now, but probably somewhere between 7 and 8.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped FMA a good 12 years ago. Gave it another chance 3 days ago and I'm seriously wondering how I never got into it before. It's amazing. I'm about to start Brotherhood and I'm so stoked. 

I dropped Naruto Shippuden, as well, but I'm starting to get back into it. 

Yowamushi Pedal is another one. I just couldn't get into it so I left it alone for a while. Came back to it a few months later and was insta-hooked. 
>> ARTICLE
I was in the same boat with Naurto until a friend had me look up Naruto Kai. It made the show far more enjoyable for me.
>> ARTICLE
FLCL I just didn't like it at all. Too many things were happening and none of it made sense.

I rewatched it a couple of months back. To me, it's still not as good as people say but I can sorta appreciate what it's doing.
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend someone to give it another shot?
>> ARTICLE
Like the other guy said it's very short, that's probably the only reason I rewatched it.

Temper your expectations, I came in expecting the best thing ever from all the hype. So I was severely disappointed.

Don't try too hard to make sense of the story and just let it come to you. If nothing else you'll appreciate the things it does well like its animation and music.
>> ARTICLE
It's only 6 episodes, and episode 6 answers a lot of questions.

I did that with Shuffle!

I thought it was really quite dull in the first couple of episodes. Got bored one day and picked it back up. Loved it.

I was happy that one of the best girls actually won and didn't have an open ending like so many others like it.

Was a hell of a way to cement his relationship with the girl also.

Dropped Texhnolyze years back after watching around 10 episodes because it was slow. Got back to it after like 2 years when I remembered that I actually liked it and watched the rest of it. One of my all time favourites now.
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Memories while it was airing. Around episode 7 or so? Then almost on a whim, polished it off. Ultimately, I didn't really enjoy watching it... but I think it's thematically really strong, and the more I think about it after the fact, the more there is to appreciate. It might just be that as I remember it less distinctly, I imagine it had more merit than was genuinely there. 

Golden Time I shifted into the drop pile several times; left it alone for a few days to a week, got antsy about it, shotgunned a couple more episodes, then 'dropped' it again. Ultimately, I quite like. The main characters are incredibly obnoxious, and powering through to the point where they become likeable takes some doing. 

Yuri Kuma Arashi... tried watching that, realized I had no point of contact with the subject matter, and dropped it. Came back to it with some cliffs notes analysis from the internet, went through it... still not a clue how much I really appreciated and how much was just totally beyond my grasp. 
>> ARTICLE
Plastic Memories ended kind of lamely for me...I kind of expected a more light-hearted Death Parade-like exploration of human nature. But what we got was romcom hijinks...
>> ARTICLE
I really wish they hadn't dropped the action so much towards the end of Plastic Memories. I found the world so interesting. Wish they'd incorporated it more, instead of what we got. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Kill La Kill twice on the first episode, once for the art style and once for the very revealing, obvious fanservice, outfit. After the third attempt I found a surprisingly well written story for the premise of the show and now it's among my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka, man fuck it has slow episodes which were deteriorating my heart
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Clannad and Toradora after 1 episode back when they originally aired like ~9 years ago. Watched both recently and loved both. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Punchline after the first episode because it was shit, but then decided to watch all of it because I didn't want to stain my record. For anyone thinking of watching it: Don't.
>> ARTICLE
I also dropped it and picked it back up, but I thought the second half was really good. Didn't fully make up for the shit first half, but I really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I respectfully disagree. Fight scenes were amazingly animated, and the story was fun, what I expect from Uchikoshi.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped the Monogatari series after finishing Bakemonogatari about 2 years ago. 

Picked it up again after watching Kizumonogatari in cinema 4 months ago. After that I read the novel and watched all of the rest in like 2 weeks.

edit: typo

I got slightly bored during the Key of the Starry Sky Arc in Fairytail. Then heard it got better in the next one so I powered through and WOW it did get better !
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that's a filler arc.
>> ARTICLE
And that would explain why it was bad.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Bakemonogatari because I couldn't figure out what it was all about at first. I was looking for a casual anime to just fill time between seasons and I thought Bakemonogatari was just plain weird at first. About a year later I decided to rewatch it after many recommendations and fell in love with it. I finished the whole series and bought the english translation of Kizumonogatari and loved the entire thing. 

The same week I dropped Bake I tried Steins;Gate out and couldn't get into it once again because I didn't realize how much there was too it. I got to around episode 5 and quit. After finishing the entire Monogatari series I decided to give Steins;Gate a shot again. Turns out, they are both my two favorite anime now.
>> ARTICLE
I've tried starting Legend of the Galactic Heroes so many times and just ended up putting it on hold one episode in. Forced myself to get through a few episodes this time and now I'm hooked.

Also, dropped Hyouka, picked up later, school festival arc pretty much made that show great for me.

>> ARTICLE
I dropped Love Live when season 1 was being released. I wasn't into Anime around that time and I just watch dubbed. I started watching in the end of 2014 and loved them. I started to listen to the music more and found out last year that they are a real idol group.
>> ARTICLE
they're not a "real idol group" per se. They're definitely formed for the sake of Love Live, and will probably tour in conjunction with promotions for it. It's not like AKB48 where the idols came before the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Steins Gate. I remember watching the first episode and the very beginning hits me with the most random irrational shit, i stopped right after his ramblings and I thought why the fuck is this so highly praised. Stuck through the first episode and it has since been one of my all time favorites. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped 'Is the order a rabbit' when I had first started watching anime. Then I decided to pick it back up when I was feeling down and stressed from school.... best choice I made in my life. :D
>> ARTICLE
durarara. i still dont know if i liked it or not but i definitely felt something
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy. Thought it was just another unfunny comedy IN SPACE. Turned out to be one of the most beautiful shows I've seen and it really resonated with me.

Bakemonogatari. Thought the humor was lost in translation and I didn't like the animation. Finished it and Nisemonogatari and still didn't like it.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate- Started off so slow, evidently it picks up around episode 15 but I couldn't stand having to wait that long for a story to interest me. Regardless, I started the series over a few months ago and finished it in 2 days :D

I tried watching Shirobako over the summer last year and thought it qad insanely boring. I decided to pick it back up last week since I was watching Bakuman, which is somewhat similar, and now Shirobako is easily my favorite anime

I dropped Nichijou the first time about episode 4, because it felt too random and didn't go anywhere. A month or so later I continued it and had an absolute blast.

Blood + I watched like the first 10 minutes of it in like 08 or something and closed it. tried it out a few months ago and finished the entire show within a week.

Fate Zero.  I had no idea where to start with the Fate series.  I got bored 2 episodes in while watching on Netflix. 

Came back  a year later was definitely not sorry.

Assassination classroom.

KLK after 3 episodes. Then a year later I felt like watching something that wouldn't require me to really "think" about it. Decided on KLK, binged in one sitting, was pretty ok going into it with the right mindset.

Had a lot of trouble getting into Monster at first. I kept dropping it for a few days every episode or so in the first 1/3rd, but then once we reached the arc about the super rich old man, I got super invested. Been a while so I don't even remember his name QQ. I liked the man so much.
>> ARTICLE
dropped KLK for the same reason. It's funny because KLK is pretty far from a series you don't have to think about...
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's mostly just a show with 2 layers. You got the fun, action packed layer and then the symbolism and metaphors that were present in nearly every scene. If you look really hard, you can find A LOT of stuff in there, but it's not very revolutionary stuff. All of it is sort of like "oh cool! this thing actually references some idea!" It's not needed for the plot, but is just cool to find.
>> ARTICLE
Same here with *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann*. Yoko's skimpy outfit and the excessive fanservice really turned me off, but a friend convinced me to give it another try. I'm not sure I believe his argument that [(Gurren Lagann's) Yoko](/s "purposefully dresses that way to increase the boys' spiral power"), but oh well; it still wound up being fun.

I dropped [Code Geass around episode 15](/s "because it seemed like Mao would keep coming back after being killed, and I didn't want to watch a series focused around him"). I got into it again with a rewatch discussion, which helped a lot to get me past that point, and I also liked it a lot more once I accepted that it's "operatic" and is purposefully being overly grandiose and dedicated to "rule of cool."

Finally, *Puella Shoujo Madoka Magica* only got a single episode from me the first time; it just seemed boring and not my style. After seeing enough praise, and realizing it was only 12 episodes, I watched the entire thing and now consider it a 10/10. (I actually wound up watching six episodes, then invited a friend over and marathoned the whole thing with her. It was really great.)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I would say I loved it, but in my most recent memory I dropped "is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon" and really enjoyed. I remember I dropped it because I fell asleep like half way through episode four or five and after that I figured it wasn't worth it, then at the behest of my friends, I went back and actually enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail.  I got into it pretty quickly, and stayed until about episode 140 and gave up.  I started back up again a few months ago due to boredom and realized the show gets infinitely better post-tenroe arc
>> ARTICLE
I dropped gurren lagann 3 times before actually finishing it

I watched the first 2 episodes of Shinsekai Yori when they aired and then dropped the show, but when I watched the whole series a year later it became one of my favorites.

Dropped Golden Time because Ghost Banri is a bitch. Picked it back up and ended up being really satisfied with how it ended up.

Kill la Kill because it was filled with fanservices which is the reason why i hated anime from the start.

After getting myself adjusted to the world of Anime, i watched TTGL and impressed with it. Heard that that KLK was basically made by the same team, so i had to picked it back up. Was a blast, and basically my top favorites anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
> Kill la Kill because it was filled with fanservices which is the reason why i hated anime from the start.

If you understand what Kill la Kill is and appreciate it, then it can easily be accepted by the open mind. The show isn't afraid to sexualize it's characters, both males and females; it's making fun of it by going over the top. The show is nicely paced with an interesting plot, backed by intense action. Kill la Kill is one of the few shows I ranked as a 10.  
>> ARTICLE
Already said it earlier, that it was my top favorite anime ever, so yeah, i rated it 10 as well.

Yes, i was one of those ignorant people who thinks that every anime is full of stupid and sexualized stuff before. KLK was my first choice on getting into anime, and i hated it, not exactly the best choice for people with that kind of mindset.

Years later tried more casual anime, and finally watched TTGL for the first time. I liked it, and gave KLK another chance, and i finally know what makes anime special for me. I still disliked fanservices, but KLK gave me a reason to look into anime open-mindedly.
>> ARTICLE
I remember dropping BECK because i didn't think it was very good and I didn't like the characters very much.

Then I discovered my love for music, became a guitarist, entered college, and now a friend of mine is letting me borrow her copy of BECK for as long as I want so I can fully get into it, am currently watching it, and I'm loving it so far.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped One Piece at like, episode 100, simply because I thought I was out of the loop (when I picked it up, it was already at ep. 400) But in October, I picked it up, and it's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Clannad+After Story, Code Geass, Dragon Ball+Z, and One Punch Man. All are great, some grossly overrated but still great. 

General excuse is thus: college got busy and I forgot what I was doing for a few weeks, and it happened often. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate. The cringy and out of place first episodes really made me lost all interest in the show the first time. The second try I watched it all the way, oh boy I wasnt ready for the rollercoaster
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Jojo at about ep5.  It's not that I didn't like it, I just had lots going on and sort of dropped off on it.  About a year later the girlfriend sits me down and says I'm not leaving until season 1 is done.  She's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
First episode of Baccano was so confusing I dropped it. Picked it back up years later after hearing praises about it again and again. Was not disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
**DRRR**

Initially dropped it during the character introduction, because it's was just awfully slow and boring. I still fail to see how is it supposed to make me interested in the characters. But I suppose I'm just somehow incompatible with them or something.

I decided I should give it a second chance though, after watching baccano. And ended up kinda regretting it. I liked Shinra/Celty arc and then the ending, but since I didn't particularly care for any of the other characters, the rest didn't do anything for me.
>> ARTICLE
> I liked Shinra/Celty arc and then the ending, but since I didn't particularly care for any of the other characters, the rest didn't do anything for me.

That's how I felt about parts 2 and 3 of x2.  But S1 and x2 part 1 I loved.

Arlsan... piece of shit MC.

But their companions specially the bard guy and the big breast maiden keep it going for me.

I dropped Shinsekai Yori because it was pretty slow and wasn't getting anywhere. Picked it back up cause i ran out of stuff to watch and loved it!
>> ARTICLE
Kaichou wa Maid-sama! for me. I started it over a year ago, and I really wanted a solid _romance_ show. Like, where things happened instantly and everything was cute and fluffy. I was not in a good place romantically myself and I couldn't get into the show. So I put it on hold at episode 6. 

Got back into it last week and I'll probably have it finished by this week, which is super rare for me to watch something _that_ fast (26 episode series). I'm in a solid spot romantically now, so I was able to enjoy it as a romcom instead of just straight up romance, and now I'm really liking it a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Cross Ange in the first 60 seconds, those butt shots confused me since I was searching for some mecha action. Picked it up again and its in my top 5 now.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Hyouka because the first few episodes was a little boring

Although it isn't my favourite anime or anything , Chitanda is definitely one of my favourite character of all time
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Welcome to the N.H.K. after the 2nd episode. Just couldn't get into it for some reason. Two years later when I was extremely down I stumbled across a thread of what to watch when depressed. It was on the list so I picked it up again and was happy I did so. Helped me quite a bit and now is one of my go to shows for when I get down.

I remember I dropped Hunter x Hunter at ep 4, picked it back up in few weeks and it became my favourite anime of all time.

Asterisk.

Digibro influenced me but then i started watching it again when S2 started and I still enjoyed it a bit. Season 2 is much more interesting, so far, than season 1. 

It doesn't dissolve the complaints but it does make me think Digi was just latching on to a non-AAA anime to hate. Then I unsubbed. Don't need that contrarian bullshit limiting my hobby.
>> ARTICLE
> it does make me think Digi was just latching on to a non-AAA anime to hate

nah, he was just latching on to an **A1** anime to hate

Latching on all the same.

I dropped Bakemonogatari on episode 1, then again on episode 2, then again on episode 3, then again on episode 4, then I finally forced myself to watch it. Wanted to drop it soo badly, but I watched episode 12 and was like holy shit, this is fucking amazing, then I wanted to drop it afterwards but I stuck through to the end. And I finished it. Worth for episode 12 doe.
>> ARTICLE
Shouwa , i still havent finished but its the third time i tried and i finally finished episode 1(lol).Im so looking forward to this.Reason i dropped it it was sooooo slow paced in my mind

I dropped Tamako Market because I hate talking animal characters (with a few exceptions.  Sakamoto from Nichijou, for one).

I haven't picked it back up yet, but I plan to after I finish rewatching Azumanga Daioh.  Tell me, does the show ever tone it down with that stupid bird?

Not really, it was one of KyoAni weakest shows

Wait what?! 150 comments and not a word about Lucky Star? I thought it'd be on the top comments for sure.

I dropped it, and later finished it.  It was never great, but had moments

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann, FMA dropped at chap1 and TTGL at chap 4-5. Now I consider those two of the best anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped The Tatami Galaxy partway into episode one because the narration speed was making my head hurt.

Picked it back up when I was feeling more prepared and it was a treat.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped School Live part way through ep 1 and later went back and finished it and it was one of my fave shows last year

Toaru Majustu... after the 4 episodes. Got back to it month later and realised how stupid was that.
>> ARTICLE
[Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/)  
Dropped it because the comedy wasn't doing it for me, and when the girl that dressed like a boy showed up, by episode 3 i think.  
Watched a bit more later into the season, and loved ep 4 and 5,  ended up being one of my fav of summer 2014, along with Barakamon.
>> ARTICLE
Far too many anime because the stores didn't carry any more VHS copies and just forgot about 'em.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Code Geass 4 years ago and watched both seasons about month ago. needless to say It's now among my favorites. Such a balanced and great story.
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki no Soma.

Dropped it after episode 1 thinking that it would be boring, after getting it recommended from a friend I decided to watch it and it  turned out more enjoyable then expected.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped YuYuYu after episode 2, it became one of my favorite anime when I came back to it.

Dropped Bakemonogatari *in the middle of episode 12*, during the drive. 

why did i do that

Dropped (put on very long hold) Haikyuu around episode 9 or 10, when I got back to it quickly picked up and got very good. I still maintain that the first chunk of episodes in Haikyuu are weaker than the rest of the 1st season.

Dropped Hyouka around episode 6 or 7 when they were talking about how Oreki / Chitanda never get mad. to be fair that was a really boring conversation, but I never felt bored watching it when I got back to the show.
>> ARTICLE
**Inferno Cop** and **Ninja Slayer**, I think I just understood the concept later on.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Steins;Gate back then. Just couldn't get past the first episode.

Watching it now tho, best decision I've made

>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, Ano Hana, and Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon. Didn't drop it because I hated it, but because I was using Hulu before they had a completely ad-free option and grew tired of the 5 ads per episode shoved down my throat. Picked it back up when I got Crunchyroll and spent 2 weeks flailing on the floor wanting more when I finished Season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Concrete Revolutio. I only dropped it because I fell behind on it while it was airing and didn't feel inclined to pick it back up. Later down the line I heard how good it was from some bloggers I follow. I decided to give it another try before the second season started. It turns out that it's the strongest series from last fall. Really glad I didn't miss out on it.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora, it took me around three tries to finally get into it
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero. First episode or two bored the hell out of me but I eventually came back to it and it's among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
I completed everything I ever dropped a while back because the dropped list looked ugly:

Aoharu x Kikanju was garbage, regret looking at it.

Comet Lucifer...

GATE was alright, nothing special but wasn't bad either

Hyouka was definetaly worth it. Dropped halfway after I found out no relationship happens, it was just really slow. The pacing was still slow after I picked it up again but it was more enjoyable.

Inu x Boku ss doesn't have much going for it besides the ending.

Mushishi, I initially dropped because I tried to binge it, bad idea. Sits on the borderline between 9 and 10 for me

Nichijou was alright, second half was way better than the first half

Overlord was awesome, had some weird pacing at the start and I didn't know what to expect from another VRMMO

Rokka no Yusha was dropped just before the mystery began, not sure what to think of it because I hardly watch mysteries like that.

Sakurako-san and the bones stuff, definition of an average anime, nothing good at all, but nothing bad

Shingeki no Kyojin Highschool spinoff was just terrible in every regard don't watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Psycho-Pass because I thought Akane was too moe.

That was a mistake.
>> ARTICLE
There is no drop. Only indefinite hold. I will finish Watamote and Index eventually. :P
>> ARTICLE
Amagi Brillant Park. Watched the first 2 episodes and then got overwhelmed with other anime I thought were better at the time. Went back to watch it like 2 weeks ago and it was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Bakemonogatari like every other episode before crawling back to it in another attempt to finish it.

I loved the story behind it, it was just the whole flashy sequences and rapid cuts between live action, blank flashcards, and actual animation that really made me hate watching it. Thankfully the newer seasons don't do that and I can enjoy the show a hell of a lot more
>> ARTICLE
Madoka took like 3 tries to watch whole thing. It took me awhile to figure what really turned me off from it. I eventually figured it out. The art style which is pretty, leaves all the character completely expressionless. Character are important to me, and to have emotionless character I could not connect to made it really difficult to watch. Eventually I got over the art style. Once you watch 6+ episode you tend to learn about the characters and connect with them even despite the art style.

More recent one was Aokana. First few episodes were fun but there wasnt that drive to have me coming back so I sort of just stopped watching it. I returned to it a few months later and madly fell in love with it. I simply different give it my patience as a more slow anime. Now its one of my favorite animes. And probably my favorite final episodes of any anime.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Owari no Seraph at episode 1, then later on picked it back up and somehow managed to get to episode 18, and then dropped it again.

Kantai Collection. I couldn't get over the fact that they were girls with the souls of ships in them, still can't. The opening and ending themes pulled me back in.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 2012. I dropped it because I didn't like the animation style, but after like 10 episodes I got used to it. 

>> ARTICLE
I dropped Hunter X Hunter because it was too long. I picked it back up after my laptop broke and I had nothing to entertain me but netflix on my roommates ps4. Ended up watching everything on netflix and finishing the show after getting my laptop back from the shop. 11/10
>> ARTICLE
The two that stand out most to me:

Bakemonogatari back in 2009

And Clannad about the same time. Went back and finished them fall of 2014. Really glad I did. Monogatari is on my top 5 easy. I still can't eat fried rice because of Ushio.
>> ARTICLE
I remember dropping the monogatati series after watching it and being bored with the long dialogue as well as not understanding the plot. 

watch it again a year later and it is my favorite series of all time
>> ARTICLE
Dropped One Piece for one year because Dressrosa was annoying, picked it up again and became even more addicted to it than I was the first time. (well, it is my favourite anime and manga, but that arc was just annoying because of longevity and slow pace).    
Right now I have Fairy Tail on hold, after that break of one year the anime had I never got back into it, I remember loving to watch it..    
I've also dropped Naruto Shippuden around the arc with the big war, all those Akatsuki members being resurrected and shit. I've watched this since I was a kid so I feel pretty bad about not watching it anymore.     
I'll definitely start watching Fairy Tail and Naruto at some point again.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Nagi no Asukara about 3 times over the first 5 episodes. Went back to it recently and for some reason couldn't stop watching. Something must have changed inside me. Now it sits at a 10 in MAL, despite not grabbing me in the beginning at all.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats -- i dropped it like a month ago and can't seem to pick it back up again. The plot seemed bland to me, I guess.

Dropped SAO right before the Mother's Rosario ark, but /r/anime persisted and I finally gave in. Thank god, because I think it was the best ark in SAO (yes better then the first one)
>> ARTICLE
~~Steins;Gate. Dropped it twice at around 8 episodes, then one day finished it in one miserable weekend.~~

EDIT:    
>Which anime have you dropped, picked back up, **and loved**?

Durarara. God damn was that a struggle to get through if you are bad with names, and the first arc that came after you got used to all characters was really mediocre excluding the finish. The rest was godlike though.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped gintama after 15 episodes because it was bad and picked it up again.

Then dropped it again after 5 episodes because it was bad.

I heard that it gets good after 50 episodes or something so fuck that show.

well I don't blame ya for dropping it, it's not for you then but it seems you're not going back to it but you might be curious what they were talking about when they told it gets good so here spoiler if you're interested:

Ghost in the Shell: SAC. Dropped it because I wasn't a fan of the OP. Picked it up and rewatched the whole first season. Loved it.

Time for 2nd Gig... also Major is best.

Death Note, only saw like 3-4 episodes before I stopped and for a while, I was scared off by a lot of people saying its 2nd half sucked. I then  recently went through the entire series on Netflix. I'll admit it's good, enjoy the soundtrack, and I like Ryuk but some of the later arcs are dull and that 2nd half definitely wasn't that great either. I hope the movies are better though.

Dropped Parasyte after 2 minutes cause I didnt like the animation, picked it up a bit later and absolutely loved it :)
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say I drop shows per say, but I have a mental list of all of the episode numbers I've left off of on shows that I by no means think are bad, but just don't feel like watching

Casshern Sins episode 23: very dark and depressing show altogether.

Psycho Pass 2 episode 5: so meh.

Shokugeki episode 16: I read the manga so no point really.

Mobile Suit Gundam 00 episode 4: I don't know how I feel about it.

Durarara episode 6: unique concept, yet oddly sort-of boring for me.

God Eater episode 11: I think it took too long to finish.

Certain Magical Index episode 4: I don't understand the praise it receives on r/anime.

Shinsekai Yori episode 6: I know it gets good, but first half so far is not all that interesting.

Kyousougiga episode 8: I like the art, but didn't really care for the characters.

Mobile Suit Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans episode 13: I really liked the show until it was slice of life on a space ship for a ton of episodes in a row.

Space Dandy episode 4: I actually liked it, but at the time of watching it was really hard to find it online.

Fairy Tale Second Season episode 41: I watched 175 episodes of the first season, and 41 of this one with the promise of it "getting good." It continued the shit recycled plot every 30 episodes. The literal only anime I've watched and felt like I genuinely wasted time watching.

Edit: Just realized it said "got back into." I remember thinking Gurren Laggann was kind-of dumb, and then later gave it another chance and ended up really enjoying it. I think back then I thought it was childish, but ironically enough, the older I get, the more I appreciate and enjoy anime like that.

THAT WAS CRAZY!!! I have a heap that I loved about the different things in this movie, but I didnt love all of it.

First off, I loved the montage after Simon defeats Lordgenome, where they show the things that went on during the time skip. I think the way they did it in the show was more impactful, cutting straight from Simons awesome revival to 7 years later, but Im glad they put it in here. Specifically I love how Kittan is crying [during the wedding ceremony](http://i.imgur.com/X0Pt3kE.png) and [at the after party](http://i.imgur.com/KsPSNa4.png). I laughed a lot at this. Also, this shouldve been obvious, but Im an idiot so I didnt realise that [Simon was the one that built the Kamina statue](http://i.imgur.com/Iiy5m0s.png)!!!

I cant really remember, but I dont think they put [this](http://i.imgur.com/KnyZH1S.png) in the show. It really brings home just how powerful Simon is. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/MzGPafW.png), too.

I enjoyed [this](http://i.imgur.com/JwM11bN.png), showing Viral taking hits for Simon. And a little bit on, Yoko says [this](http://i.imgur.com/OvpiMWm.png), which is both rude and COMPLETELY UNTRUE!! Are you kidding me?? The dude couldnt look terrible if he tried. Hes flawless.

Ahhh, I wanted to point [this](http://i.imgur.com/FhmcDYI.png) out, too. They omitted so much and still thought, Nah, we gotta have this. The audience DEMANDS IT!!!

I didnt really like how they redid the [finale of Rossius arc](http://i.imgur.com/LVO9qhM.png). It felt immensely heavy in the show and the way Simon came in and just punched the living shit out of him was so great. But the way they did that here seemed lacklustre. I get why they did it that way, but I honestly would have been fine if they left it out.

Okay. So the final fight. For starters, I liked that the other guys didnt die. Kittans death was all that I really felt for, so the others were probably wasted to me. Of course, in the anime, their deaths are pretty viable, so I have no complaints, but for the sake of this movie Im glad they were kept alive. 

Speaking of which, SHIT! [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/l2K8zg1.png) WAS SO COOL!!! Seriously, all the mechas were awesome. The way the whole fight [played out](http://i.imgur.com/OS4RyRo.png) was epic. I couldnt believe that they managed to come up with even crazier shit than what they already had. The animation was beautiful and the music was awesome and the [fucking fist fight](http://i.imgur.com/sPS2SB2.png) between Simon and the Anti was so incredible. I loved every bit of it.

And lastly, two scenes that I **REALLY, REALLY, REALLY** appreciated them adding in: [the sisters crying over Kittan](http://i.imgur.com/lOWXjiS.png) and [Simon saying goodbye to Lagann](http://i.imgur.com/tZzOCv8.png). It kind of irked me that we went straight to the wedding and that there was no sort of step back to take a look at the aftermath. Specifically, I wanted to see the sisters mourning over Kittan. I did. I felt so weird being instantly thrown into the wedding and seeing the girls smiling and laughing, and I remember thinking, they just lost their older brother . And with Simons thing, I also felt annoyed that he just gave the key to Gimmy and left. I guess I prefer to have things spelt out to me, and even though these things obviously happened behind the scenes, Im really glad I got to see them.

So yeah, thats it. I loved the additions and stuff, but I doubt I would want them to replace certain scenes or to even be added into the anime series. Anyway, that was fun. All of this was fun.
>> ARTICLE
one of my favorite changes in the movie was seeing Nia draw first blood on the anti-spirals.  that was definitely badass.

also, nipples.
>> ARTICLE
The part where Nia gets recalled to the Anti-spiral home world and Simon goes from cute to *absolutely furious* in [50 seconds](http://imgur.com/bnF5ngT) is really great.

Also I just realised that Nia's mech is the only one that doesn't have green spiral energy around it, her's has white-ish like the Anti-spiral's: because she *is* anti-spiral and when she spun her drill-spear thing around it looked like she was taking a bit of Simon's spiral energy and put it into the grooves of her drill-spear.
>> ARTICLE
That comparison doesn't even look like it's the same person... He's so good.

**PSA: THERE IS A POST-CREDITS SCENE SO MAKE SURE TO WATCH THAT**

I'm gonna get today's final **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"** out of the way because I have a lot to say.

- Today's first **"Song of the Movie"** is my favorite, straight from the movie soundtrack, ["My XXX is the Best in the Universe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IVX9P9kVk). I LOVE this song, it's amazing and can really get me pumped up.

- Today's second **"Song of the Movie"** is ["Sorairo Days Tengen Toppa Version"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQvLECht08). I believe this to be the better version of Sorairo Days, it played during the final sequence of the battle with Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

- Today's and **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"** final **"Song of the Movie"** is ["Namidano Tane, Egaono Hana" by Shoko Nakagawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL740l_S5Ng). What a perfect credits song, this only makes the feels stronger.

One honorable mention.

- People have already mentioned this version of Sorairo Days but I've gotta do it too. ["Sorairo Days" - Masaaki Endoh Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dWZcF58EgA).

Here is my last set of facts for you all.

- **"That's one big robot"**: Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 52.8 BILLION light years tall according to Gainax and when it uses the Super Tengen Toppa Giga Drill Break it's length is multiplied 10 times.

- **"What could have been"**: Gainax had actually made designs for a [Tengen Toppa King Kittan](http://i.imgur.com/pwbJbCi.jpg), a [Tengen Toppa Lazengann](http://i.imgur.com/WfuvKWX.png), and a [Tengen Toppa Gurren](http://i.imgur.com/veOgulP.jpg).

- **"I see what they did there"**: I said it before but I'll say it again, Gimmy's name comes from the Japanese word for 'right' and Darry's name comes from the Japanese word for 'left'. The [Tengen Toppa Grapearl](http://i.imgur.com/wQpViEe.jpg) is piloted by Gimmy on the right and Darry on the left.

- **"Thank you Gainax, that was necessary"**: I bet you were as surprised as everyone else when all of the sudden Yoko and Nia were comepletely naked. Apparently this was done because towards the end of the production of the movies, Gainax realized that Gurren Lagann was gonna be the only Gainax anime that didn't have female nipples just plainly on screen, so they did what had to be done and we got to see some nips.

- **"Goodbye, Nia"**: It's stated by Gainax that Simon and Nia spent a week with each other alone on an island for a week after they returned and before their marriage. I know what you're wondering, "Did they do the sex?". According to Gainax, "They did what had to be done". You may interpret that any way you want.

Thank you all for the support. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this every day for the past 2 and a half weeks. I was worried at times that I wouldn't be able to pick a song or find a fact, but I was able to power through it.

I'm gonna be really honest, I didn't cry once during the rewatch until today at the credits when I finished the last movie. I don't cry very often, especially wtih anime. The last time I cried watching anime was at the finale of Death Parade and that was after I watched the series twice. I guess I just had to let the tears flow knowing that I had completed my favorite anime for a second time. Also because the emotional overflow of slowly but progressively going through the series really let all the feels build up evenly until I hit my breaking point.

I love this anime, man.

In my eyes, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a masterpiece. It has everything I wanted and more. This show gets to me on a whole other level compared to other anime I've seen. I don't know what this show doesn't have; romance, action, suspense, drama, fanservice, comedy. Of course if mechs ain't your thing then this won't appeal to you as much as me. My favorite childhood movie is "The Iron Giant", I like to think that that movie prompted my love for giant robots, and Gurren Lagann satisifies that love oh so well. Gurren Lagann has it's flaws and I am well aware of them, but it's those flaws that make it so amazing. I prefer the movies of the anime just because the hype seemingly never stops in the movies.

All that said, this anime and the movies are the only 10s on my MAL. No matter how phenominal another anime is I will never give another anime a 10, not to say it's bad or doesn't deserve a 10, I just want to honor Gurren Lagann as much as I can.

**TL;DR:** Manly tears were shed for the first time in months and this anime is my favorite of all time.

I'll say it one more time, thank you all for sticking around for **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**. May all your future endeavors be guided by your drill. I leave you all with these pictures.

I am genuinely upset we will never see those unused Tengen Toppa Gunmen animated. It's up there with the final battle with the space monsters in Gunbuster for things I want to see animated (though that battle is probably way cooler in my head so I'm kind of glad they left it out. The images they gave us were badass as hell and more than enough for me to work with).

The things I would do to get a Revoltech or Super Robot Chogokin of any of the Tengen Toppa Gunmen....
>> ARTICLE
You know what's sad as well? Lagann and the Yoko M Tank, and Yoko's Giga Drill Buster will never get animated...

Well they have made the [Tengen Toppa Solvernia](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/02/01/daibadi-brings-gurren-lagann-tengen-toppa-solvernia-garage-kit-to-wonder-festival) actually. I think they've made the Tengen Toppa Yoko gunmen too.
>> ARTICLE
I have a Revoltech of Lordgenome's mech :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the TTGL revoltechs are actually really good for revoltechs, which are generally sort of poor in quality. I have Enkidu, Super Galaxy, Tengen Toppa and the set that comes with Gurren and Lagann. They're all awesome. I need to get Lazengann too someday, though I might wait for the Riobot of that.

Your welcome. I, too, also shed tears as well.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much for hosting this rewatch. I don't usually rewatch things and at first I wasn't going to join the rewatch. I'm glad I did.
>> ARTICLE
Hey fellow TTGL bro, Seeing that you are a person that probably has the same appreciation of Gurren Lagann as I do I wanted to express myself on here on a brief note on how awesome it is. I watched Gurren Lagann at probably the best possible time. I had started watching it with not much of a high expectations , and my life's dreams had taken a turn for the worst , I had not given up and I was still fighting but after a weekend binge watching Gurren Lagann I was now a reignited super galaxy of spiral force , not only did I get myself out of there , I did so in a way that allowed me to push to go even further , and my reignited self was steadily building energy within , just like a drill. Evolving stronger than the minute before , being better every moment than the moment before and slowly yet steadily pushing forward without yielding to any circumstance you can keep going forward. This anime is much more than an anime , it's an artistical , musical , philosophical and story telling masterpiece. Thanks for everyone watching it and sharing it with us. Have a nice day 
>> ARTICLE
>They did what had to be done

they totally did the sex
>> ARTICLE
Once again, thank you so much for your support for this rewatch of Gurren Lagann.

You know, I planned on not doing any more rewatches, but after experiencing this rewatch and the demand of people wanting me to do rewatches, I've changed my mind.

So, next month, if you didn't know already, I'm going to do a rewatch of **Baccano**!

Really hope you guys had as much fun as I did.

Off-topic: What have you tagged me as, if you even tagged me at all? 

/u/rascorpia tagged me as "Senpai~" and another guy tagged me as "turned on by Hulk Porn".

And if you haven't tagged me, would it be too much to tag me as "That guy who did those rewatches". That way when I put out info next month, you'll know that's me?
>> ARTICLE
> "turned on by Hulk Porn"

Oh. [Oh my.](http://i.imgur.com/j48FK2d.gif)

I have you tagged as "Host Senpai."

I don't even know what Baccano! is about, but I'll be there. Can't wait. Great work with the TTGL rewatch!

Tee-hee... Tee-hehehehehehehehe... BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

You... you laugh at me days later. Why you little...

No way to know about every anime that I haven't seen. I'm new, remember? I think not knowing anything going into it will be fun.

So you were tagged "TTGL rewatch" before but now I tagged you as "Nostalgia-san" because you start rewatches of all my favourite anime.

>> ARTICLE
You're doing a rewatch of Baccano?!?!? We're going from my favourite anime to my 2nd favourite anime! Yes!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for doing this man. I watched the anime almost 10 months ago but I never watched it having random internet strangers hype about it on a daily basis , like when a show first airs. This whole thing was super awesome. I was getting hyped because I knew people would get hyped in the next episodes because they were hyped with much smaller things than what was coming. It was a unique chance to experience the comradery of watching TTGL. So once again thanks for arranging this
>> ARTICLE
Np. It's fun doing these types of stuff for shows that not only I enjoyed, but also for others as well.
>> ARTICLE
Another reawatch hosted by you of a show I haven't seen, Code Geass and Gurren Lagann were both 10/10's so let's see if this will be the third masterpiece I watch because of you.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass, TTGL, and Baccano are all in my Top 7. This OP has taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm bad at coming on reddit recently, is there a way I can get a notification when you do the Baccano rewatch? Been meaning to rewatch it for a while.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something called RemindMe!, where you get reminded about something after a certain period of time.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, when roughly next month will you be doing it?
>> ARTICLE
Around the 13th of July, but don't stick to that date if some things are going on in that time. I'll let you know, as well as everyone else, when it's gonna be via thread.

....and now we wait. No worries if it isn't exactly then, i'll make sure to look around anyway. See ya then!

Lordgenome hacking is probably one of my favorite things ever now.

***HAKKAAAAAAIIIIIIINGGGGGG***

ftfy
>> ARTICLE
This is not the TTGL you needed, it's the TTGL you could never have dreamed you wanted.  

I think this second movie wraps acts far more as the real ending of the series than ep. 27 because it gives a bit more closure by adding Nia's thoughts and the extended post-credits scene.
>> ARTICLE
It's like they looked at the original show and said, "How can we make them even bigger?"

But damn, that fist fight at the end was super unexpected, and pretty great, and I was in tears over the super pro hacker Lordgenome
>> ARTICLE
<><>

I love this movie. While it misses things, I think what it does do different is better than the original series. I think the alternate universe thing comes off so much better in this, and all the mechs are certainly cool. 

but...

<><>

I mentioned in the last thread I'd talk about this, so here I go. I love that part. I love the Giga Drill Busters into one another and how it plays out...

Here's the thing. To me, the main theme of TTGL is one of evolution. Basically it's about evolution from well..digging in a cave to fighting amongst galaxies. There's a lot of talk about what the "Spiral Nemesis" is...in the series, the implication is that the opening is the Spiral Nemesis, that is, a Tyrannical Simon drunk on power blow up the universe. 

This is something different. 

Evolution...it keeps on going and going until that moment when they collide together..and the camera backs out. And backs out some more. And backs out some more, as you see the galaxies coming together sucked in by the power of the mechs...and then for a split second, the image becomes clear. 

<><>

http://i.imgur.com/KkIIEtH.jpg

This, is the Spiral Nemesis. And it's a much better way of putting it. It's the danger of too much power...that literally collapses the universe. But right before it gets to that point...

Before I go with that, let me bring you back to something in the very first episode. When they launch out of the pit, and go above the clouds...and suddenly gravity remembers that they are there. But before that...the reaching of the top of their flight...

That's exactly what this reminds me of. This is the absolute top of the series...and then the devolution starts. With the awesome Soriano Days playing...it really shines in this scene, you have TTGL devolve in order to defeat the Anti-Spiral, ending with Simon, just a person (albeit with Edward Alphonse-esque powers in the Anti-Spiral Dimension.) defeating him. 

I love this scene. To the point where I use the infinity symbol as my forum icon. It's probably my favorite scene of...anything, and it brings serious tears to my eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
So I've rewatched TTGL 3 times or so over the years, but for whatever reason I never got around to watching the movies. 

I don't know what the hell I was thinking! I loved the little additions expanding on the story. That final fight was probably one of the best things I've every seen. 
>> ARTICLE
That's some really awesome art in the 'Fanart of the Day' link!
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love Google. Those bastards are one step closer to world domination, but you can find some cool shit because of them.

True. Do you have the source, by the way? Always nice to give the artist credit when possible, and they often have other cool stuff to check out too!
>> ARTICLE
[This guy.](http://www.zerochan.net/user/arnef)

Was this worth watching?  They added new scenes? I love the series but absolutely despise recap movies/eps so never ended up watching them.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh, watch the last battle. You need to at least see that one.
>> ARTICLE
may i holla for a link to said movie?
>> ARTICLE
[I'm linking you part of the final battle.](https://youtu.be/ee-JiCedC_4)
>> ARTICLE
Interesting I might end up watching them now since it's been years since I saw the series.  I just hate recaps and never watch them when series is still fresh in my mind. 
>> ARTICLE
There are actually a decent number of plot and battle changes, particularly in the final battle.  They also include new animated scenes that add to the backstory and provides supplemental value that makes it worth it. 

>> ARTICLE
Hey, thanks for arranging this, /u/angel10701. I don't think I ever made a top level post in a daily thread (curse you timezones), but let me tell you, I read every single one of them. This has been the most fun rewatch I've ever seen here on reddit! Looking forward to Baccano!.
>> ARTICLE
No problem, man. Glad you had as much fun as I did. See you in the Baccano! rewatch. ;)
>> ARTICLE
The credits song and sequence is absolutely amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, rewatching this just strengthened my opinion, that TTGL is the best anime ever (IMO).
>> ARTICLE
A little late, oh well. Said in the series discussion I had something else to post, so here it is.

**WARNING, video may contain some spoilers for various shows in the form of a picture of a mech/person.**

Im sure many of you have seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXNa_m52r0) comparing the sizes of mechas. For those who havent, check it out. Whether or not the numbers are 100% accurate, everything seems to be in an acceptable order. The video starts off small and ends ridiculously gigantic (thanks to TTGL). It also has TTGL music playing to increase your hype as it approaches all of our favorite Lagann forms. Youll also see some other random people/structures/what have you in order to give you a reference for their size.

For those who dont want to watch the whole thing

- Gurren Lagann - 5m / 16.4 feet (it always seemed a little bigger than this)
- Arc Gurren Lagann - 5,000m / 16404.2 feet (approx. 6 [Burj Khalifa towers](http://karibuworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Burj-Khalifa.jpg), the tower in Dubai)
- Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann - 5,000,000m / 16404199.48 feet (I dont even know what to compare it to since its in space almost as big as Earth, I guess)

These three are all smaller than Earth. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXNa_m52r0#t=06m41s) is a link if you just want to watch from Earth and bigger. (~2min long)

- Then you have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - 10^25 times the size of Gurren Lagann.
- Finally, Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - bigger than a folded newspaper, bigger than the observable universe. Fuck yeah!

There are also some images from Gunbuster, Diebuster, Getter Robo, GaoGaiGar and others that everyone has been talking about during this rewatch. It gives you a good idea of how large of a scale those shows can be too.
>> ARTICLE
I can't lie when I say that this might be one of my favorite movies- I have seen it so many times now and it only seems to get better. I even cried a bit near the end when Simon was going around trying to make Nin ' s dream true and ughhhh. ..

I love the show over all but I think I love the ending to the movie over the ending to the show.

:D was fun reading all these threads and discussions btw: even if i didnt contribute ^^;;;
>> ARTICLE
I have no complains on those added scenes.. but i still prefer the series ending fight somehow.. the music was just in sync with the fight the whole way..I had goose bumps watching it back then.. the movie one dint have such impact tho. Still a movie worth watching (those tits) :D
>> ARTICLE
I just finished my kinda yearly rewatch yesterday!!! 

I guess I'll be fighting the powah again 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has somehow managed to put it on hold when I got the time-skip (I'm not sure why I was loving it) and as someone who hasn't participated in a rewatch before, will I inevitably get parts of the ending spoiled for me, even if I kept up with the rewatch?
>> ARTICLE
Generally, rewatches require marked spoilers for any episode that the rewatch has not yet reached.  /u/angel10701 did the Code Geass rewatch threads, and he/she warned people not to hype future episodes in a "First-timer reactions?  DIS GONN BE GUD" sort of way.  I think you'll be okay as long as you don't love at any spoilers.  (This seems obvious, but spoilers without a scope tag on them can be tempting.  I know from... personal experience.)
>> ARTICLE
Yay, better get watching it then. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Of course, I finish TTGL right before I find out about this rewatch.

Might tune in for the movies though. Haven't seen those yet.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime of all time, I'm excited for this rewatch! 
>> ARTICLE
I might join in depending on whether I can be arsed to watch the first episode tonight/tomorrow.

Although upload time is the same as the Hyouka rewatch, is it possible to do it an hour earlier or later? If not then don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
You know what, doing at 4 PM my time really squeezes my schedule, so I'll try to put it at 5 or 6 PM, don't know which one, though. 
>> ARTICLE
6PM is probably a little late for us Europeans.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I changed it to 5 PM EST now.

>> ARTICLE
Guess it was good timing I had the whim to download all of TTGL today.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, nice! You're coming along, too? Good to have you on board once more!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! I probably won't start off doing the MASSIVE lists like I did for CG (as I have never seen this show before), but once I actually get into it, I'm sure I will.
>> ARTICLE
Well hey looks like we are in the same boat this time around as well. I look forward to seeing you in the threads once more.
>> ARTICLE
Ditto
>> ARTICLE
[Nice!](http://i.imgur.com/vGq1cGH.gif) its been a few years since I have watched this show. It will be cool to join in with this re-watch. Thanks for sorting this out. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I've never done a re-watch before but I definitely want to tune in to this one. Can someone help me by explaining exactly how it works?
Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
You first watch the episode that is going to be discussed on that day the thread comes out. Then, you give out your first impressions on the episode, short or long. Then you do that all over again the next day. After a while, however, for this rewatch, we will start to add an episode, so you have to watch two episodes in one day then discuss those two episodes. Of course, you can watch it early, write down your thoughts, then when the thread gets released, you can just copy from wherever you wrote for your thoughts and paste onto those threads. If you want some examples of some rewatches, check out my submitted posts for the Code Geass rewatch and see how the posting and discussion happens during these episode threads.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds simple enough! I should have enough time to keep up. Thanks for the response!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what the re-watch entails. Is this just a thread for people to talk about how they feel about the episodes after watching them again? I have not watched Gurren Lagann yet, so would I be able to post my thoughts on this while watching along with the schedule?
>> ARTICLE
Think of it like episode discussion threads, but for shows that already aired.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, the best part about rewatch threads are the first time watchers. 

So please, whenever you feel like it drop your impressions. It's magical to read people's take as they go through TTGL the first time!
>> ARTICLE
It could go both ways. First-timers are welcomed, no, encouraged to watch the show and discussing it in a rewatch thread. Rewatchers get to relive their first time and seeing if there are any little details that may have sparked their interest, while first timers are more so of saying what they think for the first time, and thus, giving more honest opinions than "THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVAR!!!!". It's a nice contrast between fanboyism and hard analysis that keeps the conversations on the threads very enjoyable and awesome to talk about.

So to answer your question, yes, you can post your thoughts even if you haven't watched the show.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was almost 1 year ago that my friend saw me playing Super Galaxy Rumble on League of Legends and suggested I watch this show.  My very first non-pokemon/yugioh/beyblade anime

Yeah I'm onboard, I'm in the mood for some heaven piercing.

now I only need to find a site to watch the German dub...
even if it would be easier for this rewatch to watch subbed or Eng Dub, but German Dub was the first version of TTGL I watched and it has a special place in my heart for that. Jaron Lwenbergs voice will always be the voice for Kamina atleast for me.

Woohoo, I've needed a excuse to rewatch this show after finshing Evangelion. 

Let's go!

I don't believe this... It's been forever.

Fck i finished 4 weeks ago but i go to rewatch it

Can anyone explain how these rewatches work?

Do we all watch at the same time on a stream or something? It's what I'm getting at by some of the comments. I've never watched this anime and I've been meaning to.

You watch on your own.

I have never participated in a rewatch before, but I'll try to give this one a shot since I've been wanting to watch TTGL for quite a while now.

Damn, I finished last month and don't feel like watching it again yet. Gonna watch the movies tho, didn't see them yet.

This is perfect, I just started this series a few weeks ago but got sidetracked with the bebop rewatch.

Man, that was one hell of a way to start an episode, it caught me really off-guard and it was amazing watching it happen live.
>> ARTICLE
Literally just takes me to a picture of ~~a flame~~ the team logo.

Also, I'm going to out on a limb and say this is for some sort of pachinko nonsense or something since PS is in the url.

If this is genuinely a second season, the world as we know it may implode in its core.

Man, even though I'm sure it's just a pachinko machine, I would REALLY not like a second season. Everything that the audience needed to see was in the original show.

I mean, like, MAYBE they could do a story on Lordgenome before he became Lordgenome.
>> ARTICLE
As long as it doesn't end up like the Star Wars prequels, I'd be into that
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the show on its own was fantastic. The second movie just made the ending 10x better. When you have something of high standards it's best to leave it there lest you disappoint fans with them saying "first season was better."
>> ARTICLE
I've seen the original series several times but never the movies. Do they add anything to the story?
>> ARTICLE
Mainly the final fight. Some scenes are retconned to better fit the short length of the story told. Only the second movie has new stuff though; the first one is simply a recap of the first half of the series.
>> ARTICLE
They add a whoooole lot to the ending, seriously go watch both the movies it just makes the last fights of the seasons so much better.

Otherwise the movies are fastpaced they skip small tidbits and not much changes except towards the end of the movies. 

Definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the series and you are ready for more.

> Pachinko machine

In case you're wondering about what a pachinko machine is, since Altef already explained the meme side of it, pachinko machines are mainly a thing due to the fact that gambling is illegal in Japan. To subvert that, the pachinko machines dispense prizes, which are exchangeable for cash elsewhere. The machines themselves are a mix between pinball and slot machines, so basically pinball with much more random chance and no paddles.
>> ARTICLE
 The haruhi staff said they were going to make a big announcement about Haruhi and it ended up being the announcement for a Haruhi themed Pachinko machine ^^im ^^still ^^mad 
>> ARTICLE
I mean to be fair it was stupid to hope something was going to happen anyways even if the Haruhi staff announced it. 

At absolute best you *might* get a flm of random stuff from the unadapted novels. 

But without Nagaru releasing new novels nothing would actually happen. Infact i doubt the haruhi staff would know about a new novel anyways unless Nagaru liked leaking that shit to them before the public.
>> ARTICLE
How recent was this?
>> ARTICLE
it was last year, when there was some kind of QR code scavenger hunt for haruhi (which turned out to be a promotional campaign for the haruhi pachinko machine)
>> ARTICLE
But what is a pachinko machine?
>> ARTICLE
basically slots with a minor (very minor) skill element to keep the player interested. I'm not sure if the laws around gambling have changed, but gambling was illegal in Japan for a long time, so Pachinko parlors had to basically sell Pachinko balls to players (metal ball bearings, maybe 1 CM or so in diameter) then players could exchange the balls for money or prizes at a similar rate at a separate location run by the same company or a sister company. Pachinko machines, much like American slots can be generic, but are often tie ins with popular culture to increase the likelihood that people not normally interested in gambling will give the machine a shot.

The Haruhi hunting campaign was kind of a big PR stunt, they scattered frames of a video all over Japan and asked the fans to take pictures of the frames and upload them, the result was this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETxKFFqd2IM 

Since it was a wide scale PR stunt everybody thought there was going to be a season 3 announcement or at least a movie announcement but instead all we got was a pachinko machine announcement.

\>newly animated video of haruhi and crew

I have had years of anger instantly released and is slowly building back up again. 

Based Panchinko ads. 

That being said a season 3 for haruhi is almost impossible with how much KyoAni skipped around the source material. IIRC there is only like 2 or 3 novels that are totally un-adapted. Nagaru would at least have to put out 2 more novels before a season 3 is possible. Otherwise KyoAni would have to pull some Monogatari shit and do everything out of order and out of whack again.

Don't give me that "KyoAni wouldnt do season 3" shit. Haruhi is still a sleeping goldmine. KyoAni would animate a season 3 i am 100% certain. 
>> ARTICLE
>That being said a season 3 for haruhi is almost impossible with how much KyoAni skipped around the source material. IIRC there is only like 2 or 3 novels that are totally un-adapted. 

There are 11 volumes and the anime only goes up to 4. The story does get really wonky afterward, and not in a good way.

Also Tanigawa left Kadokawa already so there won't be any more continuations. Vice versa Kodakawa cbf advertising this franchise if he's not writing anymore
>> ARTICLE
They could always just re-air it in yet another order like they did for s2, but you're right that there need to be more novels put out. Theres no real rush for Kadokawa to revive the franchise without anything new to promote

reason not to watch it [on Crunchyroll]: you're not in the US or Canada >.>

Bingo. Plus I own it on DvD so, eh.

And they are only releasing 3 episodes per week.

The real reason to not watch it on crunchy is they only have 6 episodes available. If I am going to watch it I want to marathon the shit out of it.

Damn it America, stop getting better things :(

Back to studying Japanese so I can import.

The reason I shouldn't watch it on CR is because they don't license it in the UK...same with ToraDora, and new releases like Oregairu. And yet I'm still paying the same amount...

That's a damn shame.  I'd tell you to watch it on Watch Cartoon Online, but I'm not sure of the legitimacy of the site (so take this as more of a light suggestion haha).

That site is great, actually. I watched Gurren Lagann & K-On! with it.

I've been watching Mobile Suit Gundam and Gundam Wing on it, since Crunchyroll took em down before I got the chance to watch em, and I watch a few episodes of Adventure Time every now and then.  The only thing I dislike about it is the video quality.

Yea, I've noticed some sound issues, but they're far from common.

This anime is amazing, fun to watch and I believe it's an important step for action anime. The plot moves at a breakneck pace without filler or useless character drama.

Well huh... It's not full comedy. There are still some tropes. 

[Don't read if you want to go blind in it without expectation](/s "Most importantly, it's action. Over-the-top action. It's silly, and it gets a bit emotionnal, and you'll feel something if you're attached a minimum to the characters.")

Just don't have any high expectations, because you'll most probably just be disappointed. I don't want to tell too much because you have to go in blind to truly experience an anime (just like any other media). 

And I would say, randomness is good. If you only get what you are sure you will like, it'll be kinda boring at some point. Or maybe just wait until that point comes and you maybe will want to experience something else and be more inclined to watch it of your own will.

The real reason not to watch on crunchy roll is the last free episode is Episode 8, for those who have seen the series its where [DO NOT CLICK IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE ANIME](/s "This is the episode where kamina dies")  If you havent seen the anime this is a VERY pivotal moment and you will almost be forced by your brain to continue, Crunchyroll, This is a heartless moneysteal on one of my favorite anime, Just my opinion.

Don't you just have to wait till next week for the next episode?

Well, yes but that episode will still be premium.  The episode will become free over time, BUT! It is to "planned" almost in my opinion that the last free ep is the one stated in my above comment,  I think it is completely planned that way, and from a business point of view, its a great idea, it will generate a lot of new premium users, but from a fans point of view, It is an awful thing to do, especially to one of my favorite anime of all time.

Shin Sekai Yori's English translation is "From the New World", while the series reflects many of the themes and concepts from the book "Brave New World", and it's soundtrack features an excerpt from Dvorak's 9th symphony "From the New World"
>> ARTICLE
> Brave New World

I LOVED this book. I really need to watch SSY.
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, both titles are kind of Japanese puns ("bakemono" is "monster" and "monogatari" is "story", which is very appropriate to the theme of the anime; "zetsubou" means "despair" and plays with the main character's name - when you write "Itoshiki Nozomu" in kanji horizontally, you will get "despair", which is also very thematically right).
>> ARTICLE
What's also kind of interesting is that monogatari is nuanced a little more than its English equivalent. Monogatari can also refer to stories of epic or long length, which kind of ties in with the length of the narrative itself.
>> ARTICLE
I think the writer of Bakemonogatari does that most of his stories. If I'm not mistaken, he also wrote "Katanagatari" which is also a pun, though not as smoothly put together as "Bakemonogatari."
>> ARTICLE
It's a pun on _Katanagari_ ("sword ~~gathering~~hunt") and _katari_/_gatari_ ("tales", loosely)

EDIT: I remembered wrong, it's [sword hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_hunt)
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, I didn't know about the "gari" part. That's very interesting. I understood the gatari part, however what makes his works like Bakemonogatari a bit more fitting is he's able to slip in both words very proper using the "mono" as monogatari is the full word for story or tale.
>> ARTICLE
Nisemonogatari is also a really well put together pun.

Nisemono = Fake, Impostor. 

Monogatari = Story.

Therefore, Nisemonogatari = Impostory, pretty clever.
>> ARTICLE
Ghostory and Impostory.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget that "Kizumono" roughly translates to "never"

edit: for those who don't seem to get the joke, it's a reference to Kizumonogatari's release date
>> ARTICLE
Kizumonogatari is my favourite. Kizumono means damaged goods (especially in the case of a woman), monogatari means story like always, but kizu also means cut or slash, giving it a three way meaning, all of which are relevant to the story itself.

Most of the time I only hear people talking about the kizu part, though I guess they haven't read the light novel yet.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really that clever when you realize <word>mono just means <word> thing... you can theoretically have kudamonogatari (kudamono = fruit, so fruit story) or wasuremonogatari (wasuremono = forgotten thing, so a forgotten thing story).

Although it's cool how Bake and Nise both have cool English portmanteaus as well, I doubt that was intentional.
>> ARTICLE
Inter-language puns, bad ass.
>> ARTICLE
Not quite as flawless with Monstory for Bakemonogatari, but still a perfectly acceptable pun in English as well. Only one that isn't a multilingual pun is sword story. Sadly only works in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
given that bakemono can also mean ghost. you could go for ghostory. and we do have ghost stories as opposed to monster stories in English literature, right?
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I'd only ever heard it translated as monster. Cool, ghostory is a way better pun-slation for that one. Technically we have lots of monster stories, those just get lumped in other literary categories like adventure or horror. Strange that we only specify when the monster is a ghost.
>> ARTICLE
well, you could argue that monster makes for a better literal translation. but I think that ghost fits in much better here
>> ARTICLE
I actually think impostory makes for a better English pun then monstory by quite a bit, but to each his own.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I was unclear, I was trying to point out that Bake was also a pun in both languages, but not as good a pun as Nise.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter makes sense when you think about it (the "x" is silent).  In the show people can take a rigorous exam to become a "hunter" (basically a mercenary, the definition is pretty lax).  People who pass the test can become different types of hunters like Beast Hunters or Treasure Hunters.  The protagonist of the story, Gon, is looking for his hunter father, Ging, throughout the story so he is a Hunter Hunter.
>> ARTICLE
You perfectly put into words what I always try and explain to people who say Hunter x Hunter has a childishly stupid off putting name.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like throwing that "x" in there just screws the whole thing up, really
>> ARTICLE
how so? as he mentioned its supposed to be silent, and is pretty much just an aesthetic choice 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but someone has to *tell* you it's supposed to be silent.
>> ARTICLE
Its a pretty common thing in japan it seems to have an x in a phrase and have the x be silent.
>> ARTICLE
i guess. i dont think that changes the point though. 
>> ARTICLE
Using the "x" is popular - especially in manga. It represents the word "and," is used only stylistically, or (most common) both.
>> ARTICLE
All of the episode titles are "Something" x "Something " x "Something" (for example, episode 4 is "Hope x and x Ambition") it's not that much of a stretch to figure out that you don't say the x's and they're more of an aesthetic thing.

Just for fun [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXtzoqYKFU) the voice actresses for Gon and Killua saying the title.

>> ARTICLE
Angel beats? What is so symbolic about it's name? I honestly don't know.

I mean, there's angel. But what's the "beats"? Heartbeats? Angel beats the shit out of the group? 

Now I'm confused.
>> ARTICLE
Probably referring to [Angel Beats](/s "MC donating his heart to the "Angel"")
>> ARTICLE
Also the logo is a heartbeat.
>> ARTICLE
As in metaphorically, right? [Spoilers](/s "Because although MC did actually donate organs after death,  there I don't remember that one of his organs ended up to Angel or her reincarnation in real life. ")
>> ARTICLE
[Angel Beats](/s "MC's heart got donated to Kanade when he died, and that was the reason they were both in Limbo: Kanade wanted to thank the person who gave her the heart and saved her life way back. If you're talking about the post-credit scene of the final ep with the "reincarnation" thing, then I can't answer as I tend to just ignore the existence of said scene.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "No, I actually don't remember where does it specify that MC's heart ended up being used for Kanade. It's actually confusing, seeing how Kanade was in Limbo before MC, for quite a while, attacking the others. How could she have gotten his heart, when she died before him.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "It's very explicitly explained. In the first episode she stabbed him in the chest and he had no heart, which raised suspicions. Then at one point she's laying on his chest and she can feel it in her heart that it's his. The time thing is explained that IT'S FUCKING LIMBO. It doesn't need to operate on a 1:1 clock with Earth. Also he got lost on his way in for some reason which made him take a lot longer to arrive.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I don't remember if they ever explicitly said it, but Kanade was in Limbo because she never got to thank her heart donor, and disappeared after thanking MC. As for why she got there first, it's not explicitly said either, but the general idea is that time really has no meaning in the afterlife. I.e. MC died first, moved on because had no regrets, but is pulled back to Limbo so that Kanade can thank him and move on without regrets of her own. It works and makes perfect sense within the setting too.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Great. Now the ending is even sadder. I mean, if that were true, Otonashi only ended up in limbo because of Angel, and he remained there because now he had regrets toward losing her. I rather thought that she disappeared because she found someone familiar with the situation as in donor/receiver, someone to thank for being a donor. ")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "In an early episode, she puts her head to Otonashi's chest as he's waking up in the hospital, and she can't hear a heartbeat and she knows that his heart is in her, you'll notice at that point her attitude towards the SSS softens dramatically (They're still kinda jerks to her, which makes it even sadder)")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Again, that's not proof that his heart is in her. It just means that she knows that he is a donor and she a receiver. Thus she appreciates him for being A donor, not HER donor. And thanking donors is what a receiver feels like is the appropriate thing to do. Your version seems nicer, but it's also uses time irelativity as a point that I can't easily get around. ")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Oh they explicitly say it alright.  It's the focus of the final conversation, the big reveal.  Her saying that is what finally allows her to move on, much to Otonashi's dismay.  That conversation shoved him right between a rock and a hard place.  On the one hand, Otonashi could acknowledge Kanade and the heart he gave her, which would mean losing the person he had come to love.  On the other hand, he could refuse in order to keep her around, which would mean going against everything he had stood for since entering the afterlife.")
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for clarifying, it's been quite a while since I watched it :D
>> ARTICLE
Nooooope. [](/s "It's confirmed the heart in her chest was Otonashi's. IIRC she actually tracked down the information on her donor some time prior to her death and entry into Limbo. Yes that means he and she appear there in reverse order; it's never really explained away beyond 'time isn't necessarily structured the same' there")
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty mixed on Angel Beats as a whole, but that moment man, that moment.  It's like, you see the title, you see the EKG lines in the OP, you wonder what it means, but then you forget.  Last episode: BAM!

OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED THAT

TWGOK's title drop was godly.

There's the obvious meaning you'd get from the first episode, and the less obvious meaning from the final arc right? I hope I'm not missing anything...

No, you didn't miss anything. There are only two meanings to that title.

The first is that the gaming world is the only one that God knows and cares about.

The second one occurs in the title drop. Not going to say when or where or how, because even alluding to it takes away some of the 'Holy shit' when you see it, but if you did, you probably know what it means.
>> ARTICLE
Can you elaborate in a spoiler? I've read the whole manga and I can't recall which part that is.
>> ARTICLE
[Hmm, well here we go! Spoilers after this, obviously.](/s "This took place in the final arc of the manga. The first part of the final arc involved Keima going back in time to save the female Itoshiki Nozomu, who seems hell-bent on killing herself time and time again. Over time, he gets glimpses of his duty until we arrive at Chapter 215 Page 9 (I think? Can't really read through all 200+ chapters again to find the killer moment, but that's one of them) where Dokuro says, 'Onii-chan, you must turn this into the world only you know'.")

[More spoilers](/s "This is because the future, Keima's future, in particular, has been created. The problem is, the past has not been bridged to the future. This is due to shenanigans caused by Skeleton Dokuro playing with the laws of space-time. In this perfect future, the Goddesses are released and are steadily growing in power, enough to threaten Vintage and their backers, Satyr. The problem is, for this future to be created, a few events have to fall into place. Namely, the whole class must go on that field trip and Tenri must be possessed by Diana. What exacerbates the issue is that the only one who knows what these events are and their significance is Keima.")

[Last Spoilers](/s "Hence, he must bridge the past to the future and create the world which only he knows. That's the title drop.")

[Kill la Kill](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill), Sounds cool and has some meaning behind it.
>> ARTICLE
Really? There was a meaning behind that name? 0.o
>> ARTICLE
What meaning is that?
>> ARTICLE
I thought some variation or another of the work "kill" is a homonym to the word "dress" in Japanese so the title can mean "Dress to kill" or "Kill the dress", both pretty cool and fitting, correct me if I'm wrong but i cant remember where I heard this from.
>> ARTICLE
Kill (pronounced Kiru by a native Japanese speaker) can be read as "Wear" "Cut" or as the actual English "Kill" so "dress to kill" or "dressed to kill" can be forced to fit, but not really.
>> ARTICLE
> But perhaps the best pun in the series is the title itself: Kill la Kill ( kiru ra kiru). In Japanese kiru has several different meanings: kill (), cut (), and wear (). So it makes pretty much the perfect title for an anime about a girl who wears a magical uniform (and fights other people wearing superpower-inducing uniforms), wields one half of a giant pair of scissors as a weapon, and is on a mission of vengeance to kill her father's killer.

[Source](http://kotaku.com/kill-la-kill-is-a-rare-breed-of-anime-1558049005)

"La" in Spanish means "the" in english, right?

So, the possibilities are:

"Kill the cut"

"Kill the wear"

"Cut the kill"

"Cut the wear"

"Wear the kill"

"Wear the cut"

...and each of them are really cool.

Clannad means "family" in Gaelic. Every single one of the arcs has family as a theme.

It actually doesn't, the author mistook the name of an Irish folk band as the word for family. The closest word to it is clann which refers specifically to a family's children.

Well, I guess it's the thought that counts.

Gintama being silver soul OR if we're in a more comedic mood, silver balls.

Wait, isn't  it Gintama = silver soul and Kintama = golden balls (euphemism for ballsacks)?

(and for those who don't know, to write the "gi" character in hiragana you just need to write "ki" and put double apostrophes, hence the joke)

Well yeah it's sort of the play on words I guess. I must have misunderstood how it's translated literally. The Kintama joke is used many times though.

Toradora is sort of a pun on the 2 MC's name.

Taiga has an "english" name (tiger) and the other, Ryuuji a japanese name. The title is reversed with Tora (tiger) and Dora (short for doragon > dragon)

An example would be **DARKER THAN BLACK** which is an amusing pun when you learn how **Hei** is the romanised version of the(a?) chinese word for black.

Neon Genesis Evangelion: "The gospel (aka good message) of a new creation"

The reason you're getting (unfairly) downvoted, since no one else will tell you probably, is because the production team admitted they pretty much just made it up cause it sounded cool. The fact that it manged to kinda make sense is lucky coincidence. 
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt they just picked random words. For that it fits a tad to well. 

Sure religious symbolism was added because it looked cool, but the title still fits extremely good with the plot and the message in the end.
I guess they looked for a name from a religious background and came up with that. Even if the intention was lazy, the .....creation of the title can still be creative
>> ARTICLE
http://wiki.evageeks.org/Theory_and_Analysis:List_of_Common_Misconceptions#NGE_is_religious_propaganda

> "There are a lot of giant robot shows in Japan, and we did want our story to have a religious theme to help distinguish us. Because Christianity is an uncommon religion in Japan we thought it would be mysterious. None of the staff who worked on Eva are Christians. There is no actual Christian meaning to the show, we just thought the visual symbols of Christianity look cool. If we had known the show would get distributed in the US and Europe we might have rethought that choice"
>> ARTICLE
I was always under the assumption that Eva was one of the prime anime examples where the audience calls the death of the author.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The intention was lazy. Sure. 

But they still had to know what the words mean. Otherwise they could've used something that would translate into something offensive. 
I doubt that they didn't know what Genesis means and were to lazy to look up what Evangelion means since they at least knew that Adam was the name of first man (used in a monologue from Gendo) in that story.

You don't need much to come up with that name, considering you just wrote something with so much symbolism and you have the ending in mind.

It's not like the title has a religious meaning. It just borrowed words that if translated, fit into the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Point. However just so you know...The actual title isn't Neon Genesis Evangelion. That's something ADV came up with when they brought it over. It's Shin Seiki Evangelion, which translates as "Gospel of the New Century". Slightly different meaning, no actual Genesis stuff in there.

Bleach. 

I know I know. But I love the name. Generally one of the things when we think of bleach, is that we think of dark colors being lightened. Black changing to white. One of the big themes of the early series is the idea of the "Black" Shinigami being converted to "White" Hollow. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the name was Bleach because of Ichigo's "bleached" hair.
>> ARTICLE
From the wiki: 

>The series was originally meant to be named "Black" due to the color of the Soul Reapers' clothes, but Kubo thought the title was too generic. He later tried the name of "White," but came to like "Bleach" more for its association with the color white and that he did not find it too obvious.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: It's literally the bizarre adventures, or a person/persons nicknamed Jojo.

Tenchi Muyo!: Can be read as "Useless Tenchi" (since he's the harem protag and we all know how that goes) or "Heaven and Earth" (an allusion to the series hopping back and forth between their daily life on earth and the space epic that the show becomes). Or a couple other ways, as I recall. 

Edit: Wow...noticing a lot of fairly valid answers getting downvoted..is someone brigading their answer up? 
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of valid answers are being down voted because they aren't in the spirit of OP's question. He asked for titles that are a good fit to their series, but what I got from the question is "name a series that has a title that ties into the series at a deeper level than what it literally states."

For example, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure doesn't fit the spirit of the question because its a very literal, functional title whereas something like your second explanation of Tenchi Muyo! Is an example of a good response that fits the question pretty well. It offers a deeper tie in that is something that would take watching the series to get. I've never seen either and hearing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure makes me think of a guy called or nicknamed JoJo having a weird adventure. Tenchi Muyo! On the other hand doesn't read as anything to me. Even localized as "useless Tenchi!" it says almost nothing about the show. Finding a connection from that into the series itself takes some thought, which seems to be what the OP is after.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but there are a few here that fit your "deeper meaning" definition that were sitting at 0 or lower for a bit too. Just feels like someone pushed a bunch of answers down to force theirs up. I can see Jojo getting hit that way though.

Gits = shell as in a shell console. Ghost = Mind. A mind in the console. AI/Transfered conciousness. A big part of the show.
>> ARTICLE
>ef Memories

Good thing I wasn't the only one who thought of it like that.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell is actually referring to the concept of the ghost in the machine from "The Concept of Mind" in reference to Descartes idea of mind-body dualism. So yes, it is relevant to the concept of the show, but even more so as a reference to the philosophy behind it. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate. It's something the main character is always talking about, but everyone else is like "it's just nonsense and doesn't mean anything". [Until](/s "Suzuha shows up at the end and says it's possible to reach a new worldline, the Steins Gate")
>> ARTICLE
It still doesn't mean anything then. She knows what that phrase is because the MC already told her before she went back and told him. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not so much a moment of discovery more than a Cerebus Retcon. To sum up a Cerebus Retcon without linking to TV Tropes, it's when there's a running joke throughout the series that becomes serious at a certain point.

[Spoilers from here on](/s "In this case, 'It doesn't mean anything' is a running joke throughout the series where Okabe will say something delightfully cringey and when pressed for an explanation (Why Norse mythology?) he'll reply, 'It doesn't mean anything'. Cue that episode where Older Okabe tells Okabe the Younger to send their world into Steins; Gate, a worldline that he named. As for why he calls it Steins; Gate? Well, once again, it doesn't mean anything.")
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I think you're more right than that. Maybe he tells him that knowing full well that the younger will get exactly the nature of what it is and the importance of it, because of how he always joked about it being such a earth-shatteringly huge deal.
>> ARTICLE
Well, first of all there are the titles who are pretty self explanatory:

* Sword Art Online (Name of the MMO)
* IS: Infinite Stratos (Name of the mechs)
* Log Horizon (Name of the guild)
* Mirai Nikki (Name of the phones)

But I really love Spice And Wolf (refering to the two main characters) and Tsukimonogatari. Tsukimonogatari because first of all it's "Tsuki -> possess" + "monogatari -> story" (refering to Yotsugi as a possessed doll) but also having a Tsuki in the title which reminded me of "Tsukihi" (which at first I thought was the reason of the title before looking it up; so that one stuck with me)
>> ARTICLE
For Tsuki it also refers to [Tsuki]( /s "Teori feeling like something was driving him and he was not really in control of his actions.")
>> ARTICLE
Ahh I always thought Tsuki was being said as lunar month or something so I interpreted it pretty differently
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online only really works for the first half of the first season though.

For all its problems, I fucking love the title of Eureka 7's movie: A Pocketful of Rainbows. Not only does it describe the franchise perfectly, it follows the E7 tradition of naming its episodes after songs (And a classic one at that)

You can read a lot into the weird latin in madoka's title - there's a lot of valid and interesting interpretations (such as it meaning [Ep. 8 or 9?](/s "girl of the mage which foreshadows Kyubey's intentions").

Alternatively, when porting to a western audience, they wanted a cool Latin title and not "Magical Girl Madoka Magica".
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure its the later, since "Puella" is just the word "girl" in the nominative Latin case (which means its the subject of the sentence) and "magi" is the word "magus" from which we get the word "mage" in the genitive Latin case (which means its possessive). So that gives us "Girl of the Mage". Alternatively we can translate "Puella" in the vocative, making it "Girl, be of the mages" though the context doesn't really suit this translation...

do you need me to resize things to fabricate proof? look at his other work.

I used the picture you linked as a reference. Clearly anyone who draws with a reference on hand will have their drawing look very similar. That's the point. 

Also, what does "Look at his other work" even mean? If you are implying that none of my other works are as good as this to incite suspicion it is because...

A: This TTGL painting had many more hours put in to it than anything else. Around 8 hours actually. 

B: My pen and paper drawings are from YEARS ago when I wasn't as good.

C: I have another Paint drawing with an original character in it that I think nearly matches this in quality. Probably a bit less since there was no reference and I made the whole character up.

D: And lastly if the comment "Look at his other work" was directed at that Ash and Pikachu paint drawing. That paint picture was made in 5 minutes as a joke pic. That is not a good example of my true Paint skill.

So yeah, go ahead and re-size all the parts if you want. I'm sure you could make it all fit perfectly if you tried hard enough.

>> ARTICLE
no, i was referring to your most recent work and the gap in skill, and the point isnt to look exactly like the other.

>> ARTICLE
Not so much skill gap as much as time spent creating... gap.

Then I succeeded I guess. As others have pointed out. It looks a bit different than the picture you linked.
>> ARTICLE
yes, you tried to replicate it perfectly and you fucked up, so now you play it off that you were drawing something different. sure.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, dude, calm down. A lot of beginning artists will try to imitate pictures as reference. It is a common practice, and it doesn't mean that he traced it.

HOWEVER, /u/GenesisHell, a picture done by using another as a reference that ends in the SAME POSE almost exactly (yes I know there are discrepancies) is honestly not impressive and really shouldn't be posted here.
>> ARTICLE
lol, Relax man. It's not like /r/anime is the Louvre or something. People can submit what they want.

Seeing posts of lesser quality imitating popular fanart (top few searches on Google images) is a annoyance, even if it doesn't really affect the rest of my day.
>> ARTICLE
this /r/anime, where good art comes to die and pencil sketches from noob artists get 1k upvotes.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I've seen good fanart posted here quite often. The problem is when people post their versions of existing screenshots/fanart that is worse than the older versions.

Now, screenshot redraws have been done, but they are far more detailed than what he has here.
>> ARTICLE
As he said in another comment the background is imported and filtered but everything else is too different from your image to say it's tracing. The proportions, the posture and most minute details just don't fit.  

Look at the maw from the hands, the tip of the helmet's horns, the placement of the eye on the left shoulder, the "nose" of the face on the chest, the size of the "over-shoulder" plates, etc.  
>> ARTICLE
I did not trace over that. I used it as a reference.

Clannad. I know it's supposed to be sad and all, but the fucking character designs can't make me sit through it. I have nothing against older animation, but i just can't sit through those faces.
>> ARTICLE
For me, it wasn't even the art style. Even that I could get past. My issue was the show was that I'd just gotten so bored with it. Yes, I know its supposed to be great but I'm not going to shovel my way through half a show before it picks up and I might enjoy myself. That seems like a waste of time. Though, its old so I've been spoiled so that probably has an effect. 
>> ARTICLE
That's how it was for me, too. Sure, their eyes might look like clocks and every girl has the same face. I didn't mind that. What I did mind was  the pace of the storyline. It was just way too slow for my tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is less than 10 years old, it isn't old at all. And the character designs are more modern than they are old. 
>> ARTICLE
I was turned off by the character designs but decided to just try to stick through it. I eventually got used to it and now Clannad and Clannad: After Story are two of my favorite anime of all time. If you can't get past it, I understand.

I swear to god I read this same exact phrase in the last thread.

Alright, I'll try to give you a new one. I also won't watch it because I've heard that After story is basically the only reason that Clannad is good at all, and the rest of the original series is shit. But I wouldn't know, I've never watched it.

After Story is better, but most romance shows are way better in their second half. It doesn't mean the first bit isn't enjoyable by any means.

The Dressrosa arc gets REALLLY awesome. I can't wait for the anime to start adapting the last few chapters of the manga that have come out!

You have no idea what I would do for a steam punk/one-piece esque anime. An airship with the mc as captain kinda thing.
>> ARTICLE
I say watch it if you feel like it and keep watching if you're enjoying it, stop if you're not. Just don't make any kind of "commitment" to it and you're fine.

If you've already tried watching it and weren't enjoying it, then that's fine, just don't ignore a series merely for it's episode count.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry folks, can't get into Gintama. I tried an episode and the humor felt forced beyond all belief. It felt like the situations weren't all that funny, but the characters very wildly overreacted to make it seem so. I might try again some day, but I just didn't want to watch any more of it. I've seen cool clips of the show that were kind of neat, but it doesn't seem like the kind of thing I can sit down and watched hundreds of episodes of. I guess it's just not my kind of humor?
>> ARTICLE
I currently re-watching Gintama and the first episodes are really not that good. 

But this show gets amazing at some point, but you need really some patience to sit it through until the first story arc.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who enjoyed Gintama, I'm going to tell you something different.

Comedy is a subjective thing, if you don't "get" the humor or just don't find it funny, it's nothing to feel bad about really. Not every show can be for everyone afterall
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth, *everyone* will tell you it has a weak start, and the first 20-30 episodes aren't a good representation of the series. 

I actually recently got into it and am around episode 50. It has definitely improved, but I haven't yet seen anything that warrants the extremely high scores it has on MAL. That being said I've heard it only continues to improve. 
>> ARTICLE
> and the first 20-30 episodes aren't a good representation of the series.

You know, thats not a good thing at all. Most shows are only 12 or 24 episodes. When your show takes 30 episodes to get good theres something wrong, I dont want to slog through 30 episodes just to get to the good part of an anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Gintama started in the shounen time slot. When it was pulled back off the prime time, they literally go nuts with everything. Hence why the first 30 or so episode is very shounen-ish.

Then again, I don't really want to defend Gintama early start since people always come up with this reason "there's something wrong if it needs 30 episodes yadda yadda". Watch the rest of it and you might understand why even the most critical of people are willing to give Gintama 9-10/10. 

Judging Gintama just from 30 starting episode is almost like watching 4/24 episodes of Steins;Gate. It's really not that representative of the whole. 
>> ARTICLE
It may not be representative of the whole, but again I stand by my statement that 30 episodes is too much to expect of a watcher. 4 episodes of steins gate is 2 hours, 30 episodes of gintama is 15 hours. I could watch Ping pong the animation (One of my favorite anime) 2 1/2 times in that amount of time.
>> ARTICLE
i mean if you do it percentage wise, it has the same amount of weak episodes compared to other anime
>> ARTICLE
It doesnt have the same amount of weak episodes, but it may have the same percentage of weak episodes sure. Point is, 30 episodes is a long time, and "aint nobody got time for that."
>> ARTICLE
The whole 30 episode thing isn't true anyways. Some of the episodes are amazing some of them aren't that great.
>> ARTICLE
Well you are about to get to the first serious arc. That's when you start realizing there is more to the series than episodic comedy. However, the overall quality of the series honestly just gets better, and better, and better, as it goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
What is the first serious arc?
>> ARTICLE
Benizakura arc. I believe it starts on episode 58. It introduces the main villain of the story and adds characterization for Gintoki and co. It also has a movie adaptation which is worth watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Is there a list or a guide for when to watch the Gintama movies, or an overall Gintama viewing order? 
>> ARTICLE
Well the viewing order is pretty self-explanatory if you check out the different seasons on MAL, but I'll break down the order for you real quick:

Gintama (201 episodes) -> Gintama' (51 episodes) -> Gintama': Enchousen (13 episodes) -> new Gintama season starting April 2015

The first movie: Gintama: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen, is a retelling of the first "serious" arc (Benizakura Arc, which I think is episodes 58-61. You can technically watch it even instead of the arc itself, but you should wait until after episode ~150, once you finish the "Yoshiwara in Flames" arc, because the movie briefly shows a character that is only revealed in that arc.

The second movie, Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, is an original story written by the manga author. You can probably get away watching it after all the characters are introduced ~episodes 150-200, but I would recommend watching it after Gintama': Enchousen. 

I would strongly recommend watching the 2nd movie as it is great, and also recommend watching the first movie as it has a great additional fight scene at the end. Even if you don't watch the entire movie, at least watch that scene at the end.

These. I just can't get past the characters. 

- Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu

- Golden Time

- Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (but this one I actually finished)

- Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!

>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen Golden time but the rest are very very dependent on the character's. Their plot really doesn't have any merit whatsoever if you don't like the character's. So very understandable. Haruhi is a bit different but after the first 4 episodes it's very episodic with complete reliance on character's. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, definitely. I've seen 5 episodes of Haruhi, but no matter how good the story becomes, I still wouldn't be able to keep watching those characters (and I disliked pretty much everybody there).
>> ARTICLE
You got through the first 4 and that's really the only important part. The rest is good fanservice for people who like the character's but not nearly as interesting as the first 4.
>> ARTICLE
Srsly? Because out of those 5 I maybe found 2 interesting and the rest was pretty boring. My reaction to it all was very similar to Kyon's - permanently bored.
>> ARTICLE
I won't say particularly interesting but there is definitive plot development with a little encapsulated arc of story complete with ending. The rest is very episodic with no real overarching plot. 
>> ARTICLE
>These. I just can't get past the characters..
>Sakurasou

What was the matter with the characters or was it just specific one?
>> ARTICLE
Sorata was a jerk and I doubted his sanity more often than Shiina's. As much as it was supposed to show his development as a character/person, I found it incredibly annoying and off-putting. And also Misaki and Rita were pretty annoying (and for the most part, completely useless to the overall story).
>> ARTICLE
Even though I agree with you, you have to consider that it was mostly jealousy causing him being a jerk. I guess everyone would get pissed, however being rude to Shiina was so unnecessary and really made me dislike him several times, but that's all part of it.

Misaki and Rita were used for the comedic effect, otherwise the show would've been a little onesided, but at the same time, they had a big impact on the show because there were several problems from different aspects and they both had their problems to deal with, so I wouldn't call them useless at all.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess everyone would get pissed

No, mentally stable people wouldn't.

>however being rude to Shiina was so unnecessary and really made me dislike him several times, but that's all part of it. 

That's my point. That's why I hated him.
>> ARTICLE
>No, mentally stable people wouldn't.

You wouldn' show it that obvious, but you'd surely not be all happy about when someone achieved something with ease while you have to work hard.
>> ARTICLE
Golden time is pretty good if you ask me 
>> ARTICLE
Well, yeah, that as the question. 

> What anime, that is wildly popular, that you just can't watch?

I hated Kouko. She was annoying obsessive psycho (at least in first 7 episodes). I had some problems with Banri but I can't recall the specifics right now. I think I found him quite boring and dull though.
>> ARTICLE
Although I did watch the first season (mostly because I hate dropping things that I already started), I won't watch the second season of chuunibyou. Why? Because I seriously can't get to like "the story" (yes I know it's supposed to be cute, but I don't find it either):

Guy is a retard. Guy stops being retard. Finds girl who acts like a retard. "Stop being retard", guy said. "No", responded girl. "Let's be retard together then" said guy. The end.

>> ARTICLE
I would argue that enjoyment of *Chu2Koi* has more to do with finding the characters appealing on some level than liking the story.  The fact that you call them "retards" (which is a pretty shitty expression to use, even on the internet), would indicate that you did not.
>> ARTICLE
I think at some point for me, the characters were overshadowed by the setting, so I couldn't really enjoy them.

P.S. My bad on the "retard", by where I live (Qubec, French-Canadian), we don't really associate the word "retard" with mental illness, more with acting stupidly. I just lack a better word.
>> ARTICLE
I only got like halfway through it.  But it's more like, "don't try to hide things you enjoy" or "be yourself.". That's what I understood from the few episodes anyways.

Which Inou Battle did far more better in executing that instead. Later of course.

Durarara (i tried guys...i really did. Your sorta slice-of-life supernatural urban shallow-character-fest-o-rama just didnt do it for me. I got a whole seven episodes in!)

Cowboy Bebop.

I just don't think I'll enjoy the episodic nature of it. I like watching a series and seeing character growth and events linking together over time.

Can't help but feel that removing it would essentially be like watching a bunch of really short movies together.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely. I watched it when it was airing on tv and didn't really care for it so I stopped watching it. Years later the online anime community seems to hold it as the golden example of what all anime should be, So I decide to rewatch it. I make it through and I feel so unsatisfied. After watching every episode, I still don't feel connected to the characters in the slightest. Cowboy Bebop is missing any real sense of development and I personally can't say I enjoy that sort of content. The fight scenes are all great, But they can't pull me along 
>> ARTICLE
Can't really get into anything bigger than a 60 episode series. Didn't really find Cowboy Bebop too interesting and dropped it after three episodes. Samurai Champloo was actually pretty fun but something about the art style annoyed me.
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is somehow an unlikable and infuriating version of Johnny Bravo. And "Boobies?" Really? I would ask if the show was made by small kids but I wasn't even that dumb growing up.         
      
Cowboy Bebop was just to boring for me to ever finish and for random episodes I catch the side characters always go through something that is supposed to be really emotional but I think is stupid and was completely avoidable. (Oh and could people stop bringing it and firefly up anytime there is a game/tv show set in space? It gets old. Its not the most amazing thing ever.)        
      
Kill la Kill. I keep hearing its good. That is great for anybody that can get far enough into it. When the creators or pretty much anybody comes out with a version that doesn't insult me as a human being I will gladly try it out. When I want to watch hentai or porn I can go watch hentai or porn. When I want to watch a serious anime I want to watch a serious anime. There is enough random and completely out of place fanservice in even the most unassuming(?) anime. I won't purposely go into one that is covered in it.

Clannad After Story (forced myself through season one, DON'T KNOW HOW I MADE IT THROUGH THAT PIECE OF SHIT), Lucky Star

Clannad is self-explanatory.

Lucky Star is annoying, lacks any entertaining aspects, and who the hell finds a bunch of girls talking to be entertaining? Seriously, I don't give a damn about how you eat something, what your friend online did when you already have a bunch of annoying ones who aren't online, and MANY other things. I... couldn't even get past episode 1 (and I don't even know how I forced myself through episode 1...).
>> ARTICLE
If I wasn't new to anime when I watched Clannad, I would have dropped it after 3 episodes max. I don't regret watching it though, I've completed much worse shows
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is not actually as bad as some people make it out to be, it's a quite well-crafted slice-of-life show.

Nah, I didn't really like it. It was just a mediocre high-school slice of life comedy until AS which was a lot better in my opinion.

Monogatari second season. I've managed to watch nisemonogatari and bakemonogatari, but mono finished me off. I just don't get that show. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be even. It's like a bit of everything and nothing at the same time. 
>> ARTICLE
After Nisemonogatari, I was kinda, well that's enough for me. Didn't like the whole metaphorical, super deep thing, felt like most jokes/wordplay only work in Japanese, the forced fan service, and not even a big  fan of harems. I don't understand why this sub loves the series, honestly.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I could've gotten through mono if it's first arc wasn't about Hanekawa, aka the most boring character in the universe. I've finished that arc, Hanekawa, supposedly, became better, but then the next episode was a freaking flashback! Nope. Done. Seeya not. 
>> ARTICLE
I could not even get through the first half of Chuunibyou. Not even because I thought it was awfully done, but because I cannot stand watching really socially awkward situations. Also, I find the general feeling of "being a child forever" that the shows gives off repelling.

You are missing much. It's really extremely passable. If you don't like the character's then it's downright shit tier. But a lot of people find the girls to be cute I suppose.

I have no idea how old you are in real-life, but as a 33 year old, I can tell you that whenever you can "be a kid" - whether by chronological age or just being able to relax, play and have fun as an adult - it's the right call.

It takes a while to pick up. I dropped Bakemonogatari after the first few episodes too when I first watched it, but people kept talking about how good it is and I did like the style of it, so I picked it up again and forced my way through the first episodes. Now, Monogatari series is my favourite anime series of all time. Whoops...

Steins;Gate. I'm not going to sit through 12 episodes of boredom in a 24 episode series, with only the word of others that it "gets better." There are plenty of shows that are good from the beginning for me to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Man such a coincidence because it's the same for me, I mean there are anime movies out there that have introduced characters and a plot, have the characters progress and the plot resolved, all this within 80-120 minutes, and Steins;Gate has 12 episodes where there is almost no character or plot progression at all, it's just so hard for me to get into.
>> ARTICLE
The first half is slow but that doesn't mean its bad or irrelevent it's all very important and done for a reason and I appreciate those episodes now after finishing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't think the first twelve epusodes of Sg were boring at all. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah i loved it too. actually i think the pacing is nothing short of brilliant, the first to episodes flashed me, loved the mistery the time travelling and kyouma. then it's sort of slice of live, where you really get involved with the characters, starting to love them, and learning about all the details that are ijportant about/for them which become relevant again later. also seeing their relationships and their way of life. then the shock and the adtion building up to the awesome resolution. loved that show 
>> ARTICLE
I think the show is too hyped that people get unreasonable expectations. This hype goes both ways too. When you are told the first 12 episodes suck you will probably believe it.
>> ARTICLE
So have you watched it and dropped it or just listened to others saying the first half is boring and deciding not to watch it? Because I loved literally every episode and you should at least try it out.
>> ARTICLE
I like Steins;Gate, but I *hate* when people insist that you have to get through some percent of a shitty story before it "gets better". I'm sorry but if this book/show/movie/game can't even keep me *interested* for its duration then I'm not going to bet on it ultimately delivering some amazing experience that will retroactively make it all worth it. Holding on to the audience's attention is a fundamental writing skill. If you can't do that for a given person, then as far as their considered you have a grossly inadequate skill-set as a writer. 
>> ARTICLE
I 100% agree. I always cringe when people say "Just force yourself to keep watching until episode X." I have very limited free time. I'm not going to squander it on a show that I'm hoping will stop sucking. I know that Western shows usually put everything they can into their pilot episode, since how it's received usually determines if they get to air it. Does anime not have the same system?
>> ARTICLE
I loved the show from 1-24 so I never understand why people hate the first half so much.
>> ARTICLE
Different strokes mate. It may seem strange for me to call S;G boring when Tamako Market is my favorite anime; but I went into it expecting a lack of tension and drama, whereas S;G's premise and fans lead me to expect them.

SG kinda needs the long buildup though. I'm not sure if you've watched all the way through, but after the first 8 out so episodes once they've started fucking around with the timelines, they start dropping a lot of "Oh SHIT" moments.

Kalaid Liner is mostly Iliya fanservice (it statted out as a doujin lol) plus spoilers and references to other Nasuverse works.

It is. Based on the 10 episodes I've seen, it's basically Cardcaptor Sakura with a little comedy based on ecchi and magical girl tropes.

That makes sense. I have no clue if it is or isn't.

**TTGL**. I just couldn't get into it.

I guess another one would be **Monogatari Series** . I've seen up to Second Season and I don't plan on watching the rest. Not even Kizu, whenever that may be.

**Durarara!!** I'm currently watching its second season and I'm still not liking it. I'll finish it but that's all I'm willing to watch.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** I watched two episodes. I've grown to dislike Edward so I don't know if I can force my way through 64 episodes.

Kill la Kill. I've heard great things about it but I watched a couple minutes of it and it was so hectic and over the top and I couldn't really get into it.

Kill la kill. Idk I just found myself bored with it.

* *Higurashi no Naku Koro ni* - Got bored around episode 12 while waiting for the series to transition to "explanation" arcs.  Too much backloading on the answers, and not enough connections to be made early on. 
* *Kill la Kill* - Watched two episodes, seemed overly random and nonsensical for an anime that was supposed to have a plot.   
* *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann* - Alternates between over-the-top and boring.  Can't get past episode two.
* *Welcome to the NHK* - Hits a bit close to home.  Provides no escapism because of personal similarity to the MC.  Slow.

>Can't get past episode 2 of TTGL

...I'm not an anime expert (far from it), but isn't there a "3 episode rule"? Basically, you haven't given TTGL enough of a chance.
>> ARTICLE
It just sounds like you're impatient.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes, for sure.  But there are a good many "slow" series that I've watched and enjoyed as well.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has plenty of *plot* if you know what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
it also has actual plot
>> ARTICLE
I agree with Higurashi. Took me like 2 months i think to watch all of the first season. I feel season 1 really is just a chore, not necessarily bad but nothing really happens in it till like the final 2 arcs that will hold your attention. 
>> ARTICLE
I get what they were trying to do, but pushing the "reset button" on your characters and setting every 2-4 episodes and then establishing them as radically different doesn't build any sort of attachment, for me, at least.
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly when I was watching. It all makes sense in the second season though. Honestly they could have cut out some of the reset arcs from season 1 and instead include the 1st half of the second season and it would have been so much better!
>> ARTICLE
I tried so hard to like kill a kill.  I watched 6 episodes and only laughed a total of 3 times.  All my friends like it and recommended it, but I just can't like the random shallow humor.
>> ARTICLE
> Kill la Kill - Watched two episodes, seemed overly random and nonsensical for an anime that was supposed to have a plot.

i will always say that people should see the first 3 and to be honest how much of the plot do you think you'll see in 2 episodes
>> ARTICLE
> how much of the plot do you think you'll see in 2 episodes

It depends on the series.  Most of the anime I rate highly have really strong openings that get the viewer invested in the world, plot and / or characters from the onset.  Not beginnings that make me wonder, "WTF did I just watch?"
>> ARTICLE
i guess but the overall story doesnt really come in until later about 10 or so episodes in is when "shit gets real" but i definitly say people should check out episode 3 because those first 3 are like the introduction then 4 is a break to the overall story and then things get started.

For the only watching 2 episodes thing, right?

For not being instantly hooked
>> ARTICLE
Well, for the first one you want to downvote for, I don't plan to watch it myself. I don't trust myself to not be put off - possibly put off of anime entirely - by the fanservice.

TTGL on the other hand... Well, let's just say that the Z timeline of SRW is like the Alpha timeline (and W) in that it'll have a non-Original that would pretty much be one of my favourite units in the game.
>> ARTICLE

Fan service isn't even that bad. They even make fun of it.

My point still stands, though.

Bear in mind I've only watched two and a half (because second half of UBW isn't out yet) series.
>> ARTICLE
Right. You're an anime noob still. No worries, get some experience under your belt, get used to it and come back. I was like that, then I exposed myself to Elfen Lied and Highschool DxD and promised myself I would continue to watch anime no matter what. Now no amount of fan service can touch me.

>NHK

>Provides no escapism

This is a lie.
>> ARTICLE
Not from what I could watch of the series, it isn't.
>> ARTICLE
How far did you get? Cause the only episode I'd possibly argue has no escapist-fantasy qualities is episode 1. And even in episode 1 they're there slightly.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2, I think?  Yeah, Episode 2.  It was too mundane, and didn't hold my attention.  I'm sorry we feel differently about this.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's a really good show. I'd put it in my top 5 series honestly. Maybe it'll catch your interest one day. 

I sometimes see people saying it isn't an escapist fantasy (like you did), but I'd argue it's one of the biggest escapism-providing anime series out there. I think the main character hits *so* close to home for so many people that they often overlook that even the premise for the show is as escape-y as you can get.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill really doesn't have anything resembling a plot until at least halfway through, and even then it's barely passable as plot. It gets ridiculously entertaining though, which is why I like it.
>> ARTICLE
I will watch just about anything and everything, for the sake of expanding my anime knoledge.

Gurren Laggen, not even sure why but I just couldn't carry on watching after about 3 episodes.

I don't know if Shigatsu is going to end up being really popular (it's #15 on MAL at least), but I watched the first episode a while back and decided I didn't care for it. After reading some reviews and deliberately spoiling the ending for myself I'm fairly sure I'll never watch it. It's just not my kind of thing.

Also I watched the first episode of Nichijou and decided not to continue because I didn't think it was funny.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the characters in Shigatsu are too young. It's a great show, but that really threw me off at first.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter and Gintama both for the same reason: So many episodes...I really to hate to use that as an excuse because I know I can be missing something amazing and I hate it when people say with books "I don't read it because it's too many pages", but when I hear "You have to watch 30-50 episodes before it gets really good", I just don't think I can last that long to wait for a show to get that good. Maybe over the summer I'll finally do it, but at the moment, I^am^really^sorry...
>> ARTICLE
For Hunter X Hunter I liked... I don't consider the arc names a spoiler... The hunter's exam arc better in the 99 series than in the 2011 one. 2011 one skipped some cool things and even half of one phase. :( Actually, it was probably somewhere in the heaven's arena arc where I enjoyed the 2011 series more than the 99. 

Regardless I say start watching it. if you're not enjoying it then you can stop, but if you are enjoying it continue. I don't understand people having to make a commitment out of it.
>> ARTICLE
The only arc name that is a spoiler is [Hunter x Hunter Spoilers](/s "13th Chairman Election Arc. That sorta tells you that something happens to the 12th chairman.")

Just take it slow... I mean nobody is forcing you to watch every episode in a week. I got into Gintama watching an episode every day or two, and eventually it turned into more and more.

Admittedly it was RWBY that got me interested,  but it was Girls und Panzer that got my attention. That and Kantai b/c Kongou best Battlecruiser.
>> ARTICLE
Glad that we can agree on KanColle being awesome. Haven't seen the other two, only heard of them but they never seemed very interesting to me. 
>> ARTICLE
Girls und Panzer is interesting especially if KanColle got you interested in WWII vehicle history. It's a fun little romp and the steryotypes each of the other schools play to ate all entertaining.

RWBY most people don't consider to be an Anime,  and on top of that, it's a new project made by an entirely green team that's never really worked in anime before and with two seasons already gone doesn't show signs of wrapping any time soon. To further complicate things, the project lead died a while back. It's got a great world,  great concepts, and great characters,  but the writing and at times the animation are suffering. The voice acting starts rough but gets better by the end of S1, and one of the VAs has been picked up to do some professional VA work on other dubs as a result. 
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion for few reasons:  

* Graphics, i just can't stand old graphics. I know that old shows may have absolutely awesome plot, but i just can't make myself watch them.

The Fate route!

That H scene threw me off, had no idea it was there

Same here. So I just skiped through it as much as the VN would let me.

**Word of warning, though; there is another one later in the Fate route, UBW has one towards the end and HF (the third route has SEVERAL).**

There. Now you know.

If you're using the voice patch, then you can use that to know if one's coming - the voices are based on a different version (I think it was for the PS2?) which took those scenes out. Meaning, if the characters are speaking yet there's no voice, one of those scenes is coming up!
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen anybody mention Shinsekai Yori. IMO the cinematography (or the animation equivalent) is just whack. I can't really put my finger on it, but everything the main characters did just seemed to piss me off, just watching the way they handled situations was an eyesore. 

It's also due to this that I can't watch High-School/Romance/SoL. I saw someone previously mention that they couldn't watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and i'm 100% on their side. 

>> ARTICLE
Yea I didn't like it either. Watched the first 8 episodes when it aired and I thought they were all pretty bad. Did not drop because of the yaoi I just had no motivation whatsoever to continue. If anything it was more of the timeskip that took away any ounce of interest I had remaining for the show.

Oh there's plenty of other people out there who you can talk to it about. And hell people who dislike it can sometimes be even more willing to talk about it.

Steins gate. Been on r/anime enough to know it is Time Travelling and  I really hate that genre (But I love reincarnation so meh, I don't get it and I find second chance stories to be interesting too (New Game+)) and it sounds really cheesy to me. I guess it is because I formed an opinion that this guy will try to change the past over and over and I hate that.
>> ARTICLE
So,  so close,  yet so far. Steins;Gate actually differs a bit from normal time travel genres as for the most part,  actual physical time travel isn't possible. However,  that doesn't mean that *data* can't be sent back, which is where the kitchen appliances come in. It also focuses on rather than trying to change the past, it focuses more on how small changes can effect the present. The past does change quite a bit, but for the most part it's not Okabe doing it.

All the longer shounens: One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Bleach, Gintama, etc. The format and the amount of filler (even if you can skip filler episodes/arcs) doesn't appeal at all.

I don't think anything becomes quite as epic as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I've wanted to write a story with that level of epicness, actually, since before the series was released in the US. But I cannot think of anything that epic.

FLCL is pretty good - a six-episode OVA from the same studio as TTGL, and they do an excellent job creating an epic scale given the town-sized setting.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann yet (downloading now...) but in terms of epic anime I've seen in the last few years, Ergo Proxy has to top the list (amazing story, beautiful throughout and very original in both style and execution), followed by the ultra-bloody Hellsing Ultimate.
>> ARTICLE
The makers of TTGL followed one rule: outdo yourself every episode. The anime stops when they reach such a scale that they can no longer outdo themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I've now seen the first four episodes. Watched them last night with a couple friends, and it is indeed 'epic'. If someone had said it was the creative force that brought the world 'Dead Leaves' then I would've jumped on this train long ago. If you haven't seen 'Dead Leaves', go. Now. Buy it, stream it, torrent it. Whatever, just watch. However, I would advise getting the dub on this one. The dub is pretty good, but due to the fact that it's a total tour de force, it's very hard to keep up with the subs.

Agreed. It's like all those kids that grew watching Mazinger Z and other super-robot series grew up, joined together and made the perfect series. Or maybe they didn't grew up, which makes it even better.

A word of warning, tough: it may be too childish for your tastes at first, but gets better over time. After the series, on the OVAs, any trace of that is gone, as they are pure, unadulterated GAR.

As a bonus, the main guy shares [seiyuu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuyuki_Hiyama) with Viral. It also voices a minor (but Gar) character in the Epic+Boob series [Godannar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godannar), also recommended.

Maybe not quite on the same level, but I felt like Gunbuster 2 was the closest to the awesome that was TTGL. If you do decide to watch it, it's my opinion that you should definitely watch the first Gunbuster ; the ending to Gunbuster 2 would probably not make any sense without it.

I suggested this to Epycre at the [MAL Reddit Club](http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=18492) and he seemed to agree with both observations.

Everyone I know has either watched less than 6 episodes, or all of them.  I would tell you leave it be for a year, and then watch 8 episodes.  Then you'll almost certainly watch all 27.

Edit: Additionally, I consider the first 12 or so episodes simply build up to get you to buy into the last 15, and especially the last 6 or so episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I get that. Maybe in a year or something if I went I might like it but I feel like saying 'watch half the series then it gets good' is not that great a sign. The last time I watched half a series hoping it gets good while it's shit was Wolf's Rain.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it gets good at episode 8, and it tops anything I've ever watched after episode 17 or 18.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of animes can start out weak and get really good, and lots of them start out really good and then fall apart. Black Lagoon was really good, but I felt that the ending really wasn't anything exciting.

Because they watched more than two episodes. Seriously, it gets better and better and continually defies your expectations of what type of story and what style of anime it actually is. 
>> ARTICLE
Preach! lmao
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entire series. I still don't get it. Just here to say that it's not necessarily for everyone.

To me, it just seemed kinda ridiculous that they solve all their fights the same way every time: Some guy is harder to beat than the last one. So everyone believes in Simon. He gets a bigger drill and wins. Also, I think the drill/spiral metaphor is taken way too far, to the point where it doesn't represent anything truly meaningful after a while.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sort of like how all these lame movies have something really bad happening, and then the hero defeats it, wins, and gets the girl.

Not only is your description not technically accurate, I think you missed a lot of the subtext of the show.

I realize I won't convince you, but I did just want to go on the record as disagreeing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it'd be nice to watch it with someone who really enjoys the show. Most of the people I know who love it just make it sound like it should be self-evident that TTGL is great.

I have to agree with rerucho and cabman567. I thought this anime was awful. Came here to find out what people thought was similar to Gurren Lagann so I could avoid it. Thanks, heyarnold.
>> ARTICLE
Nah. Gurren-Lagann is certainly epic, but it's still not a proper use of the word. Not that I'm complaining, I don't mind the usage of "epic" in this fashion, but the *proper* meaning is very different.

There's only one anime that truly deserves to be called epic in the fullest sense of the word. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, also known as Gin'eiden. Translates to "Legend of the Galactic Heroes". That's what you would call a proper "epic" anime in the classical sense :)
>> ARTICLE
Upvote because this is true. I can't go into detail because I lack the eloquence to describe the difference, but you really must experience both to understand. I suppose an Epic could be described as a story you must, I guess, almost WORK to understand and enjoy - be faithful to it and it gives you a reason to be faithful to it.

Gilgamesh(the, well, epic. Not the anime) is certainly almost the perfect archetype of epic. And I don't think it's anything you really have to work to understand or enjoy.

I just watched the first 3 eps of Death Note, and it's very good.  But it's nowhere on the same level as gurren laggan.  Death Note suffers from some of the typical japanese over-rationalized explanatory style.  Good, but not great.

Last Exile was an interesting idea but not well executed.  
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Death Note is one of the most intelligent stories out there. It's essentially a mystery/detective story so the style fits. That said, I never really watched the anime. I read the manga first and realized a few eps in that a lot of dialogue was left out. Death Note is just ill-matched with anime (no "cool" fight scenes, just ones with walls of text).

>Death Note suffers from some of the typical japanese over-rationalized explanatory style.

I would rather say most anime plots aren't really rationally explained, with Death Note being an exception where everything is actually logical and makes sense.

**PSA: THERE IS A POST-CREDITS SCENE SO MAKE SURE TO WATCH THAT**

Welcome to the beginning of the end, everyone! Sorry I'm late, was watching Kekkai Sensen. "Childhood's End", a perfect name for the first movie. I don't really have a lot to say before I get started other than I'm excited that we're finally here. Welcome back to **"Heaven Piercing Music and Facts"**!

I'm changing things up a bit for the movies, instead of a **"Song of the Episode"** we'll have **"Songs of the Movie"**.

- Today's first **"Song of the Movie"** is ["Spinning Spinning Spinning Spinniiiing..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51FlClebg-Y).

- Today's second **"Song of the Movie"** is ["With Your xxx, Pierce the Heavens!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_bQMJsMl0).

- Today's third and final **"Song of the Movie"** is ["Geez, Travels are So Tiring"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdZhtZSSC9s).

Some honorable mentions.

- ["Libera Me From Hell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE) because it's amazing and deserves to be mentioned.

- ["Happily Ever After"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFahCRRS1K8) because we got to see Simon's big comeback.

Oh boy do I got a lot of facts for you guys today; most of these come from the prologue of the movie.

- **"It's Symbolic"**: In case you didn't see what I said before about "Libera Me From Hell", the song is symbolic with the opera being the Anti-Spirals and the rap being Team Dai-Gurren. So for the prologue where we get to see Lordgenome's backstory and humanity's fall; what song did they choose? "Libera Me From Hell" without the rap.

- **"Lordgenome and His Pets"**: In [this shot of Lordgenome as a kid](http://i.imgur.com/KQtH6t0.jpg), we see Lordgenome and a bunch of animals. Among these animals are a [gorilla](http://i.imgur.com/MRDdjq3.jpg), a [scorpion](http://i.imgur.com/PvALoXG.jpg), an [armadillo](http://i.imgur.com/be63whK.jpg), and a [bird](http://i.imgur.com/I906YNA.jpg). These animals correspond to the 4 generals, [Thymilph](http://i.imgur.com/yNCAjLF.jpg), [Adiane](http://i.imgur.com/KPoDPZx.jpg), [Guame](http://i.imgur.com/PQEFPKN.jpg), and [Cytomander](http://i.imgur.com/9Nl1Nww.jpg).

- **"Who's That Pokemon?"**: In addition to [the 4 generals with kid Lordgenome](http://i.imgur.com/KQtH6t0.jpg), there's also a [Pikachu](http://i.imgur.com/0cnaE0O.jpg) and a [Mew](http://i.imgur.com/izDfR7K.jpg).

- **"Omage to all those who paved the way"**: During the prologue, we're given [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/KmPDuUK.jpg) of a bunch of Gurren Laganns. A lot of those Gurren Laganns are actually mechs from different anime. I'm not entirely cultured with mech anime but I know for sure that [this one](http://i.imgur.com/XeCmwRy.jpg) is [Mazinger Z](http://i.imgur.com/xNTwbXl.jpg). If you recognized any of them feel free to reply.

- **"Clever Naming Scheme"**: The [Do-Ten-Kai-Zan's](http://i.imgur.com/1JY4LfR.jpg) name comes from the last syllable of the Four Generals' Dai-Guns: [Dai-Gundo](http://i.imgur.com/tlnB73T.gif), [Dai-Gunten](http://i.imgur.com/7FFdOKA.gif), [Dai-Gunkai](http://i.imgur.com/1SxXsjy.gif), and [Dai-Gunazan-Du](http://i.imgur.com/YOMSn7f.jpg)/[Dai-Gunzan](http://i.imgur.com/J1gPu7p.gif).

- **"O Hey it's That Guy"**: In case you didn't notice it, [this kid right here](http://i.imgur.com/vgCRMuR.jpg) is [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/uVqllAe.jpg) after the time skip.

These movies are the reason I fell in love with Gurren Lagann, the prologue is so well done and I love it. They really made Simon's comeback scene look a lot better. The amount of money they probably threw around for those redone scenes is probably immense. If you wanna see an extended version of the prologue, [Parallel Works 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e2CiFbmQEg) is a little more extended compared to the prologue. I hope to see you all tomorrow for the thrilling conclusion to this amazing series. See you all tomorrow for the last **"Heaven Piercng Music and Facts"**!
>> ARTICLE
That is a really great omage, because Mazinger Zetto and the other Mecha did pave the way for Gurren Lagann. I am sure Gunbuster and a Gundam are in there. 
>> ARTICLE
So something that I really like in Kamina's final battle is that when he wakes up to talk sense into Simon and win with Gurren Lagann one last time, the the entire cockpit and Kamina himself have a green lighting and shading. And what color is the raw spiral energy of Gurren Lagann? Green. It's like it's symbolic of how Kamina willed himself back from death to help Simon and say what he needed to say to him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I love that part, I mentioned that in the Episode 8 Rewatch Thread hoping it'd make some people happier knowing he went out like a true man
>> ARTICLE
Tomorrow...tomorrow is the anime with my favorite moment of media. Period. 

<><>

That's an infinity symbol BTW. I'll write more on why I think it's brilliant in the next post tomorrow. 
>> ARTICLE
So I actually didnt realise that these two movies would be recaps, but Im so incredibly glad that they are, cause I had a strong urge to rewatch the entire series right after the last episode.

Can I ask you guys something? Does it make you sad when you rewatch it, knowing whats gonna happen? Maybe because its still fresh to me, but its kind of saddening to me. Like [this](http://i.imgur.com/sZDhhvi.png), right here. Breaking my heart. I really hate how they were forced apart.

Also, in regards to Kaminas death scene, seeing him come back like that to knock some sense into Simon, is really hard to watch cause it was all false hope. Like, Simon looks so happy and then Kamina dies anyway. I wasnt completely sold on him living through an injury like that, but I definitely also felt some of that false hope.

And I liked the last scene, how they changed it up.

Anyway, I cant believe that was nearly 2 hours. It went by so quickly. Everything actually flowed really smoothly. It makes me appreciate the way they planned out the entire story. Its pretty incredible, seeing the beginning episodes again and understanding how complete and well-written the actual story of TTGL feels.
>> ARTICLE
I told my friend to watch the show and he binged it all till 8 am, he was utterly destroyed in the ending, he thought Kamina's part was bad, but he could see it coming, but the ending just made him stop watching anime for a while and he said he can't or ever will rate it because of how sad it was.
>> ARTICLE
That's kind of a shame. The show *was* sad, but that's not all it was
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it makes me sad, but also realizes that how small the fights are compared to later on in the series, which shows truly how far Team Dai-Gurren has come from where they first started to where they are in the last fight.

Can't wait to read your reaction for the final battle tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
For me personally, I didn't really get emotional watching the movie because for me it felt waaaay to rushed until I got to the [flashback scene](https://d.maxfile.ro/iedjmephic.webm) where it really hit hard. It was done longer in the movie than in the TV series so I think I was more emotional during the movie version than the TV one. 
>> ARTICLE
Except for the random Kamina ass-smack.

Like, what the fuck, movie, we're trying to have a moment here.
>> ARTICLE
The smack's filled with emotion, buddy.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't had time to watch the entire thing yet, only about half. I'll watch the rest and the second movie later, but we need more comments up in here! Where'd everyone go?

It's definitely weird going from the dub to the sub. I like most of the voices though. Yoko's is pretty solid, and her screams/shrieks were very good. Leeron's isn't bad, but Steve Blum just did too fantastic of a job for me to get used to another voice. Simon's is good. Kittan's is good. Kamina's is alright.

I liked how they just montaged over episode 4. Smart move to just give the highlights from it and a couple of the other less plot-important episodes. Though the first 3 or so episodes took up a good chunk of the beginning of the movie. Pacing is ok so far. It's moving fast though. It's like all the highlights are around every turn.

I guess it's pretty good. I'd rather just watch the series. I don't really get why a lot of shows do these movie recaps. Just to have a shorter version of their work? So you don't have to put in the time to watch the whole show and can just binge a movie or two to relive it?

>> ARTICLE
For me it was great to watch Gurren-Hen and Lagann-hen some years later after watching the series, I could relive the great moments of the series in two short 2 hours burst without sitting through the whole series, also I liked some changes, for example the fight against 3 generals at the same time or [Lagann-hen Spoiler](/s " The "hacking" scene with Lordgenome") but now I don't have really much to say about these movies because I already said everything in the series rewatch (and I didn't had the time to watch the movie yesterday)
>> ARTICLE
Are they that common? I know of the TTGL ones and the GitS:SAC ones (which I really enjoy as well). And I think there's Madoka Magica ones (Is that what's on Netflix now?) Oh, and Patlabor. And Macross.  And Galaxy Express 999

There's quite few actually now that I think about it. And...I like them all. At least the ones that I've seen. Which in that list is everything minus the Madoka Magica ones.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how common recap movies are, tbh. I've just seen there are some. I guess common isn't the best word, but there are enough of them that it made me wonder why they do them.

As long as they're good and people enjoy them they'll make them. I don't personally care. They're just not my thing.

> there's Madoka Magica ones (Is that what's on Netflix now?)

Yep, all three are on Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I believed Simons speech at the end couldn't be topped, but this movie showed me otherwise. I often rewatch the last 20 minutes of the movie if I ever want to just see something badass. 
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: all names in TTGL are some simple pun of anagram. The place where the final battle occurs is North Kanandoma Plateau. Kanandoma comes from Domannaka, which is "right in the middle." The series' writer (and the creator of the names) Kazuki Nakashima is joking about it "I don't know whether it is north or center"

Let's be honest, the first 85% of this one is a glorified montage.

What, no love for *Haruhi*'s Endless Eight arc? I could watch that like, 15 532 times at least.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, though... I can't think of a single anime series that I've rewatched from start to finish other than Haruhi Suzumiya, and I've rewatched that about a dozen times. I ended up making myself a fan edit of the series, in which both seasons are mixed together in something close to the original broadcast order, all episodes use the season 1 OP and ED, and half of the E8 episodes are cut out. It makes for a pretty enjoyable run.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished that. Urgh. I hoped that at the least the ending would come close to that of Melancholy VI. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude I wasted my time thinking that something different was going to happen and when it didn't happen by the 7th I was ready to throw my computer out the window.

>> ARTICLE
My frustration was not endless eight per-se. It would be a serious bother if I only knew that Disappearance would be aired. But the possibility of it being skipped altogether was too painful as it became more iminent with each missed episode.

Thankfully, the movie came, and everything went *just fine*.
>> ARTICLE
15,498 for the purists. :)
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell wouldn't they be consistent about that? Is there some particular meaning to either of the numbers?
>> ARTICLE
15,498 is the number in the novel version. After Kyoanni extended Endless Eight in the series, of course they had to change the number to keep the element of surprise.

EDIT: Typo.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes sense then. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
You know the whole point of that Endless 8 arc was so you experience the frustration/boredom that Yuki goes through right? 
>> ARTICLE
I think it was artistic genius. However, kids watching this at home might not share my respect for the creators commitment to getting us in a shared state of mind with the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's acceptable for "artistic genius" to take a backseat when said genius makes a large amount of people want to stop watching the show.
>> ARTICLE
It was just a cool concept whose implementation was horrible. 

Showing nearly the same episode over and over again in order to get the fans frustrated from seeing the same thing over and over again to set up the movie? Awesome!

Making it 8 episodes out of a f 1 cour show? um....

I would have personally liked it to be 4 episodes. I feel 4 episodes would have been good for getting the idea across, but at the same time frustrating you and making little changes here and there (Kyon's failed attempt to bring Haruhi back).
>> ARTICLE
Copied this my previous post:

It's supposed to make you empathize with Nagato. Hell, it FORCES you to. There's a reason there is an unusual amount of emphasis on her during the first season's OP, as well as the blank period where you see only Nagato reading alone, by herself for 5+ minutes in the episode "Someday in the Rain." Kyon wonders how much Nagato has to do behind the scenes because of Haruhi and the other factions after "Mysterique Sign." She also gets maimed during the filming of "The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina," and Kyon rejects her idea that it didn't hurt.

They did everything, INCLUDING Endless Eight, for a reason (the Disappearance). Watch the whole series again, and you notice foreshadowing and development for her scattered all over the place.

Edit: I went on a bit of a tangent. Look at this way. Viewing lasts approx. 3.5 hours. An average human being feels anger at having to repeat these events for that long. Now think about 500+ YEARS. Over the course of that time, even an "emotionless" android (who shows a desire to win during "The Day of Sagittarius"- so that's a lie) would get pissed off at having to go through the same two-week period 15,000+ times. She couldn't do anything to stop it because her role is to "observe ONLY," which also makes her all sorts of pitiable.
>> ARTICLE
What made me the saddest was Nagato's feeble attempt to change *anything*about the two weeks, so she just chooses different masks at the festival.

Holy hell. I never thought about that.

I just had a fridge moment about Disappearance.

[spoiler Disappearance](/s "When Asakura asks Nagato if this is what she really wanted, she was showing to her the imminent reality of death. Namely, Kyon's death. Would she like to live in a world where she and Kyon could die, and effectively disappear forever? Is this what she REALLY wanted? In this way, Asakura was fulfilling her role of being a backup. Being Nagato's voice of reason by way of a reductio ad absurdum. This is when Nagato understands (or will understand) the consequences of her decisions, in preparation for her freedom from knowing her future.")

Ok, so I'm not the only one who watches this ENTIRE scene regularly. Good...that's good...good...

Cowboy Bebop.  I'm surprised there aren't more people here saying this!  I've seen the show at least four times over, not including the times where I'll randomly find it on Adult Swim and just decide to catch an episode.  It's so easy to watch, and because of the way the plot is set up, you can jump in at any episode and find something to like.  For instance, my favorites are Ganymede Elegy and the Ballad of Fallen Angels.  In fact, I think I might have to dig out my DVD's right now...

I actually have a really hard time watching Eva again.  The beginning always feels dry so I get burnt out and just give up.

Really? Like I said before I just started this anime today and I am hooked. The very first episode is all action practically. The animation in particular is beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
The difference is that you are new to the franchise.  I have known Eva since I was ~10 years old and after all of it's incarnations in manga and movies, most recently the Rebuild series, it becomes somewhat tired.  

Eva is definitely a quality show, but it has aged.  With the Rebuild series being as new as it is, I also find it hard to have a sense of nostalgia when watching.  Think of trying to watch TV shows from when you were younger without any sense of nostalgia.

As for stuff from more recent vintage? I still re-watch Hourou Musuko, Toradora!, Nichijou, and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.
>> ARTICLE
I'm personally pretty incapable of rewatching, rereading, or replaying anything for the most part. I've rewatched some stuff, but it generally needs to be at least a year since I went through it. Part of it is because I already know what goes down, and part of it is because there's generally plenty of other things out there that I haven't experienced that I would prefer to go through.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou without a doubt. A work of genius plus I can't get enough of absurd comedy (that doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot). I can't see how you can repeatedly rewatch shows that rely heavily on plot unless you wipe your memory bank before each viewing (suggested techniques: imbibe lots of alcohol, bash head into wall). So I think slice-of-life shows make good candidates for rewatching, as they tend not to be strongly driven by plot.

I don't think a lot of people are putting thought into their choices here.  You probably shouldn't be answering this as "wut iz ur favorite animu?"  It's "rewatch infinitely".  Would you really just rewatch a 2hr movie over and over again, and not something a little longer with more variety?

My favorite shows are relatively short, but I'd choose Ranma 1/2 to rewatch over and over again, because there's a lot of variety, you could mix up the episode order and it wouldn't matter much, it's kind of light hearted so I wouldn't risk a depression-spiral, and it's long so it would be a long while until I started rewatching things.

>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I could watch it infinitely, but I have watched Madoka Magika like 5 times (does help that it is 12 episodes long). I have to hand it to the creators, the expository dialouge is very subtle and exactly phrased, particularly kyubey's and Homura's (the opening five minutes of the anime are a good example of this, but there are plenty of others).

 I really enjoy stories that are able to weave a lot of small pieces of information into the the character's speech or the setting around them (as opposed to simply concentrating all of the inportant information in the episode in a couple of hard-hitting wham lines) because you notice some new faucet of the plot, a character's disposition, or some aspect of the theme that the author is trying to demonstrate with each watch through. These reasons, I think, heavily determine a story's rereadabilty or rewatachability.

Madoka is one of probably only a couple shows which I have enjoyed watching the second or third time around more than the first time. As mentioned by some other people in this thread, FLCL and Mirrai Nikki are both highly rewatchable for similar reasons.

Welcome to the internet, not everyone has the same opinion here.

And that's okay.

Gonna say right now that using several references at once can kind of screw up your proportions if you're not careful. Good job overall!
>> ARTICLE
Good job! keep practicing! n_n
>> ARTICLE
obligatory *"Yoko's boobs aren't big enough"* comment...  Well done, makes me wish I was good at drawing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, great drawing overall, but Yoko's proportions are a ways off.
>> ARTICLE
In your defence, her boobs look better this way. I hate ridiculously large boobs.

Freakin' awesome.

This looks really well done! All the proportions are good, and the shading looks cool.  Nice background shading as well.

The finale of Battle Tendency... damn. I watched the whole first half of Stardust Crusaders in one day afterwards, and I normally don't marathon anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised how much Shokugeki No Souma manages to hype me up, the suspense the show builds up is amazing, every episode is just super exciting to watch 
>> ARTICLE
Thissssssss. I mean, this one takes the cake for me. I started watching, and after the kinda weird first 2 episodes, it got me to a whole new level of hype. 
>> ARTICLE
That moment when he dropped the Shokugeki bomb on [](/s ""Shinomiya"") was the hypest shit ive seen in a long time
>> ARTICLE
I literally pointed at the screen and went, "Ooooooooh! Fuck yes!" when that happened.
>> ARTICLE
We all know the hypest moment was [when](/s "The other students ruined his beef with the salt and he remade the beef bourguignon for Chapelle from scratch using the honey.")
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill, it also gets compared to TTGL quite a lot for the over the topness and entertainment.    
  
There's some sort of awesome moment every episode.
>> ARTICLE
i just watched the first episode of kill la kill and can confirm is a mind fucker. best anime
>> ARTICLE
I remember the excitement and anticipation between each episode of Kill la Kill when the show was ongoing. There's few things that matched those levels of hype.
>> ARTICLE
[Kill la Kill](https://fat.gfycat.com/ActualFeistyBettong.gif)
>> ARTICLE
While TTGL when quite more over the top, it actually focuses drama and quite moments quite well.


Kill la Kill on the other hand, is pure blood-boiling fight nonstop. And I like them both for being different.

I remember hearing about that third one: "and Hold a Determination to Fist"

yep, those titles are completely hype.

Just to make it clear, season 1 has some odd animation problems at times, it gets better on season 2 onwards when they redesign the characters

I just finished the first season and that graphic is spot on ( especially the 'Zenbu' and 'miku pls' ). Maybe it's because I went in with low expectations but I really enjoyed this series. I'd easily pick this over KLK honestly. It reminds me of Macross Frontier.

Animation turns to shit now and then but at least I never noticed it during fights, always during dialog and non action moments so it really didn't bother me much.

Personally Fate/Zero hyped the fuck out of me, especially the summoning the servants scene

Hell yeah Fate/Zero, that scene was so awesome (that music). The first episode needed that after the extremely long exposition.

The last thing I expected when I started this anime was to end up losing my mind over an airplane dogfight

How about sword fights... on motorcycles! Or while throwing cars and wielding machine guns.

A lot of Hiroyuki Sawano's work have some really hyped moments. 

Kill la Kill is a good example. 

[Guilty Crown](https://d.maxfile.ro/cutfxonryg.webm)

[Aldnoah Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xoqly3cifCs)

[Gundam Unicorn](https://d.maxfile.ro/nrmuesstfo.webm)
>> ARTICLE
I think the Guilty Crown link is broken; for me at least.
>> ARTICLE
Works perfectly fine for me. If you get the chrome warning just bypass it. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah man, Aldnoah had such potential...

I agree with your Gundam claim. But I would say that there are hypier entries in the franchise.
>> ARTICLE
Could you suggest one for me?
>> ARTICLE
The Gundam franchise is huge, here's a guide on all of them: https://i.imgur.com/cXsgDnR.jpg

I recommend you either start with Gundam 00, one of the more recent shows that's a spin off universe, or you start with the series's beginning, Gundam 0079.

By hypier entries in the franchise, I was referring to Gundam Build Fighters (which you shouldn't really watch if you're a beginner because it's full of fanservice for older fans) and G Gundam (an alternate universe show which is basically a shonen with robots)
>> ARTICLE
Backing up Gundam unicorn. Sawano's best work.
>> ARTICLE
unicorn looks hella nice but i don't want to watch the whole U.C T.T
>> ARTICLE
I watched it without watching the whole U.C., some things didn't make sense but it was still very good. Besides you should watch the U.C. anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown has one of the best composers ever. That and the art alone is worth a watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Agree.
>> ARTICLE
[Black Lagoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon), it's fucking pure action and fucking pure fun
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "You just got fucked!")

B-b-but muh [Jormungand](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12413/Jormungand)......
>> ARTICLE
Jormungand is nice and all, but it's not Black Lagoon. It's close, though.
>> ARTICLE
Jormugand isn't remotely similar to Black Lagoon. Comparing the two would be no different from comparing Evangelion and Eureka Seven because they both have mechs. 
>> ARTICLE
Expelled from Paradise is about quality over quantity when it comes to hype. It's a movie, so there's only a couple hype moments, but man, those goosebumps could kill a man. It's very well set up.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this was a thread about bad anime that are all hype and no pay-off. I am happily mistaken.  
  
[Haikyuu!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu!!). Every episode is build up to epic plays and things that put the audience in complete awe. I couldn't stop watching after this first episode.

A lot of sports series are filled with hype. [Kuroko](https://youtu.be/1ka8xApbV8A?t=23s) (fairly insignificant spoilers), [Ippo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxrTu7fT1FY) (spoilers), Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond, and Yowamushi Pedal for example.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, yowamushi pedal would be pointless without the hype, it is the definition of you can do an anime with anything and still make people shake between episodes
>> ARTICLE
Sports anime can build up hype really well, especially kuroko no basuke and Hajime no ippo. I can't remember how often I had to pause the anime to catch my breath and to calm down.
>> ARTICLE
Attack on titan, even a speech becomes epic because of the music and the way they scream. God I love it.

The OST from Fairy Tail is epic.

Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei


>> ARTICLE
Aite I actually like Mahouka (who knows why) but calling it a hype show is extremely inaccurate. The whole premise of that show is that Tatsuya is a diety toying with his lesser beings to amuse his imouto, and that nothing in existence could stand in his way. There's no hype there, only badassery.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life
>> ARTICLE
Hajemi No Ippo always had me at the edge of my seat. Not just during the boxing matches. Some great moments happen in between the fights as they worry and prepare for whats to come, strongly hyping up the upcoming match.

Ippo will always be one of the best adaptations for me. Like 5 manga chapters in 1 episode.

Season 2 of Assassination Classroom

Not quite sure if it fits, since it's more suspense, but Kaiji.

[Season 2 spoiler](/s "I can't think of another medium where a guy grabbing dice got me so excited.")

Redline also somewhat.

Gundam Build Fighters is exceptionally hypey, especially it's More-Shonen-Inclined second season.

This show basically runs on hype. "There's only a  1% chance he can do the thing! No one has ever done it, it's too dangerous!" "Dammit, we have no choice! We believe in you! Do the thing!" *Does the thing*.

The supposed "funniest scene in anime" from Steins;Gate was the most overhyped for me. Holy shit, I mean I love the show, but all I read before starting the series was "watch the sub otherwise you'll miss out on the funniest scene ever". 

It was pretty funny, but still... no way it could have lived up to the hype

**Code Geass - Lulu quoting Suzaku**

*I wonder what happiness could look like if we could give it a form..?
The Shape of happiness might resemble glass
Even though you don't usually notice it, it's still definitely there
You merely have to change your Point of View slightly
and that glass will sparkle when it reflects the light
I doubt that anything could argue its existence more eloquently*

**Clannad - Tomoya/Nagisa**

*Nagisa: Fun things...Happy things...They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you go on loving this place?

Tomoya: Just find something...Just find something new that's fun or happy. Come on, let's get going (We start to walk up...the long...long...uphill climb).*

A little sad considering that you can't keep finding new things, [](/s "when your dead.")

**End of Evangalion - Shinji/Asuka**; Not really a clean and neat quote but since I see people posting some interesting dialogue. 

Shinji - *Please Asuka your the only person who can help me*

Asuka - *Liar*

Shinji - *Asuka?*

Asuka - *Anyone will do. You don't care who it is. You're afraid of Misato and the 1st child. You're afraid of your mother and father too, so now you come running to me! Because that's the easiest way to keep from getting hurt! You never even loved yourself, you are all you have and you never even learned to like yourself...Pa-thetic.*

Shinji - *Help me. Somebody please help me. Asuka help me. Somebody please help me. Somebody help me! Don't leave me alone. Don't abandon me! Please don't kill me!*

Edit - gotta add one more (favorite anime of all time...) - this exchange between Faye and Spike...I love how Faye's tough exterior melts away and she shows her true colors of caring:

Faye: Why do you have to go? Where are you going? What are going to do, just throw your life away like it was nothing? 

Spike: I'm not going there to die. I'm going to find out if I'm really alive. I have to do it, Faye.

From *Samurai Champloo*, Episode 12, 17 min 43 sec:
 
Student:

**People are born to be free.  That is just what I think. But isn't that contrary to the way of the samurai?**

Teacher:

**Freedom is not something that you earn through suffering or by pushing yourself hard.**

**Also, your social status or job doesn't matter.**

**You must accept yourself, the way you are, and live your life according to the flow of things.**

**That is true freedom.**
>> ARTICLE
Freedom, like anything priceless yet immaterial, is essentially intrinsic and not extrinsic then.

That fairly dovetails with another tradition that places primacy on inner jihad, getting one's own head, heart and house in order before taking this to outer jihad. Confucius had his own hierarchical primacy that was similar, with world betterment as **last** on the list.

However, because of our democratically empowering the hyperpolitical, a-philosophical modern idiot by the millions, this is all ass backward in our time. If u don't like our progress then u hate our freedums.

>You know why people have eyes in the front? Because they have to move forward to see the landscape in the distance.

That's what lets people move forward. - **Kamina (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan)**

God I never took so much inspiration from a quote quite like this.

Pretty sure Jormungand had a similar interaction between 2 characters.

"Using a simple method to accomplish something impressive far outshines using a complex method to achieve the same thing."

"A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead!  The king must be greedier than any other. He must laugh louder and rage harder. He must exemplify the extreme of all things, good and evil. That is why his retainers envy and adore him. And why the flames of aspiration, to be as the king is, can burn within his people."

Ninamori: "Youre Puss in Boots, the one who tricks the prince. He hides who he really is and pretends to be someone else forever. So in time he becomes that person, so his lie becomes the truth, see? He transcends the mask. Well, dont you get it? Thats how he finds happiness. Thats pretty good, right?"
>> ARTICLE
I love Ninamori's quote, especially in the show at how pumped she was getting as Naota was shying away from her like she was crazy, ha ha. I think my favorite isn't that good without the context of the episode, but Amarao's disbelieving "He swung the bat!" after Naota hits the satellite always got me. That entire episode is probably my favorite actually...
>> ARTICLE
Love the Naota quote, especially considering all of the crazy shit that's happening in his town every day...robots battling and destroying the place, etc...

If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow and begin devouring humans, and from the same mouth you started devouring humans, you cried out  to me: 'I love you.' Would I be still able to say: 'I love you too.' The same way I do today?

"HOW DARE THEY BREACH OUR DEFENSES USING TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO EXIST IN THEORY?!?!?" - Redline

Sadly all my favorite serious quotes are from Katawa Shoujo. One of those:

"Don't apologize for it. Please don't. Have I ever apologized for my blindness? You can't help the way you were born, Hisao. There's no point in apologizing for who you are. You are a beautiful person, Hisao. Please don't ever apologize for that."

"I had a purpose in life. That purpose had been beside me all along. I just never noticed. I was able to live on just from hearing 'thank you' from her. Her gratitude was enough to make me feel alive. I was happy.. I was such an idiot. She meant so much for me, but I didn't do anything for her. ... And now that I've lost her, has my life ended, too? My days had been filled with happiness that I didn't realize existed. Those days are gone." -Otonashi Yuzuru (Angel Beats, episode 7)

I guess this monologue sorta served as a wake-up call for me to take a look at my surroundings and to discover the small things in life that I can truly enjoy, before it ends up escaping me. May not have the same impact on others, but to me it was really meaningful.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly how I felt about my quote, the second I heard it it hit me like a ton of bricks. I tend to find myself getting down about situations that will never even happen. That and when Shinji was getting yelled at in Evangelion, those quotes hit home hardcore.

"Dont cry, demonWhat childish fear haunts you? Dont cry over it, demon. Didnt you become a demon so you wouldnt have to cry any more?

All menare NOT created equal! Some are born smarter, or more beautiful, or with parents of greater status. Some, by contrast, are born weak of body or mind, or with few, if any, talents. All men are different! Yes, the very existence of man is discriminatory! Thats why there is war, violence and unrest. Inequality is not evil. Equality is! What became of the EU, who claimed that all are equal? It is in constant conflict because its tenets go against human nature! The Middle Eastern Federation, which harbors similar sentiments, is constantly mired with sloths! But our Britannia is not like them! We put an end to wars and evolve with every conquest! Britannia alone looks forward and moves forward to a better future! The death of my son Clovis is yet more proof that our empire is evolving. Fight! For the future rests in the hands of its ruler!

The Shape of happiness might resemble glass.
Even though you don't usually notice it, it's still definitely there,

I doubt that anything could argue its existence more eloquently."

" I want to try and live my life carrying all my memories with me. And even if those memories are painful, even if they do nothing but hurt me, I want to keep them. Even those memories I sometimes wish I could forget.

First, we are born in the same galaxy. Born of the same species. Our lifetimes overlap. The meetings between humans are so unlikely as to be miraculous. To laugh, to cry, and to fall in love. Everyone is made up of a collection of 1% chances. Thus, I am dazzled by the fact that there are so many miracles in this world. - Arakawa Under the Bridge

Pretty much every time Ulquiorra said something from bleach. Here's my favorite from him, just brutal:

Your heart you say? You humans always toss around that word so casually, as if it is something you can hold in the palm of your hand. But my eyes can see everything. Nothing exists that I can't see, so if I cant see it, it's not real. That is what I believe. Tell me, what is a heart? If I tore a hole in your chest, would I see it? If I split open your skull, would it be there?

(Soul Eater) Dr. Franken Stein: "Let me ask you this; Where does this knowledge of yours come from? This ability to know right from wrong? - There is no inherent good and evil in the world those labels are just artificial constructs. - Right and Wrong are determined by the people who hold positions of authority, that's the way it's always been so how then can anyone know this truth you speak of? - Don't you see the reality is that truth long ago became nothing more than a shadow of itself, it's a mere echo of the past now. - "You're wrong!" - Idealistic boy! The world is one big moral 'grey area' it just makes you feel safer to believe that it can be carefully categorised into good and bad. That's not actually how it works! - "You're Wrong!!" - Why are you so determined about this, kid? - "Why are you still refusing to answer any of my questions!? What information are you so desperate to keep hidden? - Hmm..."

I have no choice but to accept this one cruel, meaningless life! That's why I will fight, and why I will continue fighting."

Revy: What would you say these things are?

Rock: A medal and a skull

Revy: That's where you're wrong, both of these are just things.  Once you strip away their meanings, then that's all they really are.  Just things, and nothing more.  And if you give these things any meaning again, they won't get any other value because they're someone's precious memory.  Their value will be determined by the one thing everyone agrees on.  Money.  The rest of it is just some sentimental bullshit.
